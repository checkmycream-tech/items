            <li>This was ordered to give as a gift, and the recipient was thrilled!</li>
            <li>Better than any refreshing stuffs!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll bet most people would like the electric shavers with the beard attachment better than this!!!</li>
            <li>This one had the absolute best reviews, and the price was great too!</li>
            <li>This is EASILY the best way to keep yourself nice and neat!</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ER411NC Nose and Ear Hair Groomer is a great, easy to use tool, at an incredibly affordable price.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d been looking for something and this unit got good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>AND YOU HAVE THE GOOD ONE.</li>
            <li>If you need to buy one, this is a good one.</li>
            <li>Be warned however- if you&#x27;ve never used a good one it will take getting used to.</li>
            <li>and its a really good product.</li>
            <li>So I did my research and figured the panasonic 411NC should be a good one.</li>
            <li>Well it wasn&#x27;t good.......</li>
            <li>Cuts fairly close to the skin - a good thing.</li>
            <li>I used to think this was a superior trimmer.</li>
            <li>But all in all, a good choice.</li>
            <li>nose hairs are yanked and that ain&#x27;t a feelin good.</li>
            <li>Probably others as good</li>
            <li>Good battery life &lt;br</li>
            <li>Good  thing</li>
            <li>It works good.</li>
            <li>This is a good tool if you have nose hairs to be removed.  </li>
            <li>And the reviews seemed good, so I bought one.</li>
            <li>The cover to the battery compartment seems to have a fairly good seal.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>This product however was just as good.</li>
            <li>Heard from my barber that this was a good unit.</li>
            <li>GOOD VALUE FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li>But I do have a Norelco electric shaver that has a beard trimmer attachment that does just as good a job as this without any pain or making me want to sneeze or</li>
            <li>I have not tried it on my ears, maybe it would be good for that, but I don&#x27;t need that.</li>
            <li>Battery life is good, and cleaning the trimmer head or replacing the battery are both a snap.</li>
            <li>A good choice for those who want to keep trimmed.</li>
            <li>The original was excellent except that it was not drop resistant.  </li>
            <li>This product does everything I wanted and does it easily and for a very good price.  </li>
            <li>The product does seem to work just fine - but the TICKLING!!  </li>
            <li>And I am VERY pleased with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, works better than advertised.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s real easy; you just push that switch on the side.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s very pleased with it and says it works well.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the construction quality of this unit.</li>
            <li>the price this is a great item, if it would have lasted more than 4-5 uses.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>best, right???  </li>
            <li>Safe and effective, yes it tickles, but it works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly picky and when you hear I&#x27;m satisfied, it&#x27;s got to be good.</li>
            <li>Does your ears wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>you know, when the hair stops growing on the top of my head, and instead, decides to grow in my ears!  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic Nose and Ear Hair Groomer # ER411 more than exceeded our expectations!  </li>
            <li>Works like magic!</li>
            <li>Much better than shaving, tweezing, plucking, depilatories, etc!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many of these types of trimmers, and this one works!</li>
            <li>greatest strength is the motor power, which will quickly take care of the most bristly of hairs.  </li>
            <li>I did so with a Wahl thinking that the makers of my (excellent) hairclippers would certainly know how to make a high-quality targus-whacker.</li>
            <li>The end result is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>worked amazingly well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Inexpensive, well designed, effective...</li>
            <li>(own experience.)</li>
            <li>Nice, balanced feel in my hand.  </li>
            <li>Plucking is effective but can hurt quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wet/dry feature is really nice.  </li>
            <li>It functions nicely.</li>
            <li>, know that i got one is the best and most useful thing ever, i use it all the time, i bought another for my dad and he loves it too.</li>
            <li>I received my trimmer yesterday and am very please to say that it is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>I have to wonder, did you all use this yourselves on your own nose?</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy and pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>It is true that it is water rinsable, which is great, but it hurts when you use it, not all the time</li>
            <li>They snag a bit when they&#x27;re new, but they are the best for nose hair...</li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
            <li>Buying from Amazon was very easy also.</li>
            <li>very easy to use.</li>
            <li>When I dropped it, the cap came of very easily and the head hit</li>
            <li>Breaks very easily.</li>
            <li>It trims neatly and painlessly and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>this trimmer IS the best nose hair trimmer I have used by far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has to be the most effective means of getting rid of your unwanted nose/ear hair</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best trimmer I have ever owned!</li>
            <li>We have found the most efficient, effective nose and ear hair trimmer on the market.  </li>
            <li>which is kind of satisfying.</li>
            <li>I tried this device for the first time today and it worked splendidly.</li>
            <li>I found that although this replacement is not as good as the original, a break-in period may prove to correct the problem of pulling.  </li>
            <li>It makes a good clean cut without any irritation and without pulling hairs out.  </li>
            <li>this one, I am pretty happy with the way it performs - just 2-3 mins</li>
            <li>It is quick and easy to use and does a great job trimming those unwanted hairs.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>You just love him to death, but he&#x27;s got twigs growing out of his nose, and more hair IN his ears than around them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Nope, too many nosebleeds.</li>
            <li>what more could you want?  </li>
            <li>Entertaining for my wife, yes,</li>
            <li>This product used to be excellent, except for short blade life.</li>
            <li>so that when you attempt to stand it up it has a bit more of a chance  against the laws of physics?</li>
            <li>It may be better to use a rechargeable AA battery.</li>
            <li>Okay, when the hair on his ears was longer than on his head, I knew it was time to do something...</li>
            <li>I bought 2 more for family members.</li>
            <li>it is awesome and only one battery</li>
            <li>I was worried after reading the reviews about it pulling hair, however I did not experience any pain, it is smooth and effective.  </li>
            <li>would have given it a better rating</li>
            <li>so....far.  :-)</li>
            <li>Have been using it since Christmas morning and love it.</li>
            <li>Sure, he will grimace when he opens it up, but he&#x27;ll be on his way from crusty-gross nose to Queer-Eye Approved nasty-hair-free guy in seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I could find one that cost $50 that I could be sure wouldn&#x27;t cut me or yank out those hairs</li>
            <li>wont take more than a minute or 2.</li>
            <li>I, like most men, have hair growing in my ears and nose that tend to be a pain to groom.  </li>
            <li>, I read alll the reviews and bought this one, well he says it works ok</li>
            <li>, this is a nose,ears trimmer,but he says it feels more like a type of torture device.</li>
            <li>so I better submit review</li>
            <li>Look for something better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I made it so many years without a nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It works okay until it stops working.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased I made the purchase, and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li>If more people knew about it, it could take off and be a staple for family use.  </li>
            <li>Believe me, we have tried many different makes and models, but this is the very best!  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think you will find better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been completely satisfied with this groomer.</li>
            <li>Overall, good battery life and great trimming makes this groomer a &amp;quot;must have&amp;quot;.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s pleased, and with that, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a recommended item.</li>
            <li>The end result is, however, the same for both; an excellent trim.  </li>
            <li>I like this one better</li>
            <li>It might be OK on ears, but I don&#x27;t need it for that.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t tell my wife I said so!  :)</li>
            <li>It works just as well and, best of all, it cost the same price!</li>
            <li>To be honest, it&#x27;s not the most comfortable experience I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>Worked better</li>
            <li>Still working ok, just wish the blades would stay sharper.</li>
            <li>will look for a better trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Maybe he or she will ponder it, come to terms with it, and thereby gain more of an insight as to</li>
            <li>Most men will reach the age when they look in the mirror one day and realize there is hair growing from their nose.  </li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s been a worthwhile investment</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase!&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li>Then I made the mistake of tapping the removable head on the counter top.</li>
            <li>more thing:  </li>
            <li>Well-designed tool that works so much better than \\&quot;safety\\&quot; manicure scissors.</li>
            <li>For those of us who have more hair growing in their nose than on their head</li>
            <li>I love this type of machine.  </li>
            <li>I ended up getting a manual ear and nose hair groomer that worked much better.</li>
            <li>Husband&#x27;s favorite groomer</li>
            <li>I looked at Amazon and saw the wonderful reviews for this trimmer and resorted it as my last bet.  </li>
            <li>, I keep it in a drawer, I&#x27;m sure if you drop it you&#x27;ll have problems, but isn&#x27;t it that way with everything now?  </li>
            <li>The tip can be safely rinsed out under the tap, but don&#x27;t dunk it in the shower.</li>
            <li>They work okay</li>
            <li>and I think it needs more rpms.  </li>
            <li>this trimmer worked okay, but didn&#x27;t trim all that well.</li>
            <li>And if someone gives this to you as a gift in front of a crowd of people, this person is not your friend, but even so, look in that mirror and if you need it, use it, do us all a favor and yourself most of all.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest shopping around a bit more if you are in the market for this type of device.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Having tried many different models and styles, I have found this to be the best.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure there are those who have had problems with it.</li>
            <li>The reviews seemed good, but I&#x27;ve found that the unit really hurts!  </li>
            <li>I bought an ER 411 years ago and it&#x27;s been a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>For almost twenty dollars (thirty dollars list, according to Amazon ...), I thought this might be a pretty good trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good nose hair clipper...</li>
            <li>I used the trimmer for about 6 months, it worked great in that it cut the hair down very nicely, but it had a couple of downsides.</li>
            <li>As with most Panasonic items, a  terrific product at a very fair price.</li>
            <li>Panasonic is also very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product about 2 years ago based on all the positive reviews, and I loved it.</li>
            <li>Like most of the other reviewers, I&#x27;m very happy with mine too.  </li>
            <li>I feel more clean now :)</li>
            <li>My husband has been using Panasonic ER411 for the last five years and it was a very good product.</li>
            <li>My Sasquatch-like nostrils were becoming unmanageable.&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li>but now i can breathe smooth and freely!</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job, with minimal discomfort and no pain.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d read another review from someone who suggested wetting the blades before trimming to make things more comfortable, and this does help a bit.  </li>
            <li>Changed batteries twice and it has a grinding noise coming from it that doesn&#x27;t sound safe.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m able to take care of my \\&quot;problem\\&quot; quickly and safely.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to use and  very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the best one I have ever had; smooth, quick, quiet, and most important \\&quot;No</li>
            <li>Of all nose/ear hair clippers I tried (including other Panasonics) this is the best.</li>
            <li>This worked great when new, but performance dropped off significantly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s quite easy to use, and it does its job.</li>
            <li>One improvement, besides a more powerful motor, is that the cap has vents that allow for air drying with the cap on, and the cap will also prevent the trimmer to inadvertently turn \\&quot;ON\\&quot; via an innovative locking mechanism.</li>
            <li>Easy to use product that delivers as promised.  </li>
            <li>Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower, it&#x27;s completely waterproof and very effective and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>I am the kind of guy who researches a lot before buying anything, and since I needed a trimmer for the first time, started reading up some reviews.</li>
            <li>Looks nice, is comfortable in the hand, battery life is good, never pinches and is relatively quiet.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine for a year.  </li>
            <li>(While it did work it worked fine).  </li>
            <li>The battery tested fine.  </li>
            <li>Still, it worked fine until this happened.</li>
            <li>but the size fits in just fine.  </li>
            <li>This one is pain free and washes up easily in the sink because it&#x27;s fully immersible.  </li>
            <li>does a fine job.  </li>
            <li>It did the job fine</li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold, easy to use, quiet and does a great job trimming those hairs</li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold, easy to use, quiet and does a great job trimming those hairs</li>
            <li>Best model I could find...but it could be a little more powerful.  </li>
            <li>Despite my guyish partiality to gadgets, I&#x27;d recommend a simple bikini waxing kit until the free market recognizes this great need.</li>
            <li>and it has a light on it.</li>
            <li>Simple to use and works great.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy hearing the thing cut those ear and nose</li>
            <li>hairs;sort of like the sound of a electric bug zapper.</li>
            <li>This kind of grooming item is not used very often.</li>
            <li>So you can feel free to go after those hairs with out worries.</li>
            <li>about $ 15 plus free shipping.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li>I had a similar product from Panasonic that had a lot of power and cut really great.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s actually fun, safe and semi-enjoyable (for the tickling effect)</li>
            <li>The price is so cheap that i guess this should be listed as a disposable groomer, hehe.</li>
            <li>And Man, this is cheap and does the job.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean afterwards as well.  </li>
            <li>I keep buying this item over and over because it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>The battery connection seems secure.</li>
            <li>So if you enjoy that excruciating pain of shredding the inside of your nose, please buy this device.</li>
            <li>In short:  this device works great, until... it stops working.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s case is comfortable to hold and it effortlessly and admirably performs the task it was designed for.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Never know how important this gadget was until i used it.</li>
            <li>This groomer is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It was best if you had someone help holding it cuz it was heavy.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t like those cheap trimmers that were made in Japan.</li>
            <li>It is very quiet and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>However, do not expect it to be a completely comfortable experience.  </li>
            <li>After four months of light use the motor stopped working.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not all that easy to clean, which doesn&#x27;t help things.  </li>
            <li>The most effective, most practical solution seemed to be to hand launch the unit on a ballistic course over the fence of my back yard.  </li>
            <li>Amazon painlessly and smoothly replaced it with a working model, but this has made me doubt its durability.</li>
            <li>Cheap cutters will pull the hair from the root.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ER411NC Nose and Ear Hair Groomer has continued to perform comfortably.</li>
            <li>AS IT IS EASY TO CLEAN.</li>
            <li>Really keeps things tidy.</li>
            <li>Just use it properly and it&#x27;ll give you great results.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping Panasonic would send a replacement blade for free, but they want $10 + $5 shipping for it.</li>
            <li>Mine quit working after about a year of light use.</li>
            <li>Nicely designed, and very functional.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on all of the fantastic reviews.</li>
            <li>all the cut hairs fall inside to a storage area making clean up easy.</li>
            <li>This gadget is great, it cuts close and does the job efficiently and quietly with no cuts or pain.  </li>
            <li>Ever experienced that very unique burst of sharp pain?   </li>
            <li>I read the reviews before buying one of these to replace an older Panasonic model that I liked.</li>
            <li>and it is quick and easy to do both my ears and nose.  </li>
            <li>and I had no discomfort and super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Trims very close, the way I like it, and is very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Oh well, it&#x27;s worth it to be neatly groomed!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband originally.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am pretty satisfied this product.</li>
            <li>This being the most expensive nose and ear hair groomer offered on most sites, I assumed it was the best!  </li>
            <li>The original never snagged and pulled</li>
            <li>That first review (&#x27;glorious&#x27;) with so many &#x27;helpful&#x27; checks seems way planted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for 2 months and am still using the original set of batteries.   </li>
            <li>and I was excited to have it, but it stopped working (meaning that it still ran but the blades did not cut any hairs) after about 3 uses.  </li>
            <li>The ergonomic, curved, hypo-allergenic stainless steel blade easily cuts nose and ear hair growth in seconds without pulling or pinching because of a safety cone that protects the skin.!</li>
            <li>smooth and quick clipping with no pulling or pain whatsoever.</li>
            <li>and I have a clean feeling in my nostrils and ears.</li>
            <li>And it dosn&#x27;t just trim you hair, it will compleatly clean out all the nostral hairs in you outer cavity.  </li>
            <li>A cinch to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Get one and enjoy the experience of no-hassle and quick way to groom your nose.</li>
            <li>This unit will clean up all your nose and ear hair problems.</li>
            <li>thing - use this device over a sink and clean your nose out with a damp tissue afterward to get all the hair.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re careful they&#x27;ll be quicker and much more pleasant for the nose and nearly as quick for the ear.  </li>
            <li>I decided to buy the groomer after I have read so many positive reviews about it on amazon.  </li>
            <li>Ok but it goes thru batteries pretty quick</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now slowly becoming one with nature, sort of in the manner of \\&quot;dust to dust\\&quot; (plastic to plastic?), seeking its own destiny with nature and the future....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, it does what it says, and it seems like a good value.</li>
            <li>sweet.</li>
            <li>This does a good job of cleaning out nose hairs, however it cuts the inside of my nose at the same time, leaving me with a blood crusted inside which takes weeks to heal!  </li>
            <li>Before I bash it more let me say it works fast and gloriously for the ear.  </li>
            <li>I read every review on every personal trimmer Amazon was offering and chose to purchase this item because of all the good reviews it received.  </li>
            <li>My trimmer initially seemed like it might be a good product</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>EASY, COMFORTABLE AND VERY EFFICIENT TO USE</li>
            <li>The first one, I dropped and broke it, but it had been going strong for over 2 years.</li>
            <li>All other features are great.</li>
            <li>Good little trimmer, what more needs to be said.</li>
            <li>When I first got the unit it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>This thing worked fine when I first got it.  </li>
            <li>Painless, bloodless, and quick.  </li>
            <li>It does what it advertises quickly and effortlessly with no pulling/pinching or any problems.</li>
            <li>Painless, bloodless, and quick.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a worthy trade-off, and the cheapest trimmers I&#x27;ve found that don&#x27;t yank the hairs from the root.</li>
            <li>The best defense against discomfort is to use it regularly enough to keep hairs short to begin with.   </li>
            <li>This gadget eats away Battery quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It cuts all the hair in my ears and nose quick and close without yanking them.</li>
            <li>It worked intermitently for awhile and then quick working altogether.</li>
            <li>read the review for this product on Amazon and wondered how so many customers could speak so highly of a nose hair trimmer..</li>
            <li>This truly is the MACH 3 of nose trimmers, worked great for those hard to reach hairs, worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>Well thats what happened with this nose groomer the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>We first tried the ER4211C, the one with the light.  </li>
            <li>I think it tries to get the hair it cuts, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as successful at that.</li>
            <li>But after using this item I am in COMPLETE agreement with the other reviewers, this is THE best trimmer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>My husband has been using a small pair of scissors for years to cut his nasal and ear hair and always worried that he would gouge a hole in his nose especially from a sharp move--after using the groomer one time, he is soooooooooooooo happy I bought it--he is very comfortable with it and sees nothing but a wonderful grooming experience with it!</li>
            <li>Quiet, comfortable, and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen hair in my ears and I have a full mustache that blends in right up to my nostrils..</li>
            <li>This trimmer is easy to use, discreet, and fast.</li>
            <li>This item works without pain, and is fast and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I bet this thing would cut a male gorilla&#x27;s nose hair pretty good if you could teach a gorilla how to turn it on.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced, easy to handle, plenty of power and by design, you can&#x27;t cut or slice yourself while trimming.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this trimmer for a X-Mas gift for my husband, he has an old trimmer he had used for years, so I thought a new good one for x-mas</li>
            <li>Good cutting, easy to hold, just overall excellent!</li>
            <li>What a great little tool for getting rid of unwanted hair, My ears were a problem and this did the job</li>
            <li>This little beauty does a great job on all my excess fur.  </li>
            <li>This little guy works great.  </li>
            <li>but this little device works great</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s spinning slowly, it pinches and doesn&#x27;t do a very good job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of gross to stick this up your nose, but it really does a fine job.  </li>
            <li>Not even worth returning - this is hitting the trash can.</li>
            <li>Twice the price of the comparable Remington but worth the difference.  </li>
            <li>so I thought it worth a try.</li>
            <li>well* worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I have tried scissors, tweezers, and my razor all with varying degrees of success, blood and pain.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is quiet and effective.</li>
            <li>Why the heck they think it&#x27;s worth $50 now is beyond me.</li>
            <li>Twice the price of the comparable Remington but worth the difference.  </li>
            <li>does the job and is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I will be trying another brand, as the discomfort level just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>This one by far superceeds all the others (some of which were way more costly).  </li>
            <li>Not a lot of fun.  </li>
            <li>Boy, this thing is powerful.</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>but I just want to warn prospective buyers that this is a distinct possibility.  </li>
            <li>Incredibly useful, i&#x27;ve seen articles like this in movies, but i&#x27;ve never bought one before</li>
            <li>I have tried several nose trimmers and this one is by far the most effective.</li>
            <li>It works equally well on nose and ear hair, and is also ideal for trimming the occasional whisker on the chin or lip that gets missed during shaving.</li>
            <li>This remarkable piece of equipment mows down everything in its path.  </li>
            <li>Although both models trim nose hair excellently, his model, Panasonic ER411, is more powerful than my previous model, trims faster, and finishes the job in less time.  </li>
            <li>I had hoped the Panasonic brand trimmer would live up to both the high esteem that I hold for Pansonic brand electronics and also the excellent ratings by other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>this device is great, although it&#x27;s not easy to use to remove hair on your ear.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, ouch.</li>
            <li>Her heart is in the right place.</li>
            <li>It cleared my nose right out</li>
            <li>This product has never worked right.  </li>
            <li>It rips it right out.</li>
            <li>Well, this can&#x27;t be right</li>
            <li>This worked great for the first few months that I had it.</li>
            <li>purchased this thing after reading the reviews and having general success with most panasonic products.</li>
            <li>A GREAT LITTLE RAZOR!</li>
            <li>A GREAT LITTLE RAZOR!</li>
            <li>Amazon.com shipping was flawless, the product professionally packages - overall a 5 star experience and something that will save me a ton of aggravation in future years.  </li>
            <li>This small shaver works really great for no stress grooming of both nose and ear hairs.  </li>
            <li>It remained sharp and worked pretty good until the end when it just wouldn&#x27;t start anymore.   </li>
            <li>It misses many nose and ear  hairs as they do not seem to be directed into the slots easily and takes much time since it misses so many and doesn&#x27;t cut them short enough (it is why there is no pinch).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product..easy to clean, safe, no concern with cutting your nose.  </li>
            <li>The drop wasn&#x27;t more than a couple of feet from the medicine cabinet into the sink (and WITH the cover on), but much to my surprise, the darn thing just stopped working completely.  </li>
            <li>a female who wants to look nice, I don&#x27;t want stray nose hairs taking someones attention away from the topic at hand.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and simple to clean.  </li>
            <li>This is really great trimmer for such money, highly recomended for everyone who uses frequently trimmers.</li>
            <li>I had read some discouraging reviews about this model being a torture device but was stuck with trying it, as it was a Panasonic similar to my fine working original.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It may cost a few more bucks than those &#x27;designer&#x27; groomers you see around, but in the long run you&#x27;ll be happy with a well-designed tool that does the job well.</li>
            <li>In fact, I liked the first one so much, I purchased a 2nd groomer to put in my travel bag.</li>
            <li>I had one of these previously that worked pretty good.  </li>
            <li>this trimmer works just as advertised at a very reasonable cost, so I whole-heartedly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This new model, ER411, is just as easy to take apart and clean, as the old model.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;It feels good when sometimes you award yourself with these little life helpers.</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;m amazed at how smooth and clean it is in there now.</li>
            <li>Not the best cutting blade either - tended to tug rather than cut cleanly.</li>
            <li>The first was at Target about 3 years ago - I dropped it in the sink and it could not be repaired.  </li>
            <li>and Amazon had the only reputable source.  </li>
            <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Panasonic has changed the blade design from an &#x27;L&#x27; shaped blade, which would trim hair entering from the top as well as the sides, to an &#x27;I&#x27; shaped blade, which only cuts hair entering from the sides.</li>
            <li>Thanks Panasonic!  </li>
            <li>Okay, so I buy this online because I&#x27;m too embarrassed to admit I have a massive hedge-like formation that has cropped up on the inside rim of my nostrils</li>
            <li>Spend more money on a unit that will last longer.</li>
            <li>I found this trimer to be exactly what it is advertised to be.</li>
            <li>I would try to buy an exact replacement as this one had never \\&quot;bitten\\&quot; me.  </li>
            <li>I doesn&#x27;t pull and gets in pretty close.  </li>
            <li>Now if I could just get the hair on the top of my head to grow back...</li>
            <li>Thanks Panasonic, you have a winner here!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband, and his first statement was that he didn&#x27;t know why anyone would say it hurts.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a replacement which was slightly better, but had the same problem.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time it left you bloody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had it more than a year and still using the same battery.</li>
            <li>The device did not outlast its first battery.</li>
            <li>(*sigh*) &lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that the parts don&#x27;t seem as well made as the one from 15 years ago, but I am back to a pain free experience.  </li>
            <li>On top, it&#x27;s quiet and washable.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the giggles!</li>
            <li>A lot better than plucking or shoving your regular razor up there</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also become much more likely to nick me.</li>
            <li>Pretty flimsy.  </li>
            <li>This is my first nose/ear groomer</li>
            <li>and I was a bit hesitant in using it first (after reading reviews that it hurts).</li>
            <li>The motor gets hot within 30-60 seconds of use, so take a break between nostrils.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;OK, the results are clean-looking, but I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the pain.</li>
            <li>Mine worked wonders at first.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those evolutionary challenged individuals whom nature forgot when it slowly eliminated fur from the great apes.</li>
            <li>Of the 3 nose hair trimmers, &#x27;personal grooming devices&#x27;, I&#x27;ve used this one caused the most pain.</li>
            <li>The design and build quality both seem first rate.  </li>
            <li>More of a tickler than a cutter it left a lot to be desired in results.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is great in that it has no trouble with mowing down any bush you might have in your nose.  </li>
            <li>Well, the Wahl was much inferior; it made a nice enough whirring sound, but it simply didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li>When brand new, it was quiet and fantastic, really did the job nicely as opposed to my old method of trying to use a fingernail clipper or jam the corner of a beard trimmer in my nose.</li>
            <li>You know you are getting old when you get excited about how well a Nose and Ear hair trimmer works...</li>
            <li>Sure, it will probably break if you drop it enough, but it really is well made.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think this thing is going to last more than two months tops, but it works for now.</li>
            <li>some tiny task turns into a huge chore because you don&#x27;t have the right tool?</li>
            <li>While this is a nice gesture, it means you have to really work harder to get some trimming done!</li>
            <li>I use the trimmer daily due to a family curse (lol).</li>
            <li>This trimmer pulled out some hair and kind of ground down the rest.  </li>
            <li>Many of the reviews here 2 years and older refer to an earlier verison of this model.     </li>
            <li>around only twenty dollars) as it looked the most similar to the original and with the inside of my nose</li>
            <li>I think I could have done better on some dates if I used this long ago!  </li>
            <li>the job simply and easily.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic will definitely trim your hair very quickly and efficiently.  </li>
            <li>There is a slight tugging sensation and it does kind of tickle.  </li>
            <li>It feels solidly built and is easy to grip.</li>
            <li>The head is easily removable for cleaning which makes a big difference in the trimmers effectivity.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer does a quick and complete job.  </li>
            <li>First one (different model) was very plasticy and cheap.  </li>
            <li>Simple, straight forward and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The amount of blood flow I experienced far out did any of my less than sober attempts using scissors.</li>
            <li>altho my bro&#x27;s same model works fine still, mine deteriorated and stopped working after about a year.</li>
            <li>It accomplishes the task safely and quickly and without the vibrations that a friend had reported made him sneeze when using similar device from a different manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I now feel quite secure in my general appearance, and any person curious enough to take a gander into my facial orifices will find me nicely groomed and most presentable.</li>
            <li>And it will certainly do so in a manner that appears much safer than using pointed scissors.  </li>
            <li>Pros: effective at trimming nose and ear hair with comparatively little \\&quot;tugging\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I would recommend this handy little tool to anyone who has troublesome nose hairs.  </li>
            <li>But overall, I give it five stars and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants CLEAN AND NEAT nostrils and ears!  </li>
            <li>I believe that they have probably found a cheaper method of manufacture that leaves the blade and shearing edge of the cone less refined than the original, but hopefully will wear-in to provide a snag free instrument.</li>
            <li>I have not been disappointed and feel that these reviews indicating an excellent product are right on the money!</li>
            <li>very  nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was ready to give up and resort to using my blunt, miniature scissors for the rest of my life.&lt;BR</li>
            <li>This thing really hurts.</li>
            <li>I suppose as it doesn&#x27;t cost much.   </li>
            <li>There is absolutely nothing on the package to let you know you are buying the redesigned product.</li>
            <li>THIS TYPE OF NOSE TRIMMER IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE.</li>
            <li>AND IT CUT MUCH CLOSER .</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>very often...</li>
            <li>Side A (the left) goes reasonably smoothly though there is this wierd aroma of frying hair as I pump the thing in and out of my nostril.</li>
            <li>but I cant stop screwing my face up because the hair that got pulled out tweaked something in my face and it just stings so much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Therefore, if you are not really need it, pls do not buy it just because it is interesting.</li>
            <li>The unit is reasonable well-made</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d wrap it up and give it to my worse enemy LOL.</li>
            <li>Light, compact, simple and works.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend, however!</li>
            <li>This one really works.</li>
            <li>(Changing batteries and cleaning it don&#x27;t help much.)  </li>
            <li>Well, I have some doubts here, if you guys have been immersing the whole thing into soap water and cleaning it.  </li>
            <li>It might very well be a combination of the two.  </li>
            <li>Even though it is made of plastic, it appears to be very durable plastic.  </li>
            <li>(Maybe these things require a gentle touch.)</li>
            <li>It worked very well for all these years.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe such a great product is being sold for such a low price.  </li>
            <li>Then one day my wife was watching \\&quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Really.     </li>
            <li>it really hurts.</li>
            <li>I really just can&#x27;t stand to use it at all ...</li>
            <li>But I got one and it does not cut me up or anything, just some hair pulls that don&#x27;t hurt much.  </li>
            <li>The cutters seem to be made of stainless steel.  </li>
            <li>All of that makes cleaning the unit very convenient.  </li>
            <li>I expected more from the brand.  </li>
            <li>This product is better than expected.</li>
            <li>So, for twenty bucks who wants to hassle with warranty or repair issues??  </li>
            <li>When this day comes, it is important to remember that, like weed wackers, not all nose hair trimmers are created equal.</li>
            <li>I replaced it with the Sharper Image version which cost twice as much.  </li>
            <li>Cuts all kinds of hair, including fuzzy hair, very close, without skin damage.</li>
            <li>My nostrils had so much hair in them that the hair ebbed and flowed with every breath like squid tentacles.  </li>
            <li>The ER411NC really penalizes you for letting things get out of hand.  </li>
            <li>He is very polite.</li>
            <li>I use it in my ears and it cuts the hairs very close to the skin without any tugging.</li>
            <li>The ER411 trimmed hair very close to the skin.</li>
            <li>If you mash it flush against the skin (which is a real blast), it might nick a hair or two.  </li>
            <li>Does the job very well.</li>
            <li>This pulls at the hairs as much as it cuts them.</li>
            <li>I dismantled the head and there was nothing much that need to be cleaned.</li>
            <li>As others pointed out it really does the job</li>
            <li>You really can rinse it under water without it breaking.  </li>
            <li>Highly reccomended!</li>
            <li>Plus the price is extremely reasonable.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to make it quit.  </li>
            <li>It really does get the nose hairs out.</li>
            <li>doesnt really hurt at all</li>
            <li>/&gt;The groomer worked very well</li>
            <li>In fairness, trimming nasal hairs will probably always be an awkward process.&lt;br /&gt;The device, like most Panasonic products, is made of good quality materials.  </li>
            <li>This is far, far better than the old one.  </li>
            <li>It is a good accompaniment if you are on the highway for a long long trip...  </li>
            <li>I much preferred my old Wahl brand trimmer, which did a good job, never hurt, has been durable and lasted years -- and Wahl costs less!  </li>
            <li>one I ordered did cut the nose hairs, but first gave them a good hard tug!</li>
            <li>It also gets really hot when in use, which makes it even less comfortable!</li>
            <li>By \\&quot;hurt\\&quot; I mean it doesn&#x27;t feel good, not \\&quot;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>And other models don&#x27;t have any better reviews, including the one that worked well for me before it died.</li>
            <li>The above is my original review.  </li>
            <li>It worked much better than either of the two other products that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>, I can wash it in water and it still functions on the original battery after several months.</li>
            <li>Other shavers I&#x27;ve used yank some of the hairs out and bring tears to my eyes because they are more like pluckers than like shavers.  </li>
            <li>and I use it for the original purpose: nose and ear, but also eyebrows, upper lip, chin, cheeks, etc.  </li>
            <li>takes just one battery, cuts clean and quiet, does not pull or pinch.</li>
            <li>You can actually wash the unit under running water to clean it.  </li>
            <li>Its blades were configured to hit the hairs at a more right angle, cutting cleanly and quickly.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, there&#x27;s a minor tug or two during operation as some have noted, but the inside of my nose is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>It seemed odd it was not in original packageing but has every appearance of being new and, in fact, runs even better than the last one that seemed to go through batteries much faster...  </li>
            <li>Like most things Panasonic, this thing broke down after about a year.  </li>
            <li>Many mornings I still come away with involuntary tears streaming down my face afterward - ah, the price of vanity.   </li>
            <li>I am purchasing another as it is so good, but Panny would do well to make it cut a little easier and absorb the inevitable drop.</li>
            <li>but this is really much better and cost much less.</li>
            <li>If you want zero pain, somebody needs to design a microprecision tool for this and would cost you nothing less than a grand.</li>
            <li>The noise level is minimal and comes apart easily for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve yet to see anything on the market for my particular affliction:</li>
            <li>The older units (with a split head) worked well.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, when you get older, you get hairier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m unfortunately getting to the stage where hair starts growing in more and more places that I don&#x27;t want it to.  </li>
            <li>I have nose nair in the classic levantine tradition and over the years I had to make do with scissors and tweezers to groom myself.  </li>
            <li>Uses 1 AA battery and has a decent battery life.</li>
            <li>It is a decent ear and nose trimmer.  </li>
            <li>And I figured the $15 price tag was worth it if only to satisfy my curiousity about how these things actually operate, or at least be good for a laugh or two from my wife or kids.     </li>
            <li>After using an older Wahl for years, I had a lengthy adjustment period.  </li>
            <li>, I said, so I exchanged my first torture device, and the replacement does exactly the same thing!!!</li>
            <li>As men get older they get weirder looking, and one of the things that makes them look weirder and ickier is targus, that annnoying hair that crops up in their nostrils and ears.</li>
            <li>works great, can use it blind folded if you really wanted to not having to worry about exposed blades.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended but...</li>
            <li>Highly reccomended.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews of these things that I could find and this one ranked high in the majority of reviews.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this panasonic ear and hair groomer.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>For the price I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ER411NC groomer will give you a very clean trim in a short amount of time, but at the occasional cost of comfort.   </li>
            <li>You need to clean up your nose after a trim(the cut hair tends to stick inside) but thats a minor irritant.</li>
            <li>I have since switched to the Grommmate stainless steel and manual trimmer, which is cheaper and just as effective, albeit slower; it is also less likely to break.    </li>
            <li>We must have extremely sensitive schnozzes in Ohio!!  </li>
            <li>I would like to see Panasonic maybe insulate it a little better.  </li>
            <li>Well, this little guy Does pull on your nose and ear hairs, and if that doesn&#x27;t bother you you&#x27;re a better man than I GD.</li>
            <li>I thought the reviews I read here were a little over the top,</li>
            <li>It works well but as soon as you take it apart to clean it is nearly impossable to get it back together and working as well as it was out of the box.</li>
            <li>It really takes the sting out of a sensitive job.  </li>
            <li>I really wish companys would stop outsourcing production to China which clearly has zero quality control.</li>
            <li>I opted to splurge and get a \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot; nose hair trimmer from Sharper Image, and am quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is powerful, quiet and versatile.</li>
            <li>After about 6 months of normal usage, it just stopped working.  </li>
            <li>I will be VERY GENTLE with the new one as Panasonic apparently uses el cheapo plastic in their product (or whoever makes it under their brand name).</li>
            <li>The unit isn&#x27;t getting hot, so it&#x27;s certainly the result of an occasional sensitive hair being yanked.</li>
            <li>At first this worked great, but after a few months the RPMs went way down, and I don&#x27;t know how to make it run properly anymore.  </li>
            <li>Take VERY good care of it as it is obviously fragile and the length of life is questionable even if you do take care of it.</li>
            <li>I new</li>
            <li>This is all after testing with new batteries.</li>
            <li>This new version is quieter.</li>
            <li>I took the trimmer out and pop a new battery in and it didn&#x27;t even start.</li>
            <li>i assumed this new one would be the same--WRONG  </li>
            <li>In phone calls to Panasonic I have been told that the new design is in effect now.</li>
            <li>I just fired up my new trimmer today.  </li>
            <li>And yes, I did try new battereies.</li>
            <li>So I tossed it and bought a new Panasonic ER411NC Nose and Ear Hair Groomer.</li>
            <li>I tried new battries and it still wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>After many failed attempts, I was convinced that there wasn&#x27;t a tool available that could handle my rigorous grooming demands.  </li>
            <li>I obviously don&#x27;t have much to compare with but this unit did everything I&#x27;d hoped it would (and could reasonably expect from it).&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>It comes with the fact that all the hair is growing in the wrong places after disappearing from where we though were the most important.</li>
            <li>The newer model does not work nearly as well as the older model.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to not see others talk about this in their reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Alas</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and am surprised they aren&#x27;t doing mass advertising for it.  </li>
            <li>It still works but is very, very loud.  </li>
            <li>One of the first things I noticed with the new ER411 was that I got an occasional sting from it.  </li>
            <li>It actually does exactly what it is supposed to do, and</li>
            <li>However, from the first time I tried it it hurt and tickled at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Exact same experience.  </li>
            <li>I would be willing to pay extra for that feature.  </li>
            <li>One tip I would offer, after trimming your nose hairs thoroughly, blow your nose well to do what your barber does with the old neck brush!</li>
            <li>This groomer performs way better than others I have had in the past.  </li>
            <li>It seemed as if all it did was whirr prettily without doing the concommitant and necessary clipping.</li>
            <li>It works first time, every time, and I have only changed the AA battery</li>
            <li>and when you get down to it I suppose it&#x27;s pretty much a disposable item since the price isn&#x27;t much.  </li>
            <li>Unless you learn to clean properly this product will not last.</li>
            <li>I have try the other sub $$ products I got at the retail store and they just couldn&#x27;t do a &#x27;clean&#x27; job.   </li>
            <li>, I took my chance with this one - there are some negative reviews and some strong positive reviews.</li>
            <li>When that happens I&#x27;ll buy a new one just like the old one.</li>
            <li>Although my old model works very well, I ordered this model over 1 year ago to have a spare in my hygiene kit, as I am often on the go with very little advanced notice.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t review this against any other pure nose hair trimmer, this is the first one that I have used.</li>
            <li>I have tried first other brands, much expensief</li>
            <li>Basically I read all the good reviews and thought maybe I just got a defective one, so I was dumb enough to get it again.  </li>
            <li>It works and certainly has made an improvement in his personal appearance!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It tickles a little but does a fantastic job</li>
            <li>Hard to imagine this product any better.    </li>
            <li>works great cutting hair around the ears and nose.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic got such great reviews, how could I go wrong?</li>
            <li>old Panasonic didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice so far</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if they just had sensitive nostrils</li>
            <li>He is 85 years old</li>
            <li>Then it would frequently stop spinning.  </li>
            <li>The decision to purchase this product was based on the old theory, \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The one drawback is how loud it is.  </li>
            <li>and then it just gave up the ghost, and stopped working completely.  </li>
            <li>I purchaed this trimmer to replace the old one that I dropped on it&#x27;s tip.</li>
            <li>I have nipped my ears a number of times when trying to cut wild hairs with scissors.  </li>
            <li>I even cried wow.</li>
            <li>His old one is still in use</li>
            <li>The old one is a Remington nedh-2500</li>
            <li>Wow I just noticed there are 259 reviews for a $14 nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Wet/Dry and waterproof, completely portable, there is nothing not to like.  </li>
            <li>wish i had not bght, as ends up doubling price by battery cost so far.</li>
            <li>I have tried a number of others over the years and this is the only one that works really well.</li>
            <li>I used this trimmer once and stuck it too far inside my nose.</li>
            <li>I had another trimmer that just got old.  </li>
            <li>The old design was referred to as a curved blade design.</li>
            <li>This seems to minimize the occasional tugs that really cause the pain.   </li>
            <li>and it does the job, although it isn&#x27;t recommended for those with sensitive skin or a touchy tear reflex.</li>
            <li>It is considerably faster in the nose mowing area, and I never did dare to explore my otic growth with any object sharper than a Q-tip.</li>
            <li>my old one is still working, so I got another for my car...</li>
            <li>If you see a stubborn piece of hair that the trimmer is trimming but not removing, gently guide the trimmer the OPPOSITE direction over the hair</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t have had to buy this one if my wife hadn&#x27;t dropped the old one.</li>
            <li>It grooms wells and precisely so far.</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>As luck would have it, my wife got this for my birthday after several bouts of sneezing during our intimate moments.</li>
            <li>It was like welcoming an old friend into the house.</li>
            <li>My old ER112 has never grabbed any skin and is the tool of choice for getting in the darker recesses of this bird&#x27;s beak.</li>
            <li>This trimmer does not trim close like the old trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It will even clip a wild eyebrow hair.  </li>
            <li>But they only work a few months at most.  </li>
            <li>I got so tired of getting nicked and cut with my old one (and it still didn&#x27;t do the job effectively) that I thought I would try this one.</li>
            <li>It worked fairly well for several months, but then went into a slow decline in which it occasionally yanked hairs instead of trimming.  </li>
            <li>Most of the other similar products on the market start pulling the hair after a short time.</li>
            <li>The blade is well positioned and protected enough that, excuse my French, you pretty much can just stick it in your ear or nose, twirl a bit, and presto!  </li>
            <li>With an ergonomically designed stainless-steel blade that retains its sharpness, the Panasonic Nose and Ear Hair Groomer is the first and last personal groomer you will ever need.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR</li>
            <li>The only other concern, as with the original, is that of dropping it on it&#x27;s tip.</li>
            <li>While my age shall remain unknown to you, I have looked for a long time for a comfortable way to trim those pesky nose hairs.  </li>
            <li>think the reason for the mixed reviews is a good number of these units come right from the factory with poor cutting blades, hence some love it and</li>
            <li>It takes a special tool to handle the heavy work and this is it.  </li>
            <li>I admit to a bit of \\&quot;yikes\\&quot; now and then, but I Did discover that if you move the mower Slowly whilst hewing the internal forests it greatly reduces these little surprises.</li>
            <li>I once bought the Panasonic Dry trimmer by accident, and did not like it near as much.</li>
            <li>Makes trimming those hard to reach areas easy.  </li>
            <li>This new version is identical except that they&#x27;ve added a plastic thingy in the middle, to prevent hairs from catching/pulling.</li>
            <li>Well, I tried several new batteries in the trimmer, but it still nicked and cut when I tried it.</li>
            <li>New batteries notwithstanding, one day it simply wouldn&#x27;t work any longer.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully the relic will be found one day by some future being, perhaps a member of a new civilization.  </li>
            <li>This fell on the floor as I was taking it out of the box, fell totally apart, and despite all sorts of effort on my part to put it back together, it doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>The slight discomfort felt by a pulled out hair or two is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>This gadget never had much power, pulled at my admittedly jungle-like nose hairs painfully, and quit for good after a year.  </li>
            <li>What used to be an efficient, quick trimmer has now become a waste of both time and money.  </li>
            <li>Thought it would be limited compared to much talked about Sharper Image one, which I have tried.</li>
            <li>And with no sharp edges exposed</li>
            <li>This gadget does a much better job than scissors or other little shavers.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic is now using a less powerful motor and apparently changed the blade design as well.</li>
            <li>For $17 I&#x27;m not going to spend a lot of time trying to get it fixed or replaced, but I did see other reviews that talked of fast failures.  </li>
            <li>but this is certainly within the realm of what I expected.  </li>
            <li>the other side, frankly speaking, this device works well, if you really need it and your long nose hair really annoys you.</li>
            <li>I have been using older model, basically the same as the one I ordered for the last 5 years.  </li>
            <li>This would also make a nice little stocking stuffing for the holidays, something small but thoughtful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked great (although it could be painful), the TWO times I used it.  </li>
            <li>The one AA battery usually doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me to complete my grooming ritual, but the 90-minute battery life should be more than sufficient for the rest of you.  </li>
            <li>The light was also pretty useless.  </li>
            <li>My old scisors were sharper and I had to be more careful with them, but at least they don&#x27;t pull my nose hair.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to go into a store and let some 16 year old babe in low rise jeans see me buy it.</li>
            <li>and I would&#x27;nt be surprised if they put low quality parts into manufacturing this.</li>
            <li>and I barely used it too.</li>
            <li>It was big and had handgrips for each hand, an old plug- in- the-</li>
            <li>Apparently, they&#x27;re all duds.  </li>
            <li>and if you&#x27;re having a bit more of a difficult time breathing than normal, try this product out..</li>
            <li>If you use a tired, half-drained one, the blades grind slower and the result is more like the Epilady thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a good job of cutting hair though.</li>
            <li>Good cutting speed</li>
            <li>Good cutting capability &lt;</li>
            <li>and there is a good chance of disappointment.</li>
            <li>kind of powerless.</li>
            <li>And this little gizmo is the right tool.&lt;br /&gt;Order</li>
            <li>It still gets the job done, it just takes a few \\&quot;going overs\\&quot; to get it right.</li>
            <li>Tugs slightly on nose hairs at first use.  </li>
            <li>First one broke in less than a year.</li>
            <li>But really it&#x27;s a small price to pay to get the job done so quickly and easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a certain amount of pulling, it&#x27;s not all that sharp, but the unit does in fact clean out the hair in your nostrils and takes, oh, three or four months off your age at least.</li>
            <li>Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found it to be very well made.  </li>
            <li>I saw him go at his ears and nose with an itty bitty pair of sharp scissors, so he tried this and really loves it.</li>
            <li>When brand new this thing worked like gangbusters, however the razor sharp blades dulled quickly leaving me crying like a baby.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This little gem weed-whacks those hairs pretty well.</li>
            <li>Broke after the first few days.</li>
            <li>My first fell off a shelf and the 4 foot drop killed it.  </li>
            <li>There hasn&#x27;t been too much blood shed, but the whole process is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll take the little zing it caused on first use; my guess is that in the future it won&#x27;t be anything like the clear-cut</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only reason this trimmer gets four stars instead of five: the first one that I bought was dead on arrival.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, men of a certain age start to find the need for regular mowing of bits of our faces that previously needed none.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the device&#x27;s little blade is too far down the safety nozzle for it to do anything useful for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that much hair and only use it for like half a minute a day, but it&#x27;s stopped turning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe, but if you can picture the top of your little finger -- that&#x27;s the size of this rotary electric razor that spins in a circle.  </li>
            <li>Also, while I did notice that it pulled out a few hairs here and there, causing some slight discomfort, overall it worked MUCH better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews, I was a little worried about this product, but it works very well.  </li>
            <li>This little devil really does work well.</li>
            <li>I only used it about ten times, and the next time I turned it on, it was louder than normal due to rattling like something broke or got off-center, I don&#x27;t know.</li>

            <li> Better than any refreshing stuffs!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll bet most people would like the electric shavers with the beard attachment better than this!!!</li>
            <li> This one had the absolute best reviews, and the price was great too!</li>
            <li> This is EASILY the best way to keep yourself nice and neat!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER411NC Nose and Ear Hair Groomer is a great, easy to use tool, at an incredibly affordable price.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d been looking for something and this unit got good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> AND YOU HAVE THE GOOD ONE.</li>
            <li> If you need to buy one, this is a good one.</li>
            <li> Be warned however- if you&#x27;ve never used a good one it will take getting used to.</li>
            <li> and its a really good product.</li>
            <li> So I did my research and figured the panasonic 411NC should be a good one.</li>
            <li> Well it wasn&#x27;t good.......</li>
            <li> Cuts fairly close to the skin - a good thing.</li>
            <li> I used to think this was a superior trimmer.</li>
            <li> But all in all, a good choice.</li>
            <li> nose hairs are yanked and that ain&#x27;t a feelin good.</li>
            <li> Probably others as good</li>
            <li> Good battery life &lt;br</li>
            <li> Good  thing</li>
            <li> It works good.</li>
            <li> This is a good tool if you have nose hairs to be removed.  </li>
            <li> And the reviews seemed good, so I bought one.</li>
            <li> The cover to the battery compartment seems to have a fairly good seal.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> This product however was just as good.</li>
            <li> Heard from my barber that this was a good unit.</li>
            <li> GOOD VALUE FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> But I do have a Norelco electric shaver that has a beard trimmer attachment that does just as good a job as this without any pain or making me want to sneeze or</li>
            <li> I have not tried it on my ears, maybe it would be good for that, but I don&#x27;t need that.</li>
            <li> Battery life is good, and cleaning the trimmer head or replacing the battery are both a snap.</li>
            <li> A good choice for those who want to keep trimmed.</li>
            <li> The original was excellent except that it was not drop resistant.  </li>
            <li> This product does everything I wanted and does it easily and for a very good price.  </li>
            <li> The product does seem to work just fine - but the TICKLING!!  </li>
            <li> And I am VERY pleased with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product, works better than advertised.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s real easy; you just push that switch on the side.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s very pleased with it and says it works well.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the construction quality of this unit.</li>
            <li> the price this is a great item, if it would have lasted more than 4-5 uses.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> best, right???  </li>
            <li> Safe and effective, yes it tickles, but it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly picky and when you hear I&#x27;m satisfied, it&#x27;s got to be good.</li>
            <li> Does your ears wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li> i love it!</li>
            <li> you know, when the hair stops growing on the top of my head, and instead, decides to grow in my ears!  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic Nose and Ear Hair Groomer # ER411 more than exceeded our expectations!  </li>
            <li> Works like magic!</li>
            <li> Much better than shaving, tweezing, plucking, depilatories, etc!  </li>
            <li> I have tried many of these types of trimmers, and this one works!</li>
            <li> greatest strength is the motor power, which will quickly take care of the most bristly of hairs.  </li>
            <li> I did so with a Wahl thinking that the makers of my (excellent) hairclippers would certainly know how to make a high-quality targus-whacker.</li>
            <li> The end result is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> worked amazingly well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Inexpensive, well designed, effective...</li>
            <li> (own experience.)</li>
            <li> Nice, balanced feel in my hand.  </li>
            <li> Plucking is effective but can hurt quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wet/dry feature is really nice.  </li>
            <li> It functions nicely.</li>
            <li> , know that i got one is the best and most useful thing ever, i use it all the time, i bought another for my dad and he loves it too.</li>
            <li> I received my trimmer yesterday and am very please to say that it is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> I have to wonder, did you all use this yourselves on your own nose?</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy and pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> It is true that it is water rinsable, which is great, but it hurts when you use it, not all the time</li>
            <li> They snag a bit when they&#x27;re new, but they are the best for nose hair...</li>
            <li> He says it&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
            <li> Buying from Amazon was very easy also.</li>
            <li> very easy to use.</li>
            <li> When I dropped it, the cap came of very easily and the head hit</li>
            <li> Breaks very easily.</li>
            <li> It trims neatly and painlessly and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> this trimmer IS the best nose hair trimmer I have used by far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has to be the most effective means of getting rid of your unwanted nose/ear hair</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best trimmer I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> We have found the most efficient, effective nose and ear hair trimmer on the market.  </li>
            <li> which is kind of satisfying.</li>
            <li> I tried this device for the first time today and it worked splendidly.</li>
            <li> I found that although this replacement is not as good as the original, a break-in period may prove to correct the problem of pulling.  </li>
            <li> It makes a good clean cut without any irritation and without pulling hairs out.  </li>
            <li> this one, I am pretty happy with the way it performs - just 2-3 mins</li>
            <li> It is quick and easy to use and does a great job trimming those unwanted hairs.  </li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> You just love him to death, but he&#x27;s got twigs growing out of his nose, and more hair IN his ears than around them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Nope, too many nosebleeds.</li>
            <li> what more could you want?  </li>
            <li> Entertaining for my wife, yes,</li>
            <li> This product used to be excellent, except for short blade life.</li>
            <li> so that when you attempt to stand it up it has a bit more of a chance  against the laws of physics?</li>
            <li> It may be better to use a rechargeable AA battery.</li>
            <li> Okay, when the hair on his ears was longer than on his head, I knew it was time to do something...</li>
            <li> I bought 2 more for family members.</li>
            <li> it is awesome and only one battery</li>
            <li> I was worried after reading the reviews about it pulling hair, however I did not experience any pain, it is smooth and effective.  </li>
            <li> would have given it a better rating</li>
            <li> so....far.  :-)</li>
            <li> Have been using it since Christmas morning and love it.</li>
            <li> Sure, he will grimace when he opens it up, but he&#x27;ll be on his way from crusty-gross nose to Queer-Eye Approved nasty-hair-free guy in seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I could find one that cost $50 that I could be sure wouldn&#x27;t cut me or yank out those hairs</li>
            <li> wont take more than a minute or 2.</li>
            <li> I, like most men, have hair growing in my ears and nose that tend to be a pain to groom.  </li>
            <li> , I read alll the reviews and bought this one, well he says it works ok</li>
            <li> , this is a nose,ears trimmer,but he says it feels more like a type of torture device.</li>
            <li> so I better submit review</li>
            <li> Look for something better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I made it so many years without a nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It works okay until it stops working.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased I made the purchase, and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> If more people knew about it, it could take off and be a staple for family use.  </li>
            <li> Believe me, we have tried many different makes and models, but this is the very best!  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think you will find better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been completely satisfied with this groomer.</li>
            <li> Overall, good battery life and great trimming makes this groomer a &amp;quot;must have&amp;quot;.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s pleased, and with that, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a recommended item.</li>
            <li> The end result is, however, the same for both; an excellent trim.  </li>
            <li> I like this one better</li>
            <li> It might be OK on ears, but I don&#x27;t need it for that.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t tell my wife I said so!  :)</li>
            <li> It works just as well and, best of all, it cost the same price!</li>
            <li> To be honest, it&#x27;s not the most comfortable experience I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> Worked better</li>
            <li> Still working ok, just wish the blades would stay sharper.</li>
            <li> will look for a better trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Maybe he or she will ponder it, come to terms with it, and thereby gain more of an insight as to</li>
            <li> Most men will reach the age when they look in the mirror one day and realize there is hair growing from their nose.  </li>
            <li> in all, it&#x27;s been a worthwhile investment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase!&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li> Then I made the mistake of tapping the removable head on the counter top.</li>
            <li> more thing:  </li>
            <li> Well-designed tool that works so much better than \\&quot;safety\\&quot; manicure scissors.</li>
            <li> For those of us who have more hair growing in their nose than on their head</li>
            <li> I love this type of machine.  </li>
            <li> I ended up getting a manual ear and nose hair groomer that worked much better.</li>
            <li> Husband&#x27;s favorite groomer</li>
            <li> I looked at Amazon and saw the wonderful reviews for this trimmer and resorted it as my last bet.  </li>
            <li> , I keep it in a drawer, I&#x27;m sure if you drop it you&#x27;ll have problems, but isn&#x27;t it that way with everything now?  </li>
            <li> The tip can be safely rinsed out under the tap, but don&#x27;t dunk it in the shower.</li>
            <li> They work okay</li>
            <li> and I think it needs more rpms.  </li>
            <li> this trimmer worked okay, but didn&#x27;t trim all that well.</li>
            <li> And if someone gives this to you as a gift in front of a crowd of people, this person is not your friend, but even so, look in that mirror and if you need it, use it, do us all a favor and yourself most of all.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest shopping around a bit more if you are in the market for this type of device.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Having tried many different models and styles, I have found this to be the best.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure there are those who have had problems with it.</li>
            <li> The reviews seemed good, but I&#x27;ve found that the unit really hurts!  </li>
            <li> I bought an ER 411 years ago and it&#x27;s been a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> For almost twenty dollars (thirty dollars list, according to Amazon ...), I thought this might be a pretty good trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good nose hair clipper...</li>
            <li> I used the trimmer for about 6 months, it worked great in that it cut the hair down very nicely, but it had a couple of downsides.</li>
            <li> As with most Panasonic items, a  terrific product at a very fair price.</li>
            <li> Panasonic is also very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product about 2 years ago based on all the positive reviews, and I loved it.</li>
            <li> Like most of the other reviewers, I&#x27;m very happy with mine too.  </li>
            <li> I feel more clean now :)</li>
            <li> My husband has been using Panasonic ER411 for the last five years and it was a very good product.</li>
            <li> My Sasquatch-like nostrils were becoming unmanageable.&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li> but now i can breathe smooth and freely!</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job, with minimal discomfort and no pain.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d read another review from someone who suggested wetting the blades before trimming to make things more comfortable, and this does help a bit.  </li>
            <li> Changed batteries twice and it has a grinding noise coming from it that doesn&#x27;t sound safe.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m able to take care of my \\&quot;problem\\&quot; quickly and safely.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to use and  very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the best one I have ever had; smooth, quick, quiet, and most important \\&quot;No</li>
            <li> Of all nose/ear hair clippers I tried (including other Panasonics) this is the best.</li>
            <li> This worked great when new, but performance dropped off significantly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s quite easy to use, and it does its job.</li>
            <li> One improvement, besides a more powerful motor, is that the cap has vents that allow for air drying with the cap on, and the cap will also prevent the trimmer to inadvertently turn \\&quot;ON\\&quot; via an innovative locking mechanism.</li>
            <li> Easy to use product that delivers as promised.  </li>
            <li> Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower, it&#x27;s completely waterproof and very effective and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I am the kind of guy who researches a lot before buying anything, and since I needed a trimmer for the first time, started reading up some reviews.</li>
            <li> Looks nice, is comfortable in the hand, battery life is good, never pinches and is relatively quiet.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine for a year.  </li>
            <li> (While it did work it worked fine).  </li>
            <li> The battery tested fine.  </li>
            <li> Still, it worked fine until this happened.</li>
            <li> but the size fits in just fine.  </li>
            <li> This one is pain free and washes up easily in the sink because it&#x27;s fully immersible.  </li>
            <li> does a fine job.  </li>
            <li> It did the job fine</li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold, easy to use, quiet and does a great job trimming those hairs</li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold, easy to use, quiet and does a great job trimming those hairs</li>
            <li> Best model I could find...but it could be a little more powerful.  </li>
            <li> Despite my guyish partiality to gadgets, I&#x27;d recommend a simple bikini waxing kit until the free market recognizes this great need.</li>
            <li> and it has a light on it.</li>
            <li> Simple to use and works great.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy hearing the thing cut those ear and nose</li>
            <li> hairs;sort of like the sound of a electric bug zapper.</li>
            <li> This kind of grooming item is not used very often.</li>
            <li> So you can feel free to go after those hairs with out worries.</li>
            <li> about $ 15 plus free shipping.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> I had a similar product from Panasonic that had a lot of power and cut really great.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s actually fun, safe and semi-enjoyable (for the tickling effect)</li>
            <li> The price is so cheap that i guess this should be listed as a disposable groomer, hehe.</li>
            <li> And Man, this is cheap and does the job.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean afterwards as well.  </li>
            <li> I keep buying this item over and over because it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> The battery connection seems secure.</li>
            <li> So if you enjoy that excruciating pain of shredding the inside of your nose, please buy this device.</li>
            <li> In short:  this device works great, until... it stops working.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s case is comfortable to hold and it effortlessly and admirably performs the task it was designed for.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Never know how important this gadget was until i used it.</li>
            <li> This groomer is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It was best if you had someone help holding it cuz it was heavy.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t like those cheap trimmers that were made in Japan.</li>
            <li> It is very quiet and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> However, do not expect it to be a completely comfortable experience.  </li>
            <li> After four months of light use the motor stopped working.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not all that easy to clean, which doesn&#x27;t help things.  </li>
            <li> The most effective, most practical solution seemed to be to hand launch the unit on a ballistic course over the fence of my back yard.  </li>
            <li> Amazon painlessly and smoothly replaced it with a working model, but this has made me doubt its durability.</li>
            <li> Cheap cutters will pull the hair from the root.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER411NC Nose and Ear Hair Groomer has continued to perform comfortably.</li>
            <li> AS IT IS EASY TO CLEAN.</li>
            <li> Really keeps things tidy.</li>
            <li> Just use it properly and it&#x27;ll give you great results.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping Panasonic would send a replacement blade for free, but they want $10 + $5 shipping for it.</li>
            <li> Mine quit working after about a year of light use.</li>
            <li> Nicely designed, and very functional.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on all of the fantastic reviews.</li>
            <li> all the cut hairs fall inside to a storage area making clean up easy.</li>
            <li> This gadget is great, it cuts close and does the job efficiently and quietly with no cuts or pain.  </li>
            <li> Ever experienced that very unique burst of sharp pain?   </li>
            <li> I read the reviews before buying one of these to replace an older Panasonic model that I liked.</li>
            <li> and it is quick and easy to do both my ears and nose.  </li>
            <li> and I had no discomfort and super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Trims very close, the way I like it, and is very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Oh well, it&#x27;s worth it to be neatly groomed!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband originally.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am pretty satisfied this product.</li>
            <li> This being the most expensive nose and ear hair groomer offered on most sites, I assumed it was the best!  </li>
            <li> The original never snagged and pulled</li>
            <li> That first review (&#x27;glorious&#x27;) with so many &#x27;helpful&#x27; checks seems way planted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 2 months and am still using the original set of batteries.   </li>
            <li> and I was excited to have it, but it stopped working (meaning that it still ran but the blades did not cut any hairs) after about 3 uses.  </li>
            <li> The ergonomic, curved, hypo-allergenic stainless steel blade easily cuts nose and ear hair growth in seconds without pulling or pinching because of a safety cone that protects the skin.!</li>
            <li> smooth and quick clipping with no pulling or pain whatsoever.</li>
            <li> and I have a clean feeling in my nostrils and ears.</li>
            <li> And it dosn&#x27;t just trim you hair, it will compleatly clean out all the nostral hairs in you outer cavity.  </li>
            <li> A cinch to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Get one and enjoy the experience of no-hassle and quick way to groom your nose.</li>
            <li> This unit will clean up all your nose and ear hair problems.</li>
            <li> thing - use this device over a sink and clean your nose out with a damp tissue afterward to get all the hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re careful they&#x27;ll be quicker and much more pleasant for the nose and nearly as quick for the ear.  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy the groomer after I have read so many positive reviews about it on amazon.  </li>
            <li> Ok but it goes thru batteries pretty quick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now slowly becoming one with nature, sort of in the manner of \\&quot;dust to dust\\&quot; (plastic to plastic?), seeking its own destiny with nature and the future....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, it does what it says, and it seems like a good value.</li>
            <li> sweet.</li>
            <li> This does a good job of cleaning out nose hairs, however it cuts the inside of my nose at the same time, leaving me with a blood crusted inside which takes weeks to heal!  </li>
            <li> Before I bash it more let me say it works fast and gloriously for the ear.  </li>
            <li> I read every review on every personal trimmer Amazon was offering and chose to purchase this item because of all the good reviews it received.  </li>
            <li> My trimmer initially seemed like it might be a good product</li>
            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> EASY, COMFORTABLE AND VERY EFFICIENT TO USE</li>
            <li> The first one, I dropped and broke it, but it had been going strong for over 2 years.</li>
            <li> All other features are great.</li>
            <li> Good little trimmer, what more needs to be said.</li>
            <li> When I first got the unit it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> This thing worked fine when I first got it.  </li>
            <li> Painless, bloodless, and quick.  </li>
            <li> It does what it advertises quickly and effortlessly with no pulling/pinching or any problems.</li>
            <li> Painless, bloodless, and quick.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a worthy trade-off, and the cheapest trimmers I&#x27;ve found that don&#x27;t yank the hairs from the root.</li>
            <li> The best defense against discomfort is to use it regularly enough to keep hairs short to begin with.   </li>
            <li> This gadget eats away Battery quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It cuts all the hair in my ears and nose quick and close without yanking them.</li>
            <li> It worked intermitently for awhile and then quick working altogether.</li>
            <li> read the review for this product on Amazon and wondered how so many customers could speak so highly of a nose hair trimmer..</li>
            <li> This truly is the MACH 3 of nose trimmers, worked great for those hard to reach hairs, worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Well thats what happened with this nose groomer the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> We first tried the ER4211C, the one with the light.  </li>
            <li> I think it tries to get the hair it cuts, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as successful at that.</li>
            <li> But after using this item I am in COMPLETE agreement with the other reviewers, this is THE best trimmer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> My husband has been using a small pair of scissors for years to cut his nasal and ear hair and always worried that he would gouge a hole in his nose especially from a sharp move--after using the groomer one time, he is soooooooooooooo happy I bought it--he is very comfortable with it and sees nothing but a wonderful grooming experience with it!</li>
            <li> Quiet, comfortable, and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen hair in my ears and I have a full mustache that blends in right up to my nostrils..</li>
            <li> This trimmer is easy to use, discreet, and fast.</li>
            <li> This item works without pain, and is fast and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I bet this thing would cut a male gorilla&#x27;s nose hair pretty good if you could teach a gorilla how to turn it on.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced, easy to handle, plenty of power and by design, you can&#x27;t cut or slice yourself while trimming.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer for a X-Mas gift for my husband, he has an old trimmer he had used for years, so I thought a new good one for x-mas</li>
            <li> Good cutting, easy to hold, just overall excellent!</li>
            <li> What a great little tool for getting rid of unwanted hair, My ears were a problem and this did the job</li>
            <li> This little beauty does a great job on all my excess fur.  </li>
            <li> This little guy works great.  </li>
            <li> but this little device works great</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s spinning slowly, it pinches and doesn&#x27;t do a very good job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of gross to stick this up your nose, but it really does a fine job.  </li>
            <li> Not even worth returning - this is hitting the trash can.</li>
            <li> Twice the price of the comparable Remington but worth the difference.  </li>
            <li> so I thought it worth a try.</li>
            <li> well* worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have tried scissors, tweezers, and my razor all with varying degrees of success, blood and pain.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is quiet and effective.</li>
            <li> Why the heck they think it&#x27;s worth $50 now is beyond me.</li>
            <li> Twice the price of the comparable Remington but worth the difference.  </li>
            <li> does the job and is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I will be trying another brand, as the discomfort level just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> This one by far superceeds all the others (some of which were way more costly).  </li>
            <li> Not a lot of fun.  </li>
            <li> Boy, this thing is powerful.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> but I just want to warn prospective buyers that this is a distinct possibility.  </li>
            <li> Incredibly useful, i&#x27;ve seen articles like this in movies, but i&#x27;ve never bought one before</li>
            <li> I have tried several nose trimmers and this one is by far the most effective.</li>
            <li> It works equally well on nose and ear hair, and is also ideal for trimming the occasional whisker on the chin or lip that gets missed during shaving.</li>
            <li> This remarkable piece of equipment mows down everything in its path.  </li>
            <li> Although both models trim nose hair excellently, his model, Panasonic ER411, is more powerful than my previous model, trims faster, and finishes the job in less time.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped the Panasonic brand trimmer would live up to both the high esteem that I hold for Pansonic brand electronics and also the excellent ratings by other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> this device is great, although it&#x27;s not easy to use to remove hair on your ear.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right, ouch.</li>
            <li> Her heart is in the right place.</li>
            <li> It cleared my nose right out</li>
            <li> This product has never worked right.  </li>
            <li> It rips it right out.</li>
            <li> Well, this can&#x27;t be right</li>
            <li> This worked great for the first few months that I had it.</li>
            <li> purchased this thing after reading the reviews and having general success with most panasonic products.</li>
            <li> A GREAT LITTLE RAZOR!</li>
            <li> A GREAT LITTLE RAZOR!</li>
            <li> Amazon.com shipping was flawless, the product professionally packages - overall a 5 star experience and something that will save me a ton of aggravation in future years.  </li>
            <li> This small shaver works really great for no stress grooming of both nose and ear hairs.  </li>
            <li> It remained sharp and worked pretty good until the end when it just wouldn&#x27;t start anymore.   </li>
            <li> It misses many nose and ear  hairs as they do not seem to be directed into the slots easily and takes much time since it misses so many and doesn&#x27;t cut them short enough (it is why there is no pinch).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product..easy to clean, safe, no concern with cutting your nose.  </li>
            <li> The drop wasn&#x27;t more than a couple of feet from the medicine cabinet into the sink (and WITH the cover on), but much to my surprise, the darn thing just stopped working completely.  </li>
            <li> a female who wants to look nice, I don&#x27;t want stray nose hairs taking someones attention away from the topic at hand.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and simple to clean.  </li>
            <li> This is really great trimmer for such money, highly recomended for everyone who uses frequently trimmers.</li>
            <li> I had read some discouraging reviews about this model being a torture device but was stuck with trying it, as it was a Panasonic similar to my fine working original.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It may cost a few more bucks than those &#x27;designer&#x27; groomers you see around, but in the long run you&#x27;ll be happy with a well-designed tool that does the job well.</li>
            <li> In fact, I liked the first one so much, I purchased a 2nd groomer to put in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> I had one of these previously that worked pretty good.  </li>
            <li> this trimmer works just as advertised at a very reasonable cost, so I whole-heartedly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This new model, ER411, is just as easy to take apart and clean, as the old model.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;It feels good when sometimes you award yourself with these little life helpers.</li>
            <li> but overall I&#x27;m amazed at how smooth and clean it is in there now.</li>
            <li> Not the best cutting blade either - tended to tug rather than cut cleanly.</li>
            <li> The first was at Target about 3 years ago - I dropped it in the sink and it could not be repaired.  </li>
            <li> and Amazon had the only reputable source.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Panasonic has changed the blade design from an &#x27;L&#x27; shaped blade, which would trim hair entering from the top as well as the sides, to an &#x27;I&#x27; shaped blade, which only cuts hair entering from the sides.</li>
            <li> Thanks Panasonic!  </li>
            <li> Okay, so I buy this online because I&#x27;m too embarrassed to admit I have a massive hedge-like formation that has cropped up on the inside rim of my nostrils</li>
            <li> Spend more money on a unit that will last longer.</li>
            <li> I found this trimer to be exactly what it is advertised to be.</li>
            <li> I would try to buy an exact replacement as this one had never \\&quot;bitten\\&quot; me.  </li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t pull and gets in pretty close.  </li>
            <li> Now if I could just get the hair on the top of my head to grow back...</li>
            <li> Thanks Panasonic, you have a winner here!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, and his first statement was that he didn&#x27;t know why anyone would say it hurts.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a replacement which was slightly better, but had the same problem.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time it left you bloody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had it more than a year and still using the same battery.</li>
            <li> The device did not outlast its first battery.</li>
            <li> (*sigh*) &lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that the parts don&#x27;t seem as well made as the one from 15 years ago, but I am back to a pain free experience.  </li>
            <li> On top, it&#x27;s quiet and washable.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the giggles!</li>
            <li> A lot better than plucking or shoving your regular razor up there</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also become much more likely to nick me.</li>
            <li> Pretty flimsy.  </li>
            <li> This is my first nose/ear groomer</li>
            <li> and I was a bit hesitant in using it first (after reading reviews that it hurts).</li>
            <li> The motor gets hot within 30-60 seconds of use, so take a break between nostrils.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;OK, the results are clean-looking, but I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the pain.</li>
            <li> Mine worked wonders at first.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those evolutionary challenged individuals whom nature forgot when it slowly eliminated fur from the great apes.</li>
            <li> Of the 3 nose hair trimmers, &#x27;personal grooming devices&#x27;, I&#x27;ve used this one caused the most pain.</li>
            <li> The design and build quality both seem first rate.  </li>
            <li> More of a tickler than a cutter it left a lot to be desired in results.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is great in that it has no trouble with mowing down any bush you might have in your nose.  </li>
            <li> Well, the Wahl was much inferior; it made a nice enough whirring sound, but it simply didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> When brand new, it was quiet and fantastic, really did the job nicely as opposed to my old method of trying to use a fingernail clipper or jam the corner of a beard trimmer in my nose.</li>
            <li> You know you are getting old when you get excited about how well a Nose and Ear hair trimmer works...</li>
            <li> Sure, it will probably break if you drop it enough, but it really is well made.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think this thing is going to last more than two months tops, but it works for now.</li>
            <li> some tiny task turns into a huge chore because you don&#x27;t have the right tool?</li>
            <li> While this is a nice gesture, it means you have to really work harder to get some trimming done!</li>
            <li> I use the trimmer daily due to a family curse (lol).</li>
            <li> This trimmer pulled out some hair and kind of ground down the rest.  </li>
            <li> Many of the reviews here 2 years and older refer to an earlier verison of this model.     </li>
            <li> around only twenty dollars) as it looked the most similar to the original and with the inside of my nose</li>
            <li> I think I could have done better on some dates if I used this long ago!  </li>
            <li> the job simply and easily.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic will definitely trim your hair very quickly and efficiently.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight tugging sensation and it does kind of tickle.  </li>
            <li> It feels solidly built and is easy to grip.</li>
            <li> The head is easily removable for cleaning which makes a big difference in the trimmers effectivity.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer does a quick and complete job.  </li>
            <li> First one (different model) was very plasticy and cheap.  </li>
            <li> Simple, straight forward and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The amount of blood flow I experienced far out did any of my less than sober attempts using scissors.</li>
            <li> altho my bro&#x27;s same model works fine still, mine deteriorated and stopped working after about a year.</li>
            <li> It accomplishes the task safely and quickly and without the vibrations that a friend had reported made him sneeze when using similar device from a different manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I now feel quite secure in my general appearance, and any person curious enough to take a gander into my facial orifices will find me nicely groomed and most presentable.</li>
            <li> And it will certainly do so in a manner that appears much safer than using pointed scissors.  </li>
            <li> Pros: effective at trimming nose and ear hair with comparatively little \\&quot;tugging\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I would recommend this handy little tool to anyone who has troublesome nose hairs.  </li>
            <li> But overall, I give it five stars and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants CLEAN AND NEAT nostrils and ears!  </li>
            <li> I believe that they have probably found a cheaper method of manufacture that leaves the blade and shearing edge of the cone less refined than the original, but hopefully will wear-in to provide a snag free instrument.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed and feel that these reviews indicating an excellent product are right on the money!</li>
            <li> very  nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was ready to give up and resort to using my blunt, miniature scissors for the rest of my life.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> This thing really hurts.</li>
            <li> I suppose as it doesn&#x27;t cost much.   </li>
            <li> There is absolutely nothing on the package to let you know you are buying the redesigned product.</li>
            <li> THIS TYPE OF NOSE TRIMMER IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE.</li>
            <li> AND IT CUT MUCH CLOSER .</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> very often...</li>
            <li> Side A (the left) goes reasonably smoothly though there is this wierd aroma of frying hair as I pump the thing in and out of my nostril.</li>
            <li> but I cant stop screwing my face up because the hair that got pulled out tweaked something in my face and it just stings so much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Therefore, if you are not really need it, pls do not buy it just because it is interesting.</li>
            <li> The unit is reasonable well-made</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d wrap it up and give it to my worse enemy LOL.</li>
            <li> Light, compact, simple and works.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend, however!</li>
            <li> This one really works.</li>
            <li> (Changing batteries and cleaning it don&#x27;t help much.)  </li>
            <li> Well, I have some doubts here, if you guys have been immersing the whole thing into soap water and cleaning it.  </li>
            <li> It might very well be a combination of the two.  </li>
            <li> Even though it is made of plastic, it appears to be very durable plastic.  </li>
            <li> (Maybe these things require a gentle touch.)</li>
            <li> It worked very well for all these years.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe such a great product is being sold for such a low price.  </li>
            <li> Then one day my wife was watching \\&quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Really.     </li>
            <li> it really hurts.</li>
            <li> I really just can&#x27;t stand to use it at all ...</li>
            <li> But I got one and it does not cut me up or anything, just some hair pulls that don&#x27;t hurt much.  </li>
            <li> The cutters seem to be made of stainless steel.  </li>
            <li> All of that makes cleaning the unit very convenient.  </li>
            <li> I expected more from the brand.  </li>
            <li> This product is better than expected.</li>
            <li> So, for twenty bucks who wants to hassle with warranty or repair issues??  </li>
            <li> When this day comes, it is important to remember that, like weed wackers, not all nose hair trimmers are created equal.</li>
            <li> I replaced it with the Sharper Image version which cost twice as much.  </li>
            <li> Cuts all kinds of hair, including fuzzy hair, very close, without skin damage.</li>
            <li> My nostrils had so much hair in them that the hair ebbed and flowed with every breath like squid tentacles.  </li>
            <li> The ER411NC really penalizes you for letting things get out of hand.  </li>
            <li> He is very polite.</li>
            <li> I use it in my ears and it cuts the hairs very close to the skin without any tugging.</li>
            <li> The ER411 trimmed hair very close to the skin.</li>
            <li> If you mash it flush against the skin (which is a real blast), it might nick a hair or two.  </li>
            <li> Does the job very well.</li>
            <li> This pulls at the hairs as much as it cuts them.</li>
            <li> I dismantled the head and there was nothing much that need to be cleaned.</li>
            <li> As others pointed out it really does the job</li>
            <li> You really can rinse it under water without it breaking.  </li>
            <li> Highly reccomended!</li>
            <li> Plus the price is extremely reasonable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to make it quit.  </li>
            <li> It really does get the nose hairs out.</li>
            <li> doesnt really hurt at all</li>
            <li> /&gt;The groomer worked very well</li>
            <li> In fairness, trimming nasal hairs will probably always be an awkward process.&lt;br /&gt;The device, like most Panasonic products, is made of good quality materials.  </li>
            <li> This is far, far better than the old one.  </li>
            <li> It is a good accompaniment if you are on the highway for a long long trip...  </li>
            <li> I much preferred my old Wahl brand trimmer, which did a good job, never hurt, has been durable and lasted years -- and Wahl costs less!  </li>
            <li> one I ordered did cut the nose hairs, but first gave them a good hard tug!</li>
            <li> It also gets really hot when in use, which makes it even less comfortable!</li>
            <li> By \\&quot;hurt\\&quot; I mean it doesn&#x27;t feel good, not \\&quot;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> And other models don&#x27;t have any better reviews, including the one that worked well for me before it died.</li>
            <li> The above is my original review.  </li>
            <li> It worked much better than either of the two other products that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> , I can wash it in water and it still functions on the original battery after several months.</li>
            <li> Other shavers I&#x27;ve used yank some of the hairs out and bring tears to my eyes because they are more like pluckers than like shavers.  </li>
            <li> and I use it for the original purpose: nose and ear, but also eyebrows, upper lip, chin, cheeks, etc.  </li>
            <li> takes just one battery, cuts clean and quiet, does not pull or pinch.</li>
            <li> You can actually wash the unit under running water to clean it.  </li>
            <li> Its blades were configured to hit the hairs at a more right angle, cutting cleanly and quickly.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, there&#x27;s a minor tug or two during operation as some have noted, but the inside of my nose is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> It seemed odd it was not in original packageing but has every appearance of being new and, in fact, runs even better than the last one that seemed to go through batteries much faster...  </li>
            <li> Like most things Panasonic, this thing broke down after about a year.  </li>
            <li> Many mornings I still come away with involuntary tears streaming down my face afterward - ah, the price of vanity.   </li>
            <li> I am purchasing another as it is so good, but Panny would do well to make it cut a little easier and absorb the inevitable drop.</li>
            <li> but this is really much better and cost much less.</li>
            <li> If you want zero pain, somebody needs to design a microprecision tool for this and would cost you nothing less than a grand.</li>
            <li> The noise level is minimal and comes apart easily for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to see anything on the market for my particular affliction:</li>
            <li> The older units (with a split head) worked well.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, when you get older, you get hairier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unfortunately getting to the stage where hair starts growing in more and more places that I don&#x27;t want it to.  </li>
            <li> I have nose nair in the classic levantine tradition and over the years I had to make do with scissors and tweezers to groom myself.  </li>
            <li> Uses 1 AA battery and has a decent battery life.</li>
            <li> It is a decent ear and nose trimmer.  </li>
            <li> And I figured the $15 price tag was worth it if only to satisfy my curiousity about how these things actually operate, or at least be good for a laugh or two from my wife or kids.     </li>
            <li> After using an older Wahl for years, I had a lengthy adjustment period.  </li>
            <li> , I said, so I exchanged my first torture device, and the replacement does exactly the same thing!!!</li>
            <li> As men get older they get weirder looking, and one of the things that makes them look weirder and ickier is targus, that annnoying hair that crops up in their nostrils and ears.</li>
            <li> works great, can use it blind folded if you really wanted to not having to worry about exposed blades.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended but...</li>
            <li> Highly reccomended.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews of these things that I could find and this one ranked high in the majority of reviews.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this panasonic ear and hair groomer.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> For the price I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER411NC groomer will give you a very clean trim in a short amount of time, but at the occasional cost of comfort.   </li>
            <li> You need to clean up your nose after a trim(the cut hair tends to stick inside) but thats a minor irritant.</li>
            <li> I have since switched to the Grommmate stainless steel and manual trimmer, which is cheaper and just as effective, albeit slower; it is also less likely to break.    </li>
            <li> We must have extremely sensitive schnozzes in Ohio!!  </li>
            <li> I would like to see Panasonic maybe insulate it a little better.  </li>
            <li> Well, this little guy Does pull on your nose and ear hairs, and if that doesn&#x27;t bother you you&#x27;re a better man than I GD.</li>
            <li> I thought the reviews I read here were a little over the top,</li>
            <li> It works well but as soon as you take it apart to clean it is nearly impossable to get it back together and working as well as it was out of the box.</li>
            <li> It really takes the sting out of a sensitive job.  </li>
            <li> I really wish companys would stop outsourcing production to China which clearly has zero quality control.</li>
            <li> I opted to splurge and get a \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot; nose hair trimmer from Sharper Image, and am quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is powerful, quiet and versatile.</li>
            <li> After about 6 months of normal usage, it just stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I will be VERY GENTLE with the new one as Panasonic apparently uses el cheapo plastic in their product (or whoever makes it under their brand name).</li>
            <li> The unit isn&#x27;t getting hot, so it&#x27;s certainly the result of an occasional sensitive hair being yanked.</li>
            <li> At first this worked great, but after a few months the RPMs went way down, and I don&#x27;t know how to make it run properly anymore.  </li>
            <li> Take VERY good care of it as it is obviously fragile and the length of life is questionable even if you do take care of it.</li>
            <li> I new</li>
            <li> This is all after testing with new batteries.</li>
            <li> This new version is quieter.</li>
            <li> I took the trimmer out and pop a new battery in and it didn&#x27;t even start.</li>
            <li> i assumed this new one would be the same--WRONG  </li>
            <li> In phone calls to Panasonic I have been told that the new design is in effect now.</li>
            <li> I just fired up my new trimmer today.  </li>
            <li> And yes, I did try new battereies.</li>
            <li> So I tossed it and bought a new Panasonic ER411NC Nose and Ear Hair Groomer.</li>
            <li> I tried new battries and it still wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> After many failed attempts, I was convinced that there wasn&#x27;t a tool available that could handle my rigorous grooming demands.  </li>
            <li> I obviously don&#x27;t have much to compare with but this unit did everything I&#x27;d hoped it would (and could reasonably expect from it).&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> It comes with the fact that all the hair is growing in the wrong places after disappearing from where we though were the most important.</li>
            <li> The newer model does not work nearly as well as the older model.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to not see others talk about this in their reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Alas</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and am surprised they aren&#x27;t doing mass advertising for it.  </li>
            <li> It still works but is very, very loud.  </li>
            <li> One of the first things I noticed with the new ER411 was that I got an occasional sting from it.  </li>
            <li> It actually does exactly what it is supposed to do, and</li>
            <li> However, from the first time I tried it it hurt and tickled at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Exact same experience.  </li>
            <li> I would be willing to pay extra for that feature.  </li>
            <li> One tip I would offer, after trimming your nose hairs thoroughly, blow your nose well to do what your barber does with the old neck brush!</li>
            <li> This groomer performs way better than others I have had in the past.  </li>
            <li> It seemed as if all it did was whirr prettily without doing the concommitant and necessary clipping.</li>
            <li> It works first time, every time, and I have only changed the AA battery</li>
            <li> and when you get down to it I suppose it&#x27;s pretty much a disposable item since the price isn&#x27;t much.  </li>
            <li> Unless you learn to clean properly this product will not last.</li>
            <li> I have try the other sub $$ products I got at the retail store and they just couldn&#x27;t do a &#x27;clean&#x27; job.   </li>
            <li> , I took my chance with this one - there are some negative reviews and some strong positive reviews.</li>
            <li> When that happens I&#x27;ll buy a new one just like the old one.</li>
            <li> Although my old model works very well, I ordered this model over 1 year ago to have a spare in my hygiene kit, as I am often on the go with very little advanced notice.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t review this against any other pure nose hair trimmer, this is the first one that I have used.</li>
            <li> I have tried first other brands, much expensief</li>
            <li> Basically I read all the good reviews and thought maybe I just got a defective one, so I was dumb enough to get it again.  </li>
            <li> It works and certainly has made an improvement in his personal appearance!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It tickles a little but does a fantastic job</li>
            <li> Hard to imagine this product any better.    </li>
            <li> works great cutting hair around the ears and nose.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic got such great reviews, how could I go wrong?</li>
            <li> old Panasonic didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if they just had sensitive nostrils</li>
            <li> He is 85 years old</li>
            <li> Then it would frequently stop spinning.  </li>
            <li> The decision to purchase this product was based on the old theory, \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The one drawback is how loud it is.  </li>
            <li> and then it just gave up the ghost, and stopped working completely.  </li>
            <li> I purchaed this trimmer to replace the old one that I dropped on it&#x27;s tip.</li>
            <li> I have nipped my ears a number of times when trying to cut wild hairs with scissors.  </li>
            <li> I even cried wow.</li>
            <li> His old one is still in use</li>
            <li> The old one is a Remington nedh-2500</li>
            <li> Wow I just noticed there are 259 reviews for a $14 nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Wet/Dry and waterproof, completely portable, there is nothing not to like.  </li>
            <li> wish i had not bght, as ends up doubling price by battery cost so far.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of others over the years and this is the only one that works really well.</li>
            <li> I used this trimmer once and stuck it too far inside my nose.</li>
            <li> I had another trimmer that just got old.  </li>
            <li> The old design was referred to as a curved blade design.</li>
            <li> This seems to minimize the occasional tugs that really cause the pain.   </li>
            <li> and it does the job, although it isn&#x27;t recommended for those with sensitive skin or a touchy tear reflex.</li>
            <li> It is considerably faster in the nose mowing area, and I never did dare to explore my otic growth with any object sharper than a Q-tip.</li>
            <li> my old one is still working, so I got another for my car...</li>
            <li> If you see a stubborn piece of hair that the trimmer is trimming but not removing, gently guide the trimmer the OPPOSITE direction over the hair</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t have had to buy this one if my wife hadn&#x27;t dropped the old one.</li>
            <li> It grooms wells and precisely so far.</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> As luck would have it, my wife got this for my birthday after several bouts of sneezing during our intimate moments.</li>
            <li> It was like welcoming an old friend into the house.</li>
            <li> My old ER112 has never grabbed any skin and is the tool of choice for getting in the darker recesses of this bird&#x27;s beak.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does not trim close like the old trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It will even clip a wild eyebrow hair.  </li>
            <li> But they only work a few months at most.  </li>
            <li> I got so tired of getting nicked and cut with my old one (and it still didn&#x27;t do the job effectively) that I thought I would try this one.</li>
            <li> It worked fairly well for several months, but then went into a slow decline in which it occasionally yanked hairs instead of trimming.  </li>
            <li> Most of the other similar products on the market start pulling the hair after a short time.</li>
            <li> The blade is well positioned and protected enough that, excuse my French, you pretty much can just stick it in your ear or nose, twirl a bit, and presto!  </li>
            <li> With an ergonomically designed stainless-steel blade that retains its sharpness, the Panasonic Nose and Ear Hair Groomer is the first and last personal groomer you will ever need.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR</li>
            <li> The only other concern, as with the original, is that of dropping it on it&#x27;s tip.</li>
            <li> While my age shall remain unknown to you, I have looked for a long time for a comfortable way to trim those pesky nose hairs.  </li>
            <li> think the reason for the mixed reviews is a good number of these units come right from the factory with poor cutting blades, hence some love it and</li>
            <li> It takes a special tool to handle the heavy work and this is it.  </li>
            <li> I admit to a bit of \\&quot;yikes\\&quot; now and then, but I Did discover that if you move the mower Slowly whilst hewing the internal forests it greatly reduces these little surprises.</li>
            <li> I once bought the Panasonic Dry trimmer by accident, and did not like it near as much.</li>
            <li> Makes trimming those hard to reach areas easy.  </li>
            <li> This new version is identical except that they&#x27;ve added a plastic thingy in the middle, to prevent hairs from catching/pulling.</li>
            <li> Well, I tried several new batteries in the trimmer, but it still nicked and cut when I tried it.</li>
            <li> New batteries notwithstanding, one day it simply wouldn&#x27;t work any longer.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully the relic will be found one day by some future being, perhaps a member of a new civilization.  </li>
            <li> This fell on the floor as I was taking it out of the box, fell totally apart, and despite all sorts of effort on my part to put it back together, it doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> The slight discomfort felt by a pulled out hair or two is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> This gadget never had much power, pulled at my admittedly jungle-like nose hairs painfully, and quit for good after a year.  </li>
            <li> What used to be an efficient, quick trimmer has now become a waste of both time and money.  </li>
            <li> Thought it would be limited compared to much talked about Sharper Image one, which I have tried.</li>
            <li> And with no sharp edges exposed</li>
            <li> This gadget does a much better job than scissors or other little shavers.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic is now using a less powerful motor and apparently changed the blade design as well.</li>
            <li> For $17 I&#x27;m not going to spend a lot of time trying to get it fixed or replaced, but I did see other reviews that talked of fast failures.  </li>
            <li> but this is certainly within the realm of what I expected.  </li>
            <li> the other side, frankly speaking, this device works well, if you really need it and your long nose hair really annoys you.</li>
            <li> I have been using older model, basically the same as the one I ordered for the last 5 years.  </li>
            <li> This would also make a nice little stocking stuffing for the holidays, something small but thoughtful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked great (although it could be painful), the TWO times I used it.  </li>
            <li> The one AA battery usually doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me to complete my grooming ritual, but the 90-minute battery life should be more than sufficient for the rest of you.  </li>
            <li> The light was also pretty useless.  </li>
            <li> My old scisors were sharper and I had to be more careful with them, but at least they don&#x27;t pull my nose hair.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to go into a store and let some 16 year old babe in low rise jeans see me buy it.</li>
            <li> and I would&#x27;nt be surprised if they put low quality parts into manufacturing this.</li>
            <li> and I barely used it too.</li>
            <li> It was big and had handgrips for each hand, an old plug- in- the-</li>
            <li> Apparently, they&#x27;re all duds.  </li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;re having a bit more of a difficult time breathing than normal, try this product out..</li>
            <li> If you use a tired, half-drained one, the blades grind slower and the result is more like the Epilady thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does a good job of cutting hair though.</li>
            <li> Good cutting speed</li>
            <li> Good cutting capability &lt;</li>
            <li> and there is a good chance of disappointment.</li>
            <li> kind of powerless.</li>
            <li> And this little gizmo is the right tool.&lt;br /&gt;Order</li>
            <li> It still gets the job done, it just takes a few \\&quot;going overs\\&quot; to get it right.</li>
            <li> Tugs slightly on nose hairs at first use.  </li>
            <li> First one broke in less than a year.</li>
            <li> But really it&#x27;s a small price to pay to get the job done so quickly and easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a certain amount of pulling, it&#x27;s not all that sharp, but the unit does in fact clean out the hair in your nostrils and takes, oh, three or four months off your age at least.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found it to be very well made.  </li>
            <li> I saw him go at his ears and nose with an itty bitty pair of sharp scissors, so he tried this and really loves it.</li>
            <li> When brand new this thing worked like gangbusters, however the razor sharp blades dulled quickly leaving me crying like a baby.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This little gem weed-whacks those hairs pretty well.</li>
            <li> Broke after the first few days.</li>
            <li> My first fell off a shelf and the 4 foot drop killed it.  </li>
            <li> There hasn&#x27;t been too much blood shed, but the whole process is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll take the little zing it caused on first use; my guess is that in the future it won&#x27;t be anything like the clear-cut</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only reason this trimmer gets four stars instead of five: the first one that I bought was dead on arrival.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, men of a certain age start to find the need for regular mowing of bits of our faces that previously needed none.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the device&#x27;s little blade is too far down the safety nozzle for it to do anything useful for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that much hair and only use it for like half a minute a day, but it&#x27;s stopped turning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe, but if you can picture the top of your little finger -- that&#x27;s the size of this rotary electric razor that spins in a circle.  </li>
            <li> Also, while I did notice that it pulled out a few hairs here and there, causing some slight discomfort, overall it worked MUCH better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, I was a little worried about this product, but it works very well.  </li>
            <li> This little devil really does work well.</li>
            <li> I only used it about ten times, and the next time I turned it on, it was louder than normal due to rattling like something broke or got off-center, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> You can use it either wet or dry, it&#x27;s fully immersible, takes one &amp;quot;AA&amp;quot; battery and has a high tech look.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let it fall down with metal side, otherwise should buy new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised other reviews haven&#x27;t said this thing friggin hurts to use.  </li>
            <li> I had an old 411, lost it and purchased 2 other brands and panasonic 415.  </li>
            <li> Kudos to Panasonic for designing an essential product for every red blooded man&#x27;s toilet kit!</li>
            <li> No matter how hard I&#x27;ve tried in the past, I&#x27;ve never been able to quite get the job done.</li>
            <li> A replacement was required and one for that particular trimmer was not available.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is not a comfortable feeling to get something moving at high speed inside your nose and ears, it is just a matter of getting used to &lt;br</li>
            <li> Cons: Simply did not last very long.</li>
            <li> However it would trim small hairs from the nose and ears very well.</li>
            <li> Hope it last as long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Batteries last a long time, trims hair well, but ...</li>
            <li> It works as advertised but just doesn&#x27;t seem to last long.  </li>
            <li> I finally found out that he had stopped using it because it didn&#x27;t do a decent job of clipping those nose hairs, and I&#x27;m not sure if I can return it at this point.</li>
            <li> Problem is, as someone else reviewed, it may not work properly for very long.</li>
            <li> With new batteries, there is very low speed and the cutters don&#x27;t do an adequate job in cutting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to keep a straight face when discussing the personal grooming solution this little wonder offers -- but the bottom line is it works.</li>
            <li> I could get a brand new trimmer for less than that when Amazon has it on sale!</li>
            <li> The unit is not very loud</li>
            <li> the other side, these are low margin, low volume business for these companies</li>
            <li> The nose feels raw after using this, which I guess means its doing a good job of cutting the hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too loud when putting it in your ear.  </li>
            <li> The cutting is clean and complete.</li>
            <li> I think it would do a better job cutting finer hair... not the 20 gage wire</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaply made, and in spite of its premium price, it&#x27;s a lousy product.  </li>
            <li> I think that I knocked the blades out of alignment because it now constantly makes the same sound that it does when cutting hair.</li>
            <li> Expect to buy another before too long.</li>
            <li> Now, I haven&#x27;t used it myself (and probably won&#x27;t since it&#x27;s been in his nose...), but he did say as long as you&#x27;re not jamming it up your nose, he can&#x27;t see how it would hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This device probably provides the easiest method for trimming long nasal hairs.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how long I had it until I seen it in my order history.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s really not a lot of actual use before it just quits.  </li>
            <li> big caution is that it is not very durable.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful and it&#x27;ll last long.</li>
            <li> Bought a new groomer just because I got tired of looking at the old one.</li>
            <li> I purchased the same model as a replacement, and as a previous reviewer has stated, the blade design has been changed from the earlier model.  </li>
            <li> It arrived about a week later than promised, but I still could use the other unit (somewhat) - Otherwise I would have had to pay for the express shipping</li>
            <li> I brought it for myself due to it was under the gold box sale, and the prior grooming object was barbaric and  hurt from pulling the nasal hair.</li>
            <li> I have long needed help keeping those nasal hairs in check!  </li>
            <li> Well, other than the obvious, that is.</li>
            <li> It did work well while it lasted, but I&#x27;m hoping now the more expensive model will do the job a little longer.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s now the only one I have, I reluctantly go through this torture, with watering eyes and clenching teeth, every other month or so.  </li>
            <li> I was leery of getting this Panasonic one because of other reviews saying that this was doing the same thing (pulling the hair).</li>
            <li> Sometimes it pulls the hairs a bit which can be uncomfortable but I rather put up with that and get clean grooming rather than use the cheapo brand that doesn&#x27;t cut anything.</li>
            <li> No pain, minimal motor noise (for those seeking a discrete trim), and it works equally well in wet or dry conditions.  </li>
            <li> Today I have to replace my two year old unit because the little plastic rim that holds the trimmer head snapped off!</li>
            <li> The single battery lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> single AA battery</li>
            <li> The cutting head is smaller than I expected and fits comfortably in nostrils and ears.</li>
            <li> Now I just spend 5 minutes with the groomer every 3 or 4 weeks and no more wild hair problems.</li>
            <li> It sounded like my old one with nearly dead batteries!    </li>
            <li> Having spent long years with scissors and mirror</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps it&#x27;s defective, bad blade, or somesuch - visual inspection seems okay, but this is certainly NOT the way it&#x27;s designed to work.</li>
            <li> I found this, a buzzy little friend with a delicate head and no visible blades nor any which could harm skin but get them near tufty and furry facial cavities and they are back to their hairless days in no time.</li>
            <li> Just like shaving your teenage peach fuzz was no hassle compared to knocking down the man beard.  </li>
            <li> Despite the fact that my sink clogs up with massive amounts of hair this trimmer mows them down and keeps going.</li>
            <li> second one just died after less than a month of use.</li>
            <li> I went through about a half dozen different nose/ear hair trimmers before finding this one.  </li>
            <li> Trimmers that pull end up in the trash or yard sale right next to other creepy items.</li>
            <li> The unsightly nose hairs were so long they would sometimes get tangled, causing me extreme, eye-watering pain.  </li>
            <li> I will admit it that the only drwaback was that it would very slightly pull hairs if they were too long, but that could be avoided with routine use.     </li>
            <li> In an act of desperation, I replaced the cutting blades in my new ER411NC with the cutting blades from my dead ER411, now the trimmer works great.</li>
            <li> (otherwise little hair dust will be coming out all day!).&lt;br /&gt;Takes one AA battery, which lasts for a month or so or regular use, unless, of course, you grow hair at truly prodigious rates.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Greek and can not help my hairy genes, but this little trimmer works WELL and hasn&#x27;t upset me yet.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;You may have to rinse your nose out because the tiny little cut hairs can be quite itchy.  </li>
            <li> I think I will buy a nicer one next time and hope it lasts a little longer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Addendum: I lost this little item in a housefire (since I wrote the above review).</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, rather than another similar product, due to the previous reviews.  </li>
            <li> After a year of light use, mine kept spinning but stopped cutting.  </li>
            <li> The only negative I can see is that it doesn&#x27;t look especially robust, so I imagine it will die someday, but at $15 who cares?  </li>
            <li> Ive had nose hair since i was 15 and never really found a product that got rid of all of them.</li>
            <li> I have bought two of these and both sufferred the same terminal problem after a few months useage.  </li>
            <li> careful you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> not ER411NC) for the last few years.</li>
            <li> Performs as expected.</li>
            <li> it works as expected.  </li>
            <li> there are some simple souls who would have trouble with anything...</li>
            <li> Some reviewers made it seem as if you look at this product wrong, it will crumble right before your eyes.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this one, because I at first think it might help me to remove several of my long nose hair, which is unpleasant.</li>
            <li> neet little gadget causes minor pain .ouch</li>
            <li> That was until I received mine today and put a single AA battery into it, turned it on and began to use it in less than two minutes from its arrival..</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on the testimonials of the other reviewers for this product.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t pinch or rip out the hairs like other products he has tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any nose/ear hair trimming products before (other than cuticle scissors and yanking)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any experience with other groomers and relied on reviews from other people at this site.  </li>
            <li> I tried manual clippers in the past but found they had sharp edges and were too big for my smallish nostrils anyway.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and look at other brands.  </li>
            <li> Has sharp blades and doesn&#x27;t pull out hairs.</li>
            <li> It is an electrical equipment and does needs some due care.   </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product 100% over other methods.  </li>
            <li> You had to keep the blades sharp, or it&#x27;ll rip the hairs out of your nose.</li>
            <li> Extreme pain and blood pouring out.</li>
            <li> I do not know how well this unit will function for its other purpose: trimming ear hairs.  </li>
            <li> It works like any other (while it works).  </li>
            <li> In fact I am due for another trim.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t get \\&quot;clogged\\&quot; like some of the other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it every other day for a month now and the battery hasn&#x27;t drained a bit.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, the ER411NC is a re-design of the ER411.</li>
            <li> It would be sufficient to say that other companies are copying the design (store brands like Remington, etc)</li>
            <li> can basically use it anywhere on your face like I do, but I do not suggest using it on other parts of the body, like your chest, stomach, etc.  </li>
            <li> On my face I haven&#x27;t had any pain yet, like other reviews stated.  </li>
            <li> I didnt have any of the \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; problems other reviewers had either.  </li>
            <li> But like a bunch of other reviewers it just quit one morning.  </li>
            <li> Do not try it for purposes other than grooming nose or ear hair.  </li>
            <li> When the other person in you life starts chasing you around with tweezers - It&#x27;s time to invest in a tool that won&#x27;t bring tears to your eyes.  </li>
            <li> It is still sharp and does not pull your hair.  </li>
            <li> He complained that it was uncomfortable to use, It works fine for me...</li>
            <li> Wet the blades down before using the groomer.  </li>
            <li> I would not purchase another Panasonic unit being afraid it would all so die a quick death.  </li>
            <li> I had one of these a few years ago, and it only lasted a few months.  </li>
            <li> Worse then being more expensive, it was painfull to use.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps if the hair that sprouts from your nose is fine this tool will suffice, I&#x27;m still searching for the groomer that will be gentle to me yet viciously mow down stray hairs.</li>
            <li> The new one was more expensive and rechargble, but worked bad.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is my fault and I am butterfingers, but something should not break that easily, especially if it is something that is made to be used around hard floors, i.e. the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I like to present a neat appearance and that is hard to do with stray hairs growing where they shouldn&#x27;t be.  </li>
            <li> That having been said, these Panasonic trimmers leave a little bit of hair(maybe 1/8 of an inch) but at the same time, it doesn&#x27;t usually pull.</li>
            <li> It was also uncomfortable to use because it really pulled at the hairs.  </li>
            <li> Like another reviewer said, for the price I paid, it&#x27;s not worth the hassle of returning it or trying to fix it.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the vibrations from the head tickle the heck out of my nose.  </li>
            <li> I wish I bought it at a local store so at least I can exchange one after 3 month of purchasing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last that long either for the price that I paid because mine is now broken.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not award 5 stars was because I felt like the hair was almost being pulled, so the trimming process made me a bit edgy.    </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth pursuing a repair or a warranty</li>
            <li> I feel it is not worth the money</li>
            <li> Big thick black hairs too.</li>
            <li> motor was slowing down.  </li>
            <li> Cuts pain-free grooming time down to nothing.</li>
            <li> During cleaning take care not to lose the blade down the drain like I did.</li>
            <li> It cuts the hair down, it does not pull it out.  </li>
            <li> Feels a little bit weird the first few times, and remember you have to wipe down afterwards</li>
            <li> It should be noted that it is not painless, there is some slight discomfort as nose hairs are mowed down.</li>
            <li> Well i bought this on december 2005, i used only 4 months, after that i dropped it and the blades went bad, not broken</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m slightly disturbed by Amazon&#x27;s option to buy it used.</li>
            <li> I have had a previous model panasonic trimmer, but it gave up the ghost</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less than $15, and *</li>
            <li> I even put a half used battery in it.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to rotate fast enough so makes the job a bit too painful</li>
            <li> I have a previous Panasonic nose trimmer model which I purchased over 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li> You may experience some hair pulling and slight tugging at times.  </li>
            <li> I had used my previous Panasonic trimmer for over two years before it was lost with my luggage at the airport.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the \\&quot;less expensive\\&quot; groomers for years, and now I wonder why I hesitated to go with the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> As the previous reviewer noted, you can hear when it&#x27;s getting hair, which is helpful.</li>
            <li> I just got this model as an &#x27;upgrade&#x27; for my tired old ER112, which has been my trusty companion for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> As a previous poster mentioned, it felt like a burn.  </li>
            <li> There are few things more frustrating that placing a whirring cutting device into your nose and ears, and then waiting for it to do its job, trying every angle, all to no effect.</li>
            <li> Anyway I tried to mess with it to make it keep spinning</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;m afraid of a nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> Get a pair of those small grooming scissors and simply be careful with them.  </li>
            <li> It is occasionally painful- not REALLY bad at all</li>
            <li> just how weak the underpinnings of the old America were, how the inoperative little hair trimmer is at some level symbolic of the failed American experiment as a Constitutional Republic, or the American failure as \\&quot;Emperor of the World.\\</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER411NC Nose and Ear Hair Groomer does a great job at cutting close -- but it feels like it&#x27;s pulling the hair as much as it&#x27;s cutting!  </li>
            <li> This little groomer is the ticket.</li>
            <li> However, after shaving my mustache off, I noticed my nose hair was a little longer than I&#x27;d expect..</li>
            <li> youll feel a little tickle.</li>
            <li> This little gem of a self torture device serves quite well in ripping out hairs by the root.</li>
            <li> I also wouldn&#x27;t want to be known for my nose hairs in someones conversation about me, so \\&quot;off with the little beasties!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was offered a bundled deal with this little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic groomer works well, if with a little discomfort.  </li>
            <li> This little gizmo works like a champ.</li>
            <li> Afterward my eyes always water a little.  </li>
            <li> It can pinch a little bit when snipping the hairs, but I am told that almost all of them do that?</li>
            <li> It is a little painfull though.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to discover this newer version has a less powerful motor.</li>
            <li> The &amp;quot;pretender groomers&amp;quot; (as I like to call them) would either yank out the hairs at an excruciatingly slow pace, or I would be left with stubble inside my nose.  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful taking them apart, but it is not too hard.  </li>
            <li> I have never used a device made especially for nose and ear hair removal, I have always used scissors or tweezers, which cause immense pain and can be dangerous.  </li>
            <li> A few point to keep in mind</li>
            <li> It is also not a cheaply made product.</li>
            <li> Quite a few reviewers reported this model pulls on the hair.  </li>
            <li> had bought a low quality grommer from a different manufacturer a couple of months back and suffered from it - it would take me atleast 10 mins of grinding around my nostrils to remove all the hair follicles and even after that, I could still feel some hair inside - which I hate.</li>
            <li> * Breaks after a few months/malfunctioning -</li>
            <li> However, it always breaks after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> and I just wasted the money for this one.</li>
            <li> One year later, it is broken.  </li>
            <li> stopped working after a few months.  </li>
            <li> No batteries to wear out, and no cheap plastic to break.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Well, I dropped my ER411 and the trimmer was dead.</li>
            <li> The one I just purchased stopped (just stopped) working in a matter of a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble at all with my unit.  </li>
            <li> The other one had a straight (not round) head and was awful.</li>
            <li> The only exception to this IMHO is cutting nose hairs so short that my nose feels &#x27;raw&#x27; for a bit....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether I got a defective unit or what, but it has a tendency to yank my nose hair, and my previous nose hair trimmer doesn&#x27;t do that!</li>
            <li> I am ordering another due to blades getting dull after 3 years use.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the process is a little more painful or at least startling when it comes to trimming nose hairs.  </li>
            <li> just kidding, like the other review says the price of perfection or at least the quest for it</li>
            <li> I needed something that could tame the beast that resided inside my nose.&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li> I stumble out of the bathroom and my woman sees me bleeding crying and looking all confused</li>
            <li> Not true here!  </li>
            <li> It hurts like crazy - and I&#x27;m highly pain tolerant.  </li>
            <li> In my experience, the blade would go bad before the first battery had to be replaced.</li>
            <li> The first one of these I received painfully pulled hairs as it cut them.  </li>
            <li> The ventilation on the cap probably helps prevent moisture from building up on the cutters.&lt;br /&gt;The unit measures approximately five inches long.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Priced right, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Since it is disturbing the natural condition of our nose inside by cutting those long hair as well as Those Normal Hair, my nose feel so uncomfortable after the hair is cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this model to anyone who is conscious of their appearance and want to keep the annoying facial hairs under control.</li>
            <li> and it really seems to go haywire flaying open the skin and tugging the hairs out so viciously that I got tears running down my face.</li>
            <li> Within the first week the blade got weak and it would pull the hair before cutting it.</li>
            <li> After plucking and many other painful procedures, I gave up on these little trimmers because my previous one was WORTHLESS.  </li>
            <li> A real keeper, too bad they didn&#x27;t come out with this razor a lot sooner.</li>
            <li> A real keeper, too bad they didn&#x27;t come out with this razor a lot sooner.</li>
            <li> Functions well overall, although a few painful nicks led me to be careful about not getting it too close to the skin inside the  nostrils.</li>
            <li> To solve it I tried the small, blunt scissors--</li>
            <li> AND IF THE CUTTING BLADES ARE STRAIGHT UP, IT&#x27;S NO GOOD.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of that unsightly noae and ear hair in a few minutes with no nicks, cuts, scrapes!</li>
            <li> Use it every couple days and no more tugging.  </li>
            <li> No more for me...</li>
            <li> Until now, I&#x27;ve been taking a small scissors and a couple of mirrors to try to trim those pesky things.  </li>
            <li> I use it often, as I find excessive nose hair offensive.  </li>
            <li> I have small nose holes</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is the battery or the unit.</li>
            <li> however I suppose it&#x27;s hardly unexpected, and buying a new one every 9-12 months isn&#x27;t the worst deal in the world.  </li>
            <li> Maybe all of the other nose hair trimmers are worse.</li>
            <li> Motor spins erratically and is fairly weak... when it slows down it pulls hairs.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely powerless - very difficult if not impossible to groom Nose &amp; Ear hair</li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Honestly, every Panasonic product I&#x27;ve owned has broken down on me before a resonable time.  </li>
            <li> after 1 year of usage, it finally broken down...</li>
            <li> * Too painful and yanks off sensitive hair - yes it does pain - but very very little.  </li>
            <li> I mean, how do you get an electric razor that small?  </li>
            <li> It was hard to find this trimmer anywhere</li>
            <li> It even gives me hard breathing some time, which i have never experience before.</li>
            <li> u can press it up against your nose, but dont push it too hard.</li>
            <li> Drop it 2-3 feet on a hard surface and it may no longer function -</li>
            <li> The blades just get dull.  </li>
            <li> I had this item for 15 years, but the blades got dull.  </li>
            <li> Hairs could only enter the cutting zone of the head on the SIDES of the cutter, not on the tip.</li>
            <li> It made my eyes water and started an insane sneezing fit.  </li>
            <li> of the negative reviews and my comments on it &lt;br /</li>
            <li> I would stay away from it, or at least, drop test it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this power causes the unit to vibrate in a way that seems tickly at best and painful at worst.  </li>
            <li> but it does when you least expect it.</li>
            <li> Either I have an abundance of thick nose hairs or this</li>
            <li> No, it was not because my hair was so dense or thick that it ruined the device.</li>
            <li> slowly built up some trust until the unit managed to grab up some of my nose lining</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but like other people have said..there is a little pulling and may feel awkward once in awhile when it does that..</li>
            <li> Multiple passes and odd angling are now the norm, and I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mean to disgust you, though.</li>
            <li> I mean this is just a nose/ear hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Considering I used the trimmer approximately once per month, I am not entirely sure I would recommend this product.    </li>
            <li> I purchased this product this past June and it is broken already.</li>
            <li> I was seriously beginning to consider braiding the unsightly nose hair while claiming to &#x27;express&#x27; my individuality.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a nose-hair groomer (Wahl) that actually cuts nose hairs - dropped it to a bad landing one day, and had to replace it.</li>
            <li> but this thing is no good.  </li>
            <li> If you do, it will be instant junk, and you will be in the market for a replacement and the possibly painful break-in period.</li>
            <li> If you need a trimmer that cuts hair close to the skin, the ER411NC is not a good choice.</li>
            <li> I hate getting old.  </li>
            <li> Then imagine a tiny version of that big drill-thing from the Schwarzenegger movie \\&quot;Total Recall\\&quot; boring into your nostril, grabbing each hair, then tearing it violently from its follicle.</li>
            <li> After 2-3 very careful cleanings, the flimsy cutting mechanism fell apart.</li>
            <li> how about a base cradle or at least a flat bottom</li>
            <li> Yes, it leaves your nose smoother than babies&#x27; behind, but it&#x27;s not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that the Panasonic ER411 performed rather well for approximately 18 months.</li>
            <li> It now does a poor job of trimming hair from the nose, or ears, or anywhere else.   </li>
            <li> probably broken.</li>
            <li> Broken when I got it and</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s stone cold dead.</li>
            <li> Too irritating -</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a poor quality product.</li>
            <li> and I know from experience you can do worse.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re tired of hacking yourself up with a scissors, give this a try...</li>
            <li> and I was extremely fearful of the possibilty and was generally apprehensive with each use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone know of less painful product??</li>
            <li> As of now, all 3 have failed because of a poor switch, which chooses to fail in the OFF position.</li>
            <li> makes it unpleasant and slow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The problem is the prospect of sticking conventional trimming devices up ones nose or down ones ears, ranks anywhere between terrifying and psychotic!</li>
            <li> During cold and flu season, it was not uncommon for me to get some &amp;quot;leftovers&amp;quot; stuck in my nose.&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li> (reviewed) unit allows hairs to enter the END of the cutter, where they are TWISTED out of your skin.  </li>
            <li> This has changed the trimmer into a lousy product.</li>
            <li> dingleberries (no, not the unfortunately named Christmas cookie.)</li>
            <li> The one I got is really useless because it plugs the hair often.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m sorry I did as mine</li>
            <li> Completely useless.</li>
            <li> Annoying and a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> In fact, I did already spend some time trying to see what went wrong, but it&#x27;s still messed up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been skeptical about the practicality of electric nose hair trimmers, but I figured if the Fab Five recommended it, then maybe I should try it.  </li>
            <li> Is this a collectible?</li>
            <li> It dosn&#x27;t vibrate and create an uncomfortable feeling inside you</li>
            <li> For as well as the trimmer works, at this price you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> The Conair was useless...</li>
            <li> I do feel sorry for the woman who bought one for her husband who hates it.  </li>
            <li> Frustrating!  </li>
            <li> Sorry, we don&#x27;t need to know everything!!&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> I had my doubts when I ordered it, but I was tired of drawing blood trying to trim myself with a barber scissors, so I decided to give it a try!    </li>
            <li> Yes, I cleaned it out and checked to see if anything was clogged or wrong with it.</li>
            <li> The quality of the cutting blades was poor and resulted in some eye watering nose hair pulls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> it is very frustrating to go after them with tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cuts very poorly.  </li>
            <li> If you like the feeling of hair being violently ripped from your nostrils by a dull rotating blade, this is the device for you.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be painful and irritating, and I bled when I tried to get too close.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers: please spare me the disgusting comments about your cleaning rituals.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid that if I once accidentally dropped the thing on bathroom floor or countertop, that would be the end of it.</li>
            <li> But it pulls and snags like crazy.  </li>
            <li> Unlike scissors, there is no risk of cutting or poking the tender lining of your nose while trimming.</li>
            <li> and you can hear when it&#x27;s cutting.  </li>
            <li> Also, when it did work it was very uncomfortable as it often pulled rather than cut hairs.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted to add that it is almost impossible to screw up with this model.</li>
            <li> I never thought Panasonic will make a product which will hurt so badly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li> AA baterry life is are not so bad either.</li>
            <li> The motor is failing badly.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t THAT bad.</li>
            <li> In those areas, it pulls the hair and is quite painful.  </li>
            <li> It has the tendency to grab the hairs as the blades spin, pulling them painfully.</li>
            <li> Are you sick of seeing dad with bushes growing out of his ears and nose?</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this item.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> Con&#x27;s :(the reasons you want a nose trimmer are not solved.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this item.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed and cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I replaced it with one from The Sharper Image and had to return it because it pulled the hair instead of cutting it and was very painful.</li>
            <li> I hate it, but I can&#x27;t try all of them.</li>
            <li> If you have those annoying tufts of hair in there, this will do the trick in seconds.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER411NC Nose and Hair Groomer works just as advertised -- it painlessly clips annoying nose and ear hair.  </li>
            <li> The newer model just ignores my annoying ear hair.</li>
            <li> It pulls hairs badly!</li>
            <li> This device does an acceptable job of trimming nose and ear hairs, but at a price:  it is downright painful!  </li>
            <li> gives a very painful experience</li>
            <li> This was very painful when a nose hair is caught in the trimmer</li>
            <li> It was very painful when used in both my nose and ears.  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the Groomer.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I tried another brand and it was worthless!  </li>
            <li> Terrible.  </li>
            <li> Bought this after reading up reviews for a week(Dont want to bloody up my nose after all!)</li>
            <li> is terrible</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disgusting!  </li>
            <li> but now it just makes an awful racket when I can get it to work.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the product!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my second 411 trimmer purchased.  The first was at Target about 3 years ago - I dropped it in the sink and it could not be repaired.  I tried another brand and it was worthless!  It was hard to find this trimmer anywhere and Amazon had the only reputable source.  It was sent in &#x27;shrinkwrap&#x27; only with the printed instructions.  It seemed odd it was not in original packageing but has every appearance of being new and, in fact, runs even better than the last one that seemed to go through batteries much faster...  It arrived about a week later than promised, but I still could use the other unit (somewhat) - Otherwise I would have had to pay for the express shipping</li>
            <li> This worked great when new, but performance dropped off significantly.  Would not recommend.  Would get manual {not powered} mechanical replacement.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on the testimonials of the other reviewers for this product. I have not been disappointed and feel that these reviews indicating an excellent product are right on the money! This trimmer is easy to use, discreet, and fast. Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he abslutely loves it.  He says it&#x27;s very easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t pinch or rip out the hairs like other products he has tried.</li>
            <li> This fell on the floor as I was taking it out of the box, fell totally apart, and despite all sorts of effort on my part to put it back together, it doesn&#x27;t work very well.  Maybe it is my fault and I am butterfingers, but something should not break that easily, especially if it is something that is made to be used around hard floors, i.e. the bathroom.</li>
            <li> it seems to work but the blade is plastic and steel combination (i.e. not 100 steel blade).  it does some pulling but works okay. I was hoping to find a groomer that doesn&#x27;t pull nose hair at all...</li>
            <li> Everyone has an Uncle Walter. Great sense of humor, helps you fix things, wears Aqua-Velva.  You just love him to death, but he&#x27;s got twigs growing out of his nose, and more hair IN his ears than around them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, now you can help get that fella on the road to suave.  Get him a Panasonic brand Nose and Ear Hair Groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, I too had that problem.  To solve it I tried the small, blunt scissors--Nope, too many nosebleeds. I even tried that German Spring Clamp thing--imagine an Epilady for your nose, yanking the hairs out by the roots!  In desperation I nabbed a Panasonic. And I am VERY pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful Hint:  Always use a battery with some juice left in it. If you use a tired, half-drained one, the blades grind slower and the result is more like the Epilady thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is also very easy to clean.  It has a nose-friendly design, works well to trim that Uni-brow and it evens out your mustache very  nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may cost a few more bucks than those &#x27;designer&#x27; groomers you see around, but in the long run you&#x27;ll be happy with a well-designed tool that does the job well.</li>
            <li> My Sasquatch-like nostrils were becoming unmanageable.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;The unsightly nose hairs were so long they would sometimes get tangled, causing me extreme, eye-watering pain.  During cold and flu season, it was not uncommon for me to get some &amp;quot;leftovers&amp;quot; stuck in my nose.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;I needed something that could tame the beast that resided inside my nose.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;I needed something that could cut through dense foliage, and not look back.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Who was up for the challenge?  Not many.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;I tried a number of different grooming tools, but none of them achieved the level of trimming that I desired.  The &amp;quot;pretender groomers&amp;quot; (as I like to call them) would either yank out the hairs at an excruciatingly slow pace, or I would be left with stubble inside my nose.  The ladies might like the &amp;quot;George Michael&amp;quot; 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, but nobody likes a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow in your nostrils.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;After many failed attempts, I was convinced that there wasn&#x27;t a tool available that could handle my rigorous grooming demands.  I was ready to give up and resort to using my blunt, miniature scissors for the rest of my life.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;And then I discovered the Panasonic Nose and Ear Hair Groomer.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;This remarkable piece of equipment mows down everything in its path.  No pain, minimal motor noise (for those seeking a discrete trim), and it works equally well in wet or dry conditions.  So, worry not Seattle natives!&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;The one AA battery usually doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me to complete my grooming ritual, but the 90-minute battery life should be more than sufficient for the rest of you.  With an ergonomically designed stainless-steel blade that retains its sharpness, the Panasonic Nose and Ear Hair Groomer is the first and last personal groomer you will ever need.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;However, I&#x27;m slightly disturbed by Amazon&#x27;s option to buy it used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any nose/ear hair trimming products before (other than cuticle scissors and yanking) but I&#x27;d been looking for something and this unit got good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I just received it 2 days ago but am VERY impressed with it.  I obviously don&#x27;t have much to compare with but this unit did everything I&#x27;d hoped it would (and could reasonably expect from it).&lt;br /&gt;You do still end up with very short stubble in your nose but this is certainly within the realm of what I expected.  The unit is not very loud so I experienced no discomfort around my ear.&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive, well designed, effective... what more could you want?  Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I have to say that the Panasonic ER411 performed rather well for approximately 18 months. Considering I used the trimmer approximately once per month, I am not entirely sure I would recommend this product.    Pros: effective at trimming nose and ear hair with comparatively little \\&quot;tugging\\&quot; although it did bring me to the point of tears a couple of times.    Cons: Simply did not last very long. After 2-3 very careful cleanings, the flimsy cutting mechanism fell apart.</li>
            <li> This thing really hurts. Not a pleasent experience at all. Broke after the first few days. Save your money.</li>
            <li> ...and I have the pain threshold of the princess from the princess and the pea story, these devices should be designed with me in mind.&lt;br /&gt;  When brand new this thing worked like gangbusters, however the razor sharp blades dulled quickly leaving me crying like a baby.&lt;br /&gt;  Perhaps if the hair that sprouts from your nose is fine this tool will suffice, I&#x27;m still searching for the groomer that will be gentle to me yet viciously mow down stray hairs.</li>
            <li> I have had a previous model panasonic trimmer, but it gave up the ghost and I had to replace it.  So I went with another Panasonic.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My old Panasonic didn&#x27;t hurt.  Its blades were configured to hit the hairs at a more right angle, cutting cleanly and quickly.  Hairs could only enter the cutting zone of the head on the SIDES of the cutter, not on the tip. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This (reviewed) unit allows hairs to enter the END of the cutter, where they are TWISTED out of your skin.  It hurts like crazy - and I&#x27;m highly pain tolerant.  I think they must have done it to make the tip smaller.  But it&#x27;s a totally ineffective compromise.  It made my eyes water and started an insane sneezing fit.  Entertaining for my wife, yes, but this thing is no good.  Not even worth returning - this is hitting the trash can.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER411NC Nose and Ear Hair Groomer is a great, easy to use tool, at an incredibly affordable price.  A pleasure to use.  It really takes the sting out of a sensitive job.  Get one!</li>
            <li> Have you ever droped your razor in the sink while saving? Well thats what happened with this nose groomer the very first time I used it. The tip bent and is now unuseable. In my opinion it&#x27; not up to standards.Save your money don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> The Nose and Ear Hair Groomer that I purchased has a tendency to occasionaly pull on a hair before it cuts it off. All other features are great.</li>
            <li> We first tried the ER4211C, the one with the light.  It was designed so as to not cut the hairs too short, and we found it did not cut well at all.  The light was also pretty useless.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then we got this one.  Excellent product.  Good cutting, easy to hold, just overall excellent!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any experience with other groomers and relied on reviews from other people at this site.  I selected the Panasonic ER411NC because of those reviews.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product.....no complaints.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, I was a little worried about this product, but it works very well.  smooth and quick clipping with no pulling or pain whatsoever.</li>
            <li> My ER411 just died.   It lasted about 2 years.   Not bad I suppose as it doesn&#x27;t cost much.   It remained sharp and worked pretty good until the end when it just wouldn&#x27;t start anymore.   I&#x27;m going to try the ER421 now as that seems to be a newer model and it has a light on it.</li>
            <li> This product used to be excellent, except for short blade life. In my experience, the blade would go bad before the first battery had to be replaced. However it would trim small hairs from the nose and ears very well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Panasonic has changed the blade design from an &#x27;L&#x27; shaped blade, which would trim hair entering from the top as well as the sides, to an &#x27;I&#x27; shaped blade, which only cuts hair entering from the sides. This has changed the trimmer into a lousy product. It now does a poor job of trimming hair from the nose, or ears, or anywhere else.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Panasonic probably made the change so that the blade will last longer.  Of course it will, because now it doesn&#x27;t trim anything. There is absolutely nothing on the package to let you know you are buying the redesigned product. Stay away from this product and buy from another manufacturer.</li>
            <li> THIS TYPE OF NOSE TRIMMER IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. PANASONIC USE TO MAKE ONE FOR BROOKSTONE AND IT CUT MUCH CLOSER . BUT NOW BROOKSTONE IS HAVING ONE MADE FOR THEM JUST LIKE THIS PIECE OF JUNK.  OPEN IT UP AND IF THE CUTTING BLADES ARE STRAIGHT UP, IT&#x27;S NO GOOD. LOOK FOR THE ONE THAT HAS BLADES AT A 90 DEGREE ANGLE AND YOU HAVE THE GOOD ONE.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using a small pair of scissors for years to cut his nasal and ear hair and always worried that he would gouge a hole in his nose especially from a sharp move--after using the groomer one time, he is soooooooooooooo happy I bought it--he is very comfortable with it and sees nothing but a wonderful grooming experience with it! Highly recommend this groomer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Then I dropped it once.&lt;br /&gt;From about 4 feet.&lt;br /&gt;Never worked again.&lt;br /&gt;Once, people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic, here&#x27;s a thought - how about a base cradle or at least a flat bottom so that when you attempt to stand it up it has a bit more of a chance  against the laws of physics?</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son.  His wife noticed the difference it made.</li>
            <li> What a great little tool for getting rid of unwanted hair, My ears were a problem and this did the job and I had no discomfort and super easy to clean. If you need to buy one, this is a good one. Hope it last as long time.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for nose hair. Ive had nose hair since i was 15 and never really found a product that got rid of all of them. this one does without nicks or any bleeding. It also works in my ears.     Jim Clarey  Hoboken, NJ</li>
            <li> You get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I got so tired of getting nicked and cut with my old one (and it still didn&#x27;t do the job effectively) that I thought I would try this one. What a gem!!! Simple to use and works great. Gets rid of that unsightly noae and ear hair in a few minutes with no nicks, cuts, scrapes! Would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> A GREAT LITTLE RAZOR! Comfortable to hold, easy to use, quiet and does a great job trimming those hairs you just don&#x27;t want people to see.  Painless, bloodless, and quick.  Twice the price of the comparable Remington but worth the difference.  A real keeper, too bad they didn&#x27;t come out with this razor a lot sooner.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift and have been very happy with it. It actually does exactly what it is supposed to do, and very well.&lt;br /&gt;The AA battery supplied works for an hour or so. It may be better to use a rechargeable AA battery. The trimmer is well made, but is made of plastic;so, if you drop it....probably broken. I&#x27;ve had mine for 6 months and it is a joy to use. I also enjoy hearing the thing cut those ear and nose hairs;sort of like the sound of a electric bug zapper.I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> You know you are getting old when you get excited about how well a Nose and Ear hair trimmer works... but nonetheless... this one works great. Does the job.</li>
            <li> Okay, when the hair on his ears was longer than on his head, I knew it was time to do something... and THIS IS IT.... WORKS GREAT AND HE LOVES IT!!</li>
            <li> This truly is the MACH 3 of nose trimmers, worked great for those hard to reach hairs, worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> The reviews seemed good, but I&#x27;ve found that the unit really hurts!  Yowch!  It pulls as it cuts, and stings like heck.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it&#x27;s defective, bad blade, or somesuch - visual inspection seems okay, but this is certainly NOT the way it&#x27;s designed to work.</li>
            <li> But it does pull your nose hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy the groomer after I have read so many positive reviews about it on amazon.  The groomer works and trims the hairs fairly short.  However, from the first time I tried it it hurt and tickled at the same time.  That is the strangest sensation.  The groomer pulls hair often... very often... continuously... The combination of pulling hair and tickling makes your eyes water.  My old scisors were sharper and I had to be more careful with them, but at least they don&#x27;t pull my nose hair.</li>
            <li> it still hurt you when you try to cut your nose&#x27;s hair. not like the description says.</li>
            <li> Finally, a personal groomer that works.  I have bought (and subsequently returned) 5 personal groomers; this is the only one which performed as advertised.  Thanks Panasonic!  My wife and my nose thank you!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I buy this online because I&#x27;m too embarrassed to admit I have a massive hedge-like formation that has cropped up on the inside rim of my nostrils and I don&#x27;t want to go into a store and let some 16 year old babe in low rise jeans see me buy it. I get it home, take it out of the box and put it to work. Side A (the left) goes reasonably smoothly though there is this wierd aroma of frying hair as I pump the thing in and out of my nostril. I switch to side B and it really seems to go haywire flaying open the skin and tugging the hairs out so viciously that I got tears running down my face. I stumble out of the bathroom and my woman sees me bleeding crying and looking all confused and she says &#x27;youre on coke again aren&#x27;t you?&#x27; So I&#x27;m like &#x27;no!&#x27; but I cant stop screwing my face up because the hair that got pulled out tweaked something in my face and it just stings so much. Anyway, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I brought it for myself due to it was under the gold box sale, and the prior grooming object was barbaric and  hurt from pulling the nasal hair. This doesn&#x27;t pull the hair. It cuts the hair no pain involved at all I was so impressed with it. I bought 2 more for family members. it is awesome and only one battery and it can be immerse in water. Now I look forward to my hair growing :) and knowing I will look my best</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even THINK of using this for anything but the stated purpose.  I&#x27;ve yet to see anything on the market for my particular affliction: dingleberries (no, not the unfortunately named Christmas cookie.) Despite my guyish partiality to gadgets, I&#x27;d recommend a simple bikini waxing kit until the free market recognizes this great need. If you&#x27;ve already similarly misused the ER411NC, try Band-Aid Liquid Bandage Skin Crack Gel.  Traditional strip bandages just don&#x27;t work up there.</li>
            <li> This kind of grooming item is not used very often. When I went to use it the third time, it would not work. I tried changing the battery, but the problem is with the unit itself. It&#x27;s never been dropped -- it just stopped working. I am attempting to get Amazon to intervene and replace the unit. I&#x27;ll let you know what happens...</li>
            <li> It did not trim the hair but pull the hair out...  It is a good accompaniment if you are on the highway for a long long trip...  When you are sleepy, just trun it on and pull your nose hair...  Better than any refreshing stuffs!!!</li>
            <li> If you notice hairs sticking out of your ears or nose it is very frustrating to go after them with tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No worries this is a wonderful appliance to trim those unsightly hairs away. A must for everyone who shares this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t worry it has a \\&quot;protective safety cone\\&quot; that protects the skin and keeps you from pinching the heck out of yourself. So you can feel free to go after those hairs with out worries. It uses one AA battery (not included).</li>
            <li> I purchased this one, because I at first think it might help me to remove several of my long nose hair, which is unpleasant. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But once I use it, i found problems emerging. Since it is disturbing the natural condition of our nose inside by cutting those long hair as well as Those Normal Hair, my nose feel so uncomfortable after the hair is cut. And you will fell itchy as the hair is growing.It even gives me hard breathing some time, which i have never experience before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the other side, frankly speaking, this device works well, if you really need it and your long nose hair really annoys you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Therefore, if you are not really need it, pls do not buy it just because it is interesting. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right, ouch. I&#x27;m surprised other reviews haven&#x27;t said this thing friggin hurts to use.  A few point to keep in mind; I have used a nose trimmer before w/ no problems (chrome Remington model). By \\&quot;hurt\\&quot; I mean it doesn&#x27;t feel good, not \\&quot;I&#x27;m a puss\\&quot;. Lastly, I have nose whiskers not just nose hair, this matters. Just like shaving your teenage peach fuzz was no hassle compared to knocking down the man beard.  This trimmer pulled out some hair and kind of ground down the rest.  I think it would do a better job cutting finer hair... not the 20 gage wire I&#x27;m growing. Overall this product gets the job done but I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product does everything I wanted and does it easily and for a very good price.  It is also not a cheaply made product.</li>
            <li> When I first got the unit it worked fine.  I noticed after the about three uses it&#x27;s motor was slowing down.  I replaced the battery but it did not help.  I used it 8 times in a year and it&#x27;s motor is all ready dead.  I would not purchase another Panasonic unit being afraid it would all so die a quick death.  Spend more money on a unit that will last longer.</li>
            <li> I tried manual clippers in the past but found they had sharp edges and were too big for my smallish nostrils anyway. Instead, I used cuticle scissors for nose and ear trims. When I stumbled over the battery operated Panasonic ER411 I decided to give it a try. That was last month. I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and it&#x27;s terrific. The cutting head is smaller than I expected and fits comfortably in nostrils and ears. And with no sharp edges exposed it&#x27;s easy and pleasant to use. Great tool.</li>
            <li> I never thought Panasonic will make a product which will hurt so badly. The one I got is really useless because it plugs the hair often.</li>
            <li> This is really great trimmer for such money, highly recomended for everyone who uses frequently trimmers. I have tried first other brands, much expensief but this is really much better and cost much less. about $ 15 plus free shipping. Only one thing is where you have to be carrefully. Don&#x27;t let it fall down with metal side, otherwise should buy new one. (own experience.)</li>
            <li> What can be said? It does what it advertises quickly and effortlessly with no pulling/pinching or any problems. It&#x27;s inexpensive and convenient. I have yet to replace the batteries as well.</li>
            <li> Great product, works better than advertised. In fact, I liked the first one so much, I purchased a 2nd groomer to put in my travel bag. Great performance for the price. Buying from Amazon was very easy also.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer after owning a Wahl trimmer for 4 years, and what a mistake that was.  I only used it three times and it broke after four months.  It was also uncomfortable to use because it really pulled at the hairs.  Do yourself a favor and look at other brands.  I just ordered the following: WAHL Wet/Dry Trimmer for Nose, Ears &amp; Eyebrows (Model:5560-700).  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before buying one of these to replace an older Panasonic model that I liked. Quite a few reviewers reported this model pulls on the hair.  I didn&#x27;t know if they just had sensitive nostrils so I thought it worth a try. Well, I&#x27;m sorry I did as mine gives a very painful experience and I&#x27;m not an experienced hair trimmer user.  And other models don&#x27;t have any better reviews, including the one that worked well for me before it died. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think the reason for the mixed reviews is a good number of these units come right from the factory with poor cutting blades, hence some love it and some winch over it. In hind sight I should have returned it but at the time it didn&#x27;t occur to me this type of health and beauty items could be returned. The unit is reasonable well-made so I give it two stars, for performance alone I would it it none as I haven&#x27;t found any use for it. If I had the box it came in I&#x27;d wrap it up and give it to my worse enemy LOL.</li>
            <li> Especially good job on my ear hair.  Tugs slightly on nose hairs at first use.  Use it every couple days and no more tugging.  Nice, balanced feel in my hand.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these now. The first one, I dropped and broke it, but it had been going strong for over 2 years. I use it in the shower, it&#x27;s completely waterproof and very effective and comfortable to use. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This little groomer is the ticket. Light, compact, simple and works. Period.</li>
            <li> This product saved my Father&#x27;s nose and ears.  I used baby scissors before the purchase of the trimmer.    My father almost had a piereced nose so this product saved his life snd nose.  He is 85 years old and I have to do everything-so thank you.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0002D5Y92 Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer, Wet/Dry, Lighted]]   Broken when I got it and a rep from Panasonic said they would send me an address label to return it but I have never heard from them .  Will not buy any of their products unless this is resolved.</li>
            <li> I have nothing but the highest regard for this trimmer.  It does a great job.  I was worried after reading the reviews about it pulling hair, however I did not experience any pain, it is smooth and effective.  Easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> would have given it a better rating but it broke after 2 times!&lt;BR&gt;company is supposed to send me another one.</li>
            <li> Like most of the other reviewers, I&#x27;m very happy with mine too.  I just wanted to add that it is almost impossible to screw up with this model. The blade is well positioned and protected enough that, excuse my French, you pretty much can just stick it in your ear or nose, twirl a bit, and presto!  The only exception to this IMHO is cutting nose hairs so short that my nose feels &#x27;raw&#x27; for a bit....so just don&#x27;t...stick...it...in....so....far.  :-)</li>
            <li> I like this unit because I can use it in the shower, with my shower mirror.  I once bought the Panasonic Dry trimmer by accident, and did not like it near as much.</li>
            <li> initially It was painfull to use. If you are not carefull, it will nick and pull hair. takes some time to get used to. It does a good job of cutting hair though. &lt;BR&gt;Also mine quit working after 3 months.  I am a big fan of panasonic but not this product.</li>
            <li> this trimmer IS the best nose hair trimmer I have used by far. Be warned however- if you&#x27;ve never used a good one it will take getting used to. It is occasionally painful- not REALLY bad at all but you will notice it for sure if it grabs a hair the wrong way. I was very surprised to not see others talk about this in their reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Alas, mine was dropped on CARPET and died on me. Take VERY good care of it as it is obviously fragile and the length of life is questionable even if you do take care of it. I am purchasing another as it is so good, but Panny would do well to make it cut a little easier and absorb the inevitable drop.</li>
            <li> We must have extremely sensitive schnozzes in Ohio!!  The product does seem to work just fine - but the TICKLING!!  AH-CHOO!!  &lt;br /&gt;Maybe its just something we have to get used to??  Would highly recommend, however!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a male and over 35, its probably time to buy one of these.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used mine for about three weeks and it works great.  It&#x27;s quiet, it does what it says, and it seems like a good value.</li>
            <li> This one really works. Has sharp blades and doesn&#x27;t pull out hairs. Does your ears wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t get hot. Have been using it since Christmas morning and love it. Will buy another when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> I have owned mine for about a year. Still works great. I just bought one for my Dad (on my Mom&#x27;s request...)&lt;br /&gt;Does the job simply and easily. The single battery lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> At first this worked great, but after a few months the RPMs went way down, and I don&#x27;t know how to make it run properly anymore.  (Changing batteries and cleaning it don&#x27;t help much.)  When it&#x27;s spinning slowly, it pinches and doesn&#x27;t do a very good job.</li>
            <li> This little beauty does a great job on all my excess fur.  It&#x27;s kind of gross to stick this up your nose, but it really does a fine job.  The biggest problem I have is the sensation of getting my nose hair trimmed makes me sneeze.  Oh well, it&#x27;s worth it to be neatly groomed!</li>
            <li> Buy it for yourself. It&#x27;s less than $15, and *well* worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I found this trimer to be exactly what it is advertised to be. The cutting is clean and complete. No pulling, good speed and power, battery life is good, shape and size is ideal.</li>
            <li> Unless you learn to clean properly this product will not last.</li>
            <li> takes just one battery, cuts clean and quiet, does not pull or pinch. very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband originally. He complained that it was uncomfortable to use, It works fine for me...a bit discomfort, but not too bad....ah the price of beauty!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband last Xmas and it worked well until last month and the motor died. This year I am going to buy him about brand.</li>
            <li> This unit works like a champ, but drop it once and it&#x27;s stone cold dead. I&#x27;m on my third one. But they&#x27;re relatively inexpensive, so one can almost think of them as disposable.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had bought a low quality grommer from a different manufacturer a couple of months back and suffered from it - it would take me atleast 10 mins of grinding around my nostrils to remove all the hair follicles and even after that, I could still feel some hair inside - which I hate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Disappointed with my earlier experience, I took my chance with this one - there are some negative reviews and some strong positive reviews. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With this one, I am pretty happy with the way it performs - just 2-3 mins and I have a clean feeling in my nostrils and ears. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some of the negative reviews and my comments on it &lt;br /&gt;* Too painful and yanks off sensitive hair - yes it does pain - but very very little.  If you want zero pain, somebody needs to design a microprecision tool for this and would cost you nothing less than a grand. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* Too irritating - Yes, it is not a comfortable feeling to get something moving at high speed inside your nose and ears, it is just a matter of getting used to &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* Breaks after a few months/malfunctioning - Well, I have some doubts here, if you guys have been immersing the whole thing into soap water and cleaning it.  It is an electrical equipment and does needs some due care.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the other side, these are low margin, low volume business for these companies and I would&#x27;nt be surprised if they put low quality parts into manufacturing this. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pretty satisfied this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Within the first week the blade got weak and it would pull the hair before cutting it. OUCH! OUCH! OUCH! Then it would frequently stop spinning.  This was very painful when a nose hair is caught in the trimmer and you have to pull it out. OUCH! OUCH! OUCH!  Basically I read all the good reviews and thought maybe I just got a defective one, so I was dumb enough to get it again.  Exact same experience.  Either I have an abundance of thick nose hairs or this is a crappy product.  It might very well be a combination of the two.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Honestly, every Panasonic product I&#x27;ve owned has broken down on me before a resonable time.  I opted to splurge and get a \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot; nose hair trimmer from Sharper Image, and am quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is great in that it has no trouble with mowing down any bush you might have in your nose.  It does however, pull on the hair occaisonally which can be a bit upleasant.</li>
            <li> It worked fine for a year.  Then I dropped it onto a rug in the bathroom.  Not on the floor, a rug.  It immediately quit working.  Busted.</li>
            <li> Well i bought this on december 2005, i used only 4 months, after that i dropped it and the blades went bad, not broken but they are not aligned anymore. I tried to fix it 3 times and i couldnt, but today i said that if i dont fix it i trash it, and finally i could fix it, its working again. But anyways, this grooming hurts a lot on the nose, and it eats a lot of batteries. I dont recomend it</li>
            <li> The sale and delivery went as advertized, I will use this seller again</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this item. My husband has been using Panasonic ER411 for the last five years and it was a very good product. That&#x27;s why I bought this ER411NC for him. But ER411NC is not up to its expectations.  If you can find an ER411 anywhere, BUY IT!  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for - there should be some in a warehouse somewhere!</li>
            <li> First one broke in less than a year. Same for the second and third. I give up. Don&#x27;t buy.    Edit: Tried the Wahl wet/dry. I sucked arse in a big way. Didn&#x27;t trim close at all. Completely useless. I&#x27;m going to buy this one again, because it does work well. It&#x27;s noisy, and will break within 6 months, but it does the job. Actually, I&#x27;ll buy two. I hate it, but I can&#x27;t try all of them.</li>
            <li> I had a similar product from Panasonic that had a lot of power and cut really great. It gave out so I purchased this model and I don&#x27;t like it at all. With new batteries, there is very low speed and the cutters don&#x27;t do an adequate job in cutting. I am very disappointed in the Groomer. I would recommending that you purchase this groomer locally so you can return it to the store and get your money back or try a different one. Maybe I just got a poor quality product.</li>
            <li> The ER411 is very good at nose/ear trimming...the best I have used... Highly recommended but...Today I have to replace my two year old unit because the little plastic rim that holds the trimmer head snapped off! I will be VERY GENTLE with the new one as Panasonic apparently uses el cheapo plastic in their product (or whoever makes it under their brand name).</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and clean.  It removes unsightly nose hairs without pulling.  Works well for the price paid.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of these for gifts and myself and they work great.  Easy to clean.  You have to be careful taking them apart, but it is not too hard.  The ones I got were \\&quot;National\\&quot; brand, the Japanese brand of Panasonic.  Same product.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  Cuts very poorly.  The older units (with a split head) worked well.  This version doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The decision to purchase this product was based on the old theory, \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;.  Not true here!  This being the most expensive nose and ear hair groomer offered on most sites, I assumed it was the best!  On the contrary.  It was very painful when used in both my nose and ears.  The rotary tip literally grabs the hair and pulls it from its location.  Ouch!!  My advise...go with the $20.00 model!</li>
            <li> I never thought I had a need for a hair trimmer of any sort.. I&#x27;ve never seen hair in my ears and I have a full mustache that blends in right up to my nostrils.. However, after shaving my mustache off, I noticed my nose hair was a little longer than I&#x27;d expect..&lt;br /&gt;I read the review for this product on Amazon and wondered how so many customers could speak so highly of a nose hair trimmer.. That was until I received mine today and put a single AA battery into it, turned it on and began to use it in less than two minutes from its arrival..&lt;br /&gt;This has to be the most effective means of getting rid of your unwanted nose/ear hair that&#x27;s actually fun, safe and semi-enjoyable (for the tickling effect)..&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re hairs are going astray and if you&#x27;re having a bit more of a difficult time breathing than normal, try this product out.. You will NOT be dissatisfied..</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, when you get older, you get hairier. Are you sick of seeing dad with bushes growing out of his ears and nose? You bet you are. Sure, he will grimace when he opens it up, but he&#x27;ll be on his way from crusty-gross nose to Queer-Eye Approved nasty-hair-free guy in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quite easy to use, and it does its job. Feels a little bit weird the first few times, and remember you have to wipe down afterwards (otherwise little hair dust will be coming out all day!).&lt;br /&gt;Takes one AA battery, which lasts for a month or so or regular use, unless, of course, you grow hair at truly prodigious rates.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product and felt compelled to write about it.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found it to be very well made.  Yes, if you drop it, it will probably break...but what won&#x27;t?  Even though it is made of plastic, it appears to be very durable plastic.  Some reviewers made it seem as if you look at this product wrong, it will crumble right before your eyes.  Not so.  Also, while I did notice that it pulled out a few hairs here and there, causing some slight discomfort, overall it worked MUCH better than I expected.  The slight discomfort felt by a pulled out hair or two is well worth it.  The end result is absolutely amazing.  I have never used a device made especially for nose and ear hair removal, I have always used scissors or tweezers, which cause immense pain and can be dangerous.  I would recommend this product 100% over other methods.  The one drawback is how loud it is.  It&#x27;s a little too loud when putting it in your ear.  I would like to see Panasonic maybe insulate it a little better.  I would be willing to pay extra for that feature.  But overall, I give it five stars and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants CLEAN AND NEAT nostrils and ears!  A terrific product!</li>
            <li> I used it once or twice and then it just gave up the ghost, and stopped working completely.  For $17 I&#x27;m not going to spend a lot of time trying to get it fixed or replaced, but I did see other reviews that talked of fast failures.  Annoying and a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I hate getting old.  The hair on my head is shedding like a St. Bernard drools, but the hair in my nose and ears grows faster than unwanted weeds in my garden.  I have tried scissors, tweezers, and my razor all with varying degrees of success, blood and pain.  This invention has solved all my problems.  I no longer look like a scarecrow with straw coming out of my nose and ears.  I no longer cut myself, and I don&#x27;t bleed all over the place.  This item works without pain, and is fast and easy to use.  Highly reccomended.</li>
            <li> This thing worked fine when I first got it.  However, it quit working when I dropped it in the sink once.  The drop wasn&#x27;t more than a couple of feet from the medicine cabinet into the sink (and WITH the cover on), but much to my surprise, the darn thing just stopped working completely.  It&#x27;s too bad since I did like it while it worked.  Like another reviewer said, for the price I paid, it&#x27;s not worth the hassle of returning it or trying to fix it.  In fact, I did already spend some time trying to see what went wrong, but it&#x27;s still messed up.  I would stay away from it, or at least, drop test it a couple of times before you decide to keep it.</li>
            <li> I am the kind of guy who researches a lot before buying anything, and since I needed a trimmer for the first time, started reading up some reviews. This one had the absolute best reviews, and the price was great too! Bought this after reading up reviews for a week(Dont want to bloody up my nose after all!) and its a really good product. Cuts the hair close, doesnt cut anything else:d..The nose feels raw after using this, which I guess means its doing a good job of cutting the hair. You need to clean up your nose after a trim(the cut hair tends to stick inside) but thats a minor irritant. Does its job well, and for the price, its a great product! Looks like I need to get a Panasonic Shaver too now.</li>
            <li> i bought this flimsy tool and it just stopped working after about 8 uses.  The price is so cheap that i guess this should be listed as a disposable groomer, hehe.</li>
            <li> So I finally get the message after watching \\&quot;queer eye\\&quot; and so I start checking these things out. I read all the reviews of these things that I could find and this one ranked high in the majority of reviews. And Man, this is cheap and does the job. No pain from hairs being pulled out yet. (Maybe these things require a gentle touch.) I have several Panasonic products and this rates up there with the rest. Works great. Had it for 4 weeks and no problems. I even put a half used battery in it. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, men of a certain age start to find the need for regular mowing of bits of our faces that previously needed none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is the prospect of sticking conventional trimming devices up ones nose or down ones ears, ranks anywhere between terrifying and psychotic! Scissors up the nose? no way and the prospect of tweezing, jeeeeesh!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found this, a buzzy little friend with a delicate head and no visible blades nor any which could harm skin but get them near tufty and furry facial cavities and they are back to their hairless days in no time. With this I can trim in minutes and no longer have to fear looking like a scarry guy who is going mouldy. One tip I would offer, after trimming your nose hairs thoroughly, blow your nose well to do what your barber does with the old neck brush!</li>
            <li> I had paid quite a lot of money a number of years back for a Sharper Image nose hair trimmer. It worked very well for all these years. A replacement was required and one for that particular trimmer was not available. So I did my research and figured the panasonic 411NC should be a good one. Well it wasn&#x27;t good.......It was GREAT! Trims very close, the way I like it, and is very easy to use and clean. This is, by far, the best trimmer I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> I purchaed this trimmer to replace the old one that I dropped on it&#x27;s tip. The original was excellent except that it was not drop resistant.  The original never snagged and pulled and I was extremely fearful of the possibilty and was generally apprehensive with each use.  When I dropped it and damaged the blade cone I new I would try to buy an exact replacement as this one had never \\&quot;bitten\\&quot; me.  But when I tried to find a replacement there were of course multiple models to chose from.  I picked the most expensive model(still around only twenty dollars) as it looked the most similar to the original and with the inside of my nose I won&#x27;t skimp on price. If I could find one that cost $50 that I could be sure wouldn&#x27;t cut me or yank out those hairs I would have bought that one.  I had read some discouraging reviews about this model being a torture device but was stuck with trying it, as it was a Panasonic similar to my fine working original.  I found that although this replacement is not as good as the original, a break-in period may prove to correct the problem of pulling.  I believe that they have probably found a cheaper method of manufacture that leaves the blade and shearing edge of the cone less refined than the original, but hopefully will wear-in to provide a snag free instrument. The only other concern, as with the original, is that of dropping it on it&#x27;s tip. If you do, it will be instant junk, and you will be in the market for a replacement and the possibly painful break-in period. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> i use this for my nose hair. its great. it takes 1 AA battery. just stick it one of your nostrils and go to town. u can press it up against your nose, but dont push it too hard. youll feel a little tickle. doesnt hurt at all. its just doing its job. its great! i love it! wont take more than a minute or 2. but now i can breathe smooth and freely! sweet.</li>
            <li> It works well but as soon as you take it apart to clean it is nearly impossable to get it back together and working as well as it was out of the box.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  I have had another and it pulled the hair.  This one does not.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on the Amazon.com reviews.  I, like most men, have hair growing in my ears and nose that tend to be a pain to groom.  I have nipped my ears a number of times when trying to cut wild hairs with scissors.  The same with my nose. I like to present a neat appearance and that is hard to do with stray hairs growing where they shouldn&#x27;t be.  Plucking is effective but can hurt quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Panasonic groomer, it&#x27;s a breeze.  No nicks and it is quick and easy to do both my ears and nose.  It is easy to clean afterwards as well.  Now I just spend 5 minutes with the groomer every 3 or 4 weeks and no more wild hair problems. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Panasonic is a great brand. When I purchased the nose hair groomer I was a 100% sure this was my best option based on my experience with panasonic products. However it was not. The groomer yanks the nose hair and the pain is terrible I even cried wow.</li>
            <li> This gadget never had much power, pulled at my admittedly jungle-like nose hairs painfully, and quit for good after a year.  Next!</li>
            <li> I keep buying this item over and over because it&#x27;s cheap. However, it always breaks after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 of these, (1) a couple of years ago, (2) and (3) this last August, 2006.  &lt;br /&gt;The last two were purchased because of the performance of (1). As of now, all 3 have failed because of a poor switch, which chooses to fail in the OFF position. This is all after testing with new batteries. The battery connection seems secure. All else works well when it works.  The switches are the Achilles heel. $45.00 is enough of a test. I am going to try something else.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer for a X-Mas gift for my husband, he has an old trimmer he had used for years, so I thought a new good one for x-mas, I read alll the reviews and bought this one, well he says it works ok but it pulls hairs, this is a nose,ears trimmer,but he says it feels more like a type of torture device. His old one is still in use and I just wasted the money for this one. The old one is a Remington nedh-2500</li>
            <li> Wow I just noticed there are 259 reviews for a $14 nose hair trimmer.  Some of which are lengthy.  I ordered this recently so I better submit review #260. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It cuts my nose hair and it does not hurt.  I feel sexier after trimming my nose hair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done with an occasional pinch. Best I&#x27;ve found to date.</li>
            <li> Good cutting speed so no pulling.  Cuts fairly close to the skin - a good thing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Works great.</li>
            <li> My husband asbolutely loves this product. I cringed everytime I saw him go at his ears and nose with an itty bitty pair of sharp scissors, so he tried this and really loves it. would recommend it highly. A good deal for the money!!!</li>
            <li> This little gem of a self torture device serves quite well in ripping out hairs by the root. The so called blades inside the head do not cut but instead the wind up your hairs and rip them out at the root. The amount of blood flow I experienced far out did any of my less than sober attempts using scissors. So if you enjoy that excruciating pain of shredding the inside of your nose, please buy this device.</li>
            <li> Many of the reviews here 2 years and older refer to an earlier verison of this model.     Panasonic is now using a less powerful motor and apparently changed the blade design as well. I used to think this was a superior trimmer. Now, it is on par with all the others.     I purchased this product about 2 years ago based on all the positive reviews, and I loved it. I will admit it that the only drwaback was that it would very slightly pull hairs if they were too long, but that could be avoided with routine use.     My kids recently broke mine. Without hesitation, I reordered from Amazon. I was shocked to discover this newer version has a less powerful motor. I knew the second I turned it that the motor was different. It sounded like my old one with nearly dead batteries!    It took longer to trim hairs and did not even do a thorough job.     What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Panasonic model. (I dropped the last one after 2 years, and it broke.) This new version is identical except that they&#x27;ve added a plastic thingy in the middle, to prevent hairs from catching/pulling. While this is a nice gesture, it means you have to really work harder to get some trimming done! Multiple passes and odd angling are now the norm, and I&#x27;m disappointed. This new version is quieter.</li>
            <li> This will shave all nose/ear hair. Wet/Dry and waterproof, completely portable, there is nothing not to like.  It does everything it should with no errors.  Hard to imagine this product any better.    Edit:  The above is my original review.  One year later, it is broken.  I have since switched to the Grommmate stainless steel and manual trimmer, which is cheaper and just as effective, albeit slower; it is also less likely to break.    In short:  this device works great, until... it stops working.</li>
            <li> This is the best one we have found.  Others we have tried do not work as well as this one.</li>
            <li> Does what is supposed to do.. Easy to clean.. Durable.. I&#x27;ve dropped it on the floor several times.. I think i&#x27;ve only had to replace the battery 3 times...</li>
            <li> Nose hairs are problematic. It comes with the fact that all the hair is growing in the wrong places after disappearing from where we though were the most important.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and it just doesn&#x27;t work. There are few things more frustrating that placing a whirring cutting device into your nose and ears, and then waiting for it to do its job, trying every angle, all to no effect. I think the device&#x27;s little blade is too far down the safety nozzle for it to do anything useful for me. Your clipeage may vary.</li>
            <li> What can you say about a nose hair trimmer?...well for starters this one actually works. It&#x27;s case is comfortable to hold and it effortlessly and admirably performs the task it was designed for. It trims nose hair painlessly. It is quiet and effective. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Best model I could find...but it could be a little more powerful.  The wet/dry feature is really nice.  Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It worked great (although it could be painful), the TWO times I used it.  Then it died.  A piece of junk.  I had one of these a few years ago, and it only lasted a few months.  Look for something better.</li>
            <li> While my age shall remain unknown to you, I have looked for a long time for a comfortable way to trim those pesky nose hairs.  I can&#x27;t believe such a great product is being sold for such a low price.  This should be in every medicine cabinet in America!  It does an excellent job, with minimal discomfort and no pain.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If your looking at the reviews for this product then you or someone you know needs this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tickles a little but does a fantastic job (I can put up with that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a female who wants to look nice, I don&#x27;t want stray nose hairs taking someones attention away from the topic at hand. I also wouldn&#x27;t want to be known for my nose hairs in someones conversation about me, so \\&quot;off with the little beasties!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I used the trimmer for about 6 months, it worked great in that it cut the hair down very nicely, but it had a couple of downsides. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;1. It would get very warm and and some times pull &lt;br /&gt;2. When I dropped it, the cap came of very easily and the head hit the ground.(I thought the cap was supposed to protect it?) Anyway I tried to mess with it to make it keep spinning but nothing I did help, I only dropped it a foot of the ground onto a carpet floor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unfortunately getting to the stage where hair starts growing in more and more places that I don&#x27;t want it to.  So I needed a trimmer, and one that could handle the ears and nose.  This little guy works great.  I doesn&#x27;t pull and gets in pretty close.  My only complaint is that the vibrations from the head tickle the heck out of my nose.  But all in all, a good choice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I made it so many years without a nose hair trimmer.  I have nose nair in the classic levantine tradition and over the years I had to make do with scissors and tweezers to groom myself.  Then one day my wife was watching \\&quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy\\&quot; and they featured a nose hair trimmer that looked a lot like this Panasonic.  I&#x27;d been skeptical about the practicality of electric nose hair trimmers, but I figured if the Fab Five recommended it, then maybe I should try it.  I&#x27;ve had it over a year now and I&#x27;ve only had to change the battery once.  The only negative I can see is that it doesn&#x27;t look especially robust, so I imagine it will die someday, but at $15 who cares?  When that happens I&#x27;ll buy a new one just like the old one.</li>
            <li> I only used it a couple of times and then it stopped working. Given this is a really simple device, maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to rotate fast enough so makes the job a bit too painful</li>
            <li> I took the trimmer out and pop a new battery in and it didn&#x27;t even start. I heard there might be some quality issue with this product but this is ridicules. I didn&#x27;t even had a chance to use it.  ** Update **  Amazon immediately sent a replacement and I received it in 4 days. The trimmer seems to pull the hairs out of the nose in order to cut them. This is the first time I&#x27;m afraid of a nose trimmer. I will recommend people to use with care.</li>
            <li> This product is great to have. &lt;br /&gt;but after 1 year of usage, it finally broken down... it didn&#x27;t even have the chance to renew the battery. &lt;br /&gt;Total usage 5-6 times in 1 year.</li>
            <li> While shopping for a beard trimmer for my husband for Christmas I was offered a bundled deal with this little trimmer.  Wish I had bought one years ago.  It accomplishes the task safely and quickly and without the vibrations that a friend had reported made him sneeze when using similar device from a different manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I have bought two of these and both sufferred the same terminal problem after a few months useage.  The blade seems to get stuck against the external metal housing at the tip.  You can unscrew the tip and the blades rotate, but reattaching the tip stops the blade movement.  I&#x27;ve taken both units apart and reassembled which sometime temporaily fixes the problem.  No more for me... nostrils will just get hairier..</li>
            <li> After a year of light use, mine kept spinning but stopped cutting.  My e-mail query to Panasonic was never answered.  Caveat Emptor: It works okay until it stops working.  Expect to buy another before too long.</li>
            <li> Never know how important this gadget was until i used it. Its a must have thing. Uses 1 AA battery and has a decent battery life. Neatly designed.</li>
            <li> I have long needed help keeping those nasal hairs in check!  The Panasonic groomer works well, if with a little discomfort.  I am pleased I made the purchase, and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Functions well overall, although a few painful nicks led me to be careful about not getting it too close to the skin inside the  nostrils. Breaks very easily. Drop it 2-3 feet on a hard surface and it may no longer function - this has happened to me twice.</li>
            <li> this thing hurts!! nose hairs are yanked and that ain&#x27;t a feelin good. then it goes thru batteries like sherman thru the south, eating them up...wish i had not bght, as ends up doubling price by battery cost so far.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it - and sneezes alot. It works and certainly has made an improvement in his personal appearance!</li>
            <li> This is the only clipper I have ever found that actually works. Between me and my friends, we have tried about 10 different brands. This is the ONLY one that cuts well.</li>
            <li> I bought an ER 411 years ago and it&#x27;s been a pretty good product. It was the second nose/ear hair trimmer I bought. The other one had a straight (not round) head and was awful. After probably 7 or 8 years, I would say the $25 I paid for the ER 411 was a great investment. Why the heck they think it&#x27;s worth $50 now is beyond me. Is this a collectible? Try the ER 415 if you&#x27;re looking for a trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at that age folks... you know, when the hair stops growing on the top of my head, and instead, decides to grow in my ears!  It&#x27;s disgusting!  Until now, I&#x27;ve been taking a small scissors and a couple of mirrors to try to trim those pesky things.  There hasn&#x27;t been too much blood shed, but the whole process is ridiculous.  I went searching for one of these gadgets not knowing what to expect.  I could never figure out how they worked.  I mean, how do you get an electric razor that small?  ...&lt;BR&gt;I got it, popped the battery in, and was totally amazed!  It&#x27;s hard to describe, but if you can picture the top of your little finger -- that&#x27;s the size of this rotary electric razor that spins in a circle.  I thought it might \\&quot;pull\\&quot; the hairs out, but it doesn&#x27;t.  This gadget has changed my life!  They ought to put me on a commercial, but I&#x27;d be too embarrassed.  This thing should be in the medicine cabinet of every man over 40...  I highly recommend this product and am surprised they aren&#x27;t doing mass advertising for it.  If more people knew about it, it could take off and be a staple for family use.  Amazon.com shipping was flawless, the product professionally packages - overall a 5 star experience and something that will save me a ton of aggravation in future years.  Now if I could just get the hair on the top of my head to grow back...</li>
            <li> Uh..yeah. This groomer is fantastic. Quiet, comfortable, and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Our quest is over!  We have found the most efficient, effective nose and ear hair trimmer on the market.  Believe me, we have tried many different makes and models, but this is the very best!  The Panasonic Nose and Ear Hair Groomer # ER411 more than exceeded our expectations!  The ergonomic, curved, hypo-allergenic stainless steel blade easily cuts nose and ear hair growth in seconds without pulling or pinching because of a safety cone that protects the skin.! It&#x27;s comfortable to use and  very easy to clean.  You can use it either wet or dry, it&#x27;s fully immersible, takes one &amp;quot;AA&amp;quot; battery and has a high tech look. Thanks Panasonic, you have a winner here!</li>
            <li> A GREAT LITTLE RAZOR! Comfortable to hold, easy to use, quiet and does a great job trimming those hairs you just don&#x27;t want people to see.  Painless, bloodless, and quick.  Twice the price of the comparable Remington but worth the difference.  A real keeper, too bad they didn&#x27;t come out with this razor a lot sooner.</li>
            <li> This groomer has been great.  It hasn&#x27;t nicked me or pulled at my hairs.  It dosn&#x27;t vibrate and create an uncomfortable feeling inside you nose.  And it dosn&#x27;t just trim you hair, it will compleatly clean out all the nostral hairs in you outer cavity.  I can now breath clearer and my nose dosn&#x27;t itch.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is powerful, quiet and versatile. Cuts pain-free grooming time down to nothing. A cinch to use and clean. As with most Panasonic items, a  terrific product at a very fair price.</li>
            <li> It is a decent ear and nose trimmer.  I would like to point out that it is plastic, not metal body.  Also it would be nice if it could collect the cut hair so that a noseful of hair doesn&#x27;t have to be rinsed out after cutting.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of others over the years and this is the only one that works really well. Safe and effective, yes it tickles, but it works great. Sure, it will probably break if you drop it enough, but it really is well made. I am ordering another due to blades getting dull after 3 years use. Probably others as good but I don&#x27;t think you will find better and I know from experience you can do worse.</li>
            <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s the best nose hair trimmer in the market!!! I highly recommend this panasonic ear and hair groomer.  Get one and enjoy the experience of no-hassle and quick way to groom your nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been completely satisfied with this groomer. I&#x27;m fairly picky and when you hear I&#x27;m satisfied, it&#x27;s got to be good. Overall, good battery life and great trimming makes this groomer a &amp;quot;must have&amp;quot;.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, and his first statement was that he didn&#x27;t know why anyone would say it hurts.  Now, I haven&#x27;t used it myself (and probably won&#x27;t since it&#x27;s been in his nose...), but he did say as long as you&#x27;re not jamming it up your nose, he can&#x27;t see how it would hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, this product did its job and did it well.  He&#x27;s pleased, and with that, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a recommended item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to keep a straight face when discussing the personal grooming solution this little wonder offers -- but the bottom line is it works. Really.     There may be some who have mastered the art of using scissors to remove nosehair, but I&#x27;m not one of them. No matter how hard I&#x27;ve tried in the past, I&#x27;ve never been able to quite get the job done. Not even close. And I figured the $15 price tag was worth it if only to satisfy my curiousity about how these things actually operate, or at least be good for a laugh or two from my wife or kids.     Well, it&#x27;s no joke. Yeah, there&#x27;s a minor tug or two during operation as some have noted, but the inside of my nose is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. My advice is to give it a shot. What have you got to lose? Well, other than the obvious, that is.</li>
            <li> I have gone through two of these things. Once I dropped it and it broke apart like a piece of crystal. &lt;br /&gt;The second one just died after less than a month of use. &lt;br /&gt;LOL! &lt;br /&gt;Be careful you get what you pay for. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This little devil really does work well. &lt;br /&gt;Batteries last a long time, trims hair well, but ... &lt;br /&gt;... it really hurts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anyone know of less painful product?? &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I bought it from amazon.com and my husband just used it 3 times in 3 month and now it is broke. It does not work anymore--broke! I wish I bought it at a local store so at least I can exchange one after 3 month of purchasing. With amazon, you only have 30 days to try and return. Basicly it is not enough time for trying electronic products.</li>
            <li> The first one of these I received painfully pulled hairs as it cut them.  I ordered a replacement which was slightly better, but had the same problem.  I would stay away from this model.</li>
            <li> I have a previous Panasonic nose trimmer model which I purchased over 8 years ago.  I use it often, as I find excessive nose hair offensive.  Although my old model works very well, I ordered this model over 1 year ago to have a spare in my hygiene kit, as I am often on the go with very little advanced notice.  Although both models trim nose hair excellently, his model, Panasonic ER411, is more powerful than my previous model, trims faster, and finishes the job in less time.  The end result is, however, the same for both; an excellent trim.  This new model, ER411, is just as easy to take apart and clean, as the old model.  One improvement, besides a more powerful motor, is that the cap has vents that allow for air drying with the cap on, and the cap will also prevent the trimmer to inadvertently turn \\&quot;ON\\&quot; via an innovative locking mechanism.</li>
            <li> I have had it for the last 6 months and here are the pros and pros: &lt;br /&gt;1. Good cutting capability &lt;br /&gt;2. Good battery life &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;cons &lt;br /&gt;1. Cleaning is a pain &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall does the job and is worth the money.</li>
            <li> It hurts when I used it on my nose hair. It doesn&#x27;t last that long either for the price that I paid because mine is now broken. I bought it within 2 months ago and I barely used it too. I should have bought something else.</li>
            <li> Owned this for about 6 weeks. When brand new, it was quiet and fantastic, really did the job nicely as opposed to my old method of trying to use a fingernail clipper or jam the corner of a beard trimmer in my nose. Problem is, as someone else reviewed, it may not work properly for very long. I only used it about ten times, and the next time I turned it on, it was louder than normal due to rattling like something broke or got off-center, I don&#x27;t know. Good  thing it was only 14 bucks...makes it somewhat disposable I guess.</li>
            <li> After about 6 months of normal usage, it just stopped working.  (While it did work it worked fine).  I&#x27;d suggest trying something else.</li>
            <li> My last nose hair trimmer was my Daddy&#x27;s. It was big and had handgrips for each hand, an old plug- in- the- wall type. It was best if you had someone help holding it cuz it was heavy. You had to keep the blades sharp, or it&#x27;ll rip the hairs out of your nose. Most of the time it left you bloody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I like this one better cuz all you got to do is put a battery in and turn it on. This thing cuts all types of hair.  I bet this thing would cut a male gorilla&#x27;s nose hair pretty good if you could teach a gorilla how to turn it on. It&#x27;s real easy; you just push that switch on the side. Big thick black hairs too. It isn&#x27;t like those cheap trimmers that were made in Japan. This one was made in China. I bet I could teach a Gorilla how to use this trimmer. It works on batteries. It works good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this item for quite some time and keep giving it shot after shot after shot.  This does a good job of cleaning out nose hairs, however it cuts the inside of my nose at the same time, leaving me with a blood crusted inside which takes weeks to heal!  It also gets really hot when in use, which makes it even less comfortable!</li>
            <li> This is a good tool if you have nose hairs to be removed.  It removes all of the hairs and it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  I have had it more than a year and still using the same battery.</li>
            <li> This little gizmo works like a champ. It should be noted that it is not painless, there is some slight discomfort as nose hairs are mowed down. Use in the ears, however, is painless, though noisy. If you have those annoying tufts of hair in there, this will do the trick in seconds.</li>
            <li> For almost twenty dollars (thirty dollars list, according to Amazon ...), I thought this might be a pretty good trimmer. And the reviews seemed good, so I bought one. Well, I tried several new batteries in the trimmer, but it still nicked and cut when I tried it. Not for tender noses! ... the thing hurts and leave red inflamed marks on tender skin. I really just can&#x27;t stand to use it at all ... I fear it&#x27;s going to draw blood. It might be OK on ears, but I don&#x27;t need it for that. It&#x27;s also of flimsy construction and I&#x27;m afraid that if I once accidentally dropped the thing on bathroom floor or countertop, that would be the end of it. I much preferred my old Wahl brand trimmer, which did a good job, never hurt, has been durable and lasted years -- and Wahl costs less!  The Panasonic is OUT and I&#x27;m going to buy another Wahl brand.</li>
            <li> It functions nicely. But one does need some time to feel confatable using it...it makes you itchy.</li>
            <li> Just got it...worked amazingly well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll take the little zing it caused on first use; my guess is that in the future it won&#x27;t be anything like the clear-cut I did.&lt;br /&gt;Priced right, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I knew about these devices years ago but they sounded, well ... ouch!  But I got one and it does not cut me up or anything, just some hair pulls that don&#x27;t hurt much.  I think I could have done better on some dates if I used this long ago!  But don&#x27;t tell my wife I said so!  :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, rather than another similar product, due to the previous reviews.  I used it as soon as it arrived, and it worked effortlessly and painlessly.  It is very quiet and does a great job.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I used this trimmer once and stuck it too far inside my nose. Extreme pain and blood pouring out. Had to call 911 and be rushed to the emergency room. It ripped the inside of my nose out. Wooooh!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product..easy to clean, safe, no concern with cutting your nose.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This device probably provides the easiest method for trimming long nasal hairs.  It works quite well.  This Panasonic will definitely trim your hair very quickly and efficiently.  And it will certainly do so in a manner that appears much safer than using pointed scissors.  However, do not expect it to be a completely comfortable experience.  You may experience some hair pulling and slight tugging at times.  In fairness, trimming nasal hairs will probably always be an awkward process.&lt;br /&gt;The device, like most Panasonic products, is made of good quality materials.  The cover to the battery compartment seems to have a fairly good seal.  The cutters seem to be made of stainless steel.  All of that makes cleaning the unit very convenient.  You can actually wash the unit under running water to clean it.  A ventilated cover protects the cutters.  The ventilation on the cap probably helps prevent moisture from building up on the cutters.&lt;br /&gt;The unit measures approximately five inches long.  It requires one AA battery in order to function.  I do not know how well this unit will function for its other purpose: trimming ear hairs.  Thankfully, I do not suffer from that condition.</li>
            <li> It works like any other (while it works).  After about three or four occasional uses it quit.  I assumed it was the battery, so I replaced it.  It still didn&#x27;t work.  The battery tested fine.  I use a Wahl now with no problems.  I expected more from the brand.  The device did not outlast its first battery.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Mine stopped working after a few months.  Now it resides in a landfill somewhere.  (*sigh*) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To replace it, I bought an all-metal, mechanical nose trimmer from Vermont Country Store.  No batteries to wear out, and no cheap plastic to break.  It works just as well and, best of all, it cost the same price! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a way to manage this embarrassing problem.  For quite some time I used scissors on my nose and dealt with the occasional knick, not to mention it&#x27;s just a time-consuming process.  Now I&#x27;m able to take care of my \\&quot;problem\\&quot; quickly and safely.  To be honest, it&#x27;s not the most comfortable experience I&#x27;ve ever had.  There is a slight tugging sensation and it does kind of tickle.  Afterward my eyes always water a little.  But really it&#x27;s a small price to pay to get the job done so quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d read another review from someone who suggested wetting the blades before trimming to make things more comfortable, and this does help a bit.  For as well as the trimmer works, at this price you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This unit will clean up all your nose and ear hair problems. It will bring tears to your eyes, but the result lasts longer then sissors.  In fact I am due for another trim.  Worked better I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I bought this after trying a Conair.  The Conair was useless...it didn&#x27;t seem to work at all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This results from the Panasonic were/are instantaneous for both ear and nose hairs.  After standing in front of my mirror like a fool with the Conair looking for results, this product exceeded my expectations.  My only complaint is that the process is a little more painful or at least startling when it comes to trimming nose hairs.  Sometimes, this product can bring tears to yours eyes. Bottom line though is that it works.</li>
            <li> After four months of light use the motor stopped working.  Try another brand.</li>
            <li> Easy to use product that delivers as promised.  Makes trimming those hard to reach areas easy.  Easy to use and simple to clean.  Good product.</li>
            <li> It pulls hairs badly! My husband tried three times and it does so EVERY time. He will never never use it again!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER411NC Nose and Ear Hair Groomer does a great job at cutting close -- but it feels like it&#x27;s pulling the hair as much as it&#x27;s cutting!  By the time I am finished, my eyes are truly teared up.  I had another trimmer that just got old.  It didn&#x27;t cut quite as close, but there was no pulling sensation at all.  I will be trying another brand, as the discomfort level just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I went through about a half dozen different nose/ear hair trimmers before finding this one.  This one by far superceeds all the others (some of which were way more costly).  It does a terrific job of trimming hair and keeping the blades away from your skin.  It also doesn&#x27;t get \\&quot;clogged\\&quot; like some of the other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried.  Good product!</li>
            <li> This product is better than expected. Thought it would be limited compared to much talked about Sharper Image one, which I have tried. This product however was just as good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for about a year.  It worked fairly well for several months, but then went into a slow decline in which it occasionally yanked hairs instead of trimming.  The blades just get dull.  It&#x27;s not all that easy to clean, which doesn&#x27;t help things.  For this price however I suppose it&#x27;s hardly unexpected, and buying a new one every 9-12 months isn&#x27;t the worst deal in the world.  I do feel sorry for the woman who bought one for her husband who hates it.  Her heart is in the right place.</li>
            <li> Purchased 11/06. Still working ok, just wish the blades would stay sharper. It still gets the job done, it just takes a few \\&quot;going overs\\&quot; to get it right.</li>
            <li> I had used my previous Panasonic trimmer for over two years before it was lost with my luggage at the airport.  I purchased the same model as a replacement, and as a previous reviewer has stated, the blade design has been changed from the earlier model.  What used to be an efficient, quick trimmer has now become a waste of both time and money.  Do not buy this model, spend your money on another product.</li>
            <li> It never even turned on.  Who do I return it to, Amazon or Panasonic?</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely powerless - very difficult if not impossible to groom Nose &amp; Ear hair</li>
            <li> i had this same nose hair trimmer for years and i dropped and broke it.  i assumed this new one would be the same--WRONG  it&#x27;s horrible--takes forever and doesn&#x27;t remove nose hairs or ear hairs.  will look for a better trimmer.  JUNK!</li>
            <li> I had an old 411, lost it and purchased 2 other brands and panasonic 415.  None compare with the quality trim and closeness of the 411.  Once you try this 411 the rest will end up in the trash.  This is the PERFECT trimmer.</li>
            <li> Heard from my barber that this was a good unit. I bought it, and it was... for about a month.  Then?  New batteries notwithstanding, one day it simply wouldn&#x27;t work any longer.  Wouldn&#x27;t turn on and defied me to figure out why.  So, for twenty bucks who wants to hassle with warranty or repair issues??  Not me!  The most effective, most practical solution seemed to be to hand launch the unit on a ballistic course over the fence of my back yard.  It&#x27;s now slowly becoming one with nature, sort of in the manner of \\&quot;dust to dust\\&quot; (plastic to plastic?), seeking its own destiny with nature and the future.... Hopefully the relic will be found one day by some future being, perhaps a member of a new civilization.  Maybe he or she will ponder it, come to terms with it, and thereby gain more of an insight as to just how weak the underpinnings of the old America were, how the inoperative little hair trimmer is at some level symbolic of the failed American experiment as a Constitutional Republic, or the American failure as \\&quot;Emperor of the World.\\&quot;  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This product works--it removes the hair. But it also hurts! It can pinch a little bit when snipping the hairs, but I am told that almost all of them do that?</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER411NC Nose and Hair Groomer works just as advertised -- it painlessly clips annoying nose and ear hair.  The trimmer is lightweight and very quiet.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And, it bears repeating -- PAINLESS. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only reason this trimmer gets four stars instead of five: the first one that I bought was dead on arrival.  Amazon painlessly and smoothly replaced it with a working model, but this has made me doubt its durability. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But this trimmer works just as advertised at a very reasonable cost, so I whole-heartedly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Most men will reach the age when they look in the mirror one day and realize there is hair growing from their nose.  When this day comes, it is important to remember that, like weed wackers, not all nose hair trimmers are created equal. Cheap cutters will pull the hair from the root. Yes, it leaves your nose smoother than babies&#x27; behind, but it&#x27;s not pleasant.  Trimmers that pull end up in the trash or yard sale right next to other creepy items. That having been said, these Panasonic trimmers leave a little bit of hair(maybe 1/8 of an inch) but at the same time, it doesn&#x27;t usually pull. It&#x27;s a worthy trade-off, and the cheapest trimmers I&#x27;ve found that don&#x27;t yank the hairs from the root.</li>
            <li> I had this item for 15 years, but the blades got dull.  I replaced it with the Sharper Image version which cost twice as much.  Worse then being more expensive, it was painfull to use.  I returned the Sharper Image version and bought another Panasonic.  It&#x27;s true that the parts don&#x27;t seem as well made as the one from 15 years ago, but I am back to a pain free experience.  I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I have had two ER411 Nose and Ear Hair Groomers before making this recent purchase. I thought those ER411 groomers were perfect. You could cut on the end as well as the side making them very effective. Panasonic has changed the inner blade design so that it cuts only on the side. The old design was referred to as a curved blade design. Panasonic packaging still refers to the ER411 having the curved blade. In phone calls to Panasonic I have been told that the new design is in effect now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the \\&quot;less expensive\\&quot; groomers for years, and now I wonder why I hesitated to go with the Panasonic.  It is terrific!</li>
            <li> Of all nose/ear hair clippers I tried (including other Panasonics) this is the best. Cuts all kinds of hair, including fuzzy hair, very close, without skin damage. On top, it&#x27;s quiet and washable.</li>
            <li> Like most things Panasonic, this thing broke down after about a year.  Even when it worked, it was uncomfortable to use because even with fresh batteries it pulled hairs as much as cut them.  It&#x27;s cheaply made, and in spite of its premium price, it&#x27;s a lousy product.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This thing lasted about 5 years before I had to replace it. Didn&#x27;t realize how long I had it until I seen it in my order history.</li>
            <li> I just fired up my new trimmer today.  It worked much better than either of the two other products that I have tried.  The testing ground was nose and ears.  My nostrils had so much hair in them that the hair ebbed and flowed with every breath like squid tentacles.  But this trimmer handled the challenge well.  The only reason I did not award 5 stars was because I felt like the hair was almost being pulled, so the trimming process made me a bit edgy.    Please do not ask me to borrow nose hair trimmer.  It is for my use only.</li>
            <li> This device does an acceptable job of trimming nose and ear hairs, but at a price:  it is downright painful!  I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s because its RPMs are too low, or if the blade is simply misaligned.  But it pulls and snags like crazy.  Not a lot of fun.  Very surprising from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER411NC groomer will give you a very clean trim in a short amount of time, but at the occasional cost of comfort.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Its greatest strength is the motor power, which will quickly take care of the most bristly of hairs.  Unfortunately, this power causes the unit to vibrate in a way that seems tickly at best and painful at worst.  After using an older Wahl for years, I had a lengthy adjustment period.  Many mornings I still come away with involuntary tears streaming down my face afterward - ah, the price of vanity.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found a couple of tips to minimize this discomfort: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1.  Wet the blades down before using the groomer.  This seems to minimize the occasional tugs that really cause the pain.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2.  Keep up with your grooming regularly.  The ER411NC really penalizes you for letting things get out of hand.  The best defense against discomfort is to use it regularly enough to keep hairs short to begin with.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s been a worthwhile investment and it does the job, although it isn&#x27;t recommended for those with sensitive skin or a touchy tear reflex.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister&#x27;s husband. He is very polite. Too polite. I finally found out that he had stopped using it because it didn&#x27;t do a decent job of clipping those nose hairs, and I&#x27;m not sure if I can return it at this point. I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether I got a defective unit or what, but it has a tendency to yank my nose hair, and my previous nose hair trimmer doesn&#x27;t do that!</li>
            <li> That is the funniest review I have ever read!  Thanks for the giggles!</li>
            <li> altho my bro&#x27;s same model works fine still, mine deteriorated and stopped working after about a year. I don&#x27;t have that much hair and only use it for like half a minute a day, but it&#x27;s stopped turning. It did work well while it lasted, but I&#x27;m hoping now the more expensive model will do the job a little longer.</li>
            <li> I tried this device for the first time today and it worked splendidly. As the previous reviewer noted, you can hear when it&#x27;s getting hair, which is helpful. It cleared my nose right out and there&#x27;s a bit of stubble left but overall I&#x27;m amazed at how smooth and clean it is in there now. A lot better than plucking or shoving your regular razor up there (hey, some days you&#x27;re desperate).&lt;br /&gt;One thing - use this device over a sink and clean your nose out with a damp tissue afterward to get all the hair. I think it tries to get the hair it cuts, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as successful at that. No big deal though.&lt;br /&gt;I have a feeling that I&#x27;ll soon wonder how I ever managed without this device.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Panasonic ER411NC Nose and Ear Hair Groomer for over a year and am quite happy with it. Most of the other similar products on the market start pulling the hair after a short time. The Panasonic ER411NC Nose and Ear Hair Groomer has continued to perform comfortably. I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase!&lt;BR&gt;John Row</li>
            <li> This worked great for the first few months that I had it. Then I made the mistake of tapping the removable head on the counter top. I was amazed at all the hair that had accumulated so I kept at it. I think that I knocked the blades out of alignment because it now constantly makes the same sound that it does when cutting hair. It&#x27;s also become much more likely to nick me. I&#x27;m ordering another because of the excellent results I had before I messed it up. This time I&#x27;ll simply run the blades under the water every couple of weeks instead.     Update..The second one screwed up too but i&#x27;m still going to keep buying these as they work so well. If I could change the rating to 4 stars I would.</li>
            <li> Works like magic! I tried it yesterday and it&#x27;s just perfect. My nose is \\&quot;sparkling clean\\&quot;! I didn&#x27;t mean to disgust you, though.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as expected. I&#x27;ve had mine for about 6 months now. Good job on this product Panasonic!</li>
            <li> EASY, COMFORTABLE AND VERY EFFICIENT TO USE AS WELL AS IT IS EASY TO CLEAN. GOOD VALUE FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> Boy, this thing is powerful. It&#x27;s like a weedwacker for your nose. Sometimes it pulls the hairs a bit which can be uncomfortable but I rather put up with that and get clean grooming rather than use the cheapo brand that doesn&#x27;t cut anything. This is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple months ago and have been using it regularly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When using this for my nose it always tickles and occasionally hurts.  Before I bash it more let me say it works fast and gloriously for the ear.  But the tickling/yanking when it comes to the nose makes it unpleasant and slow. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Try this:  Get a pair of those small grooming scissors and simply be careful with them.  If you&#x27;re careful they&#x27;ll be quicker and much more pleasant for the nose and nearly as quick for the ear.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One more thing:  That first review (&#x27;glorious&#x27;) with so many &#x27;helpful&#x27; checks seems way planted.</li>
            <li> Worked great until one day when it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  Changed the battery, cleaned the contacts, disassembled and reassembled the head/blade section, and nothing.  The thing just up and died on me.  For fifteen bucks it&#x27;s not worth pursuing a repair or a warranty but I just want to warn prospective buyers that this is a distinct possibility.  Still, it worked fine until this happened.</li>
            <li> Well, this little guy Does pull on your nose and ear hairs, and if that doesn&#x27;t bother you you&#x27;re a better man than I GD. I admit to a bit of \\&quot;yikes\\&quot; now and then, but I Did discover that if you move the mower Slowly whilst hewing the internal forests it greatly reduces these little surprises. Having spent long years with scissors and mirror I Do feel that this is a great improvement. It is considerably faster in the nose mowing area, and I never did dare to explore my otic growth with any object sharper than a Q-tip. It&#x27;s also quite comprehensive in its coverage, reaching well into all nooks and crannys. I now feel quite secure in my general appearance, and any person curious enough to take a gander into my facial orifices will find me nicely groomed and most presentable.</li>
            <li> Pretty flimsy.  Motor spins erratically and is fairly weak... when it slows down it pulls hairs.</li>
            <li> Well-designed tool that works so much better than \\&quot;safety\\&quot; manicure scissors. Really keeps things tidy. I wish that everything in the world was this well-designed. This would also make a nice little stocking stuffing for the holidays, something small but thoughtful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face the fact that you just don&#x27;t *need* hair growing out of your ears or nostrils. Comes with age, but it&#x27;s gross. This is EASILY the best way to keep yourself nice and neat!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this handy little tool to anyone who has troublesome nose hairs.  It is quick and easy to use and does a great job trimming those unwanted hairs.  Unlike scissors, there is no risk of cutting or poking the tender lining of your nose while trimming.</li>
            <li> neet little gadget causes minor pain .ouch omg my nose is bleeding . just kidding, like the other review says the price of perfection or at least the quest for it</li>
            <li> They snag a bit when they&#x27;re new, but they are the best for nose hair...my old one is still working, so I got another for my car...</li>
            <li> Incredibly useful, i&#x27;ve seen articles like this in movies, but i&#x27;ve never bought one before, know that i got one is the best and most useful thing ever, i use it all the time, i bought another for my dad and he loves it too. If you suffer as me of ear hair and nasal hair, don&#x27;t hesitate, this is what you need</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great. I use it in my ears and it cuts the hairs very close to the skin without any tugging. It&#x27;s remarkably quiet (which is a big plus when a motor gets up close and personal with your eardrum). I&#x27;ve used it every other day for a month now and the battery hasn&#x27;t drained a bit. It feels solidly built and is easy to grip. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> For those of us who have more hair growing in their nose than on their head this device is great, although it&#x27;s not easy to use to remove hair on your ear.</li>
            <li> My dad asked me to find a nose groomer for him, and trusting the Panasonic brand, I selected this one.  He&#x27;s very pleased with it and says it works well.</li>
            <li> I have been happily using Panasonic&#x27;s ER411 (not ER411NC) for the last few years. I use the trimmer daily due to a family curse (lol). The ER411 is the best trimmer I have ever used...and I tried them all.  The ER411 trimmed hair very close to the skin. Well, I dropped my ER411 and the trimmer was dead. So, I purchased the ER411NC thinking the trimmers were the same. The trimmers are not the same.     As other reviewers have stated, the ER411NC is a re-design of the ER411. The newer model does not work nearly as well as the older model. The newer model just ignores my annoying ear hair. Panasonic changed the blade design in the ER411NC. In an act of desperation, I replaced the cutting blades in my new ER411NC with the cutting blades from my dead ER411, now the trimmer works great. Great move Panasonic!    If you need a trimmer that cuts hair close to the skin, the ER411NC is not a good choice.</li>
            <li> Had a Panasonic ear and nose groomer before worked great. Bought a new groomer just because I got tired of looking at the old one. The new one was more expensive and rechargble, but worked bad. When I noticed this groomer I bought it. It is great,both working and price. This is a keeper.</li>
            <li> This product has never worked right.  It makes a lot of noise like it&#x27;s doing something, but spins and spins and doesn&#x27;t remove any hair.  If you mash it flush against the skin (which is a real blast), it might nick a hair or two.  I had one of these previously that worked pretty good.  It eventually died &amp; I bought this &#x27;upgraded&#x27; model.  Another piece of junk product made in China.  Buy something else.  I really wish companys would stop outsourcing production to China which clearly has zero quality control.</li>
            <li> I love this type of machine.  works great cutting hair around the ears and nose.  It may sting or catch a hair every now a then.  Does the job very well.</li>
            <li> This pulls at the hairs as much as it cuts them. I ended up getting a manual ear and nose hair groomer that worked much better.</li>
            <li> It does not cut hair well enough,  instead it plucks hair. I stopped using it soon after purchase. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> This was hubbys needed tool and it is still working and he was very happy with it. I dont know what else to write LOL</li>
            <li> 2 Stars is generous but I gave it 3.  Pros: Looks nice, is comfortable in the hand, battery life is good, never pinches and is relatively quiet.  Con&#x27;s :(the reasons you want a nose trimmer are not solved. It misses many nose and ear  hairs as they do not seem to be directed into the slots easily and takes much time since it misses so many and doesn&#x27;t cut them short enough (it is why there is no pinch).  You can hear it working as it slows the blades, but you look and still see the ones missed. Frustrating!  Seems like there has got to be an efficient model that is powered.  I may end up with the well rated manual model. I feel it is not worth the money and there is a good chance of disappointment.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> Performs as expected.</li>
            <li> Husband&#x27;s favorite groomer</li>
            <li> I received my Panasonic ER411 today and the seconds I stick it into my nose and hear the trimming noise I know i have a winner.  I have try the other sub $$ products I got at the retail store and they just couldn&#x27;t do a &#x27;clean&#x27; job.   I have small nose holes but the size fits in just fine.  I orignially bought it only for my nose hair because I do not have ear hair that I know of.  Out of curiosity I put it in my ears and to my surprise, the trimming noise starts and took out the ear hair that I didn&#x27;t know about.  &lt;br /&gt;It feels good when sometimes you award yourself with these little life helpers.</li>
            <li> This was ordered to give as a gift, and the recipient was thrilled!</li>
            <li> I have never owned one of these but this little device works great, I can wash it in water and it still functions on the original battery after several months.</li>
            <li> I have been in the market for this item for months.  I read every review on every personal trimmer Amazon was offering and chose to purchase this item because of all the good reviews it received.  I received my trimmer yesterday and am very please to say that it is an excellent product.  It trims neatly and painlessly and is very easy to use.  The noise level is minimal and comes apart easily for cleaning.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this at an electronics store an year ago and can vouch for its usefulness. It would be sufficient to say that other companies are copying the design (store brands like Remington, etc) I used a have a combo total hair care from Remington and its trimmer would give me &amp;quot;RED EARS&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;a sore inside the nose&amp;quot; everytime I used it.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning this unit is a breeze. I dismantled the head and there was nothing much that need to be cleaned. Just keeping it under running water everytime it is used.&lt;br /&gt;The AA baterry life is are not so bad either.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product this past June and it is broken already. The motor is failing badly. Changed batteries twice and it has a grinding noise coming from it that doesn&#x27;t sound safe. I also believe it is rusting by being around our bathroom sink, and never in the water. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the construction quality of this unit. It runs surprisingly quiet.</li>
            <li> This product served me well for about 9 months and then I dropped it on the bathroom floor.  It still works but is very, very loud.  For something people will use in the bathroom it is too fragile.  If you buy it I would consider it a disposible item.  As others pointed out it really does the job well trimming nose and ear hair.  You really can rinse it under water without it breaking.  Just don&#x27;t drop it.</li>
            <li> This small shaver works really great for no stress grooming of both nose and ear hairs.  It makes a good clean cut without any irritation and without pulling hairs out.  Other shavers I&#x27;ve used yank some of the hairs out and bring tears to my eyes because they are more like pluckers than like shavers.  This one is pain free and washes up easily in the sink because it&#x27;s fully immersible.  Highly reccomended!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this Panasonic ER411 trimmer.  After plucking and many other painful procedures, I gave up on these little trimmers because my previous one was WORTHLESS.  I looked at Amazon and saw the wonderful reviews for this trimmer and resorted it as my last bet.  I went to Target and found it, bought it for $19.99, and it works great!  This is not just a tool for men, I&#x27;m a woman and I use it for the original purpose: nose and ear, but also eyebrows, upper lip, chin, cheeks, etc.  I&#x27;m Greek and can not help my hairy genes, but this little trimmer works WELL and hasn&#x27;t upset me yet.  Much better than shaving, tweezing, plucking, depilatories, etc!  &lt;br /&gt;You can basically use it anywhere on your face like I do, but I do not suggest using it on other parts of the body, like your chest, stomach, etc.  In those areas, it pulls the hair and is quite painful.  On my face I haven&#x27;t had any pain yet, like other reviews stated.  Don&#x27;t jam the thing up your nose or ear, you&#x27;ll be asking for it.  Just use it properly and it&#x27;ll give you great results.  &lt;br /&gt;You may have to rinse your nose out because the tiny little cut hairs can be quite itchy.  Other reviewers: please spare me the disgusting comments about your cleaning rituals.  Sorry, we don&#x27;t need to know everything!!&lt;br /&gt;Last tip:  If you see a stubborn piece of hair that the trimmer is trimming but not removing, gently guide the trimmer the OPPOSITE direction over the hair and you&#x27;ll hear a louder noise that lets you know it GOT the hair finally.  &lt;br /&gt;All in all, a WONDERFUL trimmer, I have no complaints yet, I keep it in a drawer, I&#x27;m sure if you drop it you&#x27;ll have problems, but isn&#x27;t it that way with everything now?  Just be careful and it&#x27;ll last long. A+++!!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your hairfreeness!</li>
            <li> This is my first nose/ear groomer and I was a bit hesitant in using it first (after reading reviews that it hurts). But to my surprise grooming seems painless...I feel more clean now :)&lt;br /&gt;Great buy. Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great!! It is a little painfull though. I have tried several nose trimmers and this one is by far the most effective. Plus the price is extremely reasonable. Buy this today and breathe freely!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have lot of nose hair, but purchased it anyway and it works great. I sneeze a lot at the time of using it because of tingling sensation it creates when trimming the hair. Overall a great product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good nose hair clipper...It gets the job done, but like other people have said..there is a little pulling and may feel awkward once in awhile when it does that.. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not giving it a 5 star, but a 3.5 to 4 star cause of that..BUT it does do the job.</li>
            <li> I have been using older model, basically the same as the one I ordered for the last 5 years.  Wouldn&#x27;t have had to buy this one if my wife hadn&#x27;t dropped the old one.</li>
            <li> I was totally satasfied with this item.  Simple, straight forward and easy to use.  I didnt have any of the \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; problems other reviewers had either.  Just a bit of a tickle while it was trimming.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I used this about once a week, just to keep everyting under control, for about 4-5 weeks.  Then it just stopped working, wont work no matter what I do.  And yes, I did try new battereies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the price this is a great item, if it would have lasted more than 4-5 uses.  I think I will buy a nicer one next time and hope it lasts a little longer.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts when I ordered it, but I was tired of drawing blood trying to trim myself with a barber scissors, so I decided to give it a try!    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, this trimmer worked perfectly.  It works equally well on nose and ear hair, and is also ideal for trimming the occasional whisker on the chin or lip that gets missed during shaving. I&#x27;ve used it for 2 months and am still using the original set of batteries.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re tired of hacking yourself up with a scissors, give this a try... you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I had hoped the Panasonic brand trimmer would live up to both the high esteem that I hold for Pansonic brand electronics and also the excellent ratings by other reviewers.  My trimmer initially seemed like it might be a good product but after a month or so it began to work erratically and by the end of two months is not working at all.  Also, when it did work it was very uncomfortable as it often pulled rather than cut hairs.  I would not purchase this if I had it to do over.  I gave it three stars but that is probably an inflated score.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through several trimmers and this one is a keeper. It works as advertised as a nose TRIMMER so it won&#x27;t neatly collect hairs like a SHAVER. The tip can be safely rinsed out under the tap, but don&#x27;t dunk it in the shower. The motor gets hot within 30-60 seconds of use, so take a break between nostrils. During cleaning take care not to lose the blade down the drain like I did. I was hoping Panasonic would send a replacement blade for free, but they want $10 + $5 shipping for it. YOWZA... I could get a brand new trimmer for less than that when Amazon has it on sale!</li>
            <li> I have used this item for the last 3 weeks with total satisfaction. It grooms wells and precisely so far.</li>
            <li> Around my house, we call this The Ripper.  This is a product for men.  Manly, manly men.  Men who wear flannel  shirts and drink instant coffee and beer from cans. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is not a nose hair removal system (I don&#x27;t call it a trimmer, and you&#x27;ll find out why soon enough) for limp-wristed metrosexual prettyboys who squeal with pain when they spill their mochalattechino coffee-like substance on their extended pinkie fingers, because it doesn&#x27;t just cut the hair.  It rips it right out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ever pulled a nose hair?  Ever experienced that very unique burst of sharp pain?   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Count all the hairs in your nose.  Then imagine a tiny version of that big drill-thing from the Schwarzenegger movie \\&quot;Total Recall\\&quot; boring into your nostril, grabbing each hair, then tearing it violently from its follicle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That is this what this product does.  If you&#x27;re man enough to remove nose hairs this way, you shall reap the dividends, because a plucked hair takes longer to grow back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a sissy, go with another product... one that simply trims the hairs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item 6 months ago. This gadget eats away Battery quickly. After 5 months of usage this is simply not working. Please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> This groomer performs way better than others I have had in the past.  I am very pleased with it. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a nose-hair groomer (Wahl) that actually cuts nose hairs - dropped it to a bad landing one day, and had to replace it. This Panasonic got such great reviews, how could I go wrong? It&#x27;s \\&quot;chosen\\&quot; by Hammacher-Schlemmer -- must be the world&#x27;s best, right???  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The one I ordered did cut the nose hairs, but first gave them a good hard tug! OWEEE!! Well, this can&#x27;t be right, I said, so I exchanged my first torture device, and the replacement does exactly the same thing!!! Since it&#x27;s now the only one I have, I reluctantly go through this torture, with watering eyes and clenching teeth, every other month or so.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;OK, the results are clean-looking, but I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the pain. CanNOT recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I have bought three of these -- I keep thinking I just got a dud.  Apparently, they&#x27;re all duds.  They work okay (get the job done) when they work.  But they only work a few months at most.  The longest lasting one I&#x27;ve had lasted about 5 months.  The one I just purchased stopped (just stopped) working in a matter of a few weeks.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> it works as expected.  does a fine job.  it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all and you can hear when it&#x27;s cutting.  single AA battery</li>
            <li> Ok but it goes thru batteries pretty quick and I think it needs more rpms.  I do find it stalling occasionally.  Not sure if it is the battery or the unit.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this item. I have been using Panasonic ER411 for the last 2-3 years and it was a very good product. That&#x27;s why i bought this ER411NC. But ER411NC is not up to its expectations.</li>
            <li> Mine quit working after about a year of light use. Not the best cutting blade either - tended to tug rather than cut cleanly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have hairy ears, but I don&#x27;t like hair in my nose.  I&#x27;ve used another brand for years and it finally gave out.  This is far, far better than the old one.  I also like it to trim eyebrow hairs rather than plucking.  This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Mine worked wonders at first.  But like a bunch of other reviewers it just quit one morning.  I tried washing the tip but now it just makes an awful racket when I can get it to work.  The blades seem very fragile.  It appears after some usage the blades gum up and get distorted.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to make it quit.  I don&#x27;t expect it to last forever, but I did expect it to last longer than it did.  I&#x27;ll be looking for a different product as a replacement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for 2 years now, and what a trouper it&#x27;s been! I&#x27;m one of those evolutionary challenged individuals whom nature forgot when it slowly eliminated fur from the great apes. I was seriously beginning to consider braiding the unsightly nose hair while claiming to &#x27;express&#x27; my individuality.    As luck would have it, my wife got this for my birthday after several bouts of sneezing during our intimate moments. I have not looked back since. Despite the fact that my sink clogs up with massive amounts of hair this trimmer mows them down and keeps going. Kudos to Panasonic for designing an essential product for every red blooded man&#x27;s toilet kit!</li>
            <li> Good little trimmer, what more needs to be said.</li>
            <li> this trimmer worked okay, but didn&#x27;t trim all that well. kind of powerless. and it stopped working properly after about a year. not the best panasonic item i&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I have had this trimmer now for over 5 years and it have worked perfectly.  The head is easily removable for cleaning which makes a big difference in the trimmers effectivity.  For the price I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> First one (different model) was very plasticy and cheap.  This model is much better!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was worried that this wouldn&#x27;t work as well as the reviews said it would.  But it does!  Say goodbye to the tweezers.  If all panasonic grroming products work this well, I may just have to give up my razor as well!</li>
            <li> As men get older they get weirder looking, and one of the things that makes them look weirder and ickier is targus, that annnoying hair that crops up in their nostrils and ears. This little gem weed-whacks those hairs pretty well. And you can HEAR it chopping away which is kind of satisfying. There is a certain amount of pulling, it&#x27;s not all that sharp, but the unit does in fact clean out the hair in your nostrils and takes, oh, three or four months off your age at least. I don&#x27;t really think this thing is going to last more than two months tops, but it works for now. It really does get the nose hairs out. And quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum: I lost this little item in a housefire (since I wrote the above review). When I replaced it I did so with a Wahl thinking that the makers of my (excellent) hairclippers would certainly know how to make a high-quality targus-whacker. Well, the Wahl was much inferior; it made a nice enough whirring sound, but it simply didn&#x27;t do the job. It seemed as if all it did was whirr prettily without doing the concommitant and necessary clipping. And then it just stopped working entirely. The battery ceased to make proper contact with the motor. So I tossed it and bought a new Panasonic ER411NC Nose and Ear Hair Groomer. It was like welcoming an old friend into the house.</li>
            <li> I thought the reviews I read here were a little over the top, I mean this is just a nose/ear hair trimmer.  But after using this item I am in COMPLETE agreement with the other reviewers, this is THE best trimmer I have ever used.  This trimmer does a quick and complete job.  I would say if you need a trimmer this will be the last one you will ever want, there will be no need to try another.</li>
            <li> You know how it is when you&#x27;re working on a project and some tiny task turns into a huge chore because you don&#x27;t have the right tool? &lt;br /&gt;Trimming nose and ear hair is like that.  And this little gizmo is the right tool.&lt;br /&gt;Order it with confidence, it works great.</li>
            <li> Nicely designed, and very functional. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on all of the fantastic reviews. I have to wonder, did you all use this yourselves on your own nose? I can&#x27;t review this against any other pure nose hair trimmer, this is the first one that I have used. I dread putting it up my nose. I found it to be painful and irritating, and I bled when I tried to get too close. Maybe all of the other nose hair trimmers are worse. A friend of mine had a manual nose hair trimmer that he wound up his nose, and it stuck, he had to pull it out. This isn&#x27;t THAT bad. But I do have a Norelco electric shaver that has a beard trimmer attachment that does just as good a job as this without any pain or making me want to sneeze or whatever. I have not tried it on my ears, maybe it would be good for that, but I don&#x27;t need that. I&#x27;ll bet most people would like the electric shavers with the beard attachment better than this!!!</li>
            <li> works great, can use it blind folded if you really wanted to not having to worry about exposed blades. doesnt really hurt at all just have to get used to the vibration. all the cut hairs fall inside to a storage area making clean up easy.</li>
            <li> This gadget is great, it cuts close and does the job efficiently and quietly with no cuts or pain.  Do not try it for purposes other than grooming nose or ear hair.  Ugh!  And if someone gives this to you as a gift in front of a crowd of people, this person is not your friend, but even so, look in that mirror and if you need it, use it, do us all a favor and yourself most of all.  This gadget does a much better job than scissors or other little shavers.  This is state of the art.  I am not a sasquatch so a battery lasts months for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update January 2006- I am seeing a basic conflict in reviews posted after mine.  Perhaps Panasonic has made its product cheaper.  I haven&#x27;t had any trouble at all with my unit.  It works first time, every time, and I have only changed the AA battery Once since I have owned the machine.  It does not hurt when the hairs are cut.  It cuts the hair down, it does not pull it out.  There may be a spate of defective products out there.  I would suggest buying it at a place where there is a warranty in force.  How about Sears where everything is guaranteed or your money refunded?</li>
            <li> When the other person in you life starts chasing you around with tweezers - It&#x27;s time to invest in a tool that won&#x27;t bring tears to your eyes.  No pain, effortless, cleans up the nose and the ears and maybe even a testy eyebrow hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If you like the feeling of hair being violently ripped from your nostrils by a dull rotating blade, this is the device for you.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I purchased this thing after reading the reviews and having general success with most panasonic products. I am extremely disappointed and cannot recommend this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Interspersed throughout the comments for this product is the occasion person whose product broke shortly after purchase.  I am one such person. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The groomer worked very well and I was excited to have it, but it stopped working (meaning that it still ran but the blades did not cut any hairs) after about 3 uses.  Yes, I cleaned it out and checked to see if anything was clogged or wrong with it. For some reason it whirred but would simply no longer trim hairs at all.  No, it was not because my hair was so dense or thick that it ruined the device. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although it was only $15 I was hoping for a longer-lasting product.  I would suggest shopping around a bit more if you are in the market for this type of device. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Of the 3 nose hair trimmers, &#x27;personal grooming devices&#x27;, I&#x27;ve used this one caused the most pain. It has the tendency to grab the hairs as the blades spin, pulling them painfully. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Be cautious with this device, I suggest one withOUT spinning blades and with reciprocating ones instead.</li>
            <li> and I love it. It is still sharp and does not pull your hair.  I&#x27;ve also only had to change the battery once.  Great product and great value.</li>
            <li> I have tried many of these types of trimmers, and this one works! &lt;br /&gt;It cuts all the hair in my ears and nose quick and close without yanking them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And the motor/cutter will not deafen you when you trim your ears. &lt;br /&gt;Good choice of products!</li>
            <li> This is actually the 2nd one I&#x27;ve bought.  It works as advertised but just doesn&#x27;t seem to last long.  The 1st lasted about 1 year but when you condier it&#x27;s probably only used a minute or so once or twice a week that&#x27;s really not a lot of actual use before it just quits.  It did the job fine and when you get down to it I suppose it&#x27;s pretty much a disposable item since the price isn&#x27;t much.  I just expect it to last longer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will it do the job, yes.  Will you have to replace it, yes.</li>
            <li> This unit gets all the follicles without taking blood.  It&#x27;s painless.  It works.</li>
            <li> I just got this model as an &#x27;upgrade&#x27; for my tired old ER112, which has been my trusty companion for a few years now.  One of the first things I noticed with the new ER411 was that I got an occasional sting from it.  As a previous poster mentioned, it felt like a burn.  The unit isn&#x27;t getting hot, so it&#x27;s certainly the result of an occasional sensitive hair being yanked. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I slowly built up some trust until the unit managed to grab up some of my nose lining (yes, it hurt and bled a lot).  From now on, the ER411 is for ears only.  My old ER112 has never grabbed any skin and is the tool of choice for getting in the darker recesses of this bird&#x27;s beak.</li>
            <li> Soon after I purchased this product, the On/Off switch began to malfunction.  It worked intermitently for awhile and then quick working altogether.</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations.  The design and build quality both seem first rate.  Battery life is good, and cleaning the trimmer head or replacing the battery are both a snap.</li>
            <li> Ear and nose hair, the curse of man!  It takes a special tool to handle the heavy work and this is it.  Having tried many different models and styles, I have found this to be the best.  Reasonably priced, easy to handle, plenty of power and by design, you can&#x27;t cut or slice yourself while trimming.  I&#x27;d recommend this model to anyone who is conscious of their appearance and want to keep the annoying facial hairs under control.</li>
            <li> This trimmer was to be a replacement for my aging trimmer of the same make &amp; model.  This trimmer does not trim close like the old trimmer.  I am very disappointed in the product!</li>
            <li> Looks like the one I have and am looking for another one even though mine still \\&quot;works\\&quot;.  Very disappointed.  I was going to Sharper Image until saw the 1 review.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works well for the price. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My big caution is that it is not very durable.  My first fell off a shelf and the 4 foot drop killed it.  I bought a second one and it fell 2 feet into a sink and stopped working as well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m gonna get another one and not keep it on those rickety shelves.</li>
            <li> Mine conked out after only 6 months and maybe only 10 uses.  The quality of the cutting blades was poor and resulted in some eye watering nose hair pulls.</li>
            <li> I just got it 2 weeks ago and once I tried it, I was hurt. It is true that it is water rinsable, which is great, but it hurts when you use it, not all the time but it does when you least expect it.</li>
            <li> This item quite working after 4 months.  I tried new battries and it still wouldn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic ear/nose trimmer for about 15 years when it finally quit. I replaced it with one from The Sharper Image and had to return it because it pulled the hair instead of cutting it and was very painful. I was leery of getting this Panasonic one because of other reviews saying that this was doing the same thing (pulling the hair). Well I&#x27;ve used it now for a couple of months and it&#x27;s the best one I have ever had; smooth, quick, quiet, and most important \\&quot;No Hurtful Pulling of Hairs\\&quot;!!! I&#x27;m buying another for a spare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Wahl, Remington and Conair and winced as it pulled rather than cut my nose and ear hairs.  This Panasonic groomer does the job as stated in the online literature.  It will even clip a wild eyebrow hair.  A good choice for those who want to keep trimmed.</li>
            <li> friends,      this is/was the jesus of trimmers. i&#x27;m sure there are those who have had problems with it. i have not! i pray to this unit!! there are some simple souls who would have trouble with anything...this unit makes the greuling chore of excess hair managment a piece of cake! and yes, if some hair would grow on my head this WOULD relieve insult to injury!</li>
            <li> More of a tickler than a cutter it left a lot to be desired in results.  It also only lasted about a year</li>
