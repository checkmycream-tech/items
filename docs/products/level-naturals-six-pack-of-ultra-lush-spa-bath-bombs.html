            <li>and I was instantly in love.</li>

            <li>They are very soothing and calming.</li>
            <li>If there was a way to pick maybe a type of smell like sweet or sour or flower something like that</li>
            <li>These came just as shown in the package in a cute little egg like carton, only 3 of them were labeled with the Naturals plastic wrapping and then the other 3 were just in clear wrapping</li>

            <li> only one out of my six had a label, the others were individually wrapped, but in plain plastic.  </li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.  </li>
            <li> Made it a bit of a guessing game, as to which were which.  </li>
            <li> Expensive for what they are.</li>
            <li> These bombs stink and not in a girly way,just stinks</li>

            <li> Wife enjoyed them for Mother&#x27;s Day, so I&#x27;m pleased.  Like other reviewers stated, the label was only on one &amp;#34;egg.&amp;#34;  Not a big deal considering the price.</li>
            <li> Bought these as a gift.  Arrived as expected.  However, had to do some research to figure out which bombs were which as it is unclear from the label.  Also, the mixed 6-pack had one or two different bombs than listed on Amazon.com.  Overall, my friend enjoyed the gift!</li>
            <li> Love them, but their scent isn&#x27;t all that strong (I have to use 2 at a time.)</li>
            <li> A lot of fizz for small bath bombs and they smell great!</li>
            <li> Great motivator for reluctant bathers!</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected...</li>
            <li> Received as a house warming gift for my huge tub, and they were delightful.  I love that there are essential oils in the fizzy balls, as well as scents and some have herbs, too.  They made my skin feel luxurious and I can&#x27;t stop bathing.  The aromatherapy is a genuine benefit, plus your entire room will smell so wonderful afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that each ball would be labeled with its scent...only one out of my six had a label, the others were individually wrapped, but in plain plastic.  Made it a bit of a guessing game, as to which were which.  But, overall, best new product I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The soaps are incredible, too.</li>
            <li> Would not dissolve....arrived in pieces</li>
            <li> These bombs stink and not in a girly way,just stinks</li>
            <li> I like my own &amp;#34;Dewy Essence bath essentials&amp;#34;, but when I don&#x27;t DIY I buy these. They are very soothing and calming. I like that they are organic  and a great price too.</li>
            <li> These came just as shown in the package in a cute little egg like carton, only 3 of them were labeled with the Naturals plastic wrapping and then the other 3 were just in clear wrapping and I just guessed which scents they were based on the ones labeled on the front of the box. The first one I tried was jasmine rose and pieces of rose petals came out with them and I was instantly in love. But on top of looking and smelling great they leave your skin feeling so moisturized. Will be buying many more of these they&#x27;re great for the price and comparable to some higher end bath bombs.</li>
            <li> I love the way these smell and dissolve. Really leave me relaxed and happy.</li>
            <li> Did not like any of the ones I got I haven&#x27;t used any cause they are mostly lemon flavor. If there was a way to pick maybe a type of smell like sweet or sour or flower something like that then they would of gotten used</li>
            <li> Loved it!!! Ordering again&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, packaging is clever, strived on time.</li>
            <li> Incredible ! I love ordering this because it&#x27;s almost always a surprise what you&#x27;re going to get</li>
            <li> Expensive for what they are.</li>
            <li> Bought them for my grandson.  He loves them.</li>
            <li> These smell nice, but that&#x27;s about it. They leave a funk residue in my bathtub that I have to scrub off after each use. I won&#x27;t be buying this brand again.</li>
