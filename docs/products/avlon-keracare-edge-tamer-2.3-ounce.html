    <ol>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t what i expected for the price i paid</li>
            <li> Great product for edge control. It lasted all day and no flaking</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter who is in the process of going natural. She didn&#x27;t care for it, didn&#x27;t lay her edges down well enough.</li>
            <li> I so in love with this product cause it hard to find the right product to lay my edges down!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It really works on my 4 C hair. I&#x27;ve tried several others including the Hicks but this one works the best.  I deducted 2 stars because of the price. I should have paid more attention to the size.  The last time I purchase it for this price the container was much larger. This time I paid almost $10 for 2 oz....ouch!!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for my hair.</li>
            <li> Great dr smoothing down edges</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like this product because it&#x27;s too hard on my baby hair and edges . It last long but too hard .</li>
            <li> This stuff dries my hair out and the only way to get it out is to wash my hair. I didn&#x27;t like the feel or texture.</li>
            <li> I relax my hair and I wanted something for in between perms to keep my edges laid. This is OK, but not worth buying again. If my hair is already dirty this flakes in my hair. It works ok if I have a fresh perm &amp; want an extra laid look, but that defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it keeps edges where they are supposed to be and it&#x27;s not sticky or greasy it&#x27;s perfect. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It really lays down yor edges better than any other gel and it&#x27;s not heavy or oily. It&#x27;s the best I ever used.</li>
            <li> I use to this items every day I love it. It hold and support your hair together all day. A very good product.  Just not enough items for the price it cost.</li>
            <li> Not add good as Edges but okay</li>
            <li> Leaves a build-up but it does tame the edges.</li>
            <li> The smell is light and pleasant and gives a nice hold without residue or buildup. I can&#x27;t find it much in stores aroubd my way so I usually purchase two jars at a time and they last me for a few months. Another product I like is the creme of nature argan oil edge tamer.</li>
            <li> Works just as described.  A must have product for me now.  Careful not to use too much or it can get caked on.  Excellent!!!</li>
            <li> Keeps my edges flat and it does not dry my hair out.  It is not sticky when it dries and does not turn colors like some gels do.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Lays my hair down but yet my hair is still soft</li>
            <li> I like it. This product really works. I&#x27;ve used Keracare products before.</li>
            <li> I think this edge tamer works pretty well but has a lot of liquid so I got curly edges pretty quickly after application. Okay for the price though.</li>
            <li> I freakin love this crap. Transitioning to natural hair using sew ins takes one heck of an edge tamer. This is oned heck of an edge tamer, I&#x27; never want to live without it, I order it before it runs out. This is the smaller size though that&#x27;s why it was so cheap</li>
