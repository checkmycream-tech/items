            <li>great hair product I will continue to use..</li>
            <li>I GET THESE PLEASANT SURPRISES</li>
            <li>I just knew this would be a great moisture treatment because the cleansing conditioner and fig oil were amazing, but it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S MUCH, MUCH BETTER!</li>
            <li>Love all the Wen products!  </li>
            <li>and my hair has never looked better!  </li>
            <li>You will love how your hair feels and looks!</li>
            <li>just love the wen products...and they smell so good</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t afford both use the conditioner after you use your own shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My hair was burn and I was ready to cut it but decided to give WEN a try it was the best desition I have ever done in my life.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I originally tried Wen products about 2 years ago and loved them.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love these products</li>
            <li>It was just ok.  </li>
            <li>I rec&#x27;d this today but have not opened the seal as it is not the product as shown on the Amazon photo or authentic WEN as the photo would indicate it to be.</li>
            <li>and I had better results.</li>
            <li>It is ok.</li>
            <li>I LOVE WEN PRODUCTS....</li>
            <li>IT WAS MORE MOISTURIZING.NOW</li>
            <li>AND IT IS NOTHING SHORT OF GREAT!!!!!  </li>
            <li>THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO APPLY</li>
            <li>Worth A Try!!</li>
            <li>frizz more smooth without being too greasy.</li>
            <li>This mask would be awesome for all hair types but I would recommend the Wen finishing products for thicker hair and feel it might weigh down finer hair.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t look like Lucille Ball (not that it didn&#x27;t look good on her, but definitely not me), and it worked.  </li>
            <li>I love Wen products &amp; this hair treatment really helped to repair my hair after I fried it bleaching it..</li>
            <li>Dry, brittle hair will Look fluffier, but it&#x27;s better to have healthier hair &amp; if you still need more volume, use styling products as needed.</li>
            <li>I dont think this conditioner is ideal for African American relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>I used it just as the instructions said - right before and immediately after coloring.  </li>
            <li>My hair really is soft, smooth and shiny.     </li>
            <li>I had just received my first shipment of WEN and I used he re-moist mask.  </li>
            <li>Chaz Dean products are the best for tired, old and lifeless hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair was AMAZING when I rinse it out and dried it.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my very curly hair.</li>
            <li>Its still not cheap, but much more reasonably priced, and its worth it.</li>
            <li>In photo and on QVC the real product is called Re-Moist MASK.</li>
            <li>As a result, I don&#x27;t use it very often.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never been so soft and shiny!!!</li>
            <li>FYI, there&#x27;s always a slight trade -off for more moisturized hair vs volume.  </li>
            <li>I actually did a second color on top hoping it would balance it out</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product along with the conditioning shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Fig/mint fragrance is NOT great, but bearable due to wonderful results!  </li>
            <li>Worked okay for my hair type, however, small size for a large price.</li>
            <li>IT INFUSED SO MUCH MOISTURE INTO MY COLOR-TREATED 66-YEAR OLD HAIR</li>
            <li>My hair can take a lot of moisturizing products without becoming weighed down.  </li>
            <li>I have frizzy, latina hair and this super expensive (to me) conditioner is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have finally found the right product for my hair.</li>
            <li>Then wrap with turbie towel &amp; soak with water as hot as I can stand and place Second shower cap over it all.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other hair treatments that moisturized just as good if not better.</li>
            <li>My hair is baby soft now.</li>
            <li>I really screwed up the color the last time I colored my hair.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is expensive but my hair is worth it :-)  </li>
            <li>Normally after coloring my hair it is dry (especially the ends), but I used the mask and my hair was VERY soft!</li>
            <li>Will look for another intensive treatment in the near future.</li>
            <li>I was getting my Wen products directly from Wen until I finally got tired of the products either not arriving or taking a month or more to arrive.  </li>
            <li>To shorten the time, I put it on after shampoo (either Wen or alternate with Hair One-\\&quot;wen clone\\&quot; from Sally&#x27;s Beauty due to $$ ) and put on First shower cap.</li>
            <li>and I live in a very dry climate.</li>

            <li> If you leave it on for a long time it does soften your hair, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any signicant improvement in the lasting hydration that the product claims.</li>
            <li> I will definitely suggest this product to anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li> This actually works but this SAME company sells this SAME product on QVC for $20.00 less.  </li>
            <li> My hair was very dry and fragile, before i started using this Hair Treatment.  </li>
            <li> I prefer a product that you don&#x27;t have to leave on so long.  </li>
            <li> My hair is extremely dry and this product makes it feel softer and healthier.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS VERY,VERY DRY...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian with permed &amp; colored hair with 30% grey, slightly oily scalp but the rest of my hair I fight to keep from splitting/damage.  </li>
            <li> it is very expensive but I am enjoying them.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely NOT shampoo.  </li>
            <li> expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> When I ran out and money was tight, I tried every product I could find for damaged, over-colored and dry hair.  </li>
            <li> By the way, I was looking at previous tags.</li>
            <li> I have been a Wen Girl for a few years now</li>
            <li> I was afraid my hair would be horribly dry and brittle after the double color.  </li>
            <li> I have started using the WEN products now for the past 2 months, YES....</li>
            <li> I bought a less expensive conditioner called Cantu Shea leave in</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and shiny it was after the brutal treatment from the color.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair which is color treated</li>
            <li> I would recommend that anyone who is not happy with their hair products to try Wen...</li>
            <li> As another poster commented, via Amazon this is quite expensive.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Worked okay for my hair type, however, small size for a large price. Not something I would reorder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian with permed &amp; colored hair with 30% grey, slightly oily scalp but the rest of my hair I fight to keep from splitting/damage.  I also like It&#x27;s a 10 Products, but I&#x27;d always wanted to try Wen. Fig/mint fragrance is NOT great, but bearable due to wonderful results!  Fig is best for damaged/dry hair.    To shorten the time, I put it on after shampoo (either Wen or alternate with Hair One-\\&quot;wen clone\\&quot; from Sally&#x27;s Beauty due to $$ ) and put on First shower cap. Then wrap with turbie towel &amp; soak with water as hot as I can stand and place Second shower cap over it all. Leave on for rest of shower.  I noticed the difference by the 2nd or 3rd time.  My hair was softer, healthier feeling &amp; bouncier curls.  FYI, there&#x27;s always a slight trade -off for more moisturized hair vs volume.  Dry, brittle hair will Look fluffier, but it&#x27;s better to have healthier hair &amp; if you still need more volume, use styling products as needed.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  Moisturizing, softening, scalp-stimulating . . . Great overnight treatment.      Now here comes the big HOWEVER. . . However, the price.  I don&#x27;t have a problem paying for something that works.  This actually works but this SAME company sells this SAME product on QVC for $20.00 less.  Just saying, if you want to treat yourself to a luxurious hair mask, this is the product, but I would recommend purchasing it from QVC, not Amazon or Mr. Dean&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.  My hair has never been so soft and shiny!!!</li>
            <li> This Is different then what i thought it was but I like it..just love the wen products...and they smell so good</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Whatever else I use, I always use this too. It&#x27;s terrific. Even after highlighting my hair and feeling that it had become straw like, this came to the rescue!  Excellent delivery time and packaging. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product blows my mind!  I used it just as the instructions said - right before and immediately after coloring.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how my hair turned out.  All I can say is THANK YOU, Chaz Dean.     By the way, I was looking at previous tags. One said &#x27;shampoo.&#x27;  This is absolutely NOT shampoo.  IT&#x27;S MUCH, MUCH BETTER!</li>
            <li> well i actually left this in over nite thinkin my hair would benefit and maybe it did but once again i have to say i dont no what i should be lookin for</li>
            <li> I found this product &amp;#34;NOT TO BE FOR ME.&amp;#34;  I like washing my hair with shampoo.  I didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> Normally after coloring my hair it is dry (especially the ends), but I used the mask and my hair was VERY soft!</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, latina hair and this super expensive (to me) conditioner is amazing. A little goes a long way. My hair really is soft, smooth and shiny.     I have finally found the right product for my hair. I use the wen fig shampoo. It&#x27;s great too.</li>
            <li> I like the way they make my hair feel.  I had to get over the no shampoo process.  Works good.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about and used this product years ago.  My hair was very dry and fragile, before i started using this Hair Treatment.  My hair is baby soft now.</li>
            <li> Love all the Wen products!  I have very thick hair which is color treated and I live in a very dry climate. My hair can take a lot of moisturizing products without becoming weighed down.  This mask would be awesome for all hair types but I would recommend the Wen finishing products for thicker hair and feel it might weigh down finer hair.  Love these products</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft!  I use it as a leave in conditioner.  I use it on my very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I really screwed up the color the last time I colored my hair.  I actually did a second color on top hoping it would balance it out and I wouldn&#x27;t look like Lucille Ball (not that it didn&#x27;t look good on her, but definitely not me), and it worked.  I was afraid my hair would be horribly dry and brittle after the double color.  I had just received my first shipment of WEN and I used he re-moist mask.  I coated my hair in a think covering, working it through well, wrapped it in plastic wrap, and left it for about 3 hours.  My hair was AMAZING when I rinse it out and dried it.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and shiny it was after the brutal treatment from the color.  This is an excellent product and I highly recommend it.  As another poster commented, via Amazon this is quite expensive. Go to QVC.  Its still not cheap, but much more reasonably priced, and its worth it.</li>
            <li> Chaz Dean products are the best for tired, old and lifeless hair.  My hair is extremely dry and this product makes it feel softer and healthier.</li>
            <li> I have started using the WEN products now for the past 2 months, YES....it is very expensive but I am enjoying them. I have highlighted, short, curly ethnic hair and this remoist is great!! I use it every time I wash my hair with the fig cleansing conditioner. I&#x27;ve just started to change my combination, I use some of the cleanser and the remoist together as a leave in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally Worth A Try!!</li>
            <li> I just knew this would be a great moisture treatment because the cleansing conditioner and fig oil were amazing, but it wasn&#x27;t.  It was just ok.  I&#x27;ve used other hair treatments that moisturized just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d this today but have not opened the seal as it is not the product as shown on the Amazon photo or authentic WEN as the photo would indicate it to be. In photo and on QVC the real product is called Re-Moist MASK. What I received is called a Re-Moist Conditioner. Chaz&#x27;s jar also 4 oz is much smaller than this 4oz jar from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Photo is deceiving.  I am waiting for a reply from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;I use all the WEN products presented on QVC by Chaz Dean himself and have for years.</li>
            <li> I love Wen products &amp; this hair treatment really helped to repair my hair after I fried it bleaching it..</li>
            <li> This conditioner is expensive but my hair is worth it :-)  I have been a Wen Girl for a few years now and my hair has never looked better!  I highly recommend this product along with the conditioning shampoo.  If you can&#x27;t afford both use the conditioner after you use your own shampoo.  You will love how your hair feels and looks!</li>
            <li> Awesome. I think you&#x27;re supposed to rinse it out but I leave it in my hair. Makes my curls/frizz more smooth without being too greasy. A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Use weeky. Leave mask on overnight then wash with WEN cleansing conditioner the next morning. Mask Left my hair feeling like silk.</li>
            <li> This product is way too overpriced. I think I got too caught up in the Wen moments. I bought a less expensive conditioner called Cantu Shea leave in and I had better results. I dont think this conditioner is ideal for African American relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I saw the commercial on TV, and decided to try it. My hair was burn and I was ready to cut it but decided to give WEN a try it was the best desition I have ever done in my life. My hair is beautiful now. I get compliments, and am amazed the way my hair is. I recommended to everyone, when I get a chance. Thank you.</li>
            <li> expensive but worth it. It makes your hair feel so soft and manageable. I will definitely suggest this product to anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li> I got immediate results with this product.  My hair became smoother and softer.  The only drawback is you must leave it on for about 45 minutes.  I prefer a product that you don&#x27;t have to leave on so long.  As a result, I don&#x27;t use it very often.  Will look for another intensive treatment in the near future.</li>
            <li> It is ok. If you leave it on for a long time it does soften your hair, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any signicant improvement in the lasting hydration that the product claims.</li>
            <li> I LOVE WEN PRODUCTS....MY HAIR IS VERY,VERY DRY...IT FEELS LIKE HAY,THE WEN PRODUCTS,WHEN I PUT THE MOIST INTENSIVE TREATMENT ON AND SIT UNDER A DRYER HOOD,RINSE AND BLOW DRY.MY HAIR DOES FEEL SOFTER AND EASIER TO PULL A COMB THROUGH.I AM A WEN CONVERT.I USE FIG,BECAUSE I READ IT WAS MORE MOISTURIZING.NOW,I AM LOOKING FOR A HAIR OIL THAT CAN HELP MY SCALP AND HAIR WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WILL NOT WEIGH MY HAIR DOWN.I LIKE MY HAIR TO HAVE BOUNCE IN IT,LIKE WHEN I LEAVE THE SALON.</li>
            <li> great hair product I will continue to use.. it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> AND IT IS NOTHING SHORT OF GREAT!!!!!  THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO APPLY IT EXPLAINED ON THE LABEL AND I CHOSE TO SLEEP IN IT FOR MAXIMUM RESULTS..... AND MAXIMUM IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT!!!  IT INFUSED SO MUCH MOISTURE INTO MY COLOR-TREATED 66-YEAR OLD HAIR THAT I WAS STUNNED!!!!  I GET THESE PLEASANT SURPRISES ALL THE TIME USING WEN BY CHAZ DEAN!!!  HEY GIRLS AND GUYS, LISTEN UP!!!  BUY THIS AND FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF!!! I HAVE CONVERTED EVERYONE I KNOW!!!!  AMAZON HAS THE VERY BEST PRICES ON WEN ( AND EVERYTHING ELSE I BUY!!! ). NEXT TIME WE MEET YOU MAY BE ANOTHER WEN CONVERT!!!!  HOPE SO!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was getting my Wen products directly from Wen until I finally got tired of the products either not arriving or taking a month or more to arrive.  I originally tried Wen products about 2 years ago and loved them.  When I ran out and money was tight, I tried every product I could find for damaged, over-colored and dry hair.  Nothing compares.  My hair is healthier now than it has ever been.  I would recommend that anyone who is not happy with their hair products to try Wen...I&#x27;m very happy that I did.</li>
