            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>but i love the design</li>
            <li>Came quickly and was cheap but nice quality!</li>
            <li>then I thought but its still super cute!</li>
            <li>I got this necklace pretty quickly, which I was happy about.</li>
            <li>Its so super cute...</li>
            <li>Very pretty!</li>
            <li>Its cheap</li>
            <li>Not as short as I would have liked it to be, but still cute for the price paid.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely adorable and I recieved it two weeks early!</li>
            <li>but I was able to adjust the necklace to fit tighter on my neck, definitely recommend!!!</li>
            <li>I just wish the hand was a tad smaller, other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t even ship me the right necklace.</li>
            <li>but you have to play with it to make it look and feel right.</li>
            <li>Its adorable but the leather wire is fixed together loosely so it doesnt stay put as a choker but still cute</li>
            <li>It was pretty</li>
            <li>Its just extremely cute and different.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s exactly like the picture .</li>
            <li>Other than that, this necklace is amazing.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and pretty necklaces.</li>
            <li>breaks easily and too big for my neck</li>
            <li>Charm is a little bigger than I was expecting but it still looks great.</li>
            <li>Low review because the hand pendant is HUGE.  </li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t really stay on all that well.</li>
            <li>2 dollars was too much for even this.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;ll like it that much</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really mind.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>but I actually really like it.</li>
            <li>and I wore it for a week straight, put it through water</li>
            <li>Very cute but for small necks its not a choker which I was hoping for</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s really cute.</li>
            <li>It only adjust to a certain length, but I think it&#x27;s because I have a pretty skinny neck.</li>
            <li>Came very early.</li>
            <li>Really pretty and simple.</li>
            <li>It looked exactly the same as it is in the picture.</li>
            <li>The hand was a little bigger than I expected but still really cute and doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s even little adjusters to fit whatever size you&#x27;d like</li>
            <li>The Hand symbol is wayy bigger in real life than it looks in the photo.</li>
            <li>You can wear it as low choker or a long necklace pretty neat</li>

            <li> You can wear it as low choker or a long necklace pretty neat</li>
            <li> The actual jewlery piece is big, and so is the &amp;#34;chain&amp;#34; it&#x27;s long.</li>
            <li> so you can keep it long or make it into a choker.</li>
            <li> And the choker doesn&#x27;t go tight enough to fit properly around the neck without looking silly.</li>
            <li> Fits rather loose for something that&#x27;s supposed to be a choker even after adjusted.  </li>
            <li> The hand is a little larger than I thought it would be</li>
            <li> The cord slips a little bit and the hand is bigger</li>
            <li> it got here sooner than I expected (17 days).  </li>
            <li> but it was expected.</li>
            <li> I found the other</li>
            <li> Not worth the two dollars.</li>
            <li> but a few days in</li>
            <li> Was a little confusing adjusting it</li>
            <li> You guys with the 1 star reviews are dumb af...</li>
            <li> but it broke within first week :&#x27;(</li>
            <li> All you have to do is figure out how to adjust the length, which isn&#x27;t very hard .</li>
            <li> I can see why some people get confused and say that it is not a choker, but it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry if I&#x27;m wearing this wrong</li>
            <li> So you get what you paid for, it&#x27;s really sad to see that there not shipping correctly,</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a necklace, and it&#x27;s disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even get to wear it Very disappointed</li>

            <li> The Hand symbol is wayy bigger in real life than it looks in the photo. Also it doesn&#x27;t really stay on all that well. But otherwise than that its good</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like the picture. It&#x27;s not a choker and it doesn&#x27;t even have the eye on it. 2 dollars was too much for even this.</li>
            <li> NOT A CHOKER. simply a necklace. Did not like the length of the chain</li>
            <li> Just got my chocker hamsa necklace today and I absolutely love it!! It looks just like the picture and its comfy! Definitely recommend it to everyone who loves chocker necklaces!👍👍👌</li>
            <li> Lovely item! Came quickly and was cheap but nice quality!</li>
            <li> Idk... Doesn&#x27;t have eye, charm is big, it&#x27;s not even a choker it&#x27;s a necklace, and it&#x27;s disappointing. I ordered one for my friend too and I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;ll like it that much</li>
            <li> Nice trendy necklace. Charm is a little bigger than I was expecting but it still looks great.</li>
            <li> This necklace was awesome- but a few days in and I lost it *sigh*. Really pretty and simple. I fell in love with how nice and lightweight it was.</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like the picture and isn&#x27;t adjustable to make choker necklace I&#x27;m disappointed. It was pretty</li>
            <li> Its so super cute... it got here sooner than I expected (17 days).  Its just extremely cute and different.  I already know the compliments are coming once I wear it out</li>
            <li> Necklace took a while to get here but it was expected. The wire it&#x27;s on is way longer than what the picture shows and what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> amazing it fits perfectly. there&#x27;s even little adjusters to fit whatever size you&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> Adjustable, I where mine as a choker, love it</li>
            <li> I love this necklace! It is absolutely adorable and I recieved it two weeks early! The hand is a little larger than I thought it would be but I don&#x27;t really mind. This is not a choker as in the picture but I was able to adjust the necklace to fit tighter on my neck, definitely recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry if I&#x27;m wearing this wrong haha, I haven&#x27;t worn a choker like this....but I actually really like it. Its cheap and it&#x27;s got a cute style. So you get what you paid for, it&#x27;s really sad to see that there not shipping correctly, I asked for the palm and they gave me the compass. It&#x27;s adorable tho :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this necklace because I already had one from the same seller and lost it. I found the other so now I have two. Happy about that because they are my favorite necklaces to wear. Simply beautiful.</li>
            <li> Came very early. The pendant itself is gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;However, I didn&#x27;t like the cord. It was coated in some plasticy, shiny film which made it look just cheap.&lt;br /&gt;I easily replaced the cord with a chain, and voila! 100% better.</li>
            <li> The one I got is different from the one in the picture. The actual jewlery piece is big, and so is the &amp;#34;chain&amp;#34; it&#x27;s long. And the chain broke within seconds .</li>
            <li> Very pretty! Adjustable and I wore it for a week straight, put it through water and it didn&#x27;t rust! Great buy :-)</li>
            <li> Very cute but for small necks its not a choker which I was hoping for</li>
            <li> Its adorable but the leather wire is fixed together loosely so it doesnt stay put as a choker but still cute</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and pretty necklaces.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as fitted as a chocker should be</li>
            <li> Fits rather loose for something that&#x27;s supposed to be a choker even after adjusted.  Low review because the hand pendant is HUGE.  A lot bigger than the one shown in the picture</li>
            <li> The cord slips a little bit and the hand is bigger then I thought but its still super cute!</li>
            <li> I got this necklace pretty quickly, which I was happy about. It looked exactly the same as it is in the picture. It also adjusts, which is great. But for me, it isn&#x27;t a choker. It only adjust to a certain length, but I think it&#x27;s because I have a pretty skinny neck. But it is a very cute necklace and I love it.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t even ship me the right necklace. The one I got had a tree pendant instead of a hand. Very disappointed. And the choker doesn&#x27;t go tight enough to fit properly around the neck without looking silly. Not worth the two dollars.</li>
            <li> Broke after pulling it out of the bag. Didn&#x27;t even get to wear it Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Not as short as I would have liked it to be, but still cute for the price paid.</li>
            <li> I got it today and it&#x27;s exactly like the picture . I can see why some people get confused and say that it is not a choker, but it is. All you have to do is figure out how to adjust the length, which isn&#x27;t very hard . I just wish the hand was a tad smaller, other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Okay. It was definitely not a choker on me. It also does not have an eye. Other than that, this necklace is amazing.</li>
            <li> You guys with the 1 star reviews are dumb af... Learn how to tighten it.. You can wear it as low choker or a long necklace pretty neat</li>
            <li> was amazing quality, and just perfect.</li>
            <li> Not a choker like it says it is</li>
            <li> breaks easily and too big for my neck but i love the design but it broke within first week :&#x27;(</li>
            <li> I really liked this necklace. It was adjustable so you can keep it long or make it into a choker. Was a little confusing adjusting it but you have to play with it to make it look and feel right. The hand was a little bigger than I expected but still really cute and doesn&#x27;t look cheap. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the two knots where you adjust the size of the necklace/choker are noticeable look like two balls beside the accessory. Other than that, it&#x27;s really cute.</li>
