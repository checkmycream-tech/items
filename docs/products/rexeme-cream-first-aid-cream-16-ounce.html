            <li> This may be due to the lanolin ingredient because my skin does not react well to lanolin.</li>

            <li> I came across this in a small non-chain drugstore and almost didn&#x27;t buy it as I thought it was too pricey, but I was desperate!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> really helps to heal most any skin blemish or problem. use on my heels and feet every night to keep them from cracking and from being dry.</li>
            <li> Cream does not absorb into the skin as well as I had hoped. Leaves kinda of sticky feeling on the skin. Afraid it might have negative affects on the arms of my leather recliner over time. I play a guitar and I have to polish it every time where my arm has layed on it because of the residue that is left on the surface from this cream. I have real sensitive skin and when I apply this cream, right after a shower, I break out in red spotty blotches.  This may be due to the lanolin ingredient because my skin does not react well to lanolin. This does disappear after an hour or so but the sticky feel remains. If lanolin has a negative effect on your skin, I wouldn&#x27;t order it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for years on burns, cuts and just rough hands. I used it on the burns I had after radiation treatments. The burns healed so quickly and so well you can hardly see he scar from my surgery. My surgeon and oncologist were so impressed they wanted the name and manufacturer of this cream so they can try to get it approved for use at the medical group I am a member of. I like it so much I sent tubs to both of my sons and a cousin so they would have it on hand when they needed it.</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended it, couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere local. fast shipment, product worked well.</li>
            <li> I was recommended to use this after I had my chemical peel. I use it on all bites, burns and just in general. it&#x27;s not greasy and works well</li>
            <li> Just ordered this product.  I&#x27;ve used it for years, but never purchased from anywhere but the maker, Brun Laboratories.  Seems that Amazon is cheaper.  First ordered it to use on a dermatitis that the doctor could not clear up.  Rex eme cream cleared it within a week!  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this hand cream better than anyone else in the market. I have been using it for a long time now and it is very good for me. I used my hands a lot because I do all my house work and because I am a crafter, knitting, crocheting, painting, etc., so my hands are very dry most of the time and this hand cream really works for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great beauty cream, believe it or not! I&#x27;m 62, still a little oily but this cream does not cause breakouts. I use it twice a day and love the way it makes my skin look. It was recommended to me in Maui, bought a sample tube and have been using it since then for two years.  I&#x27;m surprised and pleased at how well it works.</li>
            <li> This cream has a bit of a medicinal smell, however, it works great for dry feet, knees, elbows. It&#x27;s my go-to cream at night before I go to bed. The only downside is that my cat hates the smell which is actually an upside because it gets her off my bed. Seriously though, I&#x27;ve used this cream for several years and purchasing it in this size from amazon is the most economical way to buy it.</li>
            <li> This first aid cream is very healing and soothing for any skin problem area.  It is an excellent product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> Real relief, good product I have been using it for many years. It is the only over the counter product I have found to work.put on after shower and it can last the day</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and arrived fast.</li>
            <li> Only cream that has helped with severe hand eczema. I had tried everything and was on prescription steroid cream, but then was recommended this from my nail salon - I haven&#x27;t had to use steroid in 3 months! I mix with my favorite hand lotion and apply multiple times a day - it is amazing. Will heal a cut or scrape in just a few days or if you have any eczema it is the best! Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Rex-Eme for years and love it for many things.  I only wish it were available in retail stores.</li>
            <li> I recommend this cream to anyone with skin problems.  It has a light cold feeling when you first put it on, but them in a few minutes the pain goes away, and the skin is very soft.  the hands feel good after use, and it helps to heal.  I use it often for my skin condition and really appreciate it.  I bought some for my son-in-law for his psoriasis problem too.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> My friend highly recommended this cream to me for eczema, but unfortunately it seemed to make my eczema worse. It didn&#x27;t itch before I started using it, but afterward it was more red and itchy. I tried using it for about two weeks to see if it would improve. After I stopped using it the itching stopped. I guess it works for some people, but not others. My friend says it really works for her son.</li>
            <li> I have to have this cream on my shelf,  great for irritated skin.  It is something I buy again when the container starts showing the bottom!</li>
            <li> This product is great on my skin and I had gotten it locally in the past, but our pharmacies quit carrying it and it was easier for me to get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using Rex Eme for several years, and I have not had painful cracks on my fingers in that time.  This product really works to prevent skin dryness and  related problems; also, it is especially useful during the dry winter months.  It is rapidly absorbed and does not leave hands greasy and is virtually odorless.</li>
            <li> My local pharmacist told me thatat one time this was only available by prescription.  All I know is it is great for many skin issues from rashes, scrapes, sunburn, or even skin maintenance.  Highlt reccommend that you try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a number of years.  I had been ordering it directly from the company because when I started using it, you couldn&#x27;t find it most places.  I was visiting an office down in New Bern, NC and I was having to wear white socks because I had stepped in a fire ant mound a week before and got a bad set of bites.  The ladies asked me about the problem, because the bites were leaking pus, etc. onto my socks.  When I explained what had happened, they sent me over to a pharmacy nearby which carried the cream.  I explained to the folks at the pharmacy what was happening and they said that the Rex people didn&#x27;t advertise it for fire ant bites, but many people came in asking for it.  I tried it and the bites dried up and disappeared within a week.  I&#x27;ve passed along tubes of the stuff for years for fire ant bites.  Lately, one of my dogs has had an itchy ear and comes and asks me for it.  I don&#x27;t endorse it for these purposes, but I&#x27;m sure my dog and the fire ant victims  I&#x27;ve helped over the years would!</li>
            <li> I believe I have tried all the lotions available for dry skin.  I came across this in a small non-chain drugstore and almost didn&#x27;t buy it as I thought it was too pricey, but I was desperate!  Thankfully I purchased it, and for me it is simply the best I have found.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that helps my dry skin. Most products work for a while then stop helping. I&#x27;ve used this for several years.</li>
            <li> RexEme Cream, always meets our needs.</li>
            <li> This cream was recommended to me by a neighbor. I&#x27;m using it to help get rid of bruising on my arms caused by &amp;#34;old age&amp;#34;. It seems to be working. I think it&#x27;s just a really good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I found this at my local, privately owned pharmacy.  I used it on an itchy rash that high dollar creams would not help.  I love this cream and use it for all itchy skin issues.  It&#x27;s wonderful!!  The Big Box stores haven&#x27;t discovered it yet, so get it here.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of Rex Eme several years ago and have used it for cuts, scrapes, and practically any kind of external wound.  I love this product!  Seems to really help in the healing process!</li>
            <li> This cream is very effective for my extra dry skin.  It works better than any other cream I&#x27;ve tried.  I would highly recommend it.  It&#x27;s not greasy either.</li>
            <li> I am never completely out of this, before I reorder. This product does things they do not advertise it for. You have a problem that you feel is practically not fixable? Try this. And I am a customer (for like 10 years), not a rep.</li>
            <li> I have tried many prescription creams for my dry skin and this is the only thing that has worked.  It is the only thing I am able to use on my face without irritation.  It used to be made in Grand Rapids and I could buy it at the grocery store.  So glad to find it a few years ago from an independent website and now it is even easier on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Best stuff in the world...&lt;br /&gt;Worth it&#x27;s wait in gold</li>
