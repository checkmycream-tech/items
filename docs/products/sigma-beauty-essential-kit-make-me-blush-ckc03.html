            <li>In fact, I have heard that the sigma brushes are quite similar to ones of MAC but a lot more cheaper, which I couldn&#x27;t agree more !!</li>
            <li>ask the seller  to send you an updated picture because I think this is the old sigma kit, also Amazon customer service was amazing!</li>
            <li>Full confident feeling</li>
            <li>Brush kit special and wonderful and prices of less than Sigma&#x27;s official website, with a portfolio of elegant brush of the skin</li>

            <li>, YOU EVEN GET A FREE BRUSH.</li>

            <li>Its soft and works really good.</li>
            <li>The colors are brilliant with a sleek dark coral handle stamped with hologram text and a metallic satin finished ferrule.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>Totally worth the hype!  </li>
            <li>With use, the shedding has reduced significantly.     </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft, durable and easy to clean!!</li>
            <li>In addition, there was a postcard instructing the user how to keep and clean after use.</li>
            <li>Not only are the Sigma Brush Kit&#x27;s the Best they also come with pretty fast dilivery.</li>
            <li>Thus, please wisely read and be neutral to my personal opinion.     </li>
            <li>Out of all the brushes the contour is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>So I ordered these on April 11, 2013, got them within the estimated shipping date, when I received them the packaging was good, but the kit looks totally different than in the picture</li>
            <li>of course my daughter loved them second set I bought!</li>
            <li>That means it is able to be easily used by the beginner to the professional make-up artist.</li>
            <li>Other than color the quality is great</li>
            <li>know pretty much nothing about brushes or make-up, so the most valuable part of this set was the pamphlet that accompanied it that included the name and intended use of each brush.  </li>
            <li>I loved it till this day and haven&#x27;t even felt a single regret about it.</li>
            <li>The color is really pretty, you won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly!!!</li>
            <li>The brushes are well made, easy to clean and really enable you to get the right amount of color exactly where you want it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the special product that helps me picking the special gift to my girlfriend.   </li>
            <li>cannot say enough amazing things about this products</li>
            <li>I wanted to see if it was worth the price and the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to play around with it.</li>
            <li>I had never found good brushes in Pink...</li>
            <li>The write-ups are detailed, letting you know if a brush is intended for liquid or loose pigments, etc., and it&#x27;s been a great reference for someone who up until recently only wore lipstick on special occassions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ultimately, I would like to suggest to purchase this kit if you want to try something new with the reasonable pricebut great quality.</li>
            <li>I hesitated to make the purchase because of the higher price tag, but it was well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>the set is very professional, full size and worth the money.</li>
            <li>THESE ARE SO PROFESSIONAL BRUSHES, INSTEAD OF PAYING AN ARM AND LEG FOR M.A.C BRUSHES, THESE WORK JUST FINE</li>
            <li>When firstly opening, there were 12 brushes covered with the plastic packages to protect the dirt.</li>
            <li>Many various brushes for all your needs, has instructions for what brushes does what.</li>
            <li>really like this product and would recommend it!</li>
            <li>she adores the color and obviously she fell in love with the over all packaging.</li>
            <li>However when getting them, they we&#x27;re more of a beet red?</li>
            <li>Buy brushes as per your need as most brushes in the set are not essential</li>
            <li>Some one described it appropriately as &#x27;beet red.&#x27;</li>
            <li>and fast shipment!</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to spend so much when i already had a good selection of brushes</li>
            <li>and she loves them just as much as her Mac brushes.</li>
            <li>I also really love the pink or \\&quot;coral\\&quot; color.</li>
            <li>Thanks to everyone that worked to my product came to my house.</li>
            <li>, SHIPPING WAS FAST</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all-around functionality.</li>
            <li>Pink is my favorite color...</li>
            <li>&#x27;m not quite sure what other brands.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set and would absolutely purchase them again.</li>
            <li>i bought this brush set for my wife mainly because she is a make up artist.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes to anyone who is just beginning in the world of makeup.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend everyone to get this set.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend others to get this product</li>
            <li>I was head over heels in love with the pink color; however, it&#x27;s not pink at all.  </li>
            <li>, they are authentic sigma brushes, I&#x27;ve felt other brushes from dif brands before but no other compare</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my new set of Sigma brushes for a few weeks now and have to admit I love them.  </li>
            <li>I might as well buy it for that price and live with it.</li>
            <li>This is my first review ever, and clearly I should have read current reviews for this item.  </li>
            <li>The larger brushes come with a plastic sleeve and the case is large and sturdy.</li>
            <li>There were also the postcards and manual of each brush coming with the box and it clearly explains the usage.</li>
            <li>Especially the beginner or who wants to wear makeup in the natural looks must use these stuffs.</li>
            <li>They are soft and put together well.</li>
            <li>Because She told me that she had been longing for this kit, and I surprised her with the gift.</li>
            <li>For the usage, to be frank, I am not the user, but I have been touched by the soft bristle on my face ,and even though I am a man, the tenderness of it attracts me to touch it and pad it on my face over and over again.     </li>
            <li>Make me Classy in February and arrived punctually at the time.</li>
            <li>With these brushes I know my makeup looks well executed and professional.    </li>
            <li>so when i found this complete set of brushes, i decided to buy and give it her.</li>
            <li>I did experience some shedding with the large powder brush (F30) and the Duo Fibre (F50) during the first few washes and applications.  </li>
            <li>I think I am going to purchase those brushes and other products from Sigma Beauty again to give my friends the special presents in this near future.</li>
            <li>I guess since I am spending so much on make up and single brushes.</li>
            <li>A little pricy but worth it.</li>
            <li>Then, of course, for travelling you just put all of the brushes fit into one half and use the other as a lid.</li>
            <li>I thought I would recieve a small free gift as mentioned from the other reviews</li>

            <li> In addition, there was a postcard instructing the user how to keep and clean after use.</li>
            <li> Not only are the Sigma Brush Kit&#x27;s the Best they also come with pretty fast dilivery.</li>
            <li> Thus, please wisely read and be neutral to my personal opinion.     </li>
            <li> Out of all the brushes the contour is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li> So I ordered these on April 11, 2013, got them within the estimated shipping date, when I received them the packaging was good, but the kit looks totally different than in the picture</li>
            <li> of course my daughter loved them second set I bought!</li>
            <li> That means it is able to be easily used by the beginner to the professional make-up artist.</li>
            <li> Other than color the quality is great</li>
            <li> know pretty much nothing about brushes or make-up, so the most valuable part of this set was the pamphlet that accompanied it that included the name and intended use of each brush.  </li>
            <li> I loved it till this day and haven&#x27;t even felt a single regret about it.</li>
            <li> The color is really pretty, you won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly!!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are well made, easy to clean and really enable you to get the right amount of color exactly where you want it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the special product that helps me picking the special gift to my girlfriend.   </li>
            <li> cannot say enough amazing things about this products</li>
            <li> I wanted to see if it was worth the price and the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to play around with it.</li>
            <li> I had never found good brushes in Pink...</li>
            <li> The write-ups are detailed, letting you know if a brush is intended for liquid or loose pigments, etc., and it&#x27;s been a great reference for someone who up until recently only wore lipstick on special occassions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ultimately, I would like to suggest to purchase this kit if you want to try something new with the reasonable pricebut great quality.</li>
            <li> I hesitated to make the purchase because of the higher price tag, but it was well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> the set is very professional, full size and worth the money.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE SO PROFESSIONAL BRUSHES, INSTEAD OF PAYING AN ARM AND LEG FOR M.A.C BRUSHES, THESE WORK JUST FINE</li>
            <li> When firstly opening, there were 12 brushes covered with the plastic packages to protect the dirt.</li>
            <li> Many various brushes for all your needs, has instructions for what brushes does what.</li>
            <li> really like this product and would recommend it!</li>
            <li> she adores the color and obviously she fell in love with the over all packaging.</li>
            <li> However when getting them, they we&#x27;re more of a beet red?</li>
            <li> Buy brushes as per your need as most brushes in the set are not essential</li>
            <li> Some one described it appropriately as &#x27;beet red.&#x27;</li>
            <li> and fast shipment!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to spend so much when i already had a good selection of brushes</li>
            <li> and she loves them just as much as her Mac brushes.</li>
            <li> I also really love the pink or \\&quot;coral\\&quot; color.</li>
            <li> Thanks to everyone that worked to my product came to my house.</li>
            <li> , SHIPPING WAS FAST</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all-around functionality.</li>
            <li> Pink is my favorite color...</li>
            <li> &#x27;m not quite sure what other brands.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set and would absolutely purchase them again.</li>
            <li> i bought this brush set for my wife mainly because she is a make up artist.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brushes to anyone who is just beginning in the world of makeup.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend everyone to get this set.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend others to get this product</li>
            <li> I was head over heels in love with the pink color; however, it&#x27;s not pink at all.  </li>
            <li> , they are authentic sigma brushes, I&#x27;ve felt other brushes from dif brands before but no other compare</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my new set of Sigma brushes for a few weeks now and have to admit I love them.  </li>
            <li> I might as well buy it for that price and live with it.</li>
            <li> This is my first review ever, and clearly I should have read current reviews for this item.  </li>
            <li> The larger brushes come with a plastic sleeve and the case is large and sturdy.</li>
            <li> There were also the postcards and manual of each brush coming with the box and it clearly explains the usage.</li>
            <li> Especially the beginner or who wants to wear makeup in the natural looks must use these stuffs.</li>
            <li> They are soft and put together well.</li>
            <li> Because She told me that she had been longing for this kit, and I surprised her with the gift.</li>
            <li> For the usage, to be frank, I am not the user, but I have been touched by the soft bristle on my face ,and even though I am a man, the tenderness of it attracts me to touch it and pad it on my face over and over again.     </li>
            <li> Make me Classy in February and arrived punctually at the time.</li>
            <li> With these brushes I know my makeup looks well executed and professional.    </li>
            <li> so when i found this complete set of brushes, i decided to buy and give it her.</li>
            <li> I did experience some shedding with the large powder brush (F30) and the Duo Fibre (F50) during the first few washes and applications.  </li>
            <li> I think I am going to purchase those brushes and other products from Sigma Beauty again to give my friends the special presents in this near future.</li>
            <li> I guess since I am spending so much on make up and single brushes.</li>
            <li> A little pricy but worth it.</li>
            <li> Then, of course, for travelling you just put all of the brushes fit into one half and use the other as a lid.</li>
            <li> I thought I would recieve a small free gift as mentioned from the other reviews</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and do not fall out sticking to your face like other brushes.</li>
            <li> ,  I know they will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> When i ordered these they showed the picture as being all pink and when i opened the package it was different then what i had ordered and a different color.</li>
            <li> i compared them to my other sigma brushes of the same set that i had (but different color).</li>
            <li> of course the colors (they come in pink, blue, or purple)</li>
            <li> it was a deep dark purple.</li>
            <li> Each half is basically a brush \\&quot;cup\\&quot; where you can place your brushes vertically for regular use.  </li>
            <li> The shedding seems to only be associated with the black bristles.</li>
            <li> Pink, blue and black.</li>
            <li> On the other hand I was looking through my brushes and they gave two of the same brush, so one brush was left out from the set :/</li>
            <li> This set consists of 12 brushes for face and eyes utility, accompanying with the synthetic leather cylinder case in Coral (for me it looks pink).  </li>
            <li> These brushes were everything I expected them to be.</li>
            <li> -The shipment arrived sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> These are NOT real sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> In ordering these brushes, I specifically had ordered them because they we&#x27;re pink.</li>
            <li> You shouldn&#x27;t make them look so pink on the website, when they&#x27;re really not that pink.</li>
            <li> but i returned them due to not being what i expected.</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes outbeat Mac brushes and all other brushes Ive ever had.</li>
            <li> The color online looks pink but in person it was a dark maroon.</li>
            <li> Please look at other customer&#x27;s pictures before ordering.</li>
            <li> Not don&#x27;t get me wrong, these brushes are soft, however, if i purchase sigma brushes, i expect sigma brushes or at least SIMILAR quality or these to be a quarter of the price i paid for.</li>
            <li> I had a small collection of brushes from MAC and Target</li>
            <li> IF NOT BETTER.</li>
            <li> The brush kit arrived safely no damage.</li>
            <li> These are way less dense and the quality is not great.</li>
            <li> If i could give this a negative 5 stars, i would!</li>
            <li> Overall I am disappointed with this order.</li>
            <li> So I am a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday!!!!</li>
            <li> me Crazy - Purple.\\</li>
            <li> Turns out its not that bad.</li>
            <li> Just give them a try I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered these in &amp;#34;Make Me Blush&amp;#34; and I was very disappointed with the color.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Worst brushs ever.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These brushes came fast and are amazing!  I love the eye brushes!  I ended up buying my mom a set and she loves them just as much as her Mac brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes come nicely packaged in a stylish and sturdy cylindrical case.  The colors are brilliant with a sleek dark coral handle stamped with hologram text and a metallic satin finished ferrule.The brushes are amazing . Glad to deal with you .</li>
            <li> I been looking for this item for a while and when I found it on Amazon.com, I decided to wait on it because the price and put it in my cart to hold. Every time I log on to the computer I kept thinking about buying it or not. I wanted to see if it was worth the price and the product. I went onto YouTube.com to see videos about it and its rating. Turns out its not that bad. I guess since I am spending so much on make up and single brushes. I might as well buy it for that price and live with it. When I received the brushes in the mail, it turned out really nice. I loved it till this day and haven&#x27;t even felt a single regret about it.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. They are soft and put together well. Never had a problem with them yet. Easy to clean</li>
            <li> I got these brushes for my girlfriend. I was a bit hesitant to get them for her since shes uses MAC brushes &amp; I&#x27;m not quite sure what other brands. Yet I knew for sure she didn&#x27;t have these in her collection. The deverse colors caught my eye &amp; I thought heck why not add some color to her collection. Well let me tell you she loved them!!! She can&#x27;t stop raving about them how good they are &amp; how they feel. You can say she compared some of them to her MAC brushes which I would say is a GREAT thing!! Just give them a try I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes outbeat Mac brushes and all other brushes Ive ever had.The bristles are soft and do not fall out sticking to your face like other brushes.I love this case because you can put the brushes in it! Its convenient cute and cant leave without it!</li>
            <li> Great makeup brushes  the set is very professional, full size and worth the money. Loved them sooo much I bought my mom a set too and we are both very pleased. The color is really pretty, you won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> I ordered Sigma Beauty 12 Brush Kit for my girlfriend as her birthday gift from Amazon.com. Because She told me that she had been longing for this kit, and I surprised her with the gift. Before the review, I must inform that the comment on these products shared  by me and my girl only. Thus, please wisely read and be neutral to my personal opinion.     In fact, I have heard that the sigma brushes are quite similar to ones of MAC but a lot more cheaper, which I couldn&#x27;t agree more !! However, my girlfriend told that the difference between them was the density of bristle, of which MAC is more dense. On the contrary, the sigma is dense enough to make my girl beautiful and she prefers the way to put the flawless makeup with it.     This set consists of 12 brushes for face and eyes utility, accompanying with the synthetic leather cylinder case in Coral (for me it looks pink).  When firstly opening, there were 12 brushes covered with the plastic packages to protect the dirt. There are 7 eye-function brushes and 5 face function brushes.  The handle of each brush is the same color as case and my girl just loves it. Its length is dextrous and easy to hold. The case is as well convenient to carry  ,though it is not the travel kit.    For the usage, to be frank, I am not the user, but I have been touched by the soft bristle on my face ,and even though I am a man, the tenderness of it attracts me to touch it and pad it on my face over and over again.     There were also the postcards and manual of each brush coming with the box and it clearly explains the usage. That means it is able to be easily used by the beginner to the professional make-up artist. In addition, there was a postcard instructing the user how to keep and clean after use. I recommend to place it on the dressing table and place it on wherever is noticeable to remind you after finishing make up.    Ultimately, I would like to suggest to purchase this kit if you want to try something new with the reasonable pricebut great quality. Especially the beginner or who wants to wear makeup in the natural looks must use these stuffs. Thanks for the special product that helps me picking the special gift to my girlfriend.   I think I am going to purchase those brushes and other products from Sigma Beauty again to give my friends the special presents in this near future.</li>
            <li> I just loved my new brushes .... arrived on schedule, well packaged and great quality! The color is wonderful and the brushes are very soft, I recommend to all! Definitely every woman deserves this kit</li>
            <li> These brushes were everything I expected them to be. They&#x27;re very soft and of great quality. The brush holder is very cute and looks very pretty on my vanity table. I highly recommend these brushes to anyone who is just beginning in the world of makeup.</li>
            <li> A little pricy but worth it. Many various brushes for all your needs, has instructions for what brushes does what. I also really love the pink or \\&quot;coral\\&quot; color. The brushes are really soft, synthetic made, which is a good thing. Perfect for beginners and advanced as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product and would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE my new Sigma makeup brushes!!! just opening the box was an experience! I love the brush holder it comes with, it sure makes it easy to find the brush you need. All the brushes are of high quality, i like them better than MAC brushes and i also love the price! it a must buy if you use makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my new set of Sigma brushes for a few weeks now and have to admit I love them.  I was a little hesitant to spend so much when i already had a good selection of brushes but I&#x27;m so glad I did!  The brushes are well made, easy to clean and really enable you to get the right amount of color exactly where you want it.  Out of all the brushes the contour is my absolute favorite.  The case is also well made and sturdy which is a huge bonus for me since I travel a great deal and it just makes it easy to grab them and go knowing they will be well protected despite the damage luggage handlers seem to love sending in my direction.  I highly recommend this set and would absolutely purchase them again.</li>
            <li> Not only are the Sigma Brush Kit&#x27;s the Best they also come with pretty fast dilivery. They even provide great customer service.</li>
            <li> Nothing but rave reviews from our daughters - they say the Sigma brushes make a big difference vs. lower quality brushes</li>
            <li> I bought a Sigma Make me Classy in February and arrived punctually at the time. I loved the product and also enjoyed attending the Sigma Makeup when needed, the clerk Stacey congratulations for your attention and patience with me. I am very pleased with my purchase. Thanks to everyone that worked to my product came to my house. Margareth de Souza</li>
            <li> This is a great introductory set of quality brushes at a reasonable price.  Each brush is individually packaged to protect it during shipment, and the larger brushes include reusable sleeves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know pretty much nothing about brushes or make-up, so the most valuable part of this set was the pamphlet that accompanied it that included the name and intended use of each brush.  The write-ups are detailed, letting you know if a brush is intended for liquid or loose pigments, etc., and it&#x27;s been a great reference for someone who up until recently only wore lipstick on special occassions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case in the picture opens up into two separate pieces (if you look closely in the picture, the two bumps in the middle of the sides of the case are actually snaps).  Each half is basically a brush \\&quot;cup\\&quot; where you can place your brushes vertically for regular use.  Then, of course, for travelling you just put all of the brushes fit into one half and use the other as a lid.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these brushes!!! They&#x27;re soft, durable and easy to clean!! Definitely worth the price! I highly recommend everyone to get this set. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Ohhh, love these!  The brushes are wonderful, very high quality. Especially love the large brush because it feels so good on the face. All the brushes are made to perform the task they were created for with precision and function in mind. Beautiful design and color. Cleans well and travels well.</li>
            <li> I ordered these in &amp;#34;Make Me Blush&amp;#34; and I was very disappointed with the color. The color online looks pink but in person it was a dark maroon. I returned them and ordered the purple set from Sigma&#x27;s website and again it was not a brighter purple it was a deep dark purple. I decided to keep them even though the color was WAY OFF. Other than color the quality is great and I&#x27;m enjoying my brushes. Please look at other customer&#x27;s pictures before ordering.</li>
            <li> great brushes. had them for about 6 months and none of them shed. amazing quality! cannot say enough amazing things about this products</li>
            <li> Totally worth the hype!  I purchased this kit in \\&quot;Color me Crazy - Purple.\\&quot;  I would consider myself a beginner in makeup application and use basic techniques.  I had a small collection of brushes from MAC and Target but now this is all I use.  I hesitated to make the purchase because of the higher price tag, but it was well worth the investment.  With these brushes I know my makeup looks well executed and professional.    Here are the PROS:  -The shipment arrived sooner than expected.  -The brushes were neatly packaged, four of which came with brush guards.  -There were simple instructions for cleaning and a brochure explaining the best use of each brush.  -A free gift was included!  -They truly are great quality; they pick up product, distribute it nicely and feel good on my face.   -The brushes are all full size!!  (For some reason I was expecting more of a travel size kit.)  -And of course the colors (they come in pink, blue, or purple) all great and the case is convenient and cute.    Now for the CONS:  I did experience some shedding with the large powder brush (F30) and the Duo Fibre (F50) during the first few washes and applications.  The shedding seems to only be associated with the black bristles. With use, the shedding has reduced significantly.     I LOVE LOVE LOVE these brushes.  I am happy with my purchase and think you will be too.</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes I have ever used. I cousion has a set and I started to use hers. Just the way your makeup turns out is so amazing. I love it. and if you are into makeup and fashion these brushes are a must have.....</li>
            <li> i bought this brush set for my wife mainly because she is a make up artist. second she loves the quality of the brushes and been bragging out sigma brushes. so when i found this complete set of brushes, i decided to buy and give it her. she adores the color and obviously she fell in love with the over all packaging. quality is awesome.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN WANTING THESE BRUSHES FOR A YEAR NOW AND I FINALLY GOT THEM, SHIPPING WAS FAST AND THE PRICE WAS PERFECT, YOU EVEN GET A FREE BRUSH. THESE ARE SO PROFESSIONAL BRUSHES, INSTEAD OF PAYING AN ARM AND LEG FOR M.A.C BRUSHES, THESE WORK JUST FINE IF NOT BETTER. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> As a man I know nothing of makeup brushes. But my girls reaction when i gave them to her was about 5 stars! So I guess these are awesome brushes! Great gift!</li>
            <li> These brushes truely are superb. This particular set is a great one for it&#x27;s all-around functionality. Everything you need is in this convienient case!</li>
            <li> If i could give this a negative 5 stars, i would! I meant to buy this set for my friend&#x27;s graduation present. When i got these, I wanted to make sure i got al the brushes that it said it included. These are NOT real sigma brushes. i compared them to my other sigma brushes of the same set that i had (but different color). They&#x27;re not the same AT ALL. These are way less dense and the quality is not great. Not don&#x27;t get me wrong, these brushes are soft, however, if i purchase sigma brushes, i expect sigma brushes or at least SIMILAR quality or these to be a quarter of the price i paid for. These are NOT. DO NOT purchase sigma brushes on amazon. I Suggest buying these on the sigma website. TRUST ME.</li>
            <li> Brush kit special and wonderful and prices of less than Sigma&#x27;s official website, with a portfolio of elegant brush of the skin and I would recommend my colleagues to buy them and thank</li>
            <li> In ordering these brushes, I specifically had ordered them because they we&#x27;re pink. However when getting them, they we&#x27;re more of a beet red? So I am a little disappointed. You shouldn&#x27;t make them look so pink on the website, when they&#x27;re really not that pink. Overall I am disappointed with this order.</li>
            <li> So I ordered these on April 11, 2013, got them within the estimated shipping date, when I received them the packaging was good, but the kit looks totally different than in the picture, they are authentic sigma brushes, I&#x27;ve felt other brushes from dif brands before but no other compare these are ridiculously soft, perfect quality,  I know they will last a very long time. ask the seller  to send you an updated picture because I think this is the old sigma kit, also Amazon customer service was amazing!</li>
            <li> When i ordered these they showed the picture as being all pink and when i opened the package it was different then what i had ordered and a different color. Very disappointed but the brushes were a good quality but i returned them due to not being what i expected.</li>
            <li> Full confident feeling once you use sigma beauty. I couldn&#x27;t believe that brush would give me this feeling. Many colors u can chose from. Pink, blue and black. Just give it a try&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t miss it !</li>
            <li> What can I say but excellent of course my daughter loved them second set I bought! We use them everyday.i recommend these brushes. They are a five star. Every girl in my family wanted one Lol</li>
            <li> I love it. Its soft and works really good. It&#x27;s fun to play around with it. I highly recommend others to get this product</li>
            <li> Worst brushs ever. Buy brushes as per your need as most brushes in the set are not essential</li>
            <li> Excelente producto  diluye el maquillaje en el rostro sin dejar líneas marcadas, al igual q los pinceles para aplicar las sombras</li>
            <li> This is not my first set of sigma brushes and although the brushes are a good quality I must point out that this set did not come in the colors pictured in the item description.</li>
            <li> This is my first review ever, and clearly I should have read current reviews for this item.  I was head over heels in love with the pink color; however, it&#x27;s not pink at all.  Some one described it appropriately as &#x27;beet red.&#x27; Quality brushes, but they won&#x27;t make you blush :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#Disappointed</li>
            <li> amazing !!! and fast shipment!</li>
            <li> The brushes and case are beautiful!!! The larger brushes come with a plastic sleeve and the case is large and sturdy. I recommend this product highly!!! Its packaged safely, shipped quickly, and boxed gift-ready!!!</li>
            <li> Pink is my favorite color... I had never found good brushes in Pink... these are my favorite from all my makeup brushes collections... I use them everyday!!!! LOVE THEM!!!</li>
            <li> The brush kit arrived safely no damage. I love all the brushes, they are good quality brushes and nice and soft too. I love that I can pick what color brushes I want. On the other hand I was looking through my brushes and they gave two of the same brush, so one brush was left out from the set :/ They gave me two Medium Angled Shading E70 brushes when I shouldn&#x27;ve recieved the Eye shading brush E55. I thought I would recieve a small free gift as mentioned from the other reviews but I didn&#x27;t. Oh well, despite that I&#x27;m still happy.</li>
