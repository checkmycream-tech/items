            <li>quick.</li>
            <li>So glad we were able to get it at Amazon because they no longer carry it at any of our local stores.</li>
            <li>To their credit (AMerica RX) they responded quickly.</li>
            <li>Shipped pretty Fast too!</li>
            <li>This was delivered to my home shortly after purchase so I am pleased with the seller and would use them again.  </li>

            <li>Vince powder can cure a mouth ulcer much faster than any other product sold plus it has no harsh ingredients such as alcohol  to further irritate the wounded tissue.</li>

            <li> The product is fine but too expensive to  pay that price for only 1.5 oz.  </li>
            <li> more bad breath!&lt;br</li>
            <li> (If they wanted to offer a partial refund, they should check their math:  </li>
            <li> Expected the 4.5 oz.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this product for an upcoming trip but  it&#x27;s not worth packing a largely empty bottle, so</li>
            <li> Recommend this product hands down.</li>
            <li> She told me to put a small amount of the dry powder on the bump a couple of times a day and it would stop hurting and disappear.</li>
            <li> but it only takes a very small amount to start working  its&#x27; miracle healing.</li>
            <li> FOR A LOT LESS MONEY</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller after opening the plastic wrapping and noticing the bottle has less than 1/3 the product in it.</li>
            <li> 2/3 product missing should be equivalent to 2/3 refund of purchase price not 1/3).  </li>
            <li> I think other buyers (on another site) had also complained about the packaging and missing product.</li>
            <li> Hard to find ,fare price</li>
            <li> friend of mine was going through chemotherapy a few years ago and developed very painful sores in her mouth as a side effect of the chemo.</li>
            <li> Once the factory seal is broken, it has to be discarded.</li>
            <li> I had one of those painful little bumps on my tongue.</li>
            <li> TOO EXPENSIVE FOR TOOTH POWDER.  </li>
            <li> Really expensive from what it used to be.</li>
            <li> the item is useless for my intended purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is expensive stuff</li>

            <li> Similar to a product I used to purchase called Amosan, which is no longer manufacturers.  The active ingredient is the BEST for ANY oral sores you may have.</li>
            <li> TOO EXPENSIVE FOR TOOTH POWDER.  I USED HIS PRODUCT YEARS AGO FOR A LOT LESS MONEY</li>
            <li> Helped a lot.  Good feature is you can apply it only to the sore spots.  Good value.  Overseas postage was reasonable and rel. quick.</li>
            <li> Really expensive from what it used to be.</li>
            <li> perfect! my mom used this stuff in the 70&#x27;s - 90&#x27;s and she had most of her teeth when she passed away. I started using it and it has helped my gums, the dental tech said my gums had improved from sad to excellent in just a few months. I brush with it like toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Good for all those mouth and tongue discomforts.</li>
            <li> We always like to keep Vince around for when we start getting mouth sores.  Nothing works better. So glad we were able to get it at Amazon because they no longer carry it at any of our local stores.</li>
            <li> This is a product that was always in my household and a child and as an adult I&#x27;ve always kept in medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;It is the greatest for canker sores, heals them rapidly  and excellent  for any irritations to the gums or tongue. It is&lt;br /&gt;a shame that the company has gone out of business or that the product has been eliminated, I have purchased enough&lt;br /&gt;to last me for the next 15 years I hope.</li>
            <li> Product is not FACTORY SEALED.  Looks like someone decanted product from one bottle to another and didn&#x27;t even bother to fill the bottle (was about half full).  Didn&#x27;t trust to use it, as it should be FACTORY SEALED, and not sealed with Saran Wrap!  You cannot resell &amp;#34;medicines&amp;#34;.  Once the factory seal is broken, it has to be discarded.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product about 30 years ago. I had one of those painful little bumps on my tongue. A friend had some vince powder. She told me to put a small amount of the dry powder on the bump a couple of times a day and it would stop hurting and disappear. She was right! The next day it was gone. I have used it ever since with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another friend told me that they recommend it in their dental practice as a rinse (diluted in water.) No more bad breath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine was going through chemotherapy a few years ago and developed very painful sores in her mouth as a side effect of the chemo. I suggested she try using vince as a rinse. She told me that it was so effective that she told her oncologist that he should recommend it to chemo patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always keep this on hand. I hope it works as well for others. I&#x27;m sold on it!</li>
            <li> It works wonders. Helped heal the sores for new dentures. Recommend this product hands down.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it has always worked for me.</li>
            <li> Works great for various types of mouth sores.</li>
            <li> For the price this is a rip off!</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller after opening the plastic wrapping and noticing the bottle has less than 1/3 the product in it. To their credit (AMerica RX) they responded quickly. But they refunded only 1/3 the purchase price instead of offering a replacement or full refund for the inconvenience.  (If they wanted to offer a partial refund, they should check their math:  2/3 product missing should be equivalent to 2/3 refund of purchase price not 1/3).  I had ordered this product for an upcoming trip but  it&#x27;s not worth packing a largely empty bottle, so the item is useless for my intended purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I  will not buy from this company again or the seller. Will stick to diluted hydrogen peroxide in the future.  I think other buyers (on another site) had also complained about the packaging and missing product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 8 years very good satisfied.</li>
            <li> This was offered to me in 1975 after my wisdom teeth were removed. It helped me heal then and its doing a great job now. I tried to buy it at several drug stores but they had no idea what I was talking about. Thank GOD for the internet and AMAZON.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Great! It helped me a lot. Shipped pretty Fast too!</li>
            <li> The seller sent the Vince powder on time and it was packaged well.  Vince powder is the best thing for canker sores in your mouth.  It does burn a little when you apply it, but it heals the sore quickly and I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, but too expensive</li>
            <li> Vince powder can cure a mouth ulcer much faster than any other product sold plus it has no harsh ingredients such as alcohol  to further irritate the wounded tissue. This is expensive stuff but it only takes a very small amount to start working  its&#x27; miracle healing.</li>
            <li> Expected the 4.5 oz. size that I got the last time for the same cost!!!  The product is fine but too expensive to  pay that price for only 1.5 oz.  I&#x27;ll buy elsewhere next time.</li>
            <li> This was delivered to my home shortly after purchase so I am pleased with the seller and would use them again.  I have used this product since I was a child and it works to keep your gums healthy.</li>
            <li> Hard to find ,fare price</li>
            <li> Great Great Great can,t get it anywhere else&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
            <li> Have used it for years. Was so glad to find it. My pharmacy no longer gets it. This should last me several more years. Thanks</li>
