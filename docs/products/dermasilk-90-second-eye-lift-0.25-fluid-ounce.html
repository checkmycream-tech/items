            <li>Try it its amazing!</li>
            <li>I saw this product on the Rachel Ray show and thought that if they had the product on her show that it would probably have good results but it did not.</li>
            <li>I have no idea how people can write a good review on Dermasilk.</li>
            <li>Vaseline works better!</li>
            <li>REally pricey for a dud!!!!!  </li>
            <li>I did find that this product does help my sagging eye lids and and when used a couple of hours before going out it does an amazing job of lift my lids and takes years off my age.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions to the letter and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>It makes a lot of claims and to be honest I didn&#x27;t believe them.  </li>
            <li>I have sensative skin and it is very soothing, great stuff!</li>
            <li>I really liked this product form the get go.  </li>
            <li>For someone who has very droopy eylids and can&#x27;t afford plastic surgery, this is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Thought price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>It seemed I saw more wrinkles when I used it.  </li>
            <li>and it does not do anything but bring out my wrinkles even more.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>For this amount of money, it is better you can buy something else.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was watching that day.</li>
            <li>Im glad I did not read reviews before I purchased this or would not have purchased.  </li>
            <li>Tried many...</li>
            <li>After applying foundation, the appearance around my eyes was even better.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>You might think you look okay,</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t notice a hugh difference, but perhaps overtime, improvement will be more noticeable, since my undereye puffiness is more hereditary than from lack of sleep.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful - and lasts the entire day without reapplication and you can use under makeup - its invisible</li>
            <li>Youthology was 10 times better.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>Her skin on forehead, nose, chin all look better.</li>
            <li>Again, ok.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>After concealer application, I was even more amazed.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend purchasing this great product.</li>
            <li>Great product, love it, can&#x27;t live without</li>
            <li>Wait till it dries to get the full effect before you walk away from your mirror!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use; works under make-up.</li>
            <li>ALSO, it contains pthalate, which is a plasticizer that easily leaches through the skin.  </li>
            <li>If you use it and do not apply makeup, it makes you look kind of funny.</li>
            <li>Preh H cream not ointment, works fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This is inexpensive and also cheap.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>When I saw it here at such a great price, I had to order</li>
            <li>It leaves a white residue around your eyes that doesn&#x27;t look very nice.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this because the reviews were that is was like Youthology.  </li>
            <li>I originally found out about it on the Racheal Ray show.</li>
            <li>Then they told me I&#x27;d have to order the original item in a couple of weeks, because it was out of stock.  </li>
            <li>None of the packages were full, must have been opened or rejected at manufacture.</li>
            <li>The company let me keep product already received and gave me a full refund.  </li>
            <li>I love Dermasilk products and highly recommend them to everyone!</li>
            <li>You may as well put super glue on your face.  </li>
            <li>Service receiving it from Amazon was really quick.</li>
            <li>works super well until you smile</li>
            <li>My eyes looked so fresh and bright all day long.  </li>
            <li>It really does help minimize bags and fine lines.</li>
            <li>do not waste ur money, catsup, glue or even dirt would probably would work better.</li>
            <li>I does get rid of the wrinkles until you smile, then it cracks and flakes.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>But this film can \\&quot;crack\\&quot; when you smile.  </li>
            <li>but it flakes off right away.</li>
            <li>and they have helped me choose the right product.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>I am very gentle when blending the concealer.</li>
            <li>Followed instructions exactly, still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it the first time I tried it</li>
            <li>Then I tried it, the first time I applied it</li>
            <li>This product really does work!  </li>
            <li>The company is well aware that the pump in the bottle doesn&#x27;t work, but hasn&#x27;t done anything about it.</li>
            <li>It only temporary like 24 hours but works and opens eyes up more...</li>
            <li>I have considered looking into getting cosmetic surgery done because of under-eye puffiness, which I feel is the first thing people notice about me.</li>
            <li>It would have been better if the person on the phone spoke \\&quot;clear\\&quot; English!  </li>
            <li>Used it for several years, love the product, have difficulty finding</li>
            <li>I love it and will not go back to Oil of Olay!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It did exactly what it said it would.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>If you pause on the before/after shot, you can see that the lady&#x27;s entire face looks better, not just under her eyes.</li>
            <li>so I thought \\&quot;why not try it?\\&quot;  I used it for the first time yesterday morning and was AMAZED.</li>
            <li>This is good for going out at night and want to maintain a firm morning look.  </li>
            <li>He loves it and says that it really works all although it&#x27;s a little bit on the pricey side, it&#x27;s still a good buy.</li>
            <li>First if you use too much, it will flake off.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and made sure my moisturizer was dry before applying.  </li>
            <li>patted light amount on liquid while exaggerating my eyes open</li>
            <li>I tried a light coat of Vaseline under eyes hoping it might absorb or help with the glue-like substance when it dries, dries white glue-like.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it worked very well on me.</li>
            <li>and then I noticed that it really did work well around my eyes, and my puffiness was just about gone.</li>
            <li>This product does absolutely nothing, despite it&#x27;s salty cost.</li>
            <li>and I really thought it would work, but when applied it just dries up</li>
            <li>I really can tell a difference.</li>
            <li>A wee bit too much</li>
            <li>This can be very embarrassing.  </li>
            <li>I expected it to be better for  the price.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product !</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and really like it.  </li>
            <li>I may very well order it again when I am out because the prce here cannot be beat.</li>
            <li>It really works on under eye bags.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product &amp; I am very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My main concern was to reduce puffiness</li>
            <li>As we get older, and things begin to sag a bit...</li>
            <li>use a high quality foundation brush.)</li>
            <li>It immediately dried out my lower eye area giving me more wrinkles than when I started out.  </li>
            <li>As far as wrinkles go well ofcourse when the puffiness goes down you will see more wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s dirt cheap compared to all these other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fortunately I purchased the product before reading the reviews on this and other sites.</li>
            <li>Those of us with eye bags aren&#x27;t anxious to draw even more attention to an area we&#x27;re already self-conscious about.  </li>
            <li>It works exactly as stated and if the directions are followed does not leave a white residue whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I suppose the premise is that it dries like a (supposedly) clear glue, creating a film that tightens the puffy under-eye area.  </li>
            <li>The bags under my eyes were making me look so tired and aged me greatly.</li>
            <li>I have very saggy eyelids which will actually interfere with vision.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>DRY AND FULL OF WHITE FLAKES.</li>
            <li>Other reviews warned not to purchase this product because of the powder residue that it leaves under your eyes, they were correct, save your money, it makes your face feel like it is going to crack if you even think about a smile.</li>
            <li>I applied a slight amount (about a drop) of the DermaSilk 90 Second Eye Lift cream under each eye and noticed a significant difference--no more tired and old looking eyes anymore.</li>
            <li>Pretty much does what it says, but hard to wear without makeup.  </li>
            <li>I tried a tiny drop possible and still left a very noticeable residue.  </li>
            <li>If this happens, just wet your finger a bit and rub the flaky area gently.</li>
            <li>I have tried several products that say they will get rid of puffiness and such, but only Dermasilk really does that.</li>
            <li>But I do have to be careful NOT to apply too much as it &amp;#34;cakes&amp;#34; or looks like &amp;#34;peeling skin&amp;#34; after sunburn.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s ok but definitely not great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to apply the right amount, if you don&#x27;t put on enough, it doesn&#x27;t work, if you put on too much, you get a white residue when it dries.  </li>

            <li> It really works on under eye bags.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product &amp; I am very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My main concern was to reduce puffiness</li>
            <li> As we get older, and things begin to sag a bit...</li>
            <li> use a high quality foundation brush.)</li>
            <li> It immediately dried out my lower eye area giving me more wrinkles than when I started out.  </li>
            <li> As far as wrinkles go well ofcourse when the puffiness goes down you will see more wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dirt cheap compared to all these other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fortunately I purchased the product before reading the reviews on this and other sites.</li>
            <li> Those of us with eye bags aren&#x27;t anxious to draw even more attention to an area we&#x27;re already self-conscious about.  </li>
            <li> It works exactly as stated and if the directions are followed does not leave a white residue whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I suppose the premise is that it dries like a (supposedly) clear glue, creating a film that tightens the puffy under-eye area.  </li>
            <li> The bags under my eyes were making me look so tired and aged me greatly.</li>
            <li> I have very saggy eyelids which will actually interfere with vision.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> DRY AND FULL OF WHITE FLAKES.</li>
            <li> Other reviews warned not to purchase this product because of the powder residue that it leaves under your eyes, they were correct, save your money, it makes your face feel like it is going to crack if you even think about a smile.</li>
            <li> I applied a slight amount (about a drop) of the DermaSilk 90 Second Eye Lift cream under each eye and noticed a significant difference--no more tired and old looking eyes anymore.</li>
            <li> Pretty much does what it says, but hard to wear without makeup.  </li>
            <li> I tried a tiny drop possible and still left a very noticeable residue.  </li>
            <li> If this happens, just wet your finger a bit and rub the flaky area gently.</li>
            <li> I have tried several products that say they will get rid of puffiness and such, but only Dermasilk really does that.</li>
            <li> But I do have to be careful NOT to apply too much as it &amp;#34;cakes&amp;#34; or looks like &amp;#34;peeling skin&amp;#34; after sunburn.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s ok but definitely not great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to apply the right amount, if you don&#x27;t put on enough, it doesn&#x27;t work, if you put on too much, you get a white residue when it dries.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 44 years old and was looking at least ten years older.</li>
            <li> It certainly was not worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> The bags are almost completely gone and the dark circles also.</li>
            <li> It is an absolutely worthless product and good only for disgarding with the trash.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant about trying this product after all the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I looked for a long time to find something to help with puffy under eyes</li>
            <li> only to find out later you have been walking around with flaking white bits of dried glue under your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Pthalates are being phased out of use due to growing awareness of the dangers they present.</li>
            <li> I have read several of the other reviews</li>
            <li> May have lightened the dark circles a tiny bit but did nothing for wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Quick fix: I put a small amount of moisturizer over it and no more flakes!</li>
            <li> You have to use something like a Qtip, and when the product is down low, you have to find another way to get it out.</li>
            <li> You have to let it dry before adding any other products.</li>
            <li> May help some but was a waste of money for me personally.</li>
            <li> When I called about the wrong item received, they said they&#x27;d send out the correct item right away.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first got the product.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try out some of the other products in their line.</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money, this product is horrible after you apply, it create more wrinkles and it is no way I can put any make up not until I wash it off from my face.</li>
            <li> The only thing that happened was that it made the skin there feel tight which actually was not pleasant.</li>
            <li> but I always wait for it to be on sale and have a coupon also so that the price is usually 50% less than the regular price.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone with dark circles.</li>
            <li> have dark shadows &amp; bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dermasilk 90 second eye lift for at least 5 months now.</li>
            <li> Makes under eye area look smoother and even eliminates some dark area also.</li>
            <li> I am 39 and am plagued with dark circles and puffy eye bags</li>
            <li> I had never heard of this product before...was just walking down the aisle at the supermarket and saw a $10 off coupon.  </li>
            <li> You either have to put a small amount of moisturizer on before or after product, let product dry completly.  </li>
            <li> It make them less severe.</li>
            <li> The product did make my undereyes feel a little tighter.</li>
            <li> Just leaves a white gluey mess on your face,</li>
            <li> Foolishly I spent some hard earned money on this product that did nothing as promised or held out to do.  </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> I applied it way to heavy</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Saw this on The Rachael Ray Show and they showed immediate results!I have been using a couple times/day for a few weeks and still no change.  </li>
            <li> Money waste.</li>
            <li> so if u are 50 and having trouble dealing with it like me try it because botox Dr&#x27;s can&#x27;t help that part of your face..</li>
            <li> waste your money</li>
            <li> and I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> something to help for even a few hours</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE, I really would like my money back minus shipping  </li>
            <li> I think I wasted my money, and this stuff is not cheap!  </li>
            <li> It really makes me angry when companies get away with false advertisement.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Dermasilk 90 Second Eye Lift, expensive for 0.25-Fluid Ounces.  </li>
            <li> Decided to try the product for myself, boy what a waste of money!</li>
            <li> AT LEAST I DIDN&#x27;T WASTE MY MONEY, BUT I HAD TO TRY IT.</li>
            <li> I usually put a skin serum</li>
            <li> When you do that, you usually blot off the product too.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim when my usual eye cream was out of stock at the store.  </li>
            <li> Ridiculous product, i can&#x27;t believe i wasted my money.</li>
            <li> It has decreased the wrinkles around my eyes and lightened the dark areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful and a true waste of money.</li>
            <li> The item is too hard to get out of the container because it is so thick.  </li>
            <li> this helps at least one person.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t find in stores lately ,so I bought 2 of them.</li>
            <li> A very small amount works well.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad batch that was too thick &amp; \\&quot;goopy\\&quot; for human use.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased other products that claim will make the bags and dark circles go away and have been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Terrible I gave it a 1 because it made me laugh when I looked in mirror.......</li>
            <li> BIG RIP OFF AND DISAPPOINTMENT!</li>
            <li> duh!  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> It makes you look worse.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the other bad reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed, especially considering the cost of this product and the hype.  </li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> Well unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> They sent the wrong item.  </li>
            <li> It is  difficult to apply &amp; impossible to use with make-up.</li>
            <li> Made my face tight and felt horrible.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of beauty products in the past and this has to be the worst one I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product, but when I saw it on Rachel Ray I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is usually a very expensive product</li>
            <li> , we&#x27;ll I had bad results within seconds.</li>
            <li> If you add cream around edges it doesn&#x27;t pucker so bad but also doesn&#x27;t tighten as well.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed in Rachel Ray.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s my price for being stupid and believing.</li>
            <li> Now, when I see myself in the mirror, I am not drawn to the annoying bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> then you look truly horrible.  </li>
            <li> I even tried moisturizers, horrible results.  </li>
            <li> Why is this product still on the market, it is truly horrible.</li>
            <li> probably one of the worst products I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This product is awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is a waste of money! When you put it on it feels and looks as putting egg whites on your face. I wish i could get my money back!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a wedding.  I have very saggy eyelids which will actually interfere with vision.  patted light amount on liquid while exaggerating my eyes open and they stayed and looked great.  Of course if you applied cream foundation it will interfere with the liquid you just applied.  I used powder foundation.  Looked great.. No one knew.</li>
            <li> It really makes me angry when companies get away with false advertisement. This product is nothing like they say it is. It leaves a white flaky buidup around the eyes. It certainly was not worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the other bad reviews on this product. I saw this product on the Rachel Ray show and thought that if they had the product on her show that it would probably have good results but it did not. They advertised a product that does not do what they advertised. The only thing the product did in 90 seconds was turn white and flaky.    DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID!</li>
            <li> Dermasilk 90 Second Eye Lift, expensive for 0.25-Fluid Ounces.  May have lightened the dark circles a tiny bit but did nothing for wrinkles.  Asked my husband &amp; mother if they saw any difference, nothing.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product, but when I saw it on Rachel Ray I thought I would give it a try. Although this is not a permanent solution there may never be one.   I did find that this product does help my sagging eye lids and and when used a couple of hours before going out it does an amazing job of lift my lids and takes years off my age.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t listen to the reviews. Decided to try the product for myself, boy what a waste of money! I should have just burned my money instead of buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;The reviews are correct. This product leaves a glue residue under your eyes.  God forbid you put make-up on then you look truly horrible.  I tried a tiny drop possible and still left a very noticeable residue.  Followed instructions exactly, still didn&#x27;t work. Looks flaky and leave a glue-like substance once the product dries. Boy-oh-boy, only if I could return this product; wishful thinking. There is a reason the manufacturer has a no return policy on this product; it&#x27;s junk. I even tried moisturizers, horrible results.  I tried a light coat of Vaseline under eyes hoping it might absorb or help with the glue-like substance when it dries, dries white glue-like.  Why is this product still on the market, it is truly horrible. I didn&#x27;t even want to give this stuff one star. It&#x27;s awful and a true waste of money.</li>
            <li> do not waste ur money, catsup, glue or even dirt would probably would work better. seems like a ripoff to me</li>
            <li> I tried this product twice. I didn&#x27;t like it the first time I tried it so I thought I would give it a second chance. It does tighten your eye area but it flakes off right away. It leaves a white residue around your eyes that doesn&#x27;t look very nice. I didn&#x27;t think it worked very well on me. You could tell that there was something there. I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It flakes and makes ur eyes look mre wrinkle after it drys.</li>
            <li> I did not like the product.  It seemed I saw more wrinkles when I used it.  I am in the process of trying to return it to the company.</li>
            <li> Works well at erasing under eye shadows. Easy to use; works under make-up. I recommend this product to anyone with dark circles.</li>
            <li> Does not work if you plan on moving your face at all.  It makes you look worse. Ridiculous product, i can&#x27;t believe i wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing a demo on TV on the Rachael Ray Show. I was so upset it cost me a fortune and it does not do anything but bring out my wrinkles even more. Made my face tight and felt horrible. Shame on them for this product. Useless.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first got the product.  It makes a lot of claims and to be honest I didn&#x27;t believe them.  Then I tried it, the first time I applied it I applied it way to heavy and I got a film so I took it off with a damp cloth as directed and then I noticed that it really did work well around my eyes, and my puffiness was just about gone. I now will NOT leave the house without it.  I love this product</li>
            <li> None of the packages were full, must have been opened or rejected at manufacture. Thought price was too good to be true. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product really does work!  You need just a drop for both eyes and it lasts all day.  I have sensative skin and it is very soothing, great stuff!</li>
            <li> I should have known anything that says 90 seconds for an eyelift was a joke. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Foolishly I spent some hard earned money on this product that did nothing as promised or held out to do.  It let a flaky residue under the eye and you couldn&#x27;t put on regular foundation.  REally pricey for a dud!!!!!  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me because it made the area around my eye look unnaturally shiny and felt like a film on my skin.  My makeup caked on it which made it look like a mask.</li>
            <li> I definite not recommend this product to any one. Please do not waste your money, this product is horrible after you apply, it create more wrinkles and it is no way I can put any make up not until I wash it off from my face. For this amount of money, it is better you can buy something else.</li>
            <li> Saw this on The Rachael Ray Show and they showed immediate results!I have been using a couple times/day for a few weeks and still no change.  BIG RIP OFF AND DISAPPOINTMENT!</li>
            <li> I saw the demo on Rachael Ray and thought I would give it a try.  It immediately dried out my lower eye area giving me more wrinkles than when I started out.  It had the same effect as spreading egg white under and around my eyes.  ( white residue and all!)  don&#x27;t bother. Vaseline works better!</li>
            <li> The item is too hard to get out of the container because it is so thick.  It is  difficult to apply &amp; impossible to use with make-up. I have used a lot of beauty products in the past and this has to be the worst one I have ever tried.  Maybe I just got a bad batch that was too thick &amp; \\&quot;goopy\\&quot; for human use.  It is an absolutely worthless product and good only for disgarding with the trash.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this because the reviews were that is was like Youthology.  Well unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Just leaves a white gluey mess on your face,</li>
            <li> Other reviews warned not to purchase this product because of the powder residue that it leaves under your eyes, they were correct, save your money, it makes your face feel like it is going to crack if you even think about a smile.</li>
            <li> Money waste. Doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This stuff works and I have been using it for years!</li>
            <li> I use cream prep H and I&#x27;m not kidding.  it is the ONLY thing that works for bags.  All of these anti eye bag have water in then, which actually causes your eye to swell. Preh H cream not ointment, works fantastic.  and it&#x27;s dirt cheap compared to all these other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always read amazon reviews and they have helped me choose the right product.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps at least one person.  The Models have the right idea!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product does absolutely nothing, despite it&#x27;s salty cost. Also, all products from this company have defective systems to get the product out of the jar. You have to use something like a Qtip, and when the product is down low, you have to find another way to get it out. The company is well aware that the pump in the bottle doesn&#x27;t work, but hasn&#x27;t done anything about it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product &amp; I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The product label recommends putting a moisterizer on, allowing time for it to soak in, prior to using this product (If you use a moisterizer). The product did make my undereyes feel a little tighter. However, if you place any makeup over the same area, the product starts peeling off! It looks terrible!&lt;br /&gt;I have dark shadows &amp; bags under my eyes. When I put on a liquid concealer, that&#x27;s when the product started peeling off. It looked like my skin was peeling off.</li>
            <li> It was delivered on time and I really thought it would work, but when applied it just dries up and then it will start to flake.  I would not buy again and even though it was a bargain from the store price of $40.00 it still didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish I had saved the box for a return.</li>
            <li> This eye stuff is great.... I looked for a long time to find something to help with puffy under eyes it so works... can&#x27;t find in stores lately ,so I bought 2 of them. It only temporary like 24 hours but works and opens eyes up more...so if u are 50 and having trouble dealing with it like me try it because botox Dr&#x27;s can&#x27;t help that part of your face..</li>
            <li> You may as well put super glue on your face.  This is inexpensive and also cheap.  Not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product, love it, can&#x27;t live without</li>
            <li> I have been using Dermasilk 90 second eye lift for at least 5 months now. I really can tell a difference. It has decreased the wrinkles around my eyes and lightened the dark areas. It has made my eye area look 10 years younger. This product has worked for me. I originally found out about it on the Racheal Ray show. I&#x27;m glad I was watching that day.</li>
            <li> Im glad I did not read reviews before I purchased this or would not have purchased.  My family and I both saw results within 2 uses.  It does reduce puffiness.  As far as wrinkles go well ofcourse when the puffiness goes down you will see more wrinkles.  duh!  I will purchase this product again.  My main concern was to reduce puffiness and it truly worked for me.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THE ENTIRE RANGE OF DERMASILK PRODUCTS AND RETURNED THEM THE NEXT WEEK. THEY ARE MADE FROM EGG WHITE I GUESS BECAUSE THEY CAKE AND SKIN BECAMES DRY AND FULL OF WHITE FLAKES. WHAT A JOKE!! they have prices comparable to skinceuticals and skinmedica, but THEY ARE JUNK. don&#x27;t waste your money!!! buy SKINCEUTICALS, OR SKINMEDICA PRODUCTS. AT LEAST I DIDN&#x27;T WASTE MY MONEY, BUT I HAD TO TRY IT.</li>
            <li> The product did not deliver! I still had puffiness under my eyes. The only thing that happened was that it made the skin there feel tight which actually was not pleasant.</li>
            <li> It really does help minimize bags and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the bags under my eyes and it always works and this is probably for the last 25 years. My wife use to buy the most expensive makeup including eye lifts and none of hers ever worked for me. This is usually a very expensive product but I always wait for it to be on sale and have a coupon also so that the price is usually 50% less than the regular price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic. Will buy it again. It feels great. Tightens skin under eyes. Would highly recommend purchasing this great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at WAL-Mart. It is Flawless erase wrinkles in seconds. I think not. It makes your face  look like a white sheet.I will be taking this back to WAL-Mart.What a dud!</li>
            <li> As we get older, and things begin to sag a bit...&lt;br /&gt;this product lifts and tightens just as advertised</li>
            <li> works super well until you smile</li>
            <li> probably one of the worst products I have ever used. I does get rid of the wrinkles until you smile, then it cracks and flakes.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Tried many... Definitely rates above all others.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I purchased the product before reading the reviews on this and other sites. Otherwise, I may not have given this product a chance. I have purchased other products that claim will make the bags and dark circles go away and have been disappointed.  I have considered looking into getting cosmetic surgery done because of under-eye puffiness, which I feel is the first thing people notice about me. I applied a slight amount (about a drop) of the DermaSilk 90 Second Eye Lift cream under each eye and noticed a significant difference--no more tired and old looking eyes anymore. I am happy with the results and would recommend this product. Now, when I see myself in the mirror, I am not drawn to the annoying bags under my eyes. After applying foundation, the appearance around my eyes was even better.</li>
            <li> CONS:  I never received product.  The company did ship something totally diffent to me.  Charged me for the 90 second eye lift.  So now I have to deny charge with credit card company because I&#x27;m not paying 2 shipping fees just to give them back their \\&quot;WRONG\\&quot; product.     PROS:  The company let me keep product already received and gave me a full refund.  I&#x27;m going to try my order again since I was out no extra money.</li>
            <li> They sent the wrong item.  The item they mailed me was an $8.00 item and my CC was charged $28.00 which was the cost of the item I ordered.  They wouldn&#x27;t refund my charge until they received the returned  item.    When I called about the wrong item received, they said they&#x27;d send out the correct item right away.  After waiting a week, I called again to check on the item.  Then they told me I&#x27;d have to order the original item in a couple of weeks, because it was out of stock.  I was the one making the contact by phone, they never once contacted me to explain anything.  It would have been better if the person on the phone spoke \\&quot;clear\\&quot; English!  I&#x27;ll never do business with them again.  [[ASIN:B001ET7M02 Sudden Change Under-Eye Firming Serum, .23 fl oz (7 ml) (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant about trying this product after all the negative reviews. I am so glad I gave it a try. I think the problem people are having is that they do not know how to use this product correctly. First if you use too much, it will flake off. If this happens, just wet your finger a bit and rub the flaky area gently. This will correct the problem area. The second thing is that this product in my opinion is not meant to be used without applying makeup once it dries. If you use it and do not apply makeup, it makes you look kind of funny. I apply the product, wait until  it dries, and then I apply concealer using a foundation brush (do not use your fingers....use a high quality foundation brush.) I am very gentle when blending the concealer. The result is incredible. My &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; seem to disappear. I go all day with no need to reapply.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it often.  I like my regular under eye serum.  This is good for going out at night and want to maintain a firm morning look.  I put it on at the end so it won&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li> Terrible I gave it a 1 because it made me laugh when I looked in mirror....... HORRIBLE, I really would like my money back minus shipping  that&#x27;s my price for being stupid and believing.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on my under-eye bags.  A wee bit too much and it will leave a white residue.  This can be very embarrassing.  Wait till it dries to get the full effect before you walk away from your mirror!  You might think you look okay, only to find out later you have been walking around with flaking white bits of dried glue under your eyes.  Those of us with eye bags aren&#x27;t anxious to draw even more attention to an area we&#x27;re already self-conscious about.  I suppose the premise is that it dries like a (supposedly) clear glue, creating a film that tightens the puffy under-eye area.  But this film can \\&quot;crack\\&quot; when you smile.  I am very disappointed, especially considering the cost of this product and the hype.  ALSO, it contains pthalate, which is a plasticizer that easily leaches through the skin.  I assume the idea is that it keeps the film a bit pliable?  Pthalates are being phased out of use due to growing awareness of the dangers they present. If it worked, I might be tempted to take the risk ... but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This product gives same results as  Sudden Chance, it leaves  flaky residue under eye.  I expected it to be better for  the price.  Service receiving it from Amazon was really quick.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product form the get go.  You either have to put a small amount of moisturizer on before or after product, let product dry completly.  I usually put a skin serum then moisturizer on after applying the Dermasilk.  I did get a crusty area if I didn&#x27;t use moisturizer after applying 90 second Dermasilk.</li>
            <li> Used it for several years, love the product, have difficulty finding</li>
            <li> Just what my wife wanted.  The product is as advertised.  Would recommend this to friends. Best buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I think I wasted my money, and this stuff is not cheap!  It&#x27;s hard to apply the right amount, if you don&#x27;t put on enough, it doesn&#x27;t work, if you put on too much, you get a white residue when it dries.  The directions say if you get the residue, use a damp cloth to blot it off.  When you do that, you usually blot off the product too.  You also can&#x27;t put on make up or a concealer over it, it just flakes off.  My advice....don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Just received today and applied.  didn&#x27;t notice a hugh difference, but perhaps overtime, improvement will be more noticeable, since my undereye puffiness is more hereditary than from lack of sleep.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim when my usual eye cream was out of stock at the store.  I love it and will not go back to Oil of Olay!  It works exactly as stated and if the directions are followed does not leave a white residue whatsoever.  A little bit goes a long way.  I can&#x27;t wait to try out some of the other products in their line.</li>
            <li> For someone who has very droopy eylids and can&#x27;t afford plastic surgery, this is wonderful. It arrived promptly and I use it almost everyday. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful - and lasts the entire day without reapplication and you can use under makeup - its invisible</li>
            <li> This product is awful. I have no idea how people can write a good review on Dermasilk. It leaves a cracked milky residue and doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother with it. Youthology was 10 times better.</li>
            <li> It did not deliver the promise of improving the eye area in 90 seconds, and not in one week.</li>
            <li> Makes under eye area look smoother and even eliminates some dark area also. Before and after are definitely visible. Especially enjoy the discounts.  Keep me posted.</li>
            <li> I started this product one week ago and I&#x27;m sooo happy. It did exactly what it said it would. The bags under my eyes were making me look so tired and aged me greatly. I&#x27;m 44 years old and was looking at least ten years older. I followed the directions to the letter and the results are amazing. I cant get over it. I&#x27;m so happy. I highly recommend this product ! In just 90 seconds twice a day let me tell you in a week its amazing!!! I do advise following all directions and there recommendations. It really works! The bags are almost completely gone and the dark circles also. Try it its amazing!</li>
            <li> He loves it and says that it really works all although it&#x27;s a little bit on the pricey side, it&#x27;s still a good buy.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product.  It definately lifts my eye lids and reduces the look of wrinkles.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I use this on an as needed basis. I dont have a lot of puffiness or sagging but I do suffer from insomnia from time to time and therefore I wake up with baggy eyes.  I have tried several products that say they will get rid of puffiness and such, but only Dermasilk really does that. I have read several of the other reviews and I have to say that I also get the flaking sometimes. Its not just Dermasilk that flakes - it is every brand I have tried and I have tried several of them! Quick fix: I put a small amount of moisturizer over it and no more flakes! I love Dermasilk products and highly recommend them to everyone!</li>
            <li> Burned the skin under my eyes but did tighten skin.</li>
            <li> I love the product. Definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Need to redorder great product</li>
            <li> It is not a fix to any problems with the skin around your eyes. It is merely make-up that does nothing more than put a white film on the area.  I wasn&#x27;t looking for a miracle but something to help for even a few hours, we&#x27;ll I had bad results within seconds.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and leaves white flakes on your face</li>
            <li> If you saw this on a Rachel Ray video, watch it again. If you pause on the before/after shot, you can see that the lady&#x27;s entire face looks better, not just under her eyes. They must &#x27;ve used a camera filter or different lighting. Her skin on forehead, nose, chin all look better. Seems like a scam to me. Disappointed in Rachel Ray. Seems like an infomercial. I haven&#x27;t tried this product and after watching the video and reading the reviews, I don&#x27;t plan to.</li>
            <li> Again, ok.  It does lift but when you put your make up on after it all crumbles and flakes.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and really like it.  When I saw it here at such a great price, I had to order it.&lt;br /&gt;It came in great condition and in record time.  I may very well order it again when I am out because the prce here cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> This does seem to suck the water bags/bulges out from uner my eyes.  But I do have to be careful NOT to apply too much as it &amp;#34;cakes&amp;#34; or looks like &amp;#34;peeling skin&amp;#34; after sunburn.  A very small amount works well.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It really works on under eye bags. It make them less severe. You have to let it dry before adding any other products.</li>
            <li> This product does reduce the appearance of wrinkles.  I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of this product before...was just walking down the aisle at the supermarket and saw a $10 off coupon.  I am 39 and am plagued with dark circles and puffy eye bags so I thought \\&quot;why not try it?\\&quot;  I used it for the first time yesterday morning and was AMAZED. I followed the instructions and made sure my moisturizer was dry before applying.  After concealer application, I was even more amazed. My eyes looked so fresh and bright all day long.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Pretty much does what it says, but hard to wear without makeup.  But it definitely gives saggy eyelids a lift!  Arrived on time!</li>
            <li> Used faithfully and could see no visible improvement at all.  May help some but was a waste of money for me personally.</li>
            <li> It does tighten the skin but also makes skin look puckered.  If you add cream around edges it doesn&#x27;t pucker so bad but also doesn&#x27;t tighten as well.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s ok but definitely not great</li>
