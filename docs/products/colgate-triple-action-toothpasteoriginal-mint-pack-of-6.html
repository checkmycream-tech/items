            <li>very good price</li>
            <li>Great tasting toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>The value for the size is good.</li>
            <li>Ended up being a good value.</li>
            <li>Nice product, good protection for my teeth and breath</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the price  was lower.</li>
            <li>When it comes to getting your teeth clean, toothpaste is a great option.  </li>
            <li>It has a great flavor- and keeps my mouth fresh.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel clean, foams well but not too foamy, and taste is pleasant.</li>
            <li>I find that Colgate is one of the better toothpastes that I have used.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite toothpaste and will keep using it until they stop production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product was legitimate and is safe to use...</li>
            <li>It is fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Firstly, that is a huge mistake and offense to costumers, once I was not given what I have paid</li>
            <li>It is cheap and cleans, whitens, and prevents cavities.</li>
            <li>; I used them for a special project.</li>
            <li>This Colgate toothpaste is just the right size for him to handle, was easy to order, and economical with Prime shipping.</li>
            <li>The taste is great, and a little goes a looooong way with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It is fresh tasting and does the job and the tubes are well within their expiration date.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste is good and has worked like any other Colgate we have purchased in the store.  </li>
            <li>Very minty!</li>
            <li>but this was very close.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used colgate - the regular/original one - my whole life.</li>
            <li>I really like the flavor and not quite as ...</li>
            <li>Anyway, thanks Amazon and Colgate.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the refillable plan offered by Amazon</li>
            <li>, however the boxes received clearly say Made in Mexico.  </li>
            <li>Works as expected and the price was right.</li>
            <li>the only word I can think of is gritty, but that isn&#x27;t quite right cause neither this or regular colgate is really gritty.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s always a gamble buying this kind of stuff on Amazon, sometimes you get weird or expired merchandise.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thus, be aware of the fact that you will get LESS of the product!</li>

            <li> but I do prefer the larger tubes; this size takes up the same amount of space but as has less toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about purchasing considering how economical the boxes worked out, but there&#x27;s nothing wrong with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I got a few of these not too long ago.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste arrived in a heavy duty box.  </li>
            <li> I usually use aquafresh</li>
            <li> Actuallly, I&#x27;m not really sure how this tasted.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I like buying in bulk but I do prefer the larger tubes; this size takes up the same amount of space but as has less toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I provide supplies to my step father who is living in a nursing home.  This Colgate toothpaste is just the right size for him to handle, was easy to order, and economical with Prime shipping.</li>
            <li> I can not use toothpastes with whitening and trying to find one without whitening that still cleans your teeth is tricky. This is perfect! It has a great flavor- and keeps my mouth fresh.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of my teeth and mouth after brushing my teeth.  It would be nice if the price  was lower.</li>
            <li> It is fine. The value for the size is good. I usually use aquafresh but this was very close. I may try it again</li>
            <li> I got a few of these not too long ago. I find that Colgate is one of the better toothpastes that I have used. It is cheap and cleans, whitens, and prevents cavities. The taste is great, and a little goes a looooong way with this toothpaste. This toothpaste also freshens breath. This is my favorite toothpaste and will keep using it until they stop production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is good and has worked like any other Colgate we have purchased in the store.  Ordered for bulk convenience and paid around $7.50 for the pack of six, which was lower than local store prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the product description it says these are Made in the USA, however the boxes received clearly say Made in Mexico.  Many things are made all over the world, so was not a huge deal, however I think it is misleading and false advertising to have it incorrect in the product description.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used colgate - the regular/original one - my whole life. Decided to give these a try as part of my subscribe and save program at amazon. I really like the flavor and not quite as ... the only word I can think of is gritty, but that isn&#x27;t quite right cause neither this or regular colgate is really gritty. I guess I&#x27;d call it smoother. It has gel in it so that makes sense I guess. Teeth feel clean, foams well but not too foamy, and taste is pleasant.</li>
            <li> When it comes to getting your teeth clean, toothpaste is a great option.  Works as expected and the price was right.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste arrived in a heavy duty box.  The box contained 10 packages of toothpaste at&lt;br /&gt;a very good price; I used them for a special project.</li>
            <li> Great tasting toothpaste. Very minty!</li>
            <li> These are NOT 6.4-Ounce Boxes!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a pack of 6, but each has 4.6 OZ (130g) instead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, that is a huge mistake and offense to costumers, once I was not given what I have paid for.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it makes it relatively more expensive than 8.2 OZ boxes, which I decided not buy after comparing to the price of the supposedly &amp;#34;6.4 OZ boxes&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, be aware of the fact that you will get LESS of the product!</li>
            <li> Nice product, good protection for my teeth and breath but they&#x27;re made in Mexico, not in US as advertised. Anyway, thanks Amazon and Colgate.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about purchasing considering how economical the boxes worked out, but there&#x27;s nothing wrong with this toothpaste. It is fresh tasting and does the job and the tubes are well within their expiration date. I would purchase again - if I ever get through it all.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but both my husband and i aren&#x27;t big fans of the flavor - and we use Colgate products on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Great price and I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of  toothpaste again.Thanks to the refillable plan offered by Amazon</li>
            <li> This product was legitimate and is safe to use... it&#x27;s always a gamble buying this kind of stuff on Amazon, sometimes you get weird or expired merchandise.  Ended up being a good value.</li>
            <li> While not the best toothpaste in the world, Colgate does what I need. As this is a 6-pack, this set will serve you a year before you have to buy toothpaste again.</li>
            <li> Actuallly, I&#x27;m not really sure how this tasted. I had it sent as a gift last Christmas and never heard a word whether they received it or not. I actually think they would have told me if they received it which makes me wonder if they got it.</li>
