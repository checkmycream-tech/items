    <ol>
            <li>Not for those with tender gums, but THE BEST I have found for cleaning between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>My Dentist was so impressed that she ordered some for her husband and some of her patients.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to see them on Amazon and ordered them.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This solution is the best I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I give an excellent rating for the product and seller.</li>
            <li>These are the best picks I have every used for cleaning out the crevices between my teeth.</li>
            <li>I find them to be excellent in design and value.</li>
            <li>She said keep up the good work!</li>
            <li>I had never used something as great as these.</li>
            <li>These are great to use if you don&#x27;t have any floss on hand.</li>
            <li>Do a GREAT job of removing unwanted debris.  </li>
            <li>, I was quite happy with them.  </li>

            <li>I got this for my friend because just like everyone else, loved this brushpicks as I do.</li>
            <li>Otherwise a good product  Eve</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t use floss I use brushpicks, she says they appear to work good.</li>
            <li>The feathery tips are very effective  and these are absolutely the best tooth picks I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I received the BrushPicks and was very satisfied.</li>
            <li>and she says my gums are much better since using these!  </li>
            <li>Brushpicks are amazing.  </li>
            <li>and I have access to every kind of pick, floss, proxi-brush, interdental brush, water-pik, electric, ultrasonic gizmo and gadget you could ever imagine.</li>
            <li>These are really the best toothpicks on the planet.</li>
            <li>They are inexpensive and more durable than a toothpick and also get between teeth better.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to find these at WalMart -</li>
            <li>I rarely floss so a product like this is ideal for rare or non-flossers.</li>
            <li>My dentest says he has never seen my teeth and gums so healthy.</li>
            <li>Possibly the best picks in the world.</li>
            <li>We had been eating all kinds of seafood and like anyone else, I have 2 or 3 places in between my teeth that just love to trap food...</li>
            <li>It held up, did the work, and felt fabulous!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite tooth pick brush for cleaning between your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Brush picks for several years with excellent results.</li>
            <li>Try GUM soft-picks instead if you have similar issues; they are awesome.  </li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>believe most people dont know how to floss.</li>
            <li>Simply the best toothpicks ever!</li>
            <li>i love to keep these all over and in my purse and at work</li>
            <li>they work much better for me.</li>
            <li>was given my first one of these on a Cruise  and LOVED it.  </li>
            <li>These work pretty good</li>
            <li>These are GREAT, will never use old fashion wood again.</li>
            <li>were they are easy to remove and use at any time I feel the need.  </li>
            <li>Easy size to take with.</li>
            <li>Easy to carry around in the very cool little dispensing gadget  Excellent product  </li>
            <li>it is just ok, cheap and convent to use it to clean food stuck in tooth.</li>
            <li>One end has a fine ribbed pointed tip  which works well</li>
            <li>The little carrying case is perfect for sticking in my purse and carrying them with me.</li>
            <li>Fabulous.  </li>
            <li>So they turned out to be much more economical than I had thought they would be.</li>
            <li>no where near as good.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t go in between really close teeth quite as good as regular floss but still does a good on-the-fly job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to good old wood....</li>
            <li>I like the small packages best they fit in my purse and car.</li>
            <li>This size is a purse, conveniently in a small perfect container.</li>
            <li>small box is great !</li>
            <li>soft picks  are very good for cleaning between teeth near the gum.</li>
            <li>The gum soft picks work better on most of my teeth and clean both sides but the doctors picks remove impacted food better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One end is a nice pointed tip that gets in between your teeth very effectively, better than wood actually.</li>
            <li>And, the price is right!</li>
            <li>It has a nice nylon brush that is soft but durable.  </li>
            <li>They are good product for the times and I use them daily to help keep my teeth and gums healthly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap money and your gums are worth it.</li>
            <li>Apart from the fact that the brush  is a bit scratcy (not necessarily a bad thing)</li>
            <li>worth EVERY penny.</li>
            <li>All products are great, fit inbetween teeth to clean well, convenient to carry, economical compared to other similar types on the market.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of flex versus stiffness.</li>
            <li>They clean under bridges  as well as between your teeth very throughly.</li>
            <li>It also works great for patients wearing braces, although I usually prefer they use a product called \\&quot;Platypus\\&quot; flossers.</li>
            <li>Doctors brushpicks are the best for getting out little bits of food from between your teeth especially after a meal.</li>
            <li>In fact, I was convinced that only good old fashioned floss would do the trick.</li>
            <li>These are great when you want a toothpick but not the splinters from the wooden ones, or you need something to &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; stuff from between your teeth, especially when out and about.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried these I was visiting my mom and she had them.</li>
            <li>The brush is mounted on plastic, and is fairly fine, as diameter is measured, so will fit into tight spaces between teeth.  </li>
            <li>Nice little dispenser, also.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I tend to get food stuck in my teeth a lot, and I really like these as an alternative to toothpicks because of the brush end.</li>
            <li>My oral health has been improved for one reason you may carry and use Brush Picks much easier than you can floss.</li>
            <li>They get in between the teeth very well.  </li>
            <li>These really work and get all the food out of your teeth after a meal.</li>
            <li>They really work.  </li>
            <li>It is a real toothpick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also the plastic brush hurts sometimes going in between teeth and the plastic brush is too slippery to grab the particles very well.</li>
            <li>Who new there was so much to a tooth pick?!</li>
            <li>After using these for about a year, same two containers I originally bought...just never use them much.</li>
            <li>One end has the brush, the other end is more of a toothpick type end.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m due for a refill and will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Earlier I had reviewed them highly, but that was before i opened the package.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The price makes them disposable (about a penny each), compared to the more expensive wire mounted gum brushes which are not durable (wires easily bend) and seem to grate against teeth.</li>
            <li>The brush end is a little too hard and hurts my gums but all in all this is a very good product.</li>
            <li>If you are needing other items, buy over $25 and get free shipping.</li>
            <li>All work for me by having it by my chair where I watch television if I am not ready for a full brushing.  </li>
            <li>Just about everyone has a busy life these days always on the go.</li>
            <li>It in no way replaces a toothbrush, but my teeth are very crowded together and sometimes stuff gets stuck between them that even the toothpick end can&#x27;t reach, and the brush end with the tiny bristles gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>I use them to clean a few gum pockets too.</li>
            <li>Thats because the pointed end is so sharp it stabs your gums sometimes and pushes right through the food debris and doesn&#x27;t grab and hang on like the wood picks.</li>
            <li>I would go crazy trying to get out what gets stuck if it were not for these little plastic picks in their wonderful case.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, yet narrow enough to easily move between teeth with either brush-side or regular pick-side.</li>
            <li>These must be an older model with only three bristles instead of ten.  </li>
            <li>I have been practicing general dentistry for 11 years</li>
            <li>Generally what causes perio disease.</li>
            <li>I thought she was going to give me the same old thing I had been giving my patients for years</li>
            <li>I ordered theses at the same time as ordering some  G.U.M soft picks (which I have used before) just to compare.  </li>
            <li>But after getting them and using them I realized that they&#x27;re so durable you can actually use the same one several times before needing a new one.</li>
            <li>They curve and flex and really get down in there..</li>
            <li>They flex a little too much in certain instances.</li>

            <li> But after getting them and using them I realized that they&#x27;re so durable you can actually use the same one several times before needing a new one.</li>
            <li> They curve and flex and really get down in there..</li>
            <li> They flex a little too much in certain instances.</li>
            <li> My gums are too sensitive for sharp edges these have.  </li>
            <li> They are soft and well designed little brushes for efficient cleaning but require enough space between teeth to do their job.</li>
            <li> Have tried numerous similar looking types, but these are the only ones with which the brush end fits between my tight teeth.  </li>
            <li> and the other end has a very very tiny flat brush</li>
            <li> I use for long and they are fenomenal.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried about 3 other similar items.</li>
            <li> I ended up running it in between every tooth, even between adjacent crowns which is usually a little more difficult.</li>
            <li> Essential for people with braces or other mouth work where food gets stuck.</li>
            <li> my only criticism is  that the odd bristles comes off in the mouth.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not for those with tender gums, but THE BEST I have found for cleaning between my teeth.  My Dentist was so impressed that she ordered some for her husband and some of her patients.</li>
            <li> These must be an older model with only three bristles instead of ten.  They don&#x27;t hold up as well as the newer version of the same product.  Count the bristles as shown on the outside of the package and compare them with a different seller before ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier I had reviewed them highly, but that was before i opened the package.  now, i&#x27;m editing the review.  unfortunately, the five stars is something I can&#x27;t change.  if i could i would reduce the stars to zero.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried these I was visiting my mom and she had them. I had never used something as great as these. I was very happy to see them on Amazon and ordered them. They stimulate your gums as they work as a toothpick. I will never use anything but them ever again.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  My teeth are close spaced and I break floss all the time.  This solution is the best I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;ve tried about 3 other similar items.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years. They are inexpensive and more durable than a toothpick and also get between teeth better. I used to be able to find these at WalMart - but they stopped stocking them. Walgreens did not have them nor Target, when I checked. So, Amazon has them and not too costly. If you are needing other items, buy over $25 and get free shipping.</li>
            <li> The brush end is a little too hard and hurts my gums but all in all this is a very good product. Beats toothpicks hands down. I rarely floss so a product like this is ideal for rare or non-flossers.</li>
            <li> I got this for my friend because just like everyone else, loved this brushpicks as I do. This size is a purse, conveniently in a small perfect container.</li>
            <li> These are GREAT, will never use old fashion wood again. My dentest says he has never seen my teeth and gums so healthy. I like the small packages best they fit in my purse and car.</li>
            <li> Possibly the best picks in the world. Just the right amount of flex versus stiffness. I tried other brands - no where near as good.  Who new there was so much to a tooth pick?!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  I carry a package in my purse to use when I am out and one at my desk.  These are great to use if you don&#x27;t have any floss on hand.</li>
            <li> They work well.  Are not too hard or stiff, yet are not too flimsy either.  Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> was given my first one of these on a Cruise  and LOVED it.  The feathery tips are very effective  and these are absolutely the best tooth picks I have ever used.  No Splintering or bending after a few pokes between the teeth.  Do a GREAT job of removing unwanted debris.  Easy to carry around in the very cool little dispensing gadget  Excellent product  worth EVERY penny.</li>
            <li> I tend to get food stuck in my teeth a lot, and I really like these as an alternative to toothpicks because of the brush end. The little carrying case is perfect for sticking in my purse and carrying them with me.</li>
            <li> I did find these at Walgren&#x27;s at a comparable price.  They work on the same principle as gum brushes (which are more expensive).  The brush is mounted on plastic, and is fairly fine, as diameter is measured, so will fit into tight spaces between teeth.  The price makes them disposable (about a penny each), compared to the more expensive wire mounted gum brushes which are not durable (wires easily bend) and seem to grate against teeth.</li>
            <li> I have been practicing general dentistry for 11 years and I have access to every kind of pick, floss, proxi-brush, interdental brush, water-pik, electric, ultrasonic gizmo and gadget you could ever imagine. My husband&#x27;s aunt shared one of these with me several years ago when we were on vacation. We had been eating all kinds of seafood and like anyone else, I have 2 or 3 places in between my teeth that just love to trap food...especially meaty buttery hunks of crab meat! I thought she was going to give me the same old thing I had been giving my patients for years and I knew that wasn&#x27;t going to get the job done this time. In fact, I was convinced that only good old fashioned floss would do the trick. I was completely wrong! It cleaned out every area that I knew I had trapped food and several that I didn&#x27;t know about. I ended up running it in between every tooth, even between adjacent crowns which is usually a little more difficult. It held up, did the work, and felt fabulous! I now distribute these to my patients that have any areas that trap food, and to my teenagers that need a little extra help midday and I know nothing I say is going to get them to take their toothbrush to school. It also works great for patients wearing braces, although I usually prefer they use a product called \\&quot;Platypus\\&quot; flossers. Definitely recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tooth pick brush for cleaning between your teeth.  It has a nice nylon brush that is soft but durable.  It fits in small gaps.  One end has the brush, the other end is more of a toothpick type end.  It comes in a convenient container for carrying or storage.  It is also one of the least expensive, as little as a dollar for a pack of 100.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use for long and they are fenomenal. People ask me for this and I offer lots of them. With the refill of 15 we can have them anytime.</li>
            <li> I have been using Brush picks for several years with excellent results. My oral health has been improved for one reason you may carry and use Brush Picks much easier than you can floss. They clean under bridges  as well as between your teeth very throughly.Just about everyone has a busy life these days always on the go.I carry my Brush Picks in my pocket were they are easy to remove and use at any time I feel the need.  They are good product for the times and I use them daily to help keep my teeth and gums healthly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get these at my local store anymore.  These are great when you want a toothpick but not the splinters from the wooden ones, or you need something to &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; stuff from between your teeth, especially when out and about.  It in no way replaces a toothbrush, but my teeth are very crowded together and sometimes stuff gets stuck between them that even the toothpick end can&#x27;t reach, and the brush end with the tiny bristles gets the job done.  The brush end bends to reach those places you can&#x27;t even see.</li>
            <li> These work pretty good, I was quite happy with them.  They get in between the teeth very well.  They do not replace flossing; but when you out and about and need to get that cleaner feeling; this works.</li>
            <li> Lifesavers. I have a tiny gap between a crown and tooth connection.  Stuff gets stuck. I would go crazy trying to get out what gets stuck if it were not for these little plastic picks in their wonderful case.</li>
            <li> Essential for people with braces or other mouth work where food gets stuck.</li>
            <li> I received the BrushPicks and was very satisfied. They were just as I expected and they were received before the due date. I give an excellent rating for the product and seller.</li>
            <li> These are really the best toothpicks on the planet. I have bought others at the name drug stores - awful as the brushes are too short. These really work and get all the food out of your teeth after a meal. And, the price is right! Everyone I give one to becomes a fan!</li>
            <li> I ordered theses at the same time as ordering some  G.U.M soft picks (which I have used before) just to compare.  And compared to the soft picks which are firm with soft rubber teeth  these are quite bendy and scratchy. One end has a fine ribbed pointed tip  which works well and the other end has a very very tiny flat brush (looks a bit  like a fishes skeleton) made of plastic. Apart from the fact that the brush  is a bit scratcy (not necessarily a bad thing) my only criticism is  that the odd bristles comes off in the mouth.  Otherwise a good product  Eve</li>
            <li> Doctors brushpicks are the best for getting out little bits of food from between your teeth especially after a meal.</li>
            <li> All work for me by having it by my chair where I watch television if I am not ready for a full brushing.  It works when I cannot brush or get to my water pick.</li>
            <li> Great product, good sevice from Amazon.  My dental tech always comments how well my teeth look from using floss.  I have to tell her, I don&#x27;t use floss I use brushpicks, she says they appear to work good.</li>
            <li> These did not work for me.  My gums are too sensitive for sharp edges these have.  They also bend and break if cleaning under a bridge.  Try GUM soft-picks instead if you have similar issues; they are awesome.  I use them to clean a few gum pockets too.</li>
            <li> Fabulous.  Love these.  They really work.  I carry them in my car glove box, my bag, and keep them in my desk at work for emergencies.</li>
            <li> it is just ok, cheap and convent to use it to clean food stuck in tooth. 3 in 1 packet.</li>
            <li> I guess I have too narrow teeth or something because it doesn&#x27;t work for me. But great buy if it works for you.</li>
            <li> As being a Dental Hygienist for the last 20 yrs. I&amp;#34;m convinced that probably 5-10 % 0f the population floss regularly.Personally I dont care what the pt uses to get the crap out of between their teeth..Generally what causes perio disease.These stimulate the gum tissue and force the gunk out. .I believe most people dont know how to floss. They generally wrap the floss around the index fingers,which makes it quite difficult to reach the back teeth., the correct way is to wrap floss around the middle finger to anchor it and the index fingers and thumb for reach....If they can put directions 0n opening a can. I definatly think directions should be on the floss container</li>
            <li> All products are great, fit inbetween teeth to clean well, convenient to carry, economical compared to other similar types on the market.</li>
            <li> have been buying this product for years and recommend to all.  I&#x27;m due for a refill and will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> Brushpicks are amazing.  My gums and teeth feel so great after each use.</li>
            <li> Simply the best toothpicks ever! And hard to find in-store. Easy size to take with. Sturdy, yet narrow enough to easily move between teeth with either brush-side or regular pick-side.</li>
            <li> These are the best picks I have every used for cleaning out the crevices between my teeth. They have little feathered barbs to help retrieve the debris between one teeth. They curve and flex and really get down in there..</li>
            <li> Doctors  brush picks? Or gum brush picks?? Which one?&lt;br /&gt;The soft picks  are very good for cleaning between teeth near the gum. They are soft and well designed little brushes for efficient cleaning but require enough space between teeth to do their job. Small spaces  just make them bend back on themselves.&lt;br /&gt;Doctors brush picks are harder and one end is designed to remove impacted food from between teeth. It is a real toothpick.&lt;br /&gt;The other end is a small hard flat plastic brush that can force its way between teeth but might irritate gums.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest spending six bucks and buy the small size of each. Then decide.&lt;br /&gt;Personally I suggest having both around. The gum soft picks work better on most of my teeth and clean both sides but the doctors picks remove impacted food better.&lt;br /&gt;Neither one forces food up under the gums as dental floss can.&lt;br /&gt;Buy both. It&#x27;s cheap money and your gums are worth it.</li>
            <li> i love to keep these all over and in my purse and at work&lt;br /&gt;the small box is great !</li>
            <li> I bought these to try them out as an alternative to regular wooden picks. I figured I&#x27;d probably use one or two a day because I&#x27;d be discarding them every time. But after getting them and using them I realized that they&#x27;re so durable you can actually use the same one several times before needing a new one. So they turned out to be much more economical than I had thought they would be. One end is a nice pointed tip that gets in between your teeth very effectively, better than wood actually. The other end is made for flossing. It is very thin and has tiny brush like spines that grab whatevers in between your teeth and pull it out. It won&#x27;t go in between really close teeth quite as good as regular floss but still does a good on-the-fly job. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because they should be a little stiffer. They flex a little too much in certain instances. Not a deal-breaker though. Nice little dispenser, also.  UPDATE: After using these for about a year, same two containers I originally bought...just never use them much.Thats because the pointed end is so sharp it stabs your gums sometimes and pushes right through the food debris and doesn&#x27;t grab and hang on like the wood picks. Also the plastic brush hurts sometimes going in between teeth and the plastic brush is too slippery to grab the particles very well. I&#x27;ll stick to good old wood....they work much better for me.</li>
            <li> Have used for several years. Have been unable to find in stores (at least up here in Canada) for several months.  Have tried numerous similar looking types, but these are the only ones with which the brush end fits between my tight teeth.  I find them to be excellent in design and value.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a dental hygienist and she says my gums are much better since using these!  She said keep up the good work!</li>
