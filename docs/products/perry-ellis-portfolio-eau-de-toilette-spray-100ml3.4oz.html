            <li> Great perfume for the price, My husband loves it! This is his second one and he wear it almost every day.</li>
            <li> I just love the smell. Not strong or loud. Very nice pleasant smell. My mom bought this for my son for Christmas a couple of years ago and I just found it on amazon. He loves all the girls complimenting him on how good he smells. I can still smell it when he comes home at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, I just cant stop buying it, the price is ok, the size is very good, I just made this lotion my prefered one...</li>
            <li> Increased my cologne collection and this version of Perry Ellis was just what the doc ordered. It is a bit woodsy and if you are familiar with Avon, It has that IRONMAN strong intensity and similiar smell.</li>
            <li> It came very quickly and smelled just like I remembered it. I can only find this product on line and Very happy I can.</li>
