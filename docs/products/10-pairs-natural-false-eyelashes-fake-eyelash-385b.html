            <li>Simple is just pay more for better lashes, I got what I paid for which is cheap!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and very cheap for what you get</li>
            <li>shipped fast love the container it came in</li>
            <li>It arrived safely and in about as much time as you would expect a package coming from halfway around the world.</li>
            <li>I love the price as much as the item.</li>
            <li>I wish there were more up close pictures and more options of different eyelashes, and a translation maybe??</li>
            <li>I love the lashes; they look very natural!  </li>
            <li>Buy these if you want to brake up with your boyfriend and he then wont be able to find a new girlfriend.</li>
            <li>and they stick straight out when applied, uugggghh!!</li>
            <li>Love these, thick lashes and looks good.  </li>
            <li>Yes they look fab in the picture, but spend the extra cash and get something that will feel more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I love the natural look and feel of the lashes.</li>
            <li>I had no trouble putting these on and fitting my lash line.</li>
            <li>A little fuller than I had hoped but very nice for the price.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for daytime not being to dramatic</li>
            <li>They have many different styles of these too.</li>
            <li>Cute, simple lashes.</li>
            <li>she used to look pretty some times.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect super high quality, but for a dollar, try it out, it might be just what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>These are really meant for people with very large eyes.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer said, it took forever to get them and they were so cheap it wasn&#x27;t even worth sending them back.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t really what I was expecting</li>
            <li>, they  look  real.</li>
            <li>people say they look real</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I didnt really like it</li>
            <li>They are only worth 2cents if that!</li>
            <li>Love these lashes look natural just took a long time to arrive</li>
            <li>this are great, have a good base to apply the glue, there were a few that had light looking glue across them</li>
            <li>I really like how the lashes are a decent length, not overboard like one&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I used them for a costume, but they looked realistic enough and were quite pretty.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t buy these unless u plan to brake up with your boyfriend and leave him there to like wish he could meet some one new</li>
            <li>I buy them frequently this way now!</li>
            <li>They came complete &amp; haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li>when I open the box four pairs are ripped , one pair has to much glue on it</li>
            <li>described as natural, I was surprised when I saw these  were a strip of plastic and not hair.</li>
            <li>These are natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li>They are to flimsy,  was not impressed , will not buy more!......</li>
            <li>so I ordered it twice and still received these very cheap and damaged thin lashes that you couldn&#x27;t even use.</li>
            <li>overall pretty good lashes that look fairly natural and not so fake and heavy like others</li>
            <li>But obviously plastic lashes do not look all that natural.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why anyone who loves to use false eyelashes would want to pay $5 or more for just one set of lashes, but once I discovered they are sold in a bunch like this online..</li>
            <li>but like it just seems difficult and more trouble than its worth.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> the strip is like hard plastic and does not conform to your eyelid the ends stick straight out separate from your lid</li>
            <li> Prices so low not worth shipping back</li>
            <li> But their natrual looking and long.</li>
            <li> also they were REAL stiff, so it was super hard to apply them to my eyes as well.</li>
            <li> If I could give minus stars I would.</li>
            <li> but they aren&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> not exactly what I was wanting...</li>
            <li> The picture shows them to be very natural and thin</li>
            <li> Not for the average eyes.  </li>
            <li> eyelashes are plastic feeling and not worth the time or effort</li>
            <li> I never try the natural false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> These lashes are very subtle and natural.</li>
            <li> but they weren&#x27;t to much money not happy not good for me</li>
            <li> Way cheaper to buy online than Little Saigon.</li>
            <li> and if I do want them for evening they can be dressed up with a little heavier eye liner.</li>
            <li> Other than that, WHO COULD ARGUE WITH THE PRICE??!!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to someone who is looking to wear these as their everyday lashes.</li>
            <li> so they were thrown away but for the price these can&#x27;t be beat wear them everyday.</li>
            <li> The plastic band typically does not bother me, but these have a really thick band and are really stiff.</li>
            <li> I have small eyes</li>
            <li> I have ordered bulk lashes like these in the past that came on a thread instead of plastic</li>
            <li> I thought I would try ordering from china, when I tried the product it was so big, even after cutting them down.  </li>
            <li> the ones I recieved are very thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> Sucks because i bought 2 of them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no good.</li>
            <li> The lashes are also plastic and VERY hard to apply.</li>
            <li> was of poor quality - didn&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li> so not happy with these...</li>
            <li> I paid a little over a dollar for these lashes, and they aren&#x27;t all that bad.</li>
            <li> they are so fake..</li>
            <li> No one can tell they are false!  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing lashes for years and typically don&#x27;t even notice that they are on, but these are awful.</li>
            <li> I got swollen eyes after I used it, too bad, the material or something else?</li>
            <li> The edges poked my eye and hurt really bad.</li>
            <li> However I accidentally ordered these without paying closer attention and I hate them.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> These are the worst lashes I have ever purchased...EVER!</li>

            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really what I was expecting</li>
            <li> i like the not as think ones in the set but both do the trick</li>
            <li> Great product to practice with. But obviously plastic lashes do not look all that natural. I would not recommend this product to someone who is looking to wear these as their everyday lashes.</li>
            <li> I  like my eyelashes, they  look  real.</li>
            <li> I like them people say they look real</li>
            <li> It arrived safely and in about as much time as you would expect a package coming from halfway around the world. I wish there were more up close pictures and more options of different eyelashes, and a translation maybe?? Other than that, WHO COULD ARGUE WITH THE PRICE??!! I paid a little over a dollar for these lashes, and they aren&#x27;t all that bad. Don&#x27;t expect super high quality, but for a dollar, try it out, it might be just what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes look natural just took a long time to arrive</li>
            <li> this are great, have a good base to apply the glue, there were a few that had light looking glue across them so they were thrown away but for the price these can&#x27;t be beat wear them everyday.</li>
            <li> Love these, thick lashes and looks good.  Easy to use and put on. Came packaged well, for the price they are a good investment.</li>
            <li> Love this!! Super easy to put on!!</li>
            <li> was of poor quality - didn&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li> Simple is just pay more for better lashes, I got what I paid for which is cheap! An it sure came cheap looking , when I open the box four pairs are ripped , one pair has to much glue on it u can see the glue.  2 stars for the price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look anything like what&#x27;s advertised in the picture. Thought it might have been a mistake so I ordered it twice and still received these very cheap and damaged thin lashes that you couldn&#x27;t even use. If I could give minus stars I would.</li>
            <li> Cute, simple lashes. Easy to apply and I got them quicker than the delivery estimated date. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> described as natural, I was surprised when I saw these  were a strip of plastic and not hair. I did however get a good laugh  at them</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on these. If you&#x27;re looking for glamorous lashes that you can use over and over, these are not for you. These are natural looking lashes. People may not know you&#x27;re wearing falsies. They take forever to get to you though so be prepared.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and very cheap for what you get but they aren&#x27;t what I expected. The picture shows them to be very natural and thin the ones I recieved are very thick and heavy. Not disappointed because they were so cheap and I still may be able to use them on nights im feeling fun but can&#x27;t wear them more than I wanted too.</li>
            <li> They are to flimsy,  was not impressed , will not buy more!...... But they were cheap so that explains that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no good. I got swollen eyes after I used it, too bad, the material or something else?</li>
            <li> I got what i paid for. Eye lashes are outstanding. I love the price as much as the item. Most defenitly buy again :)</li>
            <li> I never try the natural false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> they are o.k.....not exactly what I was wanting...but they will work</li>
            <li> really cheaply made, hurt my eyes when wearing them. Yes they look fab in the picture, but spend the extra cash and get something that will feel more comfortable. also they were REAL stiff, so it was super hard to apply them to my eyes as well.</li>
            <li> Price was great. Shipping was fast. I&#x27;ll admit I didn&#x27;t read the item fully. These are plastic. Prices so low not worth shipping back I just gave them to my daughter to play with.</li>
            <li> I have ordered bulk lashes like these in the past that came on a thread instead of plastic and I loved them. However I accidentally ordered these without paying closer attention and I hate them. The plastic band typically does not bother me, but these have a really thick band and are really stiff. The edges poked my eye and hurt really bad. I have been wearing lashes for years and typically don&#x27;t even notice that they are on, but these are awful. Like another reviewer said, it took forever to get them and they were so cheap it wasn&#x27;t even worth sending them back. Just threw all 5 packs away and will order the ones I had before with the thread band.</li>
            <li> These lashes are very subtle and natural.</li>
            <li> I do not like them at all.. they are so fake..Sucks because i bought 2 of them.. please read the titles before u buy anything because i disnt.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try ordering from china, when I tried the product it was so big, even after cutting them down.  These are really meant for people with very large eyes. Not for the average eyes.  Very cheap, delivered really quickly.</li>
            <li> .I so not happy with these...they looked so unnatural..and to big...but they weren&#x27;t to much money not happy not good for me</li>
            <li> These are perfect for daytime not being to dramatic and if I do want them for evening they can be dressed up with a little heavier eye liner.</li>
            <li> I took almost 3 weeks to receive this product. When I got the lashes they were all bent in the package. The lashes are also plastic and VERY hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I really like how the lashes are a decent length, not overboard like one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve bought elsewhere. I used them for a costume, but they looked realistic enough and were quite pretty.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE! These are the worst lashes I have ever purchased...EVER! They appear to be man made synthetic and the strip is like hard plastic and does not conform to your eyelid the ends stick straight out separate from your lid and they stick straight out when applied, uugggghh!! I think I paid $1.87 for them and I want my $1.85 back. They are only worth 2cents if that!</li>
            <li> I didnt really like it</li>
            <li> Love them easy to ues</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time. I love the natural look and feel of the lashes.</li>
            <li> they look cheap 1 time use , BUT. they do the trick if you use enough mascara and then eyeliner over lids . works just as GOOD</li>
            <li> havent even recieved these</li>
            <li> overall pretty good lashes that look fairly natural and not so fake and heavy like others</li>
            <li> Good product. Good price</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why anyone who loves to use false eyelashes would want to pay $5 or more for just one set of lashes, but once I discovered they are sold in a bunch like this online.. I buy them frequently this way now! They are good quality and look beautiful...</li>
            <li> I am inlove with these lashes. I had no trouble putting these on and fitting my lash line. I would definitely buy again and reccomend them.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM I BOUGHT 6 BOX OF THEM</li>
            <li> eyelashes are plastic feeling and not worth the time or effort they come off very easy the adhesive does not even hold these one for a day</li>
            <li> my ex bought these then wore them. she used to look pretty some times. and stuff. now we broke up. don&#x27;t buy these unless u plan to brake up with your boyfriend and leave him there to like wish he could meet some one new but like it just seems difficult and more trouble than its worth.  Buy these if you want to brake up with your boyfriend and he then wont be able to find a new girlfriend.</li>
