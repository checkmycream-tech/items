            <li>and it is not the greatest value.  </li>
            <li>and I especially liked the eye creme.</li>

            <li>It is one of the best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The nighttime cream (called the day/night cream because it can be used for both) is best used as an overnight cream put on just before bed, but I&#x27;ve used it both ways.</li>
            <li>This product does feel wonderful on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Works wonderful!</li>

            <li>She is a winemaker who is often out in the vineyards, so the SPF 30 in the day lotion is a very good thing.  </li>
            <li>which is very good</li>
            <li>I ordered the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Regenerating Skincare package for my mother&#x27;s birthday and she absolutely loved this product!</li>
            <li>this is awesome and a good deal.</li>
            <li>have found Youth Code to be a joy to use.</li>
            <li>But for the elderly people - 50+ - you will be extremely happy with this under eye product.</li>

            <li>each lol</li>
            <li>If you travel, the sizes are great.  </li>
            <li>I love this skin care line!!</li>
            <li>It was smoother and felt very nice to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Very nice, my girl said so.</li>
            <li>I switched from Clinque to Youth Code and while I feel the product is better for my skin, it is not the best product for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love the daytime lotion... and the day cream is excellent.</li>
            <li>but with a more attractive price!</li>
            <li>A good price and great products.</li>
            <li>I was able to choose the best one for my mom</li>
            <li>Great product for a good price.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, the brand is also very good.</li>
            <li>They also have a pleasant frangrance.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprise.</li>
            <li>I will say it feels good on the skin, not oily and does not immediately disappear like some skin creams.</li>
            <li>My take is that if it feels good on your skin</li>
            <li>These do feel good on my face.</li>
            <li>This was a good way to try and while I like the products</li>
            <li>But, for a drugstore brand this is good stuff</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a great and effective product, but L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Youth Code was not it.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena was good</li>
            <li>The commodity is good, price privilege.</li>
            <li>I used this product for over two weeks to give it a fair shot.</li>
            <li>Good quality and brand.</li>
            <li>A good deal for your money.</li>
            <li>She tried this product, and LOVED the eye wand.</li>
            <li>It was a really good choice for a woman on her birthday.</li>
            <li>this is just a good product I have ordered it twice before this</li>
            <li>Price  is good.  </li>
            <li>good for my face.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell of the product, it was all very refreshing, and the product lasted just a bit longer than it claimed.</li>
            <li>And if it helps my skin look more refreshed at the end of my day, great! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I love it, it is great...</li>
            <li>these are great products and i will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>Great value for the money and have all my favorites in one boxEspecially love the eye correction cream and the way it is dispensed</li>
            <li>Love how my skin feels!</li>
            <li>As part of my efforts, I&#x27;d had a glycolic peel which had produced amazing results.</li>
            <li>I think this stuff is fabulous and it was a great deal.</li>
            <li>I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>As good as some of the more pricey boutique products out there.</li>
            <li>Could be this isn&#x27;t a one size fits all kind of thing.</li>
            <li>The one nice thing was the L&#x27;Oreal product smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Also the eye cream is nice.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say this is my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would probably get this product again, as I like it, and as this size is good for travel, but I hope the manufacturer will inspect the automated system better.</li>
            <li>I do think though I have seen a nice change in my skin tone after about a month.  </li>
            <li>The night cream is awesome, it&#x27;s so smooth and creamy and light.</li>
            <li>Nice product, you get what you pay.</li>
            <li>While this product did moisturizer nicely, that&#x27;s all it did.</li>
            <li>I love this product it work really good on my skin.</li>
            <li>This cream kind of just sat there</li>
            <li>This cream kind of just sat there</li>
            <li>It really hydrates and smoothes your skin, creating a flawless look.</li>
            <li>Could be this isn&#x27;t a one size fits all kind of thing.</li>
            <li>Loved the face cream and under eye cream the most.</li>
            <li>I am liking both of the lotions - nice scent, not greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Nice product for the price.</li>
            <li>when am use this my face very sofe this work very good not expensive and work very good</li>
            <li>the price is not expensive, and the quality is good!</li>
            <li>this product are very good and reasonable price, been a custumer for almost a year, and probably will continue to be</li>
            <li>, I loved the smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>I think this L&#x27;Oreal is okay, if you like have this kind of product, I recommend you to buy Burt&#x27;s Bee.</li>
            <li>It stood out as being the most effective of the three products.</li>
            <li>The product is awesome, makes my skin so clear.</li>
            <li>SO FAR SO GOOD!!!</li>
            <li>, so don&#x27;t know if I would recommend it for that, but the night cream is lovely and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to use too muchdue to the design of the package (which is primarily my own problem lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love eye crean because it has a massage tool</li>
            <li>It was refreshing under my eyes after showering.  </li>
            <li>I apply the eye cream in the morning and it looks like I got my precious nine hours.    </li>
            <li>Basically, I simply want to age gracefully and look the best I can (or a tad bit better) for my age</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this about 2 weeks and love the product.     </li>
            <li>- many of the reviews I read about this said they used their fingers to apply instead of the attached applicator.  </li>
            <li>Many high-end eye creams come with applicators.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a magical turn around</li>
            <li>or if you do it will take more than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>My favorite was the day cream with sufficient SPF protection.  </li>
            <li>and I do intend to get into the habit of using these for wrinkle/age prevention, but I LOVE how the serum has transformed my skin and feels so lightweight.  </li>
            <li>but the quantities are more along the lines of a sampler...</li>
            <li>My skin responds more to my hydration levels and food choices.  </li>
            <li>I love the under eye cream with the slide tube.</li>
            <li>However, I could tell within a week that my skin looked so much better.</li>
            <li>lol I don&#x27;t really care for the eye cream</li>
            <li>I love the eye cream and the day/night cream.  </li>
            <li>Eye cream is great, serum not so much.</li>
            <li>I consider it more like trial size.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed my lotions from L&#x27;Oreal skin care of Paris.</li>
            <li>- While my skin appears more even toned, it looks a shade darker.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>I believe my skin is getting better and better.</li>
            <li>I personally am satisfied with the quality of this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to others, a very happy purchase.</li>
            <li>I bought this one as a gift to my sister and she love it.</li>
            <li>The day lotion is one of the only lotions with sunscreen i can use without getting irritation, and best of all,  it does not make me feel like I have a plastic film on my skin.</li>
            <li>The eye cream is my favorite because of the texture -</li>
            <li>I cannot say that I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in winkles because I don&#x27;t have any, but, at the end of the day my skin looked more rested, a difference I never noticed with Olay.</li>
            <li>sure if it is helping because I need to be more faithful in using products.</li>
            <li>Love the deal I got on it though.</li>
            <li>Overall we are happy!</li>
            <li>For example i add more between my eyebrows and nose area.</li>
            <li>i look more awake even if i&#x27;m going on 3 hours of sleep.</li>
            <li>I love love love the day/night cream.</li>
            <li>I just love it</li>
            <li>I love these L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
            <li>and I love the eye cream.</li>
            <li>l&#x27;oreal  is one of my favorite anyway.</li>
            <li>I read most of the reviews before buying these products.</li>
            <li>Te rest of the products are OK.</li>
            <li>Although it is sized as more of a try before you buy.</li>
            <li>so that was OK.</li>
            <li>Can not return because gifted away already, beacause was march8.</li>
            <li>I love the eye cream.</li>
            <li>I used and love the Day/Night cream</li>
            <li>I believe), and my favorite - the eye serum.</li>
            <li>i love the smell and feel of the night cream.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this product.  </li>
            <li>But that is OK.</li>
            <li>not as expected considering the size , it might be good as a travelling size , good quality, good brand</li>
            <li>really evident as i was having issues with my acne treatment drying out my skin, and prematurely aging me!!! :)</li>
            <li>- Skin feels very clean  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a good product but have to be consistent with the usage</li>
            <li>but she confirmed that the area under my eyes looked more crepey.</li>
            <li>but I felt I need something more relevant for my aging skin.  </li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews on line and apparently the L&#x27;Oreal Genesis products have received great reviews and most users prefer the Genesis line over Youth Code.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li>My husband liked the small tube applicator best.</li>
            <li>soft and supple looks great</li>
            <li>Sample sizes are my favorite to buy in products so I can decide if I want to purchase the full size without wasting more money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Economically it can be a good deal to get the 3 combined products in one package, for the one price, as opposed to buying them separately if you really like this brand.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t smell like much of anything, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>the lotion doesn&#x27;t make me 18 again?!), but my skin looks good and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>absorbs easy, smells great, kept skin nice and soft, love the under eye cream in particular, would def purchase again!</li>
            <li>I did not see a significant reduction in wrinkles or lines on my skin, as I do with a top of the line Elizabeth Arden product.  </li>
            <li>It is just as described and came very quickly.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily without any residue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, with an Amazon Vine option making it easy to try this one, I figured -- why not?</li>
            <li>It has quite a strong perfumed smell.</li>
            <li>This trio pack is the perfect way to test it out for long enough to see if it will work for you- great value without committing to a huge bottle of something.</li>
            <li>Just got this in and its a great product, never tried these kinds of cremes before, but I can really tell a difference right away</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light, which I like very much.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t live up to that one, but there are still a lot of good things about the product.</li>
            <li>Both apply smoothly and easily.  </li>
            <li>I like the way the eye care helps with the fine lines</li>
            <li>I would advise using it as a preventive measure against aging skin or if you have fine lines and combo/dry skin.</li>
            <li>I would advise using it as a preventive measure against aging skin or if you have fine lines and combo/dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m 42 and have just started to notice fine lines around my eyes</li>
            <li>Loved it went out and bought the youth code products  very sensitive to all products</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t require anything special to get my foundation to look great and my eye makeup actually stayed better.  </li>
            <li>The smell is light and comfortable, the texture is smooth but not oily at all.   </li>
            <li>Both the day cream and the night cream are quite nice, with a perfect texture--not too thin, not too greasy.</li>
            <li>This is so light &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave my skin all greasy &amp; oily feeling.</li>
            <li>It feels like your using an ice cube to smooth on the lotion.  </li>
            <li>While I enjoy the softness and it&#x27;s fountain of youth theme, I don&#x27;t think that I would have put it on my shopping list.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil Fragrance Free Moisturizing Cream, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of</li>
            <li>I think the eye cream is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and at age 68 I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great set for the price especially as a Xmas gift</li>
            <li>almost like just a really nice lotion than much else.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I thought it was a great product .  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizer goes on smoothly and seems to &amp;#34;sink in&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>so my makeup goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen my clock move backwards yet in terms of firmness and wrinkles, but my skin is velvety smooth and supple.  </li>
            <li>The daily cream is great for a midday boost.</li>
            <li>the containers are sooo cute it makes you want to keep using them cuz its fun</li>
            <li>I like this product and it was a great way to try different things trying to deal with my skin issues.</li>
            <li>Day cream is light and SP30.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, good basic products, but I won&#x27;t be paying for any more.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer, not heavy, kept skin smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I bought this starter kit along with the serum hoping to get the best results as fast as possible.</li>
            <li>I will say, however, that good skin is more than topical products.</li>
            <li>This product is good for young women that want to begin a anti aging skin care regimen.  </li>
            <li>Hands down, this product has a beautiful scent, my favorite in fact.      </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely so refreshing right out of the shower</li>
            <li>It moisturized fine and went on smooth, but it just wasn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li>the lotions feel clean and comfortable rather than gloopy or greasy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say the results were spectacular (in terms of the product&#x27;s claims), but on average, it&#x27;s a good product line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The eye cream really helps, the day/night cream is great for keeping me moisturized despite the dry heat in my apartment, and the day lotion is nice and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is surprising to me as most people with dry skin say it works for them as well.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now and the face wash is really nice, surprising my skin didn&#x27;t feel stripped or tight after using it.</li>
            <li>i would suggest using l&#x27;oreal 360 clean for a face wash to go along with the products here.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t very greasy &amp; went on very smooth.  </li>
            <li>day moisturizer with SPF is very light - much like [[ASIN:B002JAYMEE</li>
            <li>I got this set as a gift for my sister but relatively impressed as it was hard to track for delivery.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>good price to buy such a set.</li>
            <li>I have adult onset acne and am on a separate, yet effective, regimen for that through Clinique, so I needed something to try that wouldn&#x27;t counteract or react with it.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s a personal decision ... if you have the money and it makes your skin feel good, go for it.</li>
            <li>Loved this product, lasted almost a month of daily use.</li>
            <li>I like this product as it gives you a day mosturizer with an spf of 30, which is a nice lotion and not heavy.  </li>
            <li>The under eye treatment is actually very soothing to put on and it gives my skin a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>The point of the eye tool is it is metal, which keeps it cool, to help reduce puffyness.  </li>
            <li>The night cream is a abt a tablespoon full...</li>
            <li>maybe a bit more, not not by much.</li>
            <li>The jars are just larger than sample size but a good deal for the money.</li>
            <li>find I don&#x27;t need much day lotion, but require more when using the day/night cream.</li>
            <li>so you buy the full size of course.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s true that there&#x27;s no greasy feel</li>
            <li>They are smaller in size but a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased this for that very reason.</li>
            <li>Cool and creamy on my skin...</li>
            <li>All in all not a bad product.  </li>
            <li>Very fast and easy routine to get</li>
            <li>The cream is a very small tub however it is perfect for traveling</li>
            <li>The other items, the daytime lotion is great</li>
            <li>Mine used up quickly, but that is because I forgot sunscreen at the beach one day and used this product on my body.</li>
            <li>If I drink enough water and eat more fruits and veggies, I have better skin.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly</li>
            <li>Granted, I only bought this product earlier in the week, but I am so impressed I couldn&#x27;t wait to write a review.  </li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Not too greasy, absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Eye cream works great to diminished my dark circles and crows feet.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you apply this to both your face and neck, you will certainly use it up very quickly.    </li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would be more gentle, because I definitely wanted a good eye cream I could use long-term to keep my eyes looking youthful.</li>
            <li>The idea is that your skin will appear more youthful and I&#x27;ve not noticed anyone wondering who the new girl is.      </li>
            <li>No grease like feel and it absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is absorbed quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty good skin, but 10+ years later the wrinkles came.  </li>
            <li>However, the kit is a good way to try out the product line (you pretty much get one product for free), especially if your skin doesn&#x27;t do well with mix-and-matching.</li>
            <li>It has gotten me interested in taking better care of my skin now that I am getting older.</li>
            <li>should start using some anti aging products under their eyes, laugh line area, etc.</li>
            <li>After some success with Revitalift, I decided to give Youth Code a shot when the drugstore was out of Revitalift.</li>
            <li>But the soft cream to help your eyes and neck and face seem okay.     </li>
            <li>Then I realized that most of the \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t work\\&quot; comments I read are in the 20-39 year old range.</li>
            <li>In the final analysis it was nice to try it out</li>
            <li>If you are not a regular user of moisturizers, then this is a good, economic starter product set.  </li>
            <li>Is effective the entire work day</li>
            <li>I am slightly more mature and prefer roc products.</li>
            <li>But if you have deep wrinkles from either over exposure to the sun, neglect, genetics and/or age no over-the-counter cream will be effective.</li>
            <li>The creams felt nice going on, but definitely did not produce desirable results.</li>
            <li>Then I realized that most of the &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t work&amp;#34; comments I read are in the 20-39 year old range.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s rare.</li>
            <li>Like most claims on skin creams this one is ok but nothing special - just your typical skin cream.  </li>
            <li>All products are high quality and the mini sizing allows for easy travel with them all.</li>
            <li>complaint is that the two moisturizers come in these very nice looking containers which are really geared more towards appearance than functionality.  </li>
            <li>The scent of all these products is pleasant and relatively mild, although the tub of day/night moisturizer smells a little like</li>
            <li>It is a good moisturizer, but did not &#x27;plump&#x27; the collagen in my agin skin as well as other products do.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this long or often enough to give a very fair review about its claims and results..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s probably the right product for you.</li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>OK, it&#x27;s true that you get what you pay for and after I finished these I went back to bioelements anyway.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I got these sample sizes rather than spending big bucks on full size.</li>
            <li>and all,  a good item that normally runs for double the price at retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this item.</li>
            <li>next add the eye cream using the very easy to use applicator.</li>
            <li>this product is good, the day cream is well absorbed but not as successful as expected, the taste of the night I left me a little more skin softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>but apparently with more moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There appears to be a lot more science and technology claimed than is readily apparent.  </li>
            <li>There was no difference in wrinkles, age spots, or anything else that would make my skin look &amp;#34;younger.&amp;#34; For the price, you&#x27;re not getting anything with Youth Code that you can&#x27;t get with a lower cost general moisturizer at your favorite drug store.</li>
            <li>it really does keep your under eye area feeling cool all day.</li>
            <li>can honestly recommend this product and believe as long as I can still get it, I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li>The eye cream could&#x27;ve been a little more moisterizing, but it&#x27;s okay for summer.  </li>
            <li>Due to the ever increasing price of everything, I, like many, have had to depart from department store products only to find drug store products are equally as good.  </li>
            <li>It came in a strong package, and inside it was surrounded with aired plastic bags.</li>
            <li>Overall, all three products are excellent and I&#x27;ve been using all of them everyday with no issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pretty pumped about this when I first got it, but it was not at all worth it to me.  </li>
            <li>I was given this kit for my birthday last year and liked it so much I bought a kit myself.</li>
            <li>This lotion set is a nice, complete moisture regimen that gives seamless around the clock hydration.  </li>
            <li>(As most creams for mature skin are very oily and my skin is already combination).</li>
            <li>Great value and worth it to at least try it.</li>
            <li>Even after a sleepless night of looking at a computer, it totally reduced the appearance of fine lines and bags!</li>
            <li>thank you very much 100% recommended</li>
            <li>However based on the title of Youth Code I was hoping they would help with fine lines and so far I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in that aspect</li>
            <li>Purchased instead of oil of olay- really like the product, as I have very sensitive skin- shipping was fast and packaging appropriate.</li>
            <li>With this particular bottle, I got the same moisturizing effects as the lower price popular drug store brands, but without any exfoliation to speak of.</li>
            <li>but it definitely does lend the skin a quality of luminescence for a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>It felt greasy, and didn&#x27;t feel like it soaked into my skin, rather just left a film on top of my skin.  </li>
            <li>For those that are buying High-End Department Store products it would be a savings for sure, but not necessarily for the drug-store-brand buyers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Eye Cream dispenser is intended to let you use it without touching it with your fingers (and getting your finger oils mixed in)</li>
            <li>While it seemed to work at first, within an hour</li>
            <li>I was blown away on the first day.</li>
            <li>but I also wondered if my frustration over my breakouts might have made me more critical of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went for my weekly facial, my aesthetician just about blew her top.</li>
            <li>It is equally as moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li>Today is the first time I used this.</li>
            <li>The product promises to improve the tiny lines many of us have in 7-10 days.</li>
            <li>This is more than enough for a month supply of all these products.</li>
            <li>and the seller packaged it very well!</li>
            <li>Whether this was because my skin was actually improving or because the lotion helped to prime my makeup better, who knows, but I like it.    </li>
            <li>Thanks for those products!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wrinkles haven&#x27;t exactly disappeared overnight</li>
            <li>the texture is better but not the actual appearance, i think after i run out i won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>If using these products you should use the serum first.</li>
            <li>FIRST TIME USING THIS PRODUCT,</li>
            <li>I love the way the product works on my skin, I could see an immediate difference especially with the eye serum.</li>
            <li>and they aren&#x27;t that big of product . :-)</li>
            <li>It may be better for younger women (39  or so.)</li>
            <li>moisturizers goes on so smoothly, the eye care does not affect my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I love this product, so glad I purchased 2 at a time, the items are packaged in small sizes.</li>
            <li>The day and night moisturizers in this set are very creamy, but absorb quickly without leaving a greasy feeling to your skin which I really like.  </li>
            <li>It provides adequate moisture for oily to normal skin types, and I found it worked well by itself for my skin.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend if you are fair skinned and sensitive stick with a different product.</li>
            <li>The day/night cream is meant for dry spots and has a light clean scent, highly concentrated, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The eye cream has a metallic, slanted tip, which is supposed to make application easier, but I found it tricky at best because it would drag and pull the skin, so I just used my little finger to pat it on.</li>
            <li>Day Lotion is a pleasant enough general moisturizer with a decent amount of SPF.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this as comparable to the other lotions I own (lancome, paula&#x27;s choice, clinique)</li>
            <li>She loved it and after a few days i think there was a real change in her sking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Olay, Garnier, ROC and found some made me break out even more, made my already oily skin more so, or dried it out completely.</li>
            <li>I wish the nite cream would of been larger but other then that it is great</li>
            <li>I am not sure why I did not feel good using this product.</li>
            <li>And also the things it comes with are a good size , they arent that small</li>
            <li>Many products don&#x27;t work with my dry, senstive skin</li>
            <li>- Still have large pores  </li>
            <li>the price, YOUTH CODE is pretty decent.</li>
            <li>For the price, YOUTH CODE is pretty decent.</li>
            <li>i add more than suggested just because i have very dry skin.</li>
            <li>Nice little gift set</li>
            <li>I thought you were at least in your early 20s!\\&quot; comments when proudly producing my ID.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This seems to work really well.  </li>
            <li>Still, I don&#x27;t see much of a change yet.</li>
            <li>Now, we don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really the fountain of youth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 46 and have had acne my whole life.</li>
            <li>Re: complaints on \\&quot;matte finish\\&quot; to skin - as someone who has had really oily skin for 30+ years</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>POP, too much</li>
            <li>I have been using the products for 2 weeks and am amazed that there really is a difference.</li>
            <li>My skin really does look younger!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Creams are smooth and not especially greasy.  </li>
            <li>I really can see a difference after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>I think the products contained in this kit, separately or together, would be appreciated by women of any age.</li>
            <li>Wife really likes it and it works well</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much about the eye cream, though.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much softer.</li>
            <li>I really like this kit.  </li>
            <li>I really can see some changes which was a surprise to me.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo2BZVTVKLH8DPY]]I purchased, and began using, the three step L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code (face wash, serum intense, and day/night cream) about three weeks ago.</li>
            <li>the delivery is fast.</li>
            <li>These work very well for my partly oily and partly skin.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really liking the kit.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s silky/creamy and really leaves a dewey texture on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This sample set does come with a very small-size pot</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast and  no damage to report!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was cooling and really helped with dryness and puffiness.</li>
            <li>if he noticed that means they were really standing out because he never notices my skin.</li>
            <li>The shipment was as fast as they promised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 46 and have had acne my whole life.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use mine much</li>
            <li>and if I put too much on, it gets flaky and just sits on the surface of my skin.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very affordable kit.</li>
            <li>It has good moisturizing coverage with thick lotion.</li>
            <li>Also absent is that strong scent of plastic, again present in most UV blockers, even though you can smell a slight hint of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read other reviews where people loved the eye cream, so I suppose you should try it for yourself, as age and skin-type may be a big factor with this item.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so sure that I just hadn&#x27;t given this enough time, which is why I went back and tried the day/night and day moisturizers again, but after all that, I pretty much give up.</li>
            <li>I only used it once a day which still gave significant benefit.</li>
            <li>Loreal in the other and I am glad Loreal won.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got significant allergies and could definitely have done without that</li>
            <li>the serum and cream combined does make the finer lines on my face seem less prominent but the big disadvantage is that it makes my pores seem huge and really stand out.</li>
            <li>i would suggest using this product as younger adults and for adults who have taken great care of there skin in the past.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for products that promos high end results for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My chin broke out, the fine lines I do have suddenly became crevices, and I&#x27;m now going to have to throw away about $90 worth of products that I bought from here and my local store.</li>
            <li>I have never had or tried a skin care kit before, so this was very new to me.  </li>
            <li>This product is good, but the specific night cream container I got was only half full, although sealed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is nice and light with plenty of coverage in a minimal amount - just a few drops a day.</li>
            <li>feels cool to the skin around the eye, which can be soothing especially in summer.  </li>
            <li>It has a kind of perfumy smell that I got used to, but it made my skin break out in small acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my dark circles getting better.  </li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s particularly fussy about health care products.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to someone my age or older</li>
            <li>Loreal - get with the program, we don&#x27;t want to stink just to have decent lotion.</li>
            <li>and I kept breaking out, particularly on my nose.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and absorbs quickly, and throughout the day my skin doesn&#x27;t get as greasy as it was with Olay Total Effects SPF lotion.</li>
            <li>But if you have deep wrinkles from either over exposure to the sun, neglect, genetics and/or age no over-the-counter cream will be effective.absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Decent value for the money.</li>
            <li>They ARE tiny, you&#x27;re just imagining it bigger and with more</li>
            <li>maybe the reason is my skin kind is not suitable for this lotion.</li>
            <li>stars cause of high price</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a skin care and make up lover, from high end to drugstore.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a high quality cream, don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>A small amount is needed and it smoothes over the skin very easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;she said that after 2 weeks, she did feel that her skin was softer, and noticed a little more firm.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li>The other 2 bottles in this set have the ounces labeled, but this one does not, and I found it ran out very quickly.</li>
            <li>Unscented, gentle and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I normally can&#x27;t wear moisturizer or any make up on my face.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth trying until the next one comes along.</li>
            <li>The eye cream felt ok going on, but I have not used it long enough to determine if it will make a difference with my under eye circles.</li>
            <li>Improves my normally oily t-zone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most of the product was dried out as if it had been on shelf for awhile.  </li>
            <li>my significant other even said he could really see my pores and he volunteered this info i didn&#x27;t ask so</li>
            <li>Normally, my skin regimen consists of a glycerin soap, followed by alpha-hydroxy lotion.</li>
            <li>I noticed that after about 5 minutes of applying it, I had to apply more because it just didn&#x27;t slough off any dry skin or moisturize properly.</li>
            <li>It actually worked really well, with significant moisturizing that lasted several hours.</li>
            <li>sunscreen moisturizer only takes a little bit to be effective.</li>
            <li>Purchased as a gift as my sister need a new perk in her makeup,this did the trick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly thicker than the day lotion but goes on easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the desert where the sun is intense so sunscreen is an absolute must- even if outside for 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The boxes looks very old, not like a new.</li>
            <li>try not to put any of the day lotion under your eyes that is a very sensitive area.</li>
            <li>Was loosely placed in an envelope and mailed to me, but luckily this wasn&#x27;t a gift.  </li>
            <li>If I only knew at 10 to not rub them so much!</li>
            <li>She has used O&#x27;lay in the past and there was a much more visible effect.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, it can get expensive to keep up with nice skin care products!  </li>
            <li>The product sizes aren&#x27;t too small, so I&#x27;ll be able to use for a month or so.</li>
            <li>After using the combination of lotions and creams for the past month, I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used the eye cream, kept eye area puffiness down and smooth.    </li>
            <li>I am not seeing any result on this product and it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed too well on my dry skin</li>
            <li>The inner container is white to make it look like it&#x27;s full, but I suspect it may not be.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and has made make up application much more even than I&#x27;ve had in the past with other products.</li>
            <li>The metal applicator is a nice touch, in that it&#x27;s naturally cooling for your eye skin, but I found that it was hard to apply smoothly and ended up just using my finger as usual.</li>
            <li>This was new to me, as I don&#x27;t really get pimples, so multiple pimples was totally unexpected.</li>
            <li>day moisturizer was lightweight and, frankly, a little light in the contents department.</li>
            <li>After a few days the fine lines at the corner of my eyes are nearly gone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to say that the results are any better than [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>my skin is clear and everyone can tell how hydrated my face is.</li>
            <li>Intense, although it&#x27;s touted on the inner paperwork) .  </li>
            <li>My suggestion for the eye cream&#x27;s metal applicator:  be sure to squeeze some cream before dabbing under the eyes, otherwise the applicator pulls on delicate skin in that</li>
            <li>While testing them, although I did not use the products exclusively, I completely used up everything in the package over a time period of about a month.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still in my early 20s</li>
            <li>Even the nighttime cream seems to be light, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your skin.</li>
            <li>my skin just didn&#x27;t seem moisturized (plus the whole sunscreen thing was a big deal for me).</li>
            <li>I was really reluctant to try the sunscreen for fear of breakout out the second I put it</li>
            <li>The result was that my skin had been looking better lately than it had in YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I shared it with my sister ,63 years old.</li>
            <li>I do tend to have sensitive skin and am age 29.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the jar of night cream didn&#x27;t have much product in it.</li>
            <li>that you&#x27;re supposed to use to apply the lotion directly on the periorbital area.  </li>
            <li>It only took a couple of days and she really noticed</li>
            <li>i use the one for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>They give out old stuff.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t use the eye cream as much as i was intending to, but i do use the day lotion regularly.</li>
            <li>and I do not think that I would buy it for myself, simply because it doesn&#x27;t give me any \\&quot;luxurious moments\\&quot; when applying the products to my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t have any significantly better effects than other skin care products I am using (at about the same price range).</li>
            <li>A second application made my face really greasy after an hour or so, though, and I noticed a significant patchiness and uneven color to my skin.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the perfume smell is very strong.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, in the past 2 months, I&#x27;ve gotten carded for liquor way more at restaurants and a have received several \\&quot;Oh</li>
            <li>Just a few minutes after applying the lotions or the creams, neither of us can feel the product on the surface of our skin, but our faces feel baby soft and remain that way, even after a full day at work.  </li>
            <li>Overall the kit has a pleasant faint fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It goes onto her skin feeling a little oily, but is completely absorbed in a matter of minutes and keeps her face feeling soft all day.</li>
            <li>I would put this on and then about half an hour later go to put makeup on and need more because of some dry patches on the skin.</li>
            <li>lotion--15 is usually not enough but is more common.</li>
            <li>; if it is it didn&#x27;t happen with regularity, so either I was applying too much or ingredients were not mixed enough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too thick and doesn&#x27;t give that whitish hue that I find with most sunscreens with an SPF above 15.</li>
            <li>I am going back to my usual department store brand, which of course I can&#x27;t name, but to compare price note that a tub of it the same size as the day/night Youth Code is just under $20 and performs exponentially better.</li>
            <li>The other products in this 3 pc kit is my first time trying</li>
            <li>Some have complained that they leave the skin too matte, but that&#x27;s a plus in my book as so many creams take forever to absorb and make it hard to apply make-up quickly.</li>
            <li>- I used very little of the daily and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to love it, and used it for a month and half hoping the new onset of pimples would disappear, but they just got worse.</li>
            <li>The Elizabeth Arden and Olay Pro X lines recommended by other users caused huge breakouts for me and did nothing for the dry spots - except make them slippery and red.      </li>
            <li>The pros are:  - Skin is clear, the only breakouts I have had are from eating chocolate or pizza  </li>
            <li>I noticed a reduction in dark circles but my skin is too sensitive to it and it has made that area swollen sometimes but very unnoticiable.</li>
            <li>I went back to my old regimen and pimples have subsided, but the scarring remains.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve got combination oily/normal skin and have occasional adult acne.</li>
            <li>Youth says it all, probably for younger people because for mature skin it does nothing.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only issue I&#x27;ve had so far</li>
            <li>Both add moisture which takes a few minutes to be absorbed, but then stays with me all day</li>
            <li>This kit is nice to try out if your skeptical of buying it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a heavy application to get this line to work - so I&#x27;d say if you are seeing irritation or need to use quite a bit to get the skin texture you want, this isn&#x27;t the right product for you.      </li>
            <li>The first couple of times I used the eye cream it burned slightly, but hasn&#x27;t since.</li>
            <li>The eye cream is pretty much a normal size tube but the day and night cream (especially) are small.</li>
            <li>None of the products in this kit was the issue--I was able to narrow it down to the BB cream!</li>
            <li>No one likes a half empty container for a full price.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am please with L&#x27;Oreal products in general.</li>
            <li>I am not sure that it is worth the cost, however.</li>
            <li>My skin around the eyes seemed hydrated and slightly softer, but I noticed that it didn&#x27;t really keep the hydration after washing my face or taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it in the past and it really has made a difference under my eyes as far as color and puffiness.</li>
            <li>The first 2 nights I used it, white chunks sloughed off my face, and I&#x27;ve found a few gummy bits in the tub of moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Further, with absolutely every other moisturizer I have used, I use a significant amount for a few days but then can start to use less of it as my skin adapts to the moisture.</li>
            <li>The day lotion just wasn&#x27;t enough for my fairly dry skin, so I passed it along to my 47-year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I personally would use the day Youth Code brand as a secondary moisturizer for times when I end up washing my face in the middle of the day and need something quick and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Feels great!  </li>

            <li> /&gt;The nighttime cream (called the day/night cream because it can be used for both) is best used as an overnight cream put on just before bed, but I&#x27;ve used it both ways.</li>

            <li> She is a winemaker who is often out in the vineyards, so the SPF 30 in the day lotion is a very good thing.  </li>
            <li> which is very good</li>
            <li> I ordered the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Regenerating Skincare package for my mother&#x27;s birthday and she absolutely loved this product!</li>
            <li> this is awesome and a good deal.</li>
            <li> have found Youth Code to be a joy to use.</li>
            <li> But for the elderly people - 50+ - you will be extremely happy with this under eye product.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this stuff.</li>
            <li> for that this product is great.</li>
            <li> Great for travel.</li>
            <li> each lol</li>
            <li> If you travel, the sizes are great.  </li>
            <li> I love this skin care line!!</li>
            <li> It was smoother and felt very nice to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Very nice, my girl said so.</li>
            <li> I switched from Clinque to Youth Code and while I feel the product is better for my skin, it is not the best product for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love the daytime lotion... and the day cream is excellent.</li>
            <li> but with a more attractive price!</li>
            <li> A good price and great products.</li>
            <li> I was able to choose the best one for my mom</li>
            <li> Great product for a good price.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, the brand is also very good.</li>
            <li> They also have a pleasant frangrance.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprise.</li>
            <li> I will say it feels good on the skin, not oily and does not immediately disappear like some skin creams.</li>
            <li> My take is that if it feels good on your skin</li>
            <li> These do feel good on my face.</li>
            <li> This was a good way to try and while I like the products</li>
            <li> But, for a drugstore brand this is good stuff</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a great and effective product, but L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Youth Code was not it.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena was good</li>
            <li> The commodity is good, price privilege.</li>
            <li> I used this product for over two weeks to give it a fair shot.</li>
            <li> Good quality and brand.</li>
            <li> A good deal for your money.</li>
            <li> She tried this product, and LOVED the eye wand.</li>
            <li> It was a really good choice for a woman on her birthday.</li>
            <li> this is just a good product I have ordered it twice before this</li>
            <li> Price  is good.  </li>
            <li> good for my face.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of the product, it was all very refreshing, and the product lasted just a bit longer than it claimed.</li>
            <li> And if it helps my skin look more refreshed at the end of my day, great! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I love it, it is great...</li>
            <li> these are great products and i will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Great value for the money and have all my favorites in one boxEspecially love the eye correction cream and the way it is dispensed</li>
            <li> Love how my skin feels!</li>
            <li> As part of my efforts, I&#x27;d had a glycolic peel which had produced amazing results.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff is fabulous and it was a great deal.</li>
            <li> I really liked it.  </li>
            <li> As good as some of the more pricey boutique products out there.</li>
            <li> Could be this isn&#x27;t a one size fits all kind of thing.</li>
            <li> The one nice thing was the L&#x27;Oreal product smells nice.  </li>
            <li> Also the eye cream is nice.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say this is my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would probably get this product again, as I like it, and as this size is good for travel, but I hope the manufacturer will inspect the automated system better.</li>
            <li> I do think though I have seen a nice change in my skin tone after about a month.  </li>
            <li> The night cream is awesome, it&#x27;s so smooth and creamy and light.</li>
            <li> Nice product, you get what you pay.</li>
            <li> While this product did moisturizer nicely, that&#x27;s all it did.</li>
            <li> I love this product it work really good on my skin.</li>
            <li> This cream kind of just sat there</li>
            <li> This cream kind of just sat there</li>
            <li> It really hydrates and smoothes your skin, creating a flawless look.</li>
            <li> Could be this isn&#x27;t a one size fits all kind of thing.</li>
            <li> Loved the face cream and under eye cream the most.</li>
            <li> I am liking both of the lotions - nice scent, not greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Nice product for the price.</li>
            <li> when am use this my face very sofe this work very good not expensive and work very good</li>
            <li> the price is not expensive, and the quality is good!</li>
            <li> this product are very good and reasonable price, been a custumer for almost a year, and probably will continue to be</li>
            <li> , I loved the smooth finish.  </li>
            <li> I think this L&#x27;Oreal is okay, if you like have this kind of product, I recommend you to buy Burt&#x27;s Bee.</li>
            <li> It stood out as being the most effective of the three products.</li>
            <li> The product is awesome, makes my skin so clear.</li>
            <li> SO FAR SO GOOD!!!</li>
            <li> , so don&#x27;t know if I would recommend it for that, but the night cream is lovely and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to use too muchdue to the design of the package (which is primarily my own problem lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love eye crean because it has a massage tool</li>
            <li> It was refreshing under my eyes after showering.  </li>
            <li> I apply the eye cream in the morning and it looks like I got my precious nine hours.    </li>
            <li> Basically, I simply want to age gracefully and look the best I can (or a tad bit better) for my age</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about 2 weeks and love the product.     </li>
            <li> - many of the reviews I read about this said they used their fingers to apply instead of the attached applicator.  </li>
            <li> Many high-end eye creams come with applicators.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a magical turn around</li>
            <li> or if you do it will take more than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> My favorite was the day cream with sufficient SPF protection.  </li>
            <li> and I do intend to get into the habit of using these for wrinkle/age prevention, but I LOVE how the serum has transformed my skin and feels so lightweight.  </li>
            <li> but the quantities are more along the lines of a sampler...</li>
            <li> My skin responds more to my hydration levels and food choices.  </li>
            <li> I love the under eye cream with the slide tube.</li>
            <li> However, I could tell within a week that my skin looked so much better.</li>
            <li> lol I don&#x27;t really care for the eye cream</li>
            <li> I love the eye cream and the day/night cream.  </li>
            <li> Eye cream is great, serum not so much.</li>
            <li> I consider it more like trial size.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed my lotions from L&#x27;Oreal skin care of Paris.</li>
            <li> - While my skin appears more even toned, it looks a shade darker.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> I believe my skin is getting better and better.</li>
            <li> I personally am satisfied with the quality of this product.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to others, a very happy purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this one as a gift to my sister and she love it.</li>
            <li> The day lotion is one of the only lotions with sunscreen i can use without getting irritation, and best of all,  it does not make me feel like I have a plastic film on my skin.</li>
            <li> The eye cream is my favorite because of the texture -</li>
            <li> I cannot say that I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in winkles because I don&#x27;t have any, but, at the end of the day my skin looked more rested, a difference I never noticed with Olay.</li>
            <li> sure if it is helping because I need to be more faithful in using products.</li>
            <li> Love the deal I got on it though.</li>
            <li> Overall we are happy!</li>
            <li> For example i add more between my eyebrows and nose area.</li>
            <li> i look more awake even if i&#x27;m going on 3 hours of sleep.</li>
            <li> I love love love the day/night cream.</li>
            <li> I just love it</li>
            <li> I love these L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
            <li> and I love the eye cream.</li>
            <li> l&#x27;oreal  is one of my favorite anyway.</li>
            <li> I read most of the reviews before buying these products.</li>
            <li> Te rest of the products are OK.</li>
            <li> Although it is sized as more of a try before you buy.</li>
            <li> so that was OK.</li>
            <li> Can not return because gifted away already, beacause was march8.</li>
            <li> I love the eye cream.</li>
            <li> I used and love the Day/Night cream</li>
            <li> I believe), and my favorite - the eye serum.</li>
            <li> i love the smell and feel of the night cream.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product.  </li>
            <li> But that is OK.</li>
            <li> not as expected considering the size , it might be good as a travelling size , good quality, good brand</li>
            <li> really evident as i was having issues with my acne treatment drying out my skin, and prematurely aging me!!! :)</li>
            <li> - Skin feels very clean  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a good product but have to be consistent with the usage</li>
            <li> but she confirmed that the area under my eyes looked more crepey.</li>
            <li> but I felt I need something more relevant for my aging skin.  </li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews on line and apparently the L&#x27;Oreal Genesis products have received great reviews and most users prefer the Genesis line over Youth Code.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> My husband liked the small tube applicator best.</li>
            <li> soft and supple looks great</li>
            <li> Sample sizes are my favorite to buy in products so I can decide if I want to purchase the full size without wasting more money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Economically it can be a good deal to get the 3 combined products in one package, for the one price, as opposed to buying them separately if you really like this brand.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t smell like much of anything, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> the lotion doesn&#x27;t make me 18 again?!), but my skin looks good and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> absorbs easy, smells great, kept skin nice and soft, love the under eye cream in particular, would def purchase again!</li>
            <li> I did not see a significant reduction in wrinkles or lines on my skin, as I do with a top of the line Elizabeth Arden product.  </li>
            <li> It is just as described and came very quickly.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily without any residue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, with an Amazon Vine option making it easy to try this one, I figured -- why not?</li>
            <li> It has quite a strong perfumed smell.</li>
            <li> This trio pack is the perfect way to test it out for long enough to see if it will work for you- great value without committing to a huge bottle of something.</li>
            <li> Just got this in and its a great product, never tried these kinds of cremes before, but I can really tell a difference right away</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and light, which I like very much.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t live up to that one, but there are still a lot of good things about the product.</li>
            <li> Both apply smoothly and easily.  </li>
            <li> I like the way the eye care helps with the fine lines</li>
            <li> I would advise using it as a preventive measure against aging skin or if you have fine lines and combo/dry skin.</li>
            <li> I would advise using it as a preventive measure against aging skin or if you have fine lines and combo/dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m 42 and have just started to notice fine lines around my eyes</li>
            <li> Loved it went out and bought the youth code products  very sensitive to all products</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t require anything special to get my foundation to look great and my eye makeup actually stayed better.  </li>
            <li> The smell is light and comfortable, the texture is smooth but not oily at all.   </li>
            <li> Both the day cream and the night cream are quite nice, with a perfect texture--not too thin, not too greasy.</li>
            <li> This is so light &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave my skin all greasy &amp; oily feeling.</li>
            <li> It feels like your using an ice cube to smooth on the lotion.  </li>
            <li> While I enjoy the softness and it&#x27;s fountain of youth theme, I don&#x27;t think that I would have put it on my shopping list.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil Fragrance Free Moisturizing Cream, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of</li>
            <li> I think the eye cream is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and at age 68 I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great set for the price especially as a Xmas gift</li>
            <li> almost like just a really nice lotion than much else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I thought it was a great product .  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important.  </li>
            <li> The moisturizer goes on smoothly and seems to &amp;#34;sink in&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> so my makeup goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen my clock move backwards yet in terms of firmness and wrinkles, but my skin is velvety smooth and supple.  </li>
            <li> The daily cream is great for a midday boost.</li>
            <li> the containers are sooo cute it makes you want to keep using them cuz its fun</li>
            <li> I like this product and it was a great way to try different things trying to deal with my skin issues.</li>
            <li> Day cream is light and SP30.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, good basic products, but I won&#x27;t be paying for any more.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer, not heavy, kept skin smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought this starter kit along with the serum hoping to get the best results as fast as possible.</li>
            <li> I will say, however, that good skin is more than topical products.</li>
            <li> This product is good for young women that want to begin a anti aging skin care regimen.  </li>
            <li> Hands down, this product has a beautiful scent, my favorite in fact.      </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely so refreshing right out of the shower</li>
            <li> It moisturized fine and went on smooth, but it just wasn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li> the lotions feel clean and comfortable rather than gloopy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say the results were spectacular (in terms of the product&#x27;s claims), but on average, it&#x27;s a good product line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The eye cream really helps, the day/night cream is great for keeping me moisturized despite the dry heat in my apartment, and the day lotion is nice and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is surprising to me as most people with dry skin say it works for them as well.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now and the face wash is really nice, surprising my skin didn&#x27;t feel stripped or tight after using it.</li>
            <li> i would suggest using l&#x27;oreal 360 clean for a face wash to go along with the products here.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t very greasy &amp; went on very smooth.  </li>
            <li> day moisturizer with SPF is very light - much like [[ASIN:B002JAYMEE</li>
            <li> I got this set as a gift for my sister but relatively impressed as it was hard to track for delivery.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> good price to buy such a set.</li>
            <li> I have adult onset acne and am on a separate, yet effective, regimen for that through Clinique, so I needed something to try that wouldn&#x27;t counteract or react with it.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s a personal decision ... if you have the money and it makes your skin feel good, go for it.</li>
            <li> Loved this product, lasted almost a month of daily use.</li>
            <li> I like this product as it gives you a day mosturizer with an spf of 30, which is a nice lotion and not heavy.  </li>
            <li> The under eye treatment is actually very soothing to put on and it gives my skin a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> The point of the eye tool is it is metal, which keeps it cool, to help reduce puffyness.  </li>
            <li> The night cream is a abt a tablespoon full...</li>
            <li> maybe a bit more, not not by much.</li>
            <li> The jars are just larger than sample size but a good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> find I don&#x27;t need much day lotion, but require more when using the day/night cream.</li>
            <li> so you buy the full size of course.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s true that there&#x27;s no greasy feel</li>
            <li> They are smaller in size but a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this for that very reason.</li>
            <li> Cool and creamy on my skin...</li>
            <li> All in all not a bad product.  </li>
            <li> Very fast and easy routine to get</li>
            <li> The cream is a very small tub however it is perfect for traveling</li>
            <li> The other items, the daytime lotion is great</li>
            <li> Mine used up quickly, but that is because I forgot sunscreen at the beach one day and used this product on my body.</li>
            <li> If I drink enough water and eat more fruits and veggies, I have better skin.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly</li>
            <li> Granted, I only bought this product earlier in the week, but I am so impressed I couldn&#x27;t wait to write a review.  </li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy, absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> Eye cream works great to diminished my dark circles and crows feet.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you apply this to both your face and neck, you will certainly use it up very quickly.    </li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would be more gentle, because I definitely wanted a good eye cream I could use long-term to keep my eyes looking youthful.</li>
            <li> The idea is that your skin will appear more youthful and I&#x27;ve not noticed anyone wondering who the new girl is.      </li>
            <li> No grease like feel and it absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is absorbed quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty good skin, but 10+ years later the wrinkles came.  </li>
            <li> However, the kit is a good way to try out the product line (you pretty much get one product for free), especially if your skin doesn&#x27;t do well with mix-and-matching.</li>
            <li> It has gotten me interested in taking better care of my skin now that I am getting older.</li>
            <li> should start using some anti aging products under their eyes, laugh line area, etc.</li>
            <li> After some success with Revitalift, I decided to give Youth Code a shot when the drugstore was out of Revitalift.</li>
            <li> But the soft cream to help your eyes and neck and face seem okay.     </li>
            <li> Then I realized that most of the \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t work\\&quot; comments I read are in the 20-39 year old range.</li>
            <li> In the final analysis it was nice to try it out</li>
            <li> If you are not a regular user of moisturizers, then this is a good, economic starter product set.  </li>
            <li> Is effective the entire work day</li>
            <li> I am slightly more mature and prefer roc products.</li>
            <li> But if you have deep wrinkles from either over exposure to the sun, neglect, genetics and/or age no over-the-counter cream will be effective.</li>
            <li> The creams felt nice going on, but definitely did not produce desirable results.</li>
            <li> Then I realized that most of the &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t work&amp;#34; comments I read are in the 20-39 year old range.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s rare.</li>
            <li> Like most claims on skin creams this one is ok but nothing special - just your typical skin cream.  </li>
            <li> All products are high quality and the mini sizing allows for easy travel with them all.</li>
            <li> complaint is that the two moisturizers come in these very nice looking containers which are really geared more towards appearance than functionality.  </li>
            <li> The scent of all these products is pleasant and relatively mild, although the tub of day/night moisturizer smells a little like</li>
            <li> It is a good moisturizer, but did not &#x27;plump&#x27; the collagen in my agin skin as well as other products do.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long or often enough to give a very fair review about its claims and results..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s probably the right product for you.</li>
            <li> The price was right.</li>
            <li> OK, it&#x27;s true that you get what you pay for and after I finished these I went back to bioelements anyway.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I got these sample sizes rather than spending big bucks on full size.</li>
            <li> and all,  a good item that normally runs for double the price at retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> next add the eye cream using the very easy to use applicator.</li>
            <li> this product is good, the day cream is well absorbed but not as successful as expected, the taste of the night I left me a little more skin softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> but apparently with more moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There appears to be a lot more science and technology claimed than is readily apparent.  </li>
            <li> There was no difference in wrinkles, age spots, or anything else that would make my skin look &amp;#34;younger.&amp;#34; For the price, you&#x27;re not getting anything with Youth Code that you can&#x27;t get with a lower cost general moisturizer at your favorite drug store.</li>
            <li> it really does keep your under eye area feeling cool all day.</li>
            <li> can honestly recommend this product and believe as long as I can still get it, I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> The eye cream could&#x27;ve been a little more moisterizing, but it&#x27;s okay for summer.  </li>
            <li> Due to the ever increasing price of everything, I, like many, have had to depart from department store products only to find drug store products are equally as good.  </li>
            <li> It came in a strong package, and inside it was surrounded with aired plastic bags.</li>
            <li> Overall, all three products are excellent and I&#x27;ve been using all of them everyday with no issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pretty pumped about this when I first got it, but it was not at all worth it to me.  </li>
            <li> I was given this kit for my birthday last year and liked it so much I bought a kit myself.</li>
            <li> This lotion set is a nice, complete moisture regimen that gives seamless around the clock hydration.  </li>
            <li> (As most creams for mature skin are very oily and my skin is already combination).</li>
            <li> Great value and worth it to at least try it.</li>
            <li> Even after a sleepless night of looking at a computer, it totally reduced the appearance of fine lines and bags!</li>
            <li> thank you very much 100% recommended</li>
            <li> However based on the title of Youth Code I was hoping they would help with fine lines and so far I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in that aspect</li>
            <li> Purchased instead of oil of olay- really like the product, as I have very sensitive skin- shipping was fast and packaging appropriate.</li>
            <li> With this particular bottle, I got the same moisturizing effects as the lower price popular drug store brands, but without any exfoliation to speak of.</li>
            <li> but it definitely does lend the skin a quality of luminescence for a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> It felt greasy, and didn&#x27;t feel like it soaked into my skin, rather just left a film on top of my skin.  </li>
            <li> For those that are buying High-End Department Store products it would be a savings for sure, but not necessarily for the drug-store-brand buyers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Eye Cream dispenser is intended to let you use it without touching it with your fingers (and getting your finger oils mixed in)</li>
            <li> While it seemed to work at first, within an hour</li>
            <li> I was blown away on the first day.</li>
            <li> but I also wondered if my frustration over my breakouts might have made me more critical of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went for my weekly facial, my aesthetician just about blew her top.</li>
            <li> It is equally as moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li> Today is the first time I used this.</li>
            <li> The product promises to improve the tiny lines many of us have in 7-10 days.</li>
            <li> This is more than enough for a month supply of all these products.</li>
            <li> and the seller packaged it very well!</li>
            <li> Whether this was because my skin was actually improving or because the lotion helped to prime my makeup better, who knows, but I like it.    </li>
            <li> Thanks for those products!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wrinkles haven&#x27;t exactly disappeared overnight</li>
            <li> the texture is better but not the actual appearance, i think after i run out i won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> If using these products you should use the serum first.</li>
            <li> FIRST TIME USING THIS PRODUCT,</li>
            <li> I love the way the product works on my skin, I could see an immediate difference especially with the eye serum.</li>
            <li> and they aren&#x27;t that big of product . :-)</li>
            <li> It may be better for younger women (39  or so.)</li>
            <li> moisturizers goes on so smoothly, the eye care does not affect my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this product, so glad I purchased 2 at a time, the items are packaged in small sizes.</li>
            <li> The day and night moisturizers in this set are very creamy, but absorb quickly without leaving a greasy feeling to your skin which I really like.  </li>
            <li> It provides adequate moisture for oily to normal skin types, and I found it worked well by itself for my skin.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend if you are fair skinned and sensitive stick with a different product.</li>
            <li> The day/night cream is meant for dry spots and has a light clean scent, highly concentrated, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The eye cream has a metallic, slanted tip, which is supposed to make application easier, but I found it tricky at best because it would drag and pull the skin, so I just used my little finger to pat it on.</li>
            <li> Day Lotion is a pleasant enough general moisturizer with a decent amount of SPF.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this as comparable to the other lotions I own (lancome, paula&#x27;s choice, clinique)</li>
            <li> She loved it and after a few days i think there was a real change in her sking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Olay, Garnier, ROC and found some made me break out even more, made my already oily skin more so, or dried it out completely.</li>
            <li> I wish the nite cream would of been larger but other then that it is great</li>
            <li> I am not sure why I did not feel good using this product.</li>
            <li> And also the things it comes with are a good size , they arent that small</li>
            <li> Many products don&#x27;t work with my dry, senstive skin</li>
            <li> - Still have large pores  </li>
            <li> the price, YOUTH CODE is pretty decent.</li>
            <li> For the price, YOUTH CODE is pretty decent.</li>
            <li> i add more than suggested just because i have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Nice little gift set</li>
            <li> I thought you were at least in your early 20s!\\&quot; comments when proudly producing my ID.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This seems to work really well.  </li>
            <li> Still, I don&#x27;t see much of a change yet.</li>
            <li> Now, we don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really the fountain of youth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46 and have had acne my whole life.</li>
            <li> Re: complaints on \\&quot;matte finish\\&quot; to skin - as someone who has had really oily skin for 30+ years</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> POP, too much</li>
            <li> I have been using the products for 2 weeks and am amazed that there really is a difference.</li>
            <li> My skin really does look younger!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Creams are smooth and not especially greasy.  </li>
            <li> I really can see a difference after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I think the products contained in this kit, separately or together, would be appreciated by women of any age.</li>
            <li> Wife really likes it and it works well</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much about the eye cream, though.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much softer.</li>
            <li> I really like this kit.  </li>
            <li> I really can see some changes which was a surprise to me.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2BZVTVKLH8DPY]]I purchased, and began using, the three step L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code (face wash, serum intense, and day/night cream) about three weeks ago.</li>
            <li> the delivery is fast.</li>
            <li> These work very well for my partly oily and partly skin.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really liking the kit.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s silky/creamy and really leaves a dewey texture on my skin.  </li>
            <li> This sample set does come with a very small-size pot</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was fast and  no damage to report!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was cooling and really helped with dryness and puffiness.</li>
            <li> if he noticed that means they were really standing out because he never notices my skin.</li>
            <li> The shipment was as fast as they promised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46 and have had acne my whole life.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use mine much</li>
            <li> and if I put too much on, it gets flaky and just sits on the surface of my skin.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very affordable kit.</li>
            <li> It has good moisturizing coverage with thick lotion.</li>
            <li> Also absent is that strong scent of plastic, again present in most UV blockers, even though you can smell a slight hint of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews where people loved the eye cream, so I suppose you should try it for yourself, as age and skin-type may be a big factor with this item.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was so sure that I just hadn&#x27;t given this enough time, which is why I went back and tried the day/night and day moisturizers again, but after all that, I pretty much give up.</li>
            <li> I only used it once a day which still gave significant benefit.</li>
            <li> Loreal in the other and I am glad Loreal won.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got significant allergies and could definitely have done without that</li>
            <li> the serum and cream combined does make the finer lines on my face seem less prominent but the big disadvantage is that it makes my pores seem huge and really stand out.</li>
            <li> i would suggest using this product as younger adults and for adults who have taken great care of there skin in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for products that promos high end results for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My chin broke out, the fine lines I do have suddenly became crevices, and I&#x27;m now going to have to throw away about $90 worth of products that I bought from here and my local store.</li>
            <li> I have never had or tried a skin care kit before, so this was very new to me.  </li>
            <li> This product is good, but the specific night cream container I got was only half full, although sealed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is nice and light with plenty of coverage in a minimal amount - just a few drops a day.</li>
            <li> feels cool to the skin around the eye, which can be soothing especially in summer.  </li>
            <li> It has a kind of perfumy smell that I got used to, but it made my skin break out in small acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my dark circles getting better.  </li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s particularly fussy about health care products.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to someone my age or older</li>
            <li> Loreal - get with the program, we don&#x27;t want to stink just to have decent lotion.</li>
            <li> and I kept breaking out, particularly on my nose.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and absorbs quickly, and throughout the day my skin doesn&#x27;t get as greasy as it was with Olay Total Effects SPF lotion.</li>
            <li> But if you have deep wrinkles from either over exposure to the sun, neglect, genetics and/or age no over-the-counter cream will be effective.absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Decent value for the money.</li>
            <li> They ARE tiny, you&#x27;re just imagining it bigger and with more</li>
            <li> maybe the reason is my skin kind is not suitable for this lotion.</li>
            <li> stars cause of high price</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skin care and make up lover, from high end to drugstore.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a high quality cream, don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> A small amount is needed and it smoothes over the skin very easy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;she said that after 2 weeks, she did feel that her skin was softer, and noticed a little more firm.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> The other 2 bottles in this set have the ounces labeled, but this one does not, and I found it ran out very quickly.</li>
            <li> Unscented, gentle and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I normally can&#x27;t wear moisturizer or any make up on my face.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth trying until the next one comes along.</li>
            <li> The eye cream felt ok going on, but I have not used it long enough to determine if it will make a difference with my under eye circles.</li>
            <li> Improves my normally oily t-zone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most of the product was dried out as if it had been on shelf for awhile.  </li>
            <li> my significant other even said he could really see my pores and he volunteered this info i didn&#x27;t ask so</li>
            <li> Normally, my skin regimen consists of a glycerin soap, followed by alpha-hydroxy lotion.</li>
            <li> I noticed that after about 5 minutes of applying it, I had to apply more because it just didn&#x27;t slough off any dry skin or moisturize properly.</li>
            <li> It actually worked really well, with significant moisturizing that lasted several hours.</li>
            <li> sunscreen moisturizer only takes a little bit to be effective.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift as my sister need a new perk in her makeup,this did the trick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly thicker than the day lotion but goes on easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the desert where the sun is intense so sunscreen is an absolute must- even if outside for 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The boxes looks very old, not like a new.</li>
            <li> try not to put any of the day lotion under your eyes that is a very sensitive area.</li>
            <li> Was loosely placed in an envelope and mailed to me, but luckily this wasn&#x27;t a gift.  </li>
            <li> If I only knew at 10 to not rub them so much!</li>
            <li> She has used O&#x27;lay in the past and there was a much more visible effect.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, it can get expensive to keep up with nice skin care products!  </li>
            <li> The product sizes aren&#x27;t too small, so I&#x27;ll be able to use for a month or so.</li>
            <li> After using the combination of lotions and creams for the past month, I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used the eye cream, kept eye area puffiness down and smooth.    </li>
            <li> I am not seeing any result on this product and it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed too well on my dry skin</li>
            <li> The inner container is white to make it look like it&#x27;s full, but I suspect it may not be.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and has made make up application much more even than I&#x27;ve had in the past with other products.</li>
            <li> The metal applicator is a nice touch, in that it&#x27;s naturally cooling for your eye skin, but I found that it was hard to apply smoothly and ended up just using my finger as usual.</li>
            <li> This was new to me, as I don&#x27;t really get pimples, so multiple pimples was totally unexpected.</li>
            <li> day moisturizer was lightweight and, frankly, a little light in the contents department.</li>
            <li> After a few days the fine lines at the corner of my eyes are nearly gone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say that the results are any better than [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> my skin is clear and everyone can tell how hydrated my face is.</li>
            <li> Intense, although it&#x27;s touted on the inner paperwork) .  </li>
            <li> My suggestion for the eye cream&#x27;s metal applicator:  be sure to squeeze some cream before dabbing under the eyes, otherwise the applicator pulls on delicate skin in that</li>
            <li> While testing them, although I did not use the products exclusively, I completely used up everything in the package over a time period of about a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in my early 20s</li>
            <li> Even the nighttime cream seems to be light, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your skin.</li>
            <li> my skin just didn&#x27;t seem moisturized (plus the whole sunscreen thing was a big deal for me).</li>
            <li> I was really reluctant to try the sunscreen for fear of breakout out the second I put it</li>
            <li> The result was that my skin had been looking better lately than it had in YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shared it with my sister ,63 years old.</li>
            <li> I do tend to have sensitive skin and am age 29.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the jar of night cream didn&#x27;t have much product in it.</li>
            <li> that you&#x27;re supposed to use to apply the lotion directly on the periorbital area.  </li>
            <li> It only took a couple of days and she really noticed</li>
            <li> i use the one for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> They give out old stuff.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t use the eye cream as much as i was intending to, but i do use the day lotion regularly.</li>
            <li> and I do not think that I would buy it for myself, simply because it doesn&#x27;t give me any \\&quot;luxurious moments\\&quot; when applying the products to my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t have any significantly better effects than other skin care products I am using (at about the same price range).</li>
            <li> A second application made my face really greasy after an hour or so, though, and I noticed a significant patchiness and uneven color to my skin.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the perfume smell is very strong.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, in the past 2 months, I&#x27;ve gotten carded for liquor way more at restaurants and a have received several \\&quot;Oh</li>
            <li> Just a few minutes after applying the lotions or the creams, neither of us can feel the product on the surface of our skin, but our faces feel baby soft and remain that way, even after a full day at work.  </li>
            <li> Overall the kit has a pleasant faint fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It goes onto her skin feeling a little oily, but is completely absorbed in a matter of minutes and keeps her face feeling soft all day.</li>
            <li> I would put this on and then about half an hour later go to put makeup on and need more because of some dry patches on the skin.</li>
            <li> lotion--15 is usually not enough but is more common.</li>
            <li> ; if it is it didn&#x27;t happen with regularity, so either I was applying too much or ingredients were not mixed enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick and doesn&#x27;t give that whitish hue that I find with most sunscreens with an SPF above 15.</li>
            <li> I am going back to my usual department store brand, which of course I can&#x27;t name, but to compare price note that a tub of it the same size as the day/night Youth Code is just under $20 and performs exponentially better.</li>
            <li> The other products in this 3 pc kit is my first time trying</li>
            <li> Some have complained that they leave the skin too matte, but that&#x27;s a plus in my book as so many creams take forever to absorb and make it hard to apply make-up quickly.</li>
            <li> - I used very little of the daily and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to love it, and used it for a month and half hoping the new onset of pimples would disappear, but they just got worse.</li>
            <li> The Elizabeth Arden and Olay Pro X lines recommended by other users caused huge breakouts for me and did nothing for the dry spots - except make them slippery and red.      </li>
            <li> The pros are:  - Skin is clear, the only breakouts I have had are from eating chocolate or pizza  </li>
            <li> I noticed a reduction in dark circles but my skin is too sensitive to it and it has made that area swollen sometimes but very unnoticiable.</li>
            <li> I went back to my old regimen and pimples have subsided, but the scarring remains.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve got combination oily/normal skin and have occasional adult acne.</li>
            <li> Youth says it all, probably for younger people because for mature skin it does nothing.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only issue I&#x27;ve had so far</li>
            <li> Both add moisture which takes a few minutes to be absorbed, but then stays with me all day</li>
            <li> This kit is nice to try out if your skeptical of buying it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a heavy application to get this line to work - so I&#x27;d say if you are seeing irritation or need to use quite a bit to get the skin texture you want, this isn&#x27;t the right product for you.      </li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used the eye cream it burned slightly, but hasn&#x27;t since.</li>
            <li> The eye cream is pretty much a normal size tube but the day and night cream (especially) are small.</li>
            <li> None of the products in this kit was the issue--I was able to narrow it down to the BB cream!</li>
            <li> No one likes a half empty container for a full price.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am please with L&#x27;Oreal products in general.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that it is worth the cost, however.</li>
            <li> My skin around the eyes seemed hydrated and slightly softer, but I noticed that it didn&#x27;t really keep the hydration after washing my face or taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it in the past and it really has made a difference under my eyes as far as color and puffiness.</li>
            <li> The first 2 nights I used it, white chunks sloughed off my face, and I&#x27;ve found a few gummy bits in the tub of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Further, with absolutely every other moisturizer I have used, I use a significant amount for a few days but then can start to use less of it as my skin adapts to the moisture.</li>
            <li> The day lotion just wasn&#x27;t enough for my fairly dry skin, so I passed it along to my 47-year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> I personally would use the day Youth Code brand as a secondary moisturizer for times when I end up washing my face in the middle of the day and need something quick and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And while this product did not have a strong scent, I am sensitive to smell, and found the fragrance (be it natural or intended) to be unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Using it for three weeks, my skin seems to be properly hydrated, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic smoothing of fine lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I have had similar puffiness with other brands so this was not surprising, and the good news is that it puffed my skin up less than other brands and the puffiness goes away after about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products on my 50 year old skin and this hasn&#x27;t produced results different than the $5 jar of Ponds cream or the Oil of Olay products I typically splurge on.</li>
            <li> I would suggest putting a little extra on your high dry areas.</li>
            <li> It seems too much money for something small.</li>
            <li> I was worried these products would not last long, but this was not a problem.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve had this long enough to notice any \\&quot;regenerating\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I decided that a few wrinkles were better than a constant break out and worse complextion.</li>
            <li> Not only is it non greasy, it doesn&#x27;t dry me out or make me break out.</li>
            <li> As a result, they take up a lot of space, but contain far less product than they otherwise could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am a woman in her mid 50&#x27;s with just one dry patch by my eyes.</li>
            <li> But the dry air in Arizona makes moisturizer a necessity, and over the years I&#x27;ve tried several brands.</li>
            <li> It consists of a daytime SPF moisturizer, an eye cream, and an extra day/night cream, which can be used for excessively dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You only need to use a very small amount of products because too much causes skin to be greasy and can clog pores causing breakouts.</li>
            <li> The night cream (also touted as a day/night cream) is heavy for day but too light for a serious night moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> These occurrences had been tapering off in the past couple of years, but has kicked in to high gear again after I began using this product.</li>
            <li> It would take a long period of use to determine if it is having any effect.  </li>
            <li> I didnt read the size of the product, so I expected bigger lotions!</li>
            <li> At night, I usually use an acne product containing Benzoyl Peroxide, which dries my skin out at times, and so I need to use a heavier than average moisturizer on certain spots.</li>
            <li> At night, I usually use an acne product containing Benzoyl Peroxide, which dries my skin out at times, and so I need to use a heavier than average moisturizer on certain spots.</li>
            <li> my face would be dry again.</li>
            <li> I have quite dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t as dry.  </li>
            <li> and my skin still felt dry and</li>
            <li> My wife has dry skin, and has been concerned about wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I guess though I wouldn&#x27;t say dry skin.</li>
            <li> Eye cream realy dry.</li>
            <li> : I wanted to mention that I went back to using the day moisturizer a few weeks later to give it another chance.</li>
            <li> A true test of a product I&#x27;ve found usually takes at least a month to notice any change (or not).</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave behind an oily sheen or residue, but I found that it didn&#x27;t really penetrate very deeply into my skin.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave behind an oily sheen or residue, but I found that it didn&#x27;t really penetrate very deeply into my skin.</li>
            <li> (The main difficulty is our local grocers generally have lousy fruit.)</li>
            <li> A little of the creams or lotion go a long way, so one purchase will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> this is the most unpleasant purchasing experience</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;d say this is an average product</li>
            <li> Other lines would cost at least 3 times as much.</li>
            <li> The creams were all loose.</li>
            <li> I have a tropism towards all-natural products that I generally buy in the health food store, because I care about the ingredients I&#x27;m slathering on my face -- but they are expensive and, more annoying, they come in bottles so large that the oil generally goes rancid before I use it up.</li>
            <li> If I only use it about twice a week, I do notice some slight softening of the skin under the eyes, so it appears to moisturize as advertised.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about a month and a half, never missed a treatment, and followed the regimen daily.</li>
            <li> The only thing is the sizes of the products are small especially the night cream.  </li>
            <li> I have used other loreal prods and so i was not surprised to see that this one does the job of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other brands usually help slough off old skin cells, but I did not get that with Youth Code.</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;I am almost 50 and have all kinds of skin problems (large pores, oily skin, periodic breakouts, age spots, wrinkles, dull tone, you name it), so I have tried a lot of different kinds of skin care products from all the major brands, as long as they weren&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li> It became very dry with a few pimples - definitely not</li>
            <li> my face is sooo soft its hard to believe.</li>
            <li> I love my Lancome, but when I saw a less expensive alternative, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try!  </li>
            <li> I really know it&#x27;s working after a night of poor sleeping.</li>
            <li> you end up having to squeeze harder then....</li>
            <li> The serum is better than the expensive (&amp;#62;$100) eye creams I have used in the past!</li>
            <li> I was using it everyday along with the other two products, however I was starting to get headaches and watery eyes throughout the day.</li>
            <li> As I said, once it&#x27;s applied it stings a little, and there is a small oval under-eye area near the bridge of my nose that puffs up after it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li> And the eye cream, in particular, makes my skin feel relaxed -- as though I&#x27;d been a little tense and hadn&#x27;t realized it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> and my skin still felt dry and tight.     </li>
            <li> The other two products have helped with face wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The small size of the creams in the set, especially the night cream, was almost as dissapointing as the lack of results.  </li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t have the after make-up sheen caused by other moisturizers.    </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how well the other products work yet.</li>
            <li> and they sent me coupons to try other products of theirs, and I have.  </li>
            <li> skin has become extremely hydrated, and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I now have a permanent mark on my cheek, and haven&#x27;t touched the other pimples just in case.</li>
            <li> I like the eye cream, but other than that?  </li>
            <li> I offered some other suggestions on how it might be used but there was no prying it out of her bag.   </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not exactly rigorous about using this stuff</li>
            <li> downside is that the other two products (day lotion and day/night cream) gave her zits.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, and a lot of money that would have been better spent on other products.  </li>
            <li> Day lotion has little dry.</li>
            <li> All three products that come in this beginner kit can last a little over a month if you use everyday as i did.</li>
            <li> This may work on someone who typically has very dry skin, I have average skin, and did find it helpful.</li>
            <li> I used everything each day for the first couple of weeks, but have ended up only using these products once or twice a week for the past 2 months because the serum alone has given me the results I wanted, and using all of them together felt too heavy and uncomfortable for me.</li>
            <li> I actually can almost achieve &#x27;glowing&#x27; skin if I try really hard.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I think I would purchase the day cream again, as it is hard to find an SPF lotion that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on my skin.</li>
            <li> In addition, it has done wonders for my dark circles and the wrinkles under my eyes that were caused in my youth from severe eye allergies.</li>
            <li> I only tried this product for a few days, and was not pleased with it, therefore I have not continued to use it.</li>
            <li> - Still have dark eyes and blotches  </li>
            <li> average performance for sunscreen moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the fragrance.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it didn&#x27;t come in the box you see attached.  </li>
            <li> However, living in a desert climate (Colorado) forced me to start using a daily moisturizing regimine at ~33 years of age.  </li>
            <li> To break down each item:    </li>
            <li> Before using this line, I needed some sort of coverage to even out my skin tone or tone down slight redness on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sizes are very small for the price and that is why I gave this product only 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I was worried about skin sensitivites because the night cream does have a slight perfume.</li>
            <li> Besides of that, the amount is not as less as some people mentioned.</li>
            <li> and I still have about half of everything.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, I thought the skin under my eyes was looking less hydrated</li>
            <li> A few of the claims include:  to diminish signs of stress and fatigue, reduces the appearance of lines/wrinkles, evens skin&#x27;s surface, boosts luminosity and decreases under-eye bags and dark circles.  </li>
            <li> from the other reviews i read this product is not great for deep wrinkles and skin that has not been taken care of before.</li>
            <li> Could be that if your skin is a little dryer - you would need another product.    </li>
            <li> * is due to the small units.</li>
            <li> It did make my face shiny, but that can be knocked out with a little powder or oil blotting sheets.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There were times when I would feel a tingling sensation around my eyes from the cream and other times I would not, so I&#x27;m not sure if that was supposed to happen</li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed because the size of the products is extremely small especially the day/night creme.</li>
            <li> The moisture is just not there and the serum burns a little.</li>
            <li> There is a slight scent to the products, but it is very slight and inoffensive.  </li>
            <li> I also tried the Night Cream a few nights, however I would wake up with my face being a little oily.  </li>
            <li> The applicator for the eye cream is a little gimmicky</li>
            <li> I found this set to be a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Then, I tried Aveeno and found it dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> Benn using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> It was one of the few that I have ever seen a noticeable difference with (and immediately).</li>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;oreal skin products for a few years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The day/night cream is just plain luxurious.</li>
            <li> My husband has allergies, so the smell is not strong and offensive and has not caused any problems with him.</li>
            <li> eye moisturizer didn&#x27;t do a thing except sting a little and make one small section of my under-eye area puffy.</li>
            <li> The overall moisture level is not great, at least not for the hype and the price.</li>
            <li> it was 2 thick &amp; heavy for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have seen no difference and when I asked her about it she also felt that there was no visible difference and that it was a bit tedious to use all 3 products daily.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found after using these products for a while that if I&#x27;m feeling particularly lazy or in a hurry, I don&#x27;t need to bother with foundation.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that I saw immediate results that are model or noteworthy, but I did stick with it.  </li>
            <li> but the containers are small.</li>
            <li> The containers are really small</li>
            <li> came opened, old, and dirty.</li>
            <li> The small trial size and price allows you to judge for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> Also when I finally received it, the plastic over the product was very dusty.  </li>
            <li> the packet arrived a little damaged, and the appareance was not good.</li>
            <li> I like how it feel and how it makes my face brighter and not so dull looking.</li>
            <li> I just use my fingers because using that applicator it is hard to control the amount of product being dispensed.  </li>
            <li> She always complained that a day of flying was hard on her skin.   </li>
            <li> I am 30 now, but a dermatologist recommended women in their late 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Was dismayed when I found a lot of negative reaction to this on the web.</li>
            <li> Over the last year or so I started to notice that the Garnier just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore-</li>
            <li> Was dismayed when I found a lot of negative reaction to this on the web.</li>
            <li> I got this package late but at least I got it before Christmas .</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;parenthesis\\&quot; lines around my mouth are slowly diminishing-</li>
            <li> The night cream is SO small!</li>
            <li> the package is a little dirty that i could recognise this thing would be placed a little longer.i search online for this</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it was exfoliation, but instead from the lip of the container where the moisturizer was exposed to air and dried a little in the cold during mailing; if you buy this in a store, you probably have nothing to worry about.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too bad the night cream&#x27;s quantity is so low.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good idea to buy this as a gift.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I needed the larger container of the day/night cream.  </li>
            <li> This made no difference in the feel of my skin, the eye tool was very hard to keep the product on.  </li>
            <li> - Wrinkles have decreased and skin is firmer  </li>
            <li> and so I am afraid to use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift,but the outer package is broken when I got it</li>
            <li> I use it for preventative measures as well as to prevent damage from the extreme dryness of the climate I&#x27;m in (winter and summer are bad!).</li>
            <li> Definitely not impressed with the day moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The applicator was useless, but I don&#x27;t mind using my fingers to apply it.</li>
            <li> The scent, though, is really unfortunate.</li>
            <li> Having reached my mid-40s, I&#x27;ve become somewhat obsessed with undoing the damage to my skin caused by a couple of decades suntanning, sleeping in makeup, and skipping the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Every woman knows those things can happen with hormone fluctuations, stress, eating the wrong stuff</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it also caused quite a bit of breakouts, specifically on my cheeks, and blackheads all over my nose and chin.</li>
            <li> I have this weird reaction with a rash all over where I put this, and all within three days.</li>
            <li> therefore i was unable to give as a gift.  </li>
            <li> Today is the third day that my face looks horrible after using Youth code in the morning (serum and BB)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately within 48 hours of use, my skin began to develop a really bad problem.  </li>
            <li> The box it came in was scratched up and it looked dirty .</li>
            <li> The smell is very faint and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She broke out badly, and then had to deal with getting rid of zits, which she hasn&#x27;t had to do in 15 years.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why Loreal reacts so badly to my skin, but</li>
            <li> but if this does work for your skin type, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The face hurts so bad, and it just looks awful.</li>
            <li> [...]    [...]    [...]    The skincare cream from L&#x27;Oreal was very painful &amp; burned my eyes and nose as you can see in the pictures.</li>
            <li> I cannot abide by having this stuff on my face because of its nasty aroma.</li>
            <li> I have bumps all over my face and neck, just imagine a horrible sun burn combined with an acne attack.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this product is good, the day cream is well absorbed but not as successful as expected, the taste of the night I left me a little more skin softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> good price to buy such a set.I love eye crean because it has a massage tool</li>
            <li> My wife used the items contained within this product quite diligently.  Here is a summary of her take on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Starter Kit contains only the SPF 30 Day Lotion, a 0.5 oz jar of the day/night cream, and the 0.33 oz tub of eye cream (no Serum Intense, although it&#x27;s touted on the inner paperwork) .  I finished using all 3 products, and I won&#x27;t be buying them.  A few of the claims include:  to diminish signs of stress and fatigue, reduces the appearance of lines/wrinkles, evens skin&#x27;s surface, boosts luminosity and decreases under-eye bags and dark circles.  I didn&#x27;t experience any of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Day Lotion is a pleasant enough general moisturizer with a decent amount of SPF.  The night cream (also touted as a day/night cream) is heavy for day but too light for a serious night moisturizer.  My suggestion for the eye cream&#x27;s metal applicator:  be sure to squeeze some cream before dabbing under the eyes, otherwise the applicator pulls on delicate skin in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good basic products, but I won&#x27;t be paying for any more.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews about the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Regenerating Skincare Kit &amp; decided to give it a try.  I used the Day Lotion in the morning under my make-up.  It wasn&#x27;t very greasy &amp; went on very smooth.  I also used the Eye Cream in my morning routine.  I really liked it.  It was refreshing under my eyes after showering.  I also tried the Night Cream a few nights, however I would wake up with my face being a little oily.  After it broke me out I stopped using it.  All in all not a bad product.  I will pick up another kit when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> I tried a different moisturizer from this company &amp; it broke me out bcuz it was 2 thick &amp; heavy for my skin. The youth code is perfect for me. I normally can&#x27;t wear moisturizer or any make up on my face. This is so light &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave my skin all greasy &amp; oily feeling. The \\&quot;parenthesis\\&quot; lines around my mouth are slowly diminishing- &amp; I&#x27;ve only used the products for a month! I love this skin care line!!</li>
            <li> I was worried these products would not last long, but this was not a problem. I have been using the eye cream for over five months (once or twice a day). It seems to have helped with crow&#x27;s feet and shadows. I really know it&#x27;s working after a night of poor sleeping. I apply the eye cream in the morning and it looks like I got my precious nine hours.    The other two products have helped with face wrinkles. I apply the day/night cream to trouble areas rather than my whole face. This may explain ehy it lasted 3.5 months. Sometimes it gives me a zit, so I don&#x27;t use it where I don&#x27;t need it.    I use the day lotion whenever I am out in the sun (20spf). Mine used up quickly, but that is because I forgot sunscreen at the beach one day and used this product on my body.</li>
            <li> I have been using anti-aging creams since I was 26 with mixed results. I am 30 now, but a dermatologist recommended women in their late 20&#x27;s should start using some anti aging products under their eyes, laugh line area, etc. as a preventative measure. I&#x27;ve tried Olay, Garnier, ROC and found some made me break out even more, made my already oily skin more so, or dried it out completely. I have adult onset acne and am on a separate, yet effective, regimen for that through Clinique, so I needed something to try that wouldn&#x27;t counteract or react with it. After some success with Revitalift, I decided to give Youth Code a shot when the drugstore was out of Revitalift. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Not only is it non greasy, it doesn&#x27;t dry me out or make me break out. In addition, it has done wonders for my dark circles and the wrinkles under my eyes that were caused in my youth from severe eye allergies. If I only knew at 10 to not rub them so much! Anyway, in the past 2 months, I&#x27;ve gotten carded for liquor way more at restaurants and a have received several \\&quot;Oh my! I thought you were at least in your early 20s!\\&quot; comments when proudly producing my ID. These occurrences had been tapering off in the past couple of years, but has kicked in to high gear again after I began using this product. Music to my ears!!! My boyfriend has even commented on how radiant and youthful my skin is looking these days. Basically, I simply want to age gracefully and look the best I can (or a tad bit better) for my age and I feel I am well armed with this product. I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This seems to work really well.  I like the feel of it and the eye cream is a great idea!  It feels like your using an ice cube to smooth on the lotion.  Feels great!  My only complaint is that the perfume smell is very strong.  If you can deal with the smell the product does seem to work.</li>
            <li> I found this set to be a waste of money.  The small size of the creams in the set, especially the night cream, was almost as dissapointing as the lack of results.  I perfered the revitalift products by Loreal.</li>
            <li> works well i have no regret</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually very pleased with this product. Of course, at my age, it&#x27;s not going to do miracles but it definitely does lend the skin a quality of luminescence for a more youthful appearance. I was worried about skin sensitivites because the night cream does have a slight perfume. Many products don&#x27;t work with my dry, senstive skin but I&#x27;ve had no problems with either the night cream or the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after trying it now for over two weeks, I am very happy with the product and would not hesitate to add it to my skin care regime.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a way to neutrally review a product like this.  It would take a long period of use to determine if it is having any effect.  I will say it feels good on the skin, not oily and does not immediately disappear like some skin creams. Cosmetics make a lot of claims that can&#x27;t be substantiated.  My take is that if it feels good on your skin it&#x27;s probably the right product for you. It seems to me that these are very tiny bottles for the price and it is not the greatest value.  But that&#x27;s a personal decision ... if you have the money and it makes your skin feel good, go for it.</li>
            <li> Loved this product, lasted almost a month of daily use. Good moisturizer, not heavy, kept skin smooth and not greasy. Moisturizer all day. Used the eye cream, kept eye area puffiness down and smooth.    As good as some of the more pricey boutique products out there.</li>
            <li> The day and night moisturizers in this set are very creamy, but absorb quickly without leaving a greasy feeling to your skin which I really like.  They also have a pleasant frangrance.  However based on the title of Youth Code I was hoping they would help with fine lines and so far I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in that aspect but I have only been using it for about a month so I will keep my fingers crossed that I see some results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would pay $30 for this product or even $20. It seems too much money for something small. While I enjoy the softness and it&#x27;s fountain of youth theme, I don&#x27;t think that I would have put it on my shopping list. But the soft cream to help your eyes and neck and face seem okay.     Still, I don&#x27;t see much of a change yet. My sister likes it and she&#x27;s particularly fussy about health care products. You have nothing to lose if you buy and use it for your face or to give as a gift to a friend. You may not have found the fountain of youth but L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code is trying to be. Now, we don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really the fountain of youth but it&#x27;s worth trying until the next one comes along.</li>
            <li> Having no desire or need to \\&quot;regenerate\\&quot; my manly skin, or anything else, I gave this to the missus to try out. She took her time and used all the products, and here&#x27;s what she had to say about them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I am almost 50 and have all kinds of skin problems (large pores, oily skin, periodic breakouts, age spots, wrinkles, dull tone, you name it), so I have tried a lot of different kinds of skin care products from all the major brands, as long as they weren&#x27;t too expensive. Prior to my husband giving me this kit, I had not tried any of the products here. While testing them, although I did not use the products exclusively, I completely used up everything in the package over a time period of about a month. The result was it did not irritate my skin like some products have, but I did not see any noticeable improvement in my skin at all. It moisturized fine and went on smooth, but it just wasn&#x27;t anything special. Overall I&#x27;d say this is an average product and I do not think that I would buy it for myself, simply because it doesn&#x27;t give me any \\&quot;luxurious moments\\&quot; when applying the products to my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t have any significantly better effects than other skin care products I am using (at about the same price range). Three stars.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about 2 weeks and love the product.     Was dismayed when I found a lot of negative reaction to this on the web. Then I realized that most of the \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t work\\&quot; comments I read are in the 20-39 year old range. Could be this isn&#x27;t a one size fits all kind of thing. I&#x27;m 46 and have had acne my whole life. The Elizabeth Arden and Olay Pro X lines recommended by other users caused huge breakouts for me and did nothing for the dry spots - except make them slippery and red.      Re: complaints on \\&quot;matte finish\\&quot; to skin - as someone who has had really oily skin for 30+ years, I loved the smooth finish.  It didn&#x27;t require anything special to get my foundation to look great and my eye makeup actually stayed better.  And I didn&#x27;t have the after make-up sheen caused by other moisturizers.    Re: need to use a lot of the daily moiturizer - I used very little of the daily and it worked fine.  No grease like feel and it absorbed quickly.  Could be that if your skin is a little dryer - you would need another product.    Re: eye cream made me breakout - many of the reviews I read about this said they used their fingers to apply instead of the attached applicator.  The applicator helps control the amount you use plus it keeps finger oils from blending with the product.  Many high-end eye creams come with applicators.  If you don&#x27;t use it - you could overapply the product causing irritation or transfer something from your fingers to the cream.  I know - I&#x27;ve done this myself.  So I recommend using the applicator.  I used it at night and in the morning and didn&#x27;t have any irritation or puffiness.    It doesn&#x27;t take a heavy application to get this line to work - so I&#x27;d say if you are seeing irritation or need to use quite a bit to get the skin texture you want, this isn&#x27;t the right product for you.      I would recommend it to someone my age or older and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It came in a strong package, and inside it was surrounded with aired plastic bags. The product was intact, and the presentation was excelent!</li>
            <li> I only tried this product for a few days, and was not pleased with it, therefore I have not continued to use it. I did not like how the cream felt on my face. It felt greasy, and didn&#x27;t feel like it soaked into my skin, rather just left a film on top of my skin.  And while this product did not have a strong scent, I am sensitive to smell, and found the fragrance (be it natural or intended) to be unpleasant. The eye cream felt ok going on, but I have not used it long enough to determine if it will make a difference with my under eye circles.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my wife who has been using it for about 3 weeks and applying it daily. I have seen no difference and when I asked her about it she also felt that there was no visible difference and that it was a bit tedious to use all 3 products daily.  She has used O&#x27;lay in the past and there was a much more visible effect.  The one nice thing was the L&#x27;Oreal product smells nice.  Also if you are looking to work on the lines under your eyes Anthony&#x27;s has a product that also has shown results on my wife as well as myself.  If you are looking for a magical turn around I don&#x27;t think you are going to get this with L&#x27;Oreal or if you do it will take more than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I wish I could say I see some difference but I really don&#x27;t.  I regularly use a similar product.  These do feel good on my face. My favorite was the day cream with sufficient SPF protection.  It is nice and light with plenty of coverage in a minimal amount - just a few drops a day. The night cream is a lot heavier... heavier than I am used to wearing at night.  I like the eye cream and the metal tip of the dispenser feels cool to the skin around the eye, which can be soothing especially in summer.  I find however, that I still need to use my finger to evenly distribute it.  I use an eye cream every night anyway, not this brand, but I don&#x27;t see any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Economically it can be a good deal to get the 3 combined products in one package, for the one price, as opposed to buying them separately if you really like this brand. For those that are buying High-End Department Store products it would be a savings for sure, but not necessarily for the drug-store-brand buyers. I will continue to use it until it is gone and then re-evaluate my review - stay tuned!</li>
            <li> I bought this starter kit along with the serum hoping to get the best results as fast as possible. I used everything each day for the first couple of weeks, but have ended up only using these products once or twice a week for the past 2 months because the serum alone has given me the results I wanted, and using all of them together felt too heavy and uncomfortable for me. I&#x27;m still in my early 20s and I do intend to get into the habit of using these for wrinkle/age prevention, but I LOVE how the serum has transformed my skin and feels so lightweight.  I haven&#x27;t used this long or often enough to give a very fair review about its claims and results.. but I&#x27;ll update this again (if I remember).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been wanting to try youth code as an alternative to much more expensive bioelements skincare I&#x27;d been using. This was a good way to try and while I like the products OK, it&#x27;s true that you get what you pay for and after I finished these I went back to bioelements anyway. There is a difference in my skin with the more expensive products - they seem to go farther, too. But, for a drugstore brand this is good stuff and I especially liked the eye creme.</li>
            <li> I like this product as it gives you a day mosturizer with an spf of 30, which is a nice lotion and not heavy.  Also the eye cream is nice.  I wish the nite cream would of been larger but other then that it is great</li>
            <li> Summary: An excellent way to try out L&#x27;Oreal skincare products - but the quantities are more along the lines of a sampler...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This provides three products - a  day moisturizer, a night moisturizer, and a day/night cream intended just for around your eyes (Crows feet)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day moisturizer with SPF is very light - much like [[ASIN:B002JAYMEE Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock, SPF 100, 3 Ounce]] but apparently with more moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Eye Cream dispenser is intended to let you use it without touching it with your fingers (and getting your finger oils mixed in) but in practice the hole in the dispenser always get clogged and you end up having to squeeze harder then....POP, too much moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There appears to be a lot more science and technology claimed than is readily apparent.  It&#x27;s hard to say that the results are any better than [[ASIN:B001ET76EE Cetaphil Fragrance Free Moisturizing Cream, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One complaint is that the two moisturizers come in these very nice looking containers which are really geared more towards appearance than functionality.  As a result, they take up a lot of space, but contain far less product than they otherwise could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d go with 3-1/2 stars if that was an option.  In the final analysis it was nice to try it out but I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> It is one of the best product I have ever used. I like all of them here. Especially the daily cream with SPF. The smell is light and comfortable, the texture is smooth but not oily at all.   Besides of that, the amount is not as less as some people mentioned. The daily lotion is 30 ml, the eye cream is 10 g, and the night cream is about 14 g as mentioned in the box. I bought them for about a month now and I still have about half of everything.</li>
            <li> This set comes with 3 separate moisturizers: A day moisturizer, an eye cream, and an overnight moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day moisturizer was lightweight and, frankly, a little light in the contents department. The other 2 bottles in this set have the ounces labeled, but this one does not, and I found it ran out very quickly. The inner container is white to make it look like it&#x27;s full, but I suspect it may not be. Further, with absolutely every other moisturizer I have used, I use a significant amount for a few days but then can start to use less of it as my skin adapts to the moisture. Not with Youth Code! I have to use a ton of it, especially of the day moisturizer. The overall moisture level is not great, at least not for the hype and the price. With this particular bottle, I got the same moisturizing effects as the lower price popular drug store brands, but without any exfoliation to speak of. Other brands usually help slough off old skin cells, but I did not get that with Youth Code. I personally would use the day Youth Code brand as a secondary moisturizer for times when I end up washing my face in the middle of the day and need something quick and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I wanted to mention that I went back to using the day moisturizer a few weeks later to give it another chance. I noticed that after about 5 minutes of applying it, I had to apply more because it just didn&#x27;t slough off any dry skin or moisturize properly. A second application made my face really greasy after an hour or so, though, and I noticed a significant patchiness and uneven color to my skin. Definitely not impressed with the day moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye moisturizer didn&#x27;t do a thing except sting a little and make one small section of my under-eye area puffy. The applicator was useless, but I don&#x27;t mind using my fingers to apply it. As I said, once it&#x27;s applied it stings a little, and there is a small oval under-eye area near the bridge of my nose that puffs up after it&#x27;s applied. I have had similar puffiness with other brands so this was not surprising, and the good news is that it puffed my skin up less than other brands and the puffiness goes away after about 10 minutes. If I only use it about twice a week, I do notice some slight softening of the skin under the eyes, so it appears to moisturize as advertised. Again, though, neither wrinkles nor eye circles were affected by this product. I will still use it twice a week for softness, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nighttime cream (called the day/night cream because it can be used for both) is best used as an overnight cream put on just before bed, but I&#x27;ve used it both ways. The first 2 nights I used it, white chunks sloughed off my face, and I&#x27;ve found a few gummy bits in the tub of moisturizer. I don&#x27;t believe it was exfoliation, but instead from the lip of the container where the moisturizer was exposed to air and dried a little in the cold during mailing; if you buy this in a store, you probably have nothing to worry about. I started using this one twice a day after the day moisturizer just didn&#x27;t do anything for me. This day/night moisturizer is thicker but, again, I had to use quite a bit of it. While it seemed to work at first, within an hour my face would be dry again. I would put this on and then about half an hour later go to put makeup on and need more because of some dry patches on the skin. The scent of all these products is pleasant and relatively mild, although the tub of day/night moisturizer smells a little like glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: When my second try at the day moisturizer didn&#x27;t pan out, I started using the day/night cream once a day in the morning. It actually worked really well, with significant moisturizing that lasted several hours. I only used it once a day which still gave significant benefit. The scent, though, is really unfortunate. It is just like glue, and I don&#x27;t think I could use this all the time because of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so sure that I just hadn&#x27;t given this enough time, which is why I went back and tried the day/night and day moisturizers again, but after all that, I pretty much give up. I am going back to my usual department store brand, which of course I can&#x27;t name, but to compare price note that a tub of it the same size as the day/night Youth Code is just under $20 and performs exponentially better. There was no difference in wrinkles, age spots, or anything else that would make my skin look &amp;#34;younger.&amp;#34; For the price, you&#x27;re not getting anything with Youth Code that you can&#x27;t get with a lower cost general moisturizer at your favorite drug store.</li>
            <li> let me start by saying that I have used products from Beauty Control, Avon, Mary Kay, and Dove. I can honestly say this is my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;I have found Youth Code to be a joy to use. It&#x27;s nice and light, which I like very much. Even the nighttime cream seems to be light, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your skin. The smell is very faint and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I am a woman in her mid 50&#x27;s with just one dry patch by my eyes. I have been using the products for 2 weeks and am amazed that there really is a difference. My skin really does look younger!&lt;br /&gt;I gave Youth Code 4 stars instead of 5 because it is a bit pricey for the size of the products. That can be a deal breaker on my budget.</li>
            <li> Hands down, this product has a beautiful scent, my favorite in fact.      I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products on my 50 year old skin and this hasn&#x27;t produced results different than the $5 jar of Ponds cream or the Oil of Olay products I typically splurge on. This product does feel wonderful on my skin.  I like that it is absorbed quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I am not sure that it is worth the cost, however. The idea is that your skin will appear more youthful and I&#x27;ve not noticed anyone wondering who the new girl is.      I will say, however, that good skin is more than topical products. My skin responds more to my hydration levels and food choices.  If I drink enough water and eat more fruits and veggies, I have better skin. I actually can almost achieve &#x27;glowing&#x27; skin if I try really hard.  (The main difficulty is our local grocers generally have lousy fruit.)</li>
            <li> Creams are smooth and not especially greasy.  If you are not a regular user of moisturizers, then this is a good, economic starter product set.  I did not see a significant reduction in wrinkles or lines on my skin, as I do with a top of the line Elizabeth Arden product.  However, living in a desert climate (Colorado) forced me to start using a daily moisturizing regimine at ~33 years of age.  I have pretty good skin, but 10+ years later the wrinkles came.  I have been searching for a great and effective product, but L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Youth Code was not it.  It is a good moisturizer, but did not &#x27;plump&#x27; the collagen in my agin skin as well as other products do.</li>
            <li> I love the under eye cream with the slide tube. I&#x27;ve been using it in the past and it really has made a difference under my eyes as far as color and puffiness. I really can see a difference after a couple of weeks. The other products in this 3 pc kit is my first time trying and I have just started using it so I don&#x27;t know how well the other products work yet.But for the elderly people - 50+ - you will be extremely happy with this under eye product. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately within 48 hours of use, my skin began to develop a really bad problem.  It became very dry with a few pimples - definitely not what I was going for in a skin treatment.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me, so I can&#x27;t speak for everyone. But I&#x27;m definitely avoiding products from Oil of Olay.</li>
            <li> I bought the kit. Great product. Ran out of the serum first.&lt;br /&gt;Now using spot corrector serum with the rest of the kit.&lt;br /&gt;Love the metal for eyes, for soothing  the crows feet.&lt;br /&gt;4 stars cause of high price</li>
            <li> Just got this in and its a great product, never tried these kinds of cremes before, but I can really tell a difference right away</li>
            <li> the package is a little dirty that i could recognise this thing would be placed a little longer.i search online for this expiration.the deadline is 2013.</li>
            <li> Why do cosmetics companies think consumers want to smell like a petroleum factory? I cannot abide by having this stuff on my face because of its nasty aroma. Loreal - get with the program, we don&#x27;t want to stink just to have decent lotion.</li>
            <li> For starters, I&#x27;m 27 with combination skin. I have been using Garner products for years since it was the only thing that didn&#x27;t make me break out (with the exception of Clinique Moisture Surge but I couldn&#x27;t justify the price every month!). I use it for preventative measures as well as to prevent damage from the extreme dryness of the climate I&#x27;m in (winter and summer are bad!). However, I struggled with finding a sunscreen moisturizer that didn&#x27;t make breakout- even Garnier&#x27;s caused issues. Over the last year or so I started to notice that the Garnier just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore- my skin just didn&#x27;t seem moisturized (plus the whole sunscreen thing was a big deal for me). I went on the hunt...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this trial/trio pack at Target and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. I was blown away on the first day. I was really reluctant to try the sunscreen for fear of breakout out the second I put it on- but that hasn&#x27;t happened and I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now. A true test of a product I&#x27;ve found usually takes at least a month to notice any change (or not). However, I could tell within a week that my skin looked so much better. I use the day/night cream at night and my skin looks refreshed in the morning despite perpetual lack of sleep...a very good thing. lol I don&#x27;t really care for the eye cream but I do find it helps puffiness with the applicator. Overall, all three products are excellent and I&#x27;ve been using all of them everyday with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen moisturizer only takes a little bit to be effective. It&#x27;s not greasy but you can tell it&#x27;s moisturizing. It dries quickly and has made make up application much more even than I&#x27;ve had in the past with other products. I&#x27;m in the desert where the sun is intense so sunscreen is an absolute must- even if outside for 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day/night cream is just plain luxurious. It&#x27;s slightly thicker than the day lotion but goes on easily. It dries quickly but it&#x27;s easy to use too muchdue to the design of the package (which is primarily my own problem lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My makeup is very sheer (I use a mineral foundation) but I&#x27;ve found after using these products for a while that if I&#x27;m feeling particularly lazy or in a hurry, I don&#x27;t need to bother with foundation. I just put on some moisturizer and go. Before using this line, I needed some sort of coverage to even out my skin tone or tone down slight redness on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No product is a one-size-fits-all but if this does work for your skin type, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. This trio pack is the perfect way to test it out for long enough to see if it will work for you- great value without committing to a huge bottle of something.</li>
            <li> It is just as described and came very quickly. All products are high quality and the mini sizing allows for easy travel with them all.</li>
            <li> I think this L&#x27;Oreal is okay, if you like have this kind of product, I recommend you to buy Burt&#x27;s Bee. I am not sure why I did not feel good using this product. maybe the reason is my skin kind is not suitable for this lotion.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful! I was pleasantly surprise. I will continue to buy this product</li>
            <li> This product is good, but the specific night cream container I got was only half full, although sealed.&lt;br /&gt; I would probably get this product again, as I like it, and as this size is good for travel, but I hope the manufacturer will inspect the automated system better. No one likes a half empty container for a full price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Regenerating Skincare Kit for about a month.  I love the eye cream and the day/night cream.  Both apply smoothly and easily.  Both add moisture which takes a few minutes to be absorbed, but then stays with me all day I think the eye cream is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and at age 68 I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.  The day lotion just wasn&#x27;t enough for my fairly dry skin, so I passed it along to my 47-year old daughter.  She gives it 5 stars.  It goes onto her skin feeling a little oily, but is completely absorbed in a matter of minutes and keeps her face feeling soft all day. She is a winemaker who is often out in the vineyards, so the SPF 30 in the day lotion is a very good thing.  Just a few minutes after applying the lotions or the creams, neither of us can feel the product on the surface of our skin, but our faces feel baby soft and remain that way, even after a full day at work.  There is a slight scent to the products, but it is very slight and inoffensive.  A little of the creams or lotion go a long way, so one purchase will last a long time.  I cannot swear that either of us looks \\&quot;youthfully luminous\\&quot; but, without doubt, our skin looks and feels softer and smoother.  I think the products contained in this kit, separately or together, would be appreciated by women of any age.</li>
            <li> Granted, I only bought this product earlier in the week, but I am so impressed I couldn&#x27;t wait to write a review.  On day 2 of the regimen my skin was smoother already.  The under eye treatment is actually very soothing to put on and it gives my skin a healthy glow.  I would definitely recommend this product.  I was shopping and had Neutrogenia in one hand and Loreal in the other and I am glad Loreal won.</li>
            <li> I have never had or tried a skin care kit before, so this was very new to me.  I have quite dry skin.  I am not sure that I saw immediate results that are model or noteworthy, but I did stick with it.  I do think though I have seen a nice change in my skin tone after about a month.  My skin wasn&#x27;t as dry.  It was smoother and felt very nice to the touch.  I am now 40 and should probably do some sort of skin regimen.  I will be buying this again.  It has gotten me interested in taking better care of my skin now that I am getting older.</li>
            <li> Having reached my mid-40s, I&#x27;ve become somewhat obsessed with undoing the damage to my skin caused by a couple of decades suntanning, sleeping in makeup, and skipping the moisturizer. As part of my efforts, I&#x27;d had a glycolic peel which had produced amazing results. I&#x27;ve also become religious about daily cleansing, toning, moisturizing, and every week I get a facial. The result was that my skin had been looking better lately than it had in YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried this stuff. I did not change anything else in my skincare routine; I simply used this daily moisturizer, night cream and eye cream in place of the Olay Pro products I&#x27;d run out of. Three days into it, I started to break out. Every woman knows those things can happen with hormone fluctuations, stress, eating the wrong stuff or, heck, just because the planets got out of alignment. (Kidding.) So I kept using Youth Code... and I kept breaking out, particularly on my nose. Meanwhile, I thought the skin under my eyes was looking less hydrated but I also wondered if my frustration over my breakouts might have made me more critical of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went for my weekly facial, my aesthetician just about blew her top. Not only were my pores clogged again (hence the nose zits) but she confirmed that the area under my eyes looked more crepey. So I&#x27;m not using this product anymore, and now I&#x27;m looking at a couple of weeks working on unplugging my pores and calming my skin again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was pretty pumped about this when I first got it, but it was not at all worth it to me.  This made no difference in the feel of my skin, the eye tool was very hard to keep the product on.  The point of the eye tool is it is metal, which keeps it cool, to help reduce puffyness.  I do want to say however, that I called Loreal and let them know I didn&#x27;t like this and they sent me coupons to try other products of theirs, and I have.  So, they back their products.  Not for me, but I&#x27;m not everyone.  34 and showing beginning signs of aging!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great set for the price especially as a Xmas gift&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a good product but have to be consistent with the usage</li>
            <li> Wife really likes it and it works well</li>
            <li> Both the day cream and the night cream are quite nice, with a perfect texture--not too thin, not too greasy. Some have complained that they leave the skin too matte, but that&#x27;s a plus in my book as so many creams take forever to absorb and make it hard to apply make-up quickly. I can&#x27;t say the results were spectacular (in terms of the product&#x27;s claims), but on average, it&#x27;s a good product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SPF 30 is great in the day lotion--15 is usually not enough but is more common. I can&#x27;t say much about the eye cream, though. The metal applicator is a nice touch, in that it&#x27;s naturally cooling for your eye skin, but I found that it was hard to apply smoothly and ended up just using my finger as usual. If you just want to try out one of these products, I&#x27;d recommend the night cream. It stood out as being the most effective of the three products. However, the kit is a good way to try out the product line (you pretty much get one product for free), especially if your skin doesn&#x27;t do well with mix-and-matching.</li>
            <li> I am turning 30, and wanted to start a skincare kit that would prevent wrinkles. I also purchased the youth code face wash. I used this product for about a month and a half, never missed a treatment, and followed the regimen daily. Also bought the serum. I loved the smell of the product, it was all very refreshing, and the product lasted just a bit longer than it claimed. Eye cream is great, serum not so much. Daily moisturizer with SPF I did not like at all, it made my skin feel greasy... The night cream is awesome, it&#x27;s so smooth and creamy and light. I would definitely buy the night product again. The face wash claims to remove all make-up, including eye make-up, and it did not. That&#x27;s the products...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has become extremely hydrated, and moisturized. I can see how this would prevent wrinkles. Unfortunately, it also caused quite a bit of breakouts, specifically on my cheeks, and blackheads all over my nose and chin. This was new to me, as I don&#x27;t really get pimples, so multiple pimples was totally unexpected. With all the moisture it only makes sense to me that there is an overabundance of product that accumulates. After I  squeezed a pimple on my cheek, I had scarring...which has NEVER happened before. I now have a permanent mark on my cheek, and haven&#x27;t touched the other pimples just in case. My skin was always oily and it always looked like I just came in from the summer heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I wouldn&#x27;t not recommend this product. I really wanted to love it, and used it for a month and half hoping the new onset of pimples would disappear, but they just got worse. I went back to my old regimen and pimples have subsided, but the scarring remains. This may work on someone who typically has very dry skin, I have average skin, and did find it helpful.</li>
            <li> I got these at a low price. Nice little gift set but the containers are small. I consider it more like trial size. The eye cream is pretty much a normal size tube but the day and night cream (especially) are small.</li>
            <li> I have used other loreal prods and so i was not surprised to see that this one does the job of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Providing non greasy moisture to the skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Goes on easily without any residue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Is not perfumey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Improves my normally oily t-zone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Is effective the entire work day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Eye applicator is efficient ( but i find that the product stings  on contact...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Improved skin tone.....really evident as i was having issues with my acne treatment drying out my skin, and prematurely aging me!!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my rating of 4** is due to the small units. The night cream is a abt a tablespoon full...maybe a bit more, not not by much. But a little does go a long way. And given that i am getting results, favorable one at that, i would recommend the kit.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed my lotions from L&#x27;Oreal skin care of Paris. My skin feels so much softer. I shared it with my sister ,63 years old. Now she is won over! Thank you</li>
            <li> I think this stuff is fabulous and it was a great deal.</li>
            <li> The product is awesome, makes my skin so clear. The jars are just larger than sample size but a good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> So i got this for my mom and decided to have her let me know her thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;she said that after 2 weeks, she did feel that her skin was softer, and noticed a little more firm.&lt;br /&gt;its almost like just a really nice lotion than much else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;worth the price? not at all.. in both her and my opinion.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, it can get expensive to keep up with nice skin care products!  I love my Lancome, but when I saw a less expensive alternative, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try!  Well, I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, but I also wasn&#x27;t expecting \\&quot;nothing\\&quot; either.  I like the eye cream, but other than that?  I will stick to my Lancome where I can see a difference.  I felt like I used the product and was expecting to see a difference and did not.</li>
            <li> Due to the ever increasing price of everything, I, like many, have had to depart from department store products only to find drug store products are equally as good.  I began with Oil of Olay and felt my skin was greasy and tended to break out. Then, I tried Aveeno and found it dried out my skin. Neutrogena was good but I felt I need something more relevant for my aging skin.  So I tried L&#x27;Oreal and have become very happy with their products.  The pros are:  - Skin is clear, the only breakouts I have had are from eating chocolate or pizza  - Skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy  - Skin feels very clean  - Wrinkles have decreased and skin is firmer  The cons:  - Still have dark eyes and blotches  - Still have large pores  - While my skin appears more even toned, it looks a shade darker.  Overall, I am please with L&#x27;Oreal products in general. I switched from Moroccan  Oil to Ever Sleek and have not noticed a difference in my hair. It is equally as moisturized and healthy. I switched from Clinque to Youth Code and while I feel the product is better for my skin, it is not the best product for my skin.  I read a lot of reviews on line and apparently the L&#x27;Oreal Genesis products have received great reviews and most users prefer the Genesis line over Youth Code.  So I ordered the Genesis line and we will see.</li>
            <li> I gave this to a female friend while we were on a flying trip. She always complained that a day of flying was hard on her skin.   She loved it and after a few days i think there was a real change in her sking. I offered some other suggestions on how it might be used but there was no prying it out of her bag.   Overall I thought it was a great product .  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  The containers are really small and so I am afraid to use it everyday.  I do not know if I will buy again.</li>
            <li> the packet arrived a little damaged, and the appareance was not good. I think is a smaller pack than I thougt.</li>
            <li> I love it, it is great...I believe my skin is getting better and better. I didnt read the size of the product, so I expected bigger lotions!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve had this long enough to notice any \\&quot;regenerating\\&quot; but I do quite like all of the products. The eye cream really helps, the day/night cream is great for keeping me moisturized despite the dry heat in my apartment, and the day lotion is nice and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find I don&#x27;t need much day lotion, but require more when using the day/night cream.</li>
            <li> Today is the first time I used this. I could see my skin glow with night cream. we will see/</li>
            <li> I have this weird reaction with a rash all over where I put this, and all within three days. What is in this stuff?</li>
            <li> The commodity is good, price privilege. Logistics costs a bit more expensive.</li>
            <li> I used this product for over two weeks to give it a fair shot. I do tend to have sensitive skin and am age 29. I wanted to use this product as a preventitive measure. It has a kind of perfumy smell that I got used to, but it made my skin break out in small acne. Even after using it for a couple weeks I continued to break out. I decided that a few wrinkles were better than a constant break out and worse complextion.</li>
            <li> thank you very much 100% recommended</li>
            <li> Loreal is such a winner with their skin care products.  This kit is nice to try out if your skeptical of buying it.  I personally am satisfied with the quality of this product.  I love the daytime lotion... and the day cream is excellent.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift,but the outer package is broken when I got it, I had to used it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily this product doesn&#x27;t  disappoint me.I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good idea to buy this as a gift. The boxes looks very old, not like a new.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a really great product. I would definitely recommend it to others, a very happy purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this one as a gift to my sister and she love it. Recommend this one as a gift. Good quality and brand.</li>
            <li> not as expected considering the size , it might be good as a travelling size , good quality, good brand</li>
            <li> I really like this kit.  I will buy this Skincare product again. I really can see some changes which was a surprise to me. The only thing is the sizes of the products are small especially the night cream.  I that this is an excellent product but I would not buy this &amp;#34;sample kit&amp;#34; I would just go out and get the regular sized product from this point on.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2BZVTVKLH8DPY]]I purchased, and began using, the three step L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code (face wash, serum intense, and day/night cream) about three weeks ago. The product promises to improve the tiny lines many of us have in 7-10 days. It didn&#x27;t live up to that one, but there are still a lot of good things about the product.</li>
            <li> Like most claims on skin creams this one is ok but nothing special - just your typical skin cream.  Don&#x27;t put a lot of hope into it.</li>
            <li> This product is good for young women that want to begin a anti aging skin care regimen.  I am slightly more mature and prefer roc products.</li>
            <li> Great price for this set. Gives me the opportunity to try these products with out spending a lot of money. The product sizes aren&#x27;t too small, so I&#x27;ll be able to use for a month or so. My skin seems to be brighter and my crows feet aren&#x27;t as noticeable. So far I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is more than enough for a month supply of all these products. Other lines would cost at least 3 times as much. The day lotion is one of the only lotions with sunscreen i can use without getting irritation, and best of all,  it does not make me feel like I have a plastic film on my skin.</li>
            <li> the delivery is fast. and the seller packaged it very well! the price is not expensive, and the quality is good! i like this stuff. and that is a happy shopping!</li>
            <li> Purchased instead of oil of olay- really like the product, as I have very sensitive skin- shipping was fast and packaging appropriate.</li>
            <li> These work very well for my partly oily and partly skin.  I was given this kit for my birthday last year and liked it so much I bought a kit myself.</li>
            <li> Nice product, you get what you pay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skin care and make up lover, from high end to drugstore. I&#x27;m always looking for products that promos high end results for a reasonable price. While this product did moisturizer nicely, that&#x27;s all it did. Frankly, it&#x27;s overpriced for a drugstore brand and I&#x27;m glad I got these sample sizes rather than spending big bucks on full size. Also, I really did not enjoy the smell of the product.</li>
            <li> I was ordering this kit. But finally received an eye cream. Damn it! this is the most unpleasant purchasing experience</li>
            <li> I like that the day moisturizer has SPF. It&#x27;s important.  I like the way the eye care helps with the fine lines</li>
            <li> I received the package promptly and I&#x27;m really liking the kit.  I&#x27;ve noticed my dark circles getting better.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the jar of night cream didn&#x27;t have much product in it.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer goes on smoothly and seems to &amp;#34;sink in&amp;#34;.  I still use a tiny bit of primer over it so my makeup goes on smoothly.  All in all, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product it work really good on my skin. I like how it feel and how it makes my face brighter and not so dull looking. Thank you. I will be ordering for this seller again.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, the brand is also very good.</li>
            <li> This lotion set is a nice, complete moisture regimen that gives seamless around the clock hydration.  The eye cream is my favorite because of the texture - it&#x27;s silky/creamy and really leaves a dewey texture on my skin.  The applicator for the eye cream is a little gimmicky I think - it&#x27;s a metallic tip that you&#x27;re supposed to use to apply the lotion directly on the periorbital area.  I just use my fingers because using that applicator it is hard to control the amount of product being dispensed.  Overall the kit has a pleasant faint fragrance.  I haven&#x27;t seen my clock move backwards yet in terms of firmness and wrinkles, but my skin is velvety smooth and supple.  I would recommend this as comparable to the other lotions I own (lancome, paula&#x27;s choice, clinique) but with a more attractive price!</li>
            <li> I started using this set at the beginning of the year. I&#x27;m 24 and and was looking for something preventative, yet not too mature-oriented for my skin. (As most creams for mature skin are very oily and my skin is already combination). To break down each item:    The night cream does not leave my skin feeling oily after applying at night, or in the morning when I woke up. This is surprising to me as most people with dry skin say it works for them as well. This sample set does come with a very small-size pot but hey, they want you to sample it so you buy the full size of course. Also, if you apply this to both your face and neck, you will certainly use it up very quickly.    The day lotion is great. It is lightweight and absorbs quickly, and throughout the day my skin doesn&#x27;t get as greasy as it was with Olay Total Effects SPF lotion. I cannot say that I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in winkles because I don&#x27;t have any, but, at the end of the day my skin looked more rested, a difference I never noticed with Olay. Whether this was because my skin was actually improving or because the lotion helped to prime my makeup better, who knows, but I like it.    The eye cream is my only con with this set. I was using it everyday along with the other two products, however I was starting to get headaches and watery eyes throughout the day. I realized it was this eye cream because the morning I stopped using it, I didn&#x27;t have a headache and my eyes were not as irritated. I think one reason for this may be that its not meant to be worn during the day? I was really hoping this would be more gentle, because I definitely wanted a good eye cream I could use long-term to keep my eyes looking youthful. I&#x27;ve read other reviews where people loved the eye cream, so I suppose you should try it for yourself, as age and skin-type may be a big factor with this item.    Overall, I think I would purchase the day cream again, as it is hard to find an SPF lotion that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on my skin. And if it helps my skin look more refreshed at the end of my day, great! :)</li>
            <li> Thanks for those products!</li>
            <li> Most of the product was dried out as if it had been on shelf for awhile.  Guess thats what I get for ordering online, think this was leftover item from store.</li>
            <li> This is a great set of 3 Youth Code products.&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to try Youth Code and this was the perfect way.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it is helping because I need to be more faithful in using products.</li>
            <li> A good deal for your money. I got this set as a gift for my sister but relatively impressed as it was hard to track for delivery.&lt;br /&gt;All and all,  a good item that normally runs for double the price at retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This is a great size for travel or if you are just wanting to sample the product.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works great and doesn&#x27;t bother my psoriasis. Very fast and easy routine to get into.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and  no damage to report!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy this on a regular basis!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a low-fuss person and I don&#x27;t wear makeup. But the dry air in Arizona makes moisturizer a necessity, and over the years I&#x27;ve tried several brands. I have a tropism towards all-natural products that I generally buy in the health food store, because I care about the ingredients I&#x27;m slathering on my face -- but they are expensive and, more annoying, they come in bottles so large that the oil generally goes rancid before I use it up. (I&#x27;m not exactly rigorous about using this stuff every day.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with an Amazon Vine option making it easy to try this one, I figured -- why not? After using the combination of lotions and creams for the past month, I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the lotions feel clean and comfortable rather than gloopy or greasy. Some moisturizers can make my skin break out if I use them for several days in a row; that hasn&#x27;t been a problem here. They don&#x27;t smell like much of anything, which is a good thing. And the eye cream, in particular, makes my skin feel relaxed -- as though I&#x27;d been a little tense and hadn&#x27;t realized it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrinkles haven&#x27;t exactly disappeared overnight (what? the lotion doesn&#x27;t make me 18 again?!), but my skin looks good and the price is reasonable. I&#x27;m happy with this stuff. You probably will be, too.</li>
            <li> The YOUTH CODE SKINCARE KIT by L&#x27;OREAL is a 3-step kit that helps keep skin moisturized and \\&quot;youthful\\&quot; looking. It consists of a daytime SPF moisturizer, an eye cream, and an extra day/night cream, which can be used for excessively dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got combination oily/normal skin and have occasional adult acne. YOUTH CODE didn&#x27;t cause me to break out, but I didn&#x27;t use the day/night cream overnight, so keep that in mind. Using it for three weeks, my skin seems to be properly hydrated, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic smoothing of fine lines on my forehead. Here&#x27;s how each item worked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* SPF 30 DAY LOTION&lt;br /&gt;Above average performance for sunscreen moisturizer. It&#x27;s not too thick and doesn&#x27;t give that whitish hue that I find with most sunscreens with an SPF above 15. Also absent is that strong scent of plastic, again present in most UV blockers, even though you can smell a slight hint of it. It provides adequate moisture for oily to normal skin types, and I found it worked well by itself for my skin. It did make my face shiny, but that can be knocked out with a little powder or oil blotting sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* EYE CREAM&lt;br /&gt;Average performance and has tendency to cake-up if applied in over itself. The eye cream has a metallic, slanted tip, which is supposed to make application easier, but I found it tricky at best because it would drag and pull the skin, so I just used my little finger to pat it on. There were times when I would feel a tingling sensation around my eyes from the cream and other times I would not, so I&#x27;m not sure if that was supposed to happen; if it is it didn&#x27;t happen with regularity, so either I was applying too much or ingredients were not mixed enough. My skin around the eyes seemed hydrated and slightly softer, but I noticed that it didn&#x27;t really keep the hydration after washing my face or taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* DAY AND NIGHT CREAM&lt;br /&gt;Average performance. The day/night cream is meant for dry spots and has a light clean scent, highly concentrated, and absorbs quickly. It didn&#x27;t leave behind an oily sheen or residue, but I found that it didn&#x27;t really penetrate very deeply into my skin. At night, I usually use an acne product containing Benzoyl Peroxide, which dries my skin out at times, and so I need to use a heavier than average moisturizer on certain spots. This cream kind of just sat there and my skin still felt dry and tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, YOUTH CODE is pretty decent. I would advise using it as a preventive measure against aging skin or if you have fine lines and combo/dry skin. But if you have deep wrinkles from either over exposure to the sun, neglect, genetics and/or age no over-the-counter cream will be effective.absorbs quickly.

            <li> My wife has dry skin, and has been concerned about wrinkles. She tried this product, and LOVED the eye wand. It was cooling and really helped with dryness and puffiness. It only took a couple of days and she really noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that the other two products (day lotion and day/night cream) gave her zits. She broke out badly, and then had to deal with getting rid of zits, which she hasn&#x27;t had to do in 15 years. The creams felt nice going on, but definitely did not produce desirable results. Your mileage may vary, however, depending on your skin type. Be forewarned.</li>
            <li> This is a &amp;#34;trial size&amp;#34; kit. Just so ya know. Love the deal I got on it though.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now and the face wash is really nice, surprising my skin didn&#x27;t feel stripped or tight after using it. the serum and cream combined does make the finer lines on my face seem less prominent but the big disadvantage is that it makes my pores seem huge and really stand out. my significant other even said he could really see my pores and he volunteered this info i didn&#x27;t ask so if he noticed that means they were really standing out because he never notices my skin. if you use it and immediately put on makeup then it works well but if you&#x27;re going barefaced beware the texture is better but not the actual appearance, i think after i run out i won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Arrived what was promised. A good price and great products. The shipment was as fast as they promised. Overall we are happy!</li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed because the size of the products is extremely small especially the day/night creme. You only need to use a very small amount of products because too much causes skin to be greasy and can clog pores causing breakouts. All three products that come in this beginner kit can last a little over a month if you use everyday as i did. The serum that does not come in this kit is a must have. It really hydrates and smoothes your skin, creating a flawless look. If using these products you should use the serum first. A small amount is needed and it smoothes over the skin very easy. Next you should use the day lotion with the spf.  I would suggest putting a little extra on your high dry areas. For example i add more between my eyebrows and nose area. try not to put any of the day lotion under your eyes that is a very sensitive area. next add the eye cream using the very easy to use applicator. it really does keep your under eye area feeling cool all day. I noticed a reduction in dark circles but my skin is too sensitive to it and it has made that area swollen sometimes but very unnoticiable. at night you should wash your face and just apply the day/night cream. i add more than suggested just because i have very dry skin. i am only 21 so i am not using this product for wrinkle reducing and age spots. i am using it as a preventative measure to keep my skin hydrated and protected. for that this product is great. i look more awake even if i&#x27;m going on 3 hours of sleep. my skin is clear and everyone can tell how hydrated my face is. my face is sooo soft its hard to believe. i would suggest using l&#x27;oreal 360 clean for a face wash to go along with the products here. there are about 5 different 360 cleans that go with every type of skin. i use the one for sensitive skin. these are great products and i will be purchasing more. from the other reviews i read this product is not great for deep wrinkles and skin that has not been taken care of before. i would suggest using this product as younger adults and for adults who have taken great care of there skin in the past.</li>
            <li> absorbs easy, smells great, kept skin nice and soft, love the under eye cream in particular, would def purchase again!</li>
            <li> this product are very good and reasonable price, been a custumer for almost a year, and probably will continue to be</li>
            <li> FIRST TIME USING THIS PRODUCT, BUT I HAVE USED THE BRAND, AND SO FAR SO GOOD!!!</li>
            <li> I love the way the product works on my skin, I could see an immediate difference especially with the eye serum. The sizes are very small for the price and that is why I gave this product only 4 stars. But I would indeed buy it again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the serum but the night day cream and the daily lotion are great! I love love love the day/night cream. It&#x27;s just perfect for my skin. I have dryer skin I guess though I wouldn&#x27;t say dry skin. It&#x27;s absolutely so refreshing right out of the shower and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. The daily cream is great for a midday boost. Great price for this package!</li>
            <li> the containers are sooo cute it makes you want to keep using them cuz its fun</li>
            <li> Very nice, my girl said so.</li>
            <li> Normally, my skin regimen consists of a glycerin soap, followed by alpha-hydroxy lotion. That&#x27;s worked well for me, with the exception that I will get the occasional blemish and my skin can get blotchy from the acidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 42 and have just started to notice fine lines around my eyes, so I thought it might be time to change up what I&#x27;ve been using. My local supermarket had this kit (as shown in the box) on clearance for half-price, so I decided to take a chance and bought the last two boxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true that there&#x27;s no greasy feel and my skin has lost its redness. After a few days the fine lines at the corner of my eyes are nearly gone. The only negative is the fragrance. It has quite a strong perfumed smell. I&#x27;ve got significant allergies and could definitely have done without that added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly recommend this product and believe as long as I can still get it, I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Was dismayed when I found a lot of negative reaction to this on the web. Then I realized that most of the &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t work&amp;#34; comments I read are in the 20-39 year old range. Could be this isn&#x27;t a one size fits all kind of thing. I&#x27;m 46 and have had acne my whole life. The Elizabeth Arden and Olay Pro X lines...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come packaged as shown.  Was loosely placed in an envelope and mailed to me, but luckily this wasn&#x27;t a gift.  Otherwise, I would have returned it.  Benn using it for a few weeks and I don&#x27;t see any change to my skin, so don&#x27;t know if I would recommend it for that, but the night cream is lovely and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I got this package late but at least I got it before Christmas . The box it came in was scratched up and it looked dirty . This is a Christmas present so hopefully the person I give this to likes it . And also the things it comes with are a good size , they arent that small and they aren&#x27;t that big of product . :-)</li>
            <li> Great value and worth it to at least try it. I would definitely but these products in a store. Loved the face cream and under eye cream the most.</li>
            <li> The products were a bit smaller than I thought. My husband liked the small tube applicator best. I didn&#x27;t see any difference when using these products.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it didn&#x27;t come in the box you see attached.  This was meant as a gift therefore i was unable to give as a gift.  The creams were all loose.</li>
            <li> Becareful, I purchased this because it is a package, but received three pieces w/o package showed on the picture. Need to return it.</li>
            <li> Great value for the money and have all my favorites in one boxEspecially love the eye correction cream and the way it is dispensed</li>
            <li> I brought L&#x27;oreal Youth code for my Hubby and i have being using it for myself also...I just love it</li>
            <li> Youth says it all, probably for younger people because for mature skin it does nothing. Total waste of money! Alot of hype for nothing.</li>
            <li> I love these L&#x27;Oreal products. They are smaller in size but a good value for the price. Great for travel. Item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> like it&lt;br /&gt;it is soothes my skin immediately after I put it I feel like some one is pulling my face all around which is very good</li>
            <li> I like this product and it was a great way to try different things trying to deal with my skin issues. The price was right. I may not buy the night cream again but I like the day cream and I love the eye cream.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift as my sister need a new perk in her makeup,this did the trick. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> this is awesome and a good deal. l&#x27;oreal  is one of my favorite anyway.</li>
            <li> I read most of the reviews before buying these products. I&#x27;m well beyond the acne years, or was for over 20 yrs  till I used this stuff. My skin is somewhat sensitve, but not overly so.  My chin broke out, the fine lines I do have suddenly became crevices, and I&#x27;m now going to have to throw away about $90 worth of products that I bought from here and my local store. Very disappointing, and a lot of money that would have been better spent on other products.  I won&#x27;t make that mistake again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I stopped using all of the products, then added one at a time back. None of the products in this kit was the issue--I was able to narrow it down to the BB cream!</li>
            <li> The night cream is SO small! Te rest of the products are OK. If you are looking for a high quality cream, don&#x27;t but this set.</li>
            <li> The moisture is just not there and the serum burns a little. It may be better for younger women (39  or so.)</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a gift and the recipient loves it. It was a really good choice for a woman on her birthday. I will recommend it.</li>
            <li> Unscented, gentle and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin. It has good moisturizing coverage with thick lotion. Although it is sized as more of a try before you buy. (not sample sized though)</li>
            <li> I bought three sets of this product, one for a coworker, one for me and one for my mom. I don&#x27;t use mine much but my coworker raves about the eye cream especially. The reason I gave it four stars is the packaging I received. Seems like a Rite-Aid liquidated their stock to the seller as the packaging was scratched up and some had price labels.  I was able to choose the best one for my mom so that was OK.</li>
            <li> [...]    [...]    [...]    The skincare cream from L&#x27;Oreal was very painful &amp; burned my eyes and nose as you can see in the pictures. I tried a skin healing ointment but I am still in pain and now require a dermatologist to recover the damage caused.  Use caution when buying any of these L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
            <li> I am not seeing any result on this product and it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed too well on my dry skin and if I put too much on, it gets flaky and just sits on the surface of my skin.  I would not buy those drug store brand anymore. I thought I will save money on my cosmetic but oh well, I guess I&#x27;ll go back to department store brand.</li>
            <li> came opened, old, and dirty. Can not return because gifted away already, beacause was march8. Not recommending buying from Loreal. They give out old stuff.</li>
            <li> Bought this along time ago to try the products. I am hooked, I now only use these products faithfully.</li>
            <li> Loved it went out and bought the youth code products  very sensitive to all products this one was wonderful eye cream didn&#x27;t burn skin feels soft and supple looks great</li>
            <li> this is just a good product I have ordered it twice before this</li>
            <li> Sample sizes are my favorite to buy in products so I can decide if I want to purchase the full size without wasting more money. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this for that very reason. I am liking both of the lotions - nice scent, not greasy feeling. The first couple of times I used the eye cream it burned slightly, but hasn&#x27;t since. That&#x27;s the only issue I&#x27;ve had so far which is why I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars. Plus a product has to be prefect to get 5 stars from me and that&#x27;s rare.</li>
            <li> I ordered the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Regenerating Skincare package for my mother&#x27;s birthday and she absolutely loved this product!</li>
            <li> I love the eye cream. It was one of the few that I have ever seen a noticeable difference with (and immediately). Everything else was just meh though.</li>
            <li> The small trial size and price allows you to judge for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Both moisturizers goes on so smoothly, the eye care does not affect my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this product, so glad I purchased 2 at a time, the items are packaged in small sizes. Wish the amount of the product was a larger quantity. Love how my skin feels!</li>
            <li> I used and love the Day/Night cream so I decided to order the set! The set includes a smaller Day/Night Cream, a day cream with sunscreen (SPF 30 I believe), and my favorite - the eye serum. The serum is better than the expensive (&amp;#62;$100) eye creams I have used in the past! Even after a sleepless night of looking at a computer, it totally reduced the appearance of fine lines and bags!</li>
            <li> buen articulo llego a la fecha sin ningún problema 100% confiable el vendedor,operacion realizada sin ningun tipo de incoveniente el producto llena mi perspectiva</li>
            <li> My grandmother loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very affordable kit. i love the smell and feel of the night cream. i don&#x27;t use the eye cream as much as i was intending to, but i do use the day lotion regularly. it&#x27;s too bad the night cream&#x27;s quantity is so low.</li>
            <li> Another of those skin care products that did not do a thing for me.</li>
            <li> Today is the third day that my face looks horrible after using Youth code in the morning (serum and BB) I have no idea why Loreal reacts so badly to my skin, but HIGHLY recommend if you are fair skinned and sensitive stick with a different product. I have bumps all over my face and neck, just imagine a horrible sun burn combined with an acne attack. I will NEVER use a Loreal product again. The face hurts so bad, and it just looks awful.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy, absorbs quickly.  The eye cream could&#x27;ve been a little more moisterizing, but it&#x27;s okay for summer.  Decent value for the money.</li>
            <li> They ARE tiny, you&#x27;re just imagining it bigger and with more product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m holding em&#x27; ... one curled finger each lol</li>
            <li> This product arrived in a timely manner.  I am enjoying this product.  My husband has allergies, so the smell is not strong and offensive and has not caused any problems with him.</li>
            <li> Day/night is my prefer. Day lotion has little dry. Eye cream realy dry. But that is OK. Price  is good.  I like it.</li>
            <li> good for my face. when am use this my face very sofe this work very good not expensive and work very good</li>
            <li> While the product was what i was hoping for, I received it in two weeks, while expecting it in 3-5 days.  Also when I finally received it, the plastic over the product was very dusty.  I had to wipe it quite a bit before opneing it.</li>
            <li> Nice product for the price.</li>
            <li> Cool and creamy on my skin...I look five years younger</li>
            <li> Eye cream, night cream and day cream are included.  If you travel, the sizes are great.  Eye cream works great to diminished my dark circles and crows feet.  Day cream is light and SP30.  No problems with night cream. Great product for a good price.</li>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;oreal skin products for a few years.  I saw this online and didn&#x27;t read the print closely enough so when it came I was disappointed because I needed the larger container of the day/night cream.  The cream is a very small tub however it is perfect for traveling so that&#x27;s what I use it for now.  The other items, the daytime lotion is great and I haven&#x27;t tried the eye stuff yet.</li>
