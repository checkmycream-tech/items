            <li> The best perfume ever!</li>
            <li> Not the original...dont waste your money like i did...gave them 2 star for fast shipping</li>
            <li> This perfume has a light floral/fruity scent. It is not overpowering nor is it offensively pungent. Just a great youthful scent!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance. The smell is mesmerizing.  The price was exceptional compared to $60/$70 in stores and perfume outlets. I need to order another just to have. Thanks Amazon for an amazing fragrance at the right price.</li>
            <li> When I got my package a few minutes ago I thought it was a necklace I bought that said it should be here today. This perfume was estimated to show up 4-6 days from now! I ordered it two days ago and its already here! This is my favorite perfume it&#x27;s all I wear! I always get compliments and everyone wants to know what I wear but its my secret so no one can smell like me! The scent is hard to describe for me but I think every woman would love this! Its fruity and it lasts for hours! I don&#x27;t need to use half as much as I do with other perfumes and it actually stays on! Plus, $20 for a 3.3oz bottle is a total steal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many compliments walking by people wearing this scent! It&#x27;s too light to me but because of these compliments I am buying it again and again!</li>
            <li> It is not to my taste, but the price was good. May be someone else will like it. Keep it</li>
            <li> Love love love it..fast shipping..I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Okay I first bought this item  2 months ago for my gf  after reading some very pleasing reviews.....this is my second order.......her and her friends have ran the bottle dry in less than a few weeks....its a smell unlike no other not fruity or minty....its a fresh clean smell that any mature woman will enjoy</li>
            <li> Fell in love with thus perfume when i got it on my lat trip. Great deal, since I couldn&#x27;t get it  in Canada.</li>
            <li> I GET LOTS AND LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS ON THIS PERFUME!! ITS VERY SOFT, CLASSY SMELL TO IT. BETWEEN LACOSTE TOUCH OF PINK AND PARIS HILTON..</li>
            <li> A friend asked me to buy this for them. They obviously like it.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect scent for a young woman! Fruity, soft and long lasting fragance.  I would recommend it for a young lady on her 20s or 30s</li>

            <li> a little smell like sunrise ，more sweet , do not use it after shower.  like the bottle, it looks like china.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect scent for a young 30 something, mature without being old lady, flirty without being labeled a teenager. I wish they made a purse size version.</li>
