            <li>our amazing</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t buy foo foo magic products but the &amp;#34;Un wrinkle&amp;#34; pads and this moisturizing product are amazing and everyone has been asking me what I have done because my skin looks so good.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturiser - it is just lovely!</li>
            <li>I have used the more emollient PTR anti aging cream and liked it.</li>
            <li>I am wondering if the product I got was an authentic item.</li>
            <li>any product by this company, they are all fantastic!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>
            <li>The Un-Wrinkle Foundation is also top notch--better than Lancôme, Dior and Chanel.</li>
            <li>think it is ok, anyway the characters on the lid do not apply to my face.</li>
            <li>The product is ok, I think it is not fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I am OK with that.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love me some  Peter Thomas Roth.  </li>
            <li>My skin really doesn&#x27;t look as good as it used to since I began using this.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good cream, each with its rapidly absorbed, my skin is sensitive, but it is not allergies</li>
            <li>Also helps with fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I was worried about it being too light</li>
            <li>The packaging was secure and it came in a timely manner</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is rich and light.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and am really pleased with how my skin has changed since I have started my new regimen.</li>
            <li>but it is rather rich.</li>
            <li>The consistency is perfect - not too heavy, but really luxurious and feels so lovely on my skin.</li>
            <li>The name on the cap wore off pretty quickly which made me wonder if this is really an authentic product.</li>
            <li>product has just the right amount of moisture.  </li>
            <li>It is just right for me.  </li>
            <li>One step to just the right amount of moisture.  </li>
            <li>Rich Intensive Anti-Aging Cellular Crème\\&quot; which currently costs $75 though I love the latter better.</li>
            <li>, this is the second bottle I use, I think I would have insisted it because I love it.</li>
            <li>This okay if you are just looking for a basic moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love this brand and will definitely continue to purchase this product!</li>
            <li>The package arrived fast.</li>
            <li>Besides it didn&#x27;t real do anything ..</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, today I went to a real store and checked this item, and I am pretty sure that the characters on the lid do not fade out as I tried very hard on the tester.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I will use it out anyway, and will buy a new one on either the store or the official website, to make a comparison.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and recently started a new regimen with the Peter Thomas Roth Cucumber Foaming wash followed by this Ultra-Lite moisturizer, topped off with the Anti-aging defense sunscreen stick if I am going outdoors.</li>
            <li>i think this is a great product, it might be a little thick for the summer</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and notice a huge difference in the feel and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>the real stuff is the dealer purchased something and just putting it into individual jars.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel soft, with no greasy feel.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, my fingers turned black.</li>

            <li> The package arrived fast. After have used for a week, I have noticed something on the container. The printed words has gone smudged, the black ink is all over the container. I get my fingers all over the black ink powder. I am wondering if the product I got was an authentic item.</li>
            <li> A moisturizer than actually does dry matte. Is ultra-light as stated.  Has a pleasant lemony smell. Will keep extras on hand.  I have used this even though I have oily skin and have not felt overy &amp;#34;greased up.&amp;#34; Would recommend other Peter Thomas Roth products as well.</li>
            <li> Great skin product by Peter Thomas Roth! I have yet to be disappointed hu any product by this company, they are all fantastic! Anti-aging cellular repair especially. I use this everyday and notice a huge difference in the feel and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is a very good cream, each with its rapidly absorbed, my skin is sensitive, but it is not allergies, this is the second bottle I use, I think I would have insisted it because I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks now.  I do not see it as a miracle product, but I am very pleased with how it has worked for me.</li>
            <li> I was worried about it being too light but it is rather rich. It is really a good alternative of the \\&quot;Mega Rich Intensive Anti-Aging Cellular Crème\\&quot; which currently costs $75 though I love the latter better. All PeterThomasRoth products are great. The Un-Wrinkle Foundation is also top notch--better than Lancôme, Dior and Chanel. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this brand.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected. My wife really loved it. Very good product for the price I paid. I recommend it</li>
            <li> I had the same problem with the ink coming off .To me that makes me think twice is this the real stuff is the dealer purchased something and just putting it into individual jars. Cause I bought this from qvc and the texture was way different then what&#x27;s in this jar. Besides it didn&#x27;t real do anything ..Peter thomas roth products our amazing this was not. I would not buy this from . this dealer again. Not to mention it was not creamy and it had a different smell...Just saying! !</li>
            <li> i think this is a great product, it might be a little thick for the summer but I still like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying all of the Peter Thomas Roth products and this is the most disappointing of them. It really doesn&#x27;t do anything. It&#x27;s not moisturizing, it doesn&#x27;t have any discernible &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; effects and it smells terrible. I&#x27;ve used the entire jar so I think if it were going to do anything, I would have happened by now.</li>
            <li> This okay if you are just looking for a basic moisturizer.  I was anxious to try this based on the reviews but will be going back to my previous moisturizer as soon as this is gone.  My skin really doesn&#x27;t look as good as it used to since I began using this.  The name on the cap wore off pretty quickly which made me wonder if this is really an authentic product.</li>
            <li> Price is great and it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I love Peter Roth products! It makes my skin feel rejuvenated . Also helps with fine lines and wrinkles. Thank you Peter Roth!</li>
            <li> Maybe the product is ok, but I DON&#x27;T know what&#x27;s wrong with the lid. The character on it just disappeared after a couple of days. The ink just appear on my hand. I didn&#x27;t read the view other people wrote down carefully. When I found this problem, I reread it, AND I found others have the same problem.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, my fingers turned black. Later I found it was because of the characters on the lid of the item. Very very soon the brand characters printed on the lid became hard to distinguish and I even had to use cloth to wipe it so that my fingers did not turn black again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is ok, anyway the characters on the lid do not apply to my face. The product is ok, I think it is not fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, today I went to a real store and checked this item, and I am pretty sure that the characters on the lid do not fade out as I tried very hard on the tester.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I couldn&#x27;t help doubting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I will use it out anyway, and will buy a new one on either the store or the official website, to make a comparison.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I am 60, have wrinkles that are not going to go away and I am OK with that.&lt;br /&gt;This product has just the right amount of moisture.  I appreciate not having to go with the serums, the eye creams, the neck creams, etc.  It is just right for me.  One step to just the right amount of moisture.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturiser - it is just lovely! The consistency is perfect - not too heavy, but really luxurious and feels so lovely on my skin. Its a really great cream - I love this brand and will definitely continue to purchase this product!</li>
            <li> people talked about how good this thing was.... but when i finally got to try it... no.... i didn&#x27;t like it.... it smells great... but it left my face sticky.... now i only use it on my neck...</li>
            <li> product date is 2012,it is getting expired,will not recommond to buy.product date is 2012,it is getting expired,will not recommond to buy.</li>
            <li> It is an awesome product at a fabulous price. I don&#x27;t buy foo foo magic products but the &amp;#34;Un wrinkle&amp;#34; pads and this moisturizing product are amazing and everyone has been asking me what I have done because my skin looks so good.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and recently started a new regimen with the Peter Thomas Roth Cucumber Foaming wash followed by this Ultra-Lite moisturizer, topped off with the Anti-aging defense sunscreen stick if I am going outdoors. I never liked using moisturizers on my skin because they seemed to make my face even oilier. This moisturizer is rich and light. It makes your skin feel soft, with no greasy feel. I absolutely love this product and am really pleased with how my skin has changed since I have started my new regimen.</li>
            <li> I have used the more emollient PTR anti aging cream and liked it. Thought I would try a lighter version but it is drying to my skin and I it has a sticky feeling to it. I would not purchase this again. The packaging was secure and it came in a timely manner but it is not for me.</li>
            <li> Love me some  Peter Thomas Roth.  Shipment was fast</li>
