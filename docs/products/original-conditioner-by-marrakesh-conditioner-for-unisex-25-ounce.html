            <li> I bought almost every brand of conditioner looking for one that would remoisturize my color treated hair without making it look greasy.  By accident, I ran into a hairdresser at a mall beauty supply store.  She implored me to try this product and it is perfect - conditioning without greasiness.</li>
            <li> I found the conditioner was very effective in leaving my hair clean &amp; manageable.  I would recommend this product to any potential buyer.</li>

            <li> I have very coarse, thick hair. I used the Marrakesh leave in treatment for a long time an decided to take a chance on the shampoo and conditioner. I am so glad I did. I only have to wash my hair twice a week now and my scalp isn&#x27;t itchy or flaky anymore.</li>
