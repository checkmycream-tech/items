            <li>Nice quality too.</li>
            <li>Nice colors.</li>
            <li>However 24 pencils for $9 is a nice price</li>
            <li>It is nice but it makes my eyelids stick together  every time I blink .</li>
            <li>Nice price/quantity.</li>

            <li>.. Very smooth</li>
            <li>Very light colors.</li>
            <li>although this product is very light ( except for the darker colors) even than i have to apply planty of coats...</li>
            <li>not water proof, runs easy, nice colors though</li>
            <li>I bought these liners because I love the NYX liners</li>
            <li>My daughter and I love them.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>

            <li>I love how they look.</li>
            <li>you have too put so many times for you can see the lines.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Eye skin irritated after so many stokes.  </li>
            <li>BUT i love the bulk order</li>
            <li>really enjoying it,  </li>
            <li>Received them on time, love the color selection.</li>
            <li>its gonna be my favorite for sure</li>
            <li>:) love this product already</li>
            <li>I Am In So Love With These Products</li>
            <li>Girls your going to love it</li>
            <li>Good quality eyeliners for a great price, so I definitely can&#x27;t complain about that.</li>
            <li>I love &amp;#34;ITALIA&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I cant wait to start using them. :)</li>
            <li>but that was a better ratio compared to this.</li>
            <li>I do love the lip liners but the eyeliners not at all.</li>
            <li>Applies smoothly and without flaw!</li>
            <li>I just received  them and they look pretty good for my money....</li>
            <li>Got exactly what it said i was getting  good quality  lip liners.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and beautiful on my eyes.</li>
            <li>pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>Love the color easy to apply 😃😃😃</li>
            <li>So many colors and it applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>These eyeliners go on really smooth, they blend well and most importantly I have been able to wear all day</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and good quality</li>
            <li>The colors are true to photo, but without any finishing spray this will not stay on all day!</li>
            <li>it smudges easily</li>
            <li>Some colors are great, some you can barely see.</li>
            <li>I have found that if you have more inset eyes, putting some of the colors on the top of the eye lid rubs off fairly easily but on the bottom of the eyelid it stays very well</li>
            <li>Here is my absolute honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, cheap material</li>
            <li>I like nabi cosmetics as I already own the whole line of lip liners</li>
            <li>the light brown.so</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>They are completely amazing and so worth it, they go with every skin tone and they are very high pigmented, they also are just like in the picture!</li>
            <li>This was my second purchase from Nabi Cosmetics, and I liked the lip liners a bit more than the eyeliners.</li>
            <li>I will be contacting them to see if they can make it right!</li>
            <li>Italia is a better brand and shows up much darker.</li>
            <li>Colors are nice and soft otherwise.</li>
            <li>I love all the colors and the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>There is also a link to a quick video review that I did on this</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly-</li>
            <li>I was more than thrilled to discover that this product is worth every penny I spent on it</li>
            <li>Definitely worth to buy especially because of how many you get for so cheap!</li>
            <li>They sharpen easily without wasting too much pencil.</li>
            <li>Awesome product,came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>the light blue is by far my favorite out of all of these, and i love Nabi products</li>
            <li>The colors were correct, arrived very quickly and the colors show up vibrantly.</li>
            <li>Beyond worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>Still, for the price, they&#x27;re worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I love their &amp;#34;wholesale&amp;#34; options, and that their products live up to EXACTLY</li>
            <li>Hope this seller contacts me to make this order right</li>
            <li>I always stick to my basic black pencil, but its nice to be able to switch things up for sooo cheap.</li>
            <li>And they got here super fast.</li>
            <li>The colors are very bold, and overall quite true to the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors are exactly what you see in the picture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fake costumer.</li>
            <li>First off, I did not receive the colors shown.</li>
            <li>:Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>Got here pretty fast only about 2 or 3 came repeated but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s a color I really wanted.</li>
            <li>the lighter colors don&#x27;t really show up that well on my skin tone that much (probably because I&#x27;m basically albino)</li>
            <li>These are so worth it, for yourself or even for professional use.</li>
            <li>Color goes on light and alot of them look the same color</li>
            <li>I really like these</li>
            <li>These pencils were really pigmented except for the gold I couldn&#x27;t get it to transfer color very well</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really painful.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>Well let me start off by saying this shipping was awesomely fast.</li>
            <li>Smudges/wears kinda fast.</li>
            <li>Received my order sooner than I expected and was 100% satisfied with the the quality of the liners.</li>
            <li>The product is way better than I expected!!</li>
            <li>You get so many for such a low price.</li>
            <li>I may be looking for high pigment in products that aren&#x27;t supposed to be high pigment,</li>
            <li>I recently went to a funeral of a very very dear friend of mine and cried the whole time.</li>
            <li>Normally I can&#x27;t even buy one eyeliner for this price~</li>
            <li>Still, these go on relatively smoothly and last for several hours without needing to be reapplied.</li>
            <li>many repetitive colors I got 4 browns.</li>
            <li>Do not waste money on this!</li>
            <li>I at first thought I was maybe not being firm enough, but it draws on my hand with light application.</li>
            <li>Different vibrant colors</li>
            <li>I really love the variety, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because I&#x27;m not sure of pigment.</li>
            <li>but they were kind of expensive.</li>
            <li>thing worth pointing out is that both of my orders were missing pieces.</li>
            <li>but the other pencils were very pigmented and lasted all day</li>
            <li>Colors weren&#x27;t as vibrant as i expected, but still like them.</li>
            <li>but you have to be careful when using them as they are very soft.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and usually have to use Almay or other products that don&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li>The pencils are delightfully smooth and pigmented and for someone that is slowly working on their makeup skills that ease of use is a must!</li>
            <li>They are long lasting and really easy to apply and very hard to smudge.</li>

            <li> The colors are exactly what you see in the picture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fake costumer.</li>
            <li> First off, I did not receive the colors shown.</li>
            <li> :Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> Got here pretty fast only about 2 or 3 came repeated but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s a color I really wanted.</li>
            <li> the lighter colors don&#x27;t really show up that well on my skin tone that much (probably because I&#x27;m basically albino)</li>
            <li> These are so worth it, for yourself or even for professional use.</li>
            <li> Color goes on light and alot of them look the same color</li>
            <li> I really like these</li>
            <li> These pencils were really pigmented except for the gold I couldn&#x27;t get it to transfer color very well</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really painful.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> Well let me start off by saying this shipping was awesomely fast.</li>
            <li> Smudges/wears kinda fast.</li>
            <li> Received my order sooner than I expected and was 100% satisfied with the the quality of the liners.</li>
            <li> The product is way better than I expected!!</li>
            <li> You get so many for such a low price.</li>
            <li> I may be looking for high pigment in products that aren&#x27;t supposed to be high pigment,</li>
            <li> I recently went to a funeral of a very very dear friend of mine and cried the whole time.</li>
            <li> Normally I can&#x27;t even buy one eyeliner for this price~</li>
            <li> Still, these go on relatively smoothly and last for several hours without needing to be reapplied.</li>
            <li> many repetitive colors I got 4 browns.</li>
            <li> Do not waste money on this!</li>
            <li> I at first thought I was maybe not being firm enough, but it draws on my hand with light application.</li>
            <li> Different vibrant colors</li>
            <li> I really love the variety, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because I&#x27;m not sure of pigment.</li>
            <li> but they were kind of expensive.</li>
            <li> thing worth pointing out is that both of my orders were missing pieces.</li>
            <li> but the other pencils were very pigmented and lasted all day</li>
            <li> Colors weren&#x27;t as vibrant as i expected, but still like them.</li>
            <li> but you have to be careful when using them as they are very soft.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and usually have to use Almay or other products that don&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li> The pencils are delightfully smooth and pigmented and for someone that is slowly working on their makeup skills that ease of use is a must!</li>
            <li> They are long lasting and really easy to apply and very hard to smudge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They stay long enough for 4-5 hours without any touch</li>
            <li> I Received: Khaki, Black, Dark Gold, Hot Blue, Baby Blue, Lime Green (actually a Navy Blue color), Charcoal Grey, Satin Blue, Medium Brown, M. green, Cosmos, Silver, Purple Glitter, Emerald Green, Dark Brown, Gold, Lime, Ocean Blue, Light Brown, Peacock, Charcoal, Taupe, Brown, and Cafe.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> The colors are not what I expected, some are actually the same colors of my lip pencils.</li>
            <li> I am light skin and had to apply this product at least 10 times in order to get the result as other Brand Name pencils WHICH REQUIRES ONE STROKE!!!  </li>
            <li> I came in way earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> but I want what I ordered I could have spent a little extra from a different seller if I knew this would happen.</li>
            <li> Totally recommended this product and other Nabi products to the make up lovers out there!!</li>
            <li> I got duplicates of medium brown and did not get pink</li>
            <li> ... arrived on time as expected.</li>
            <li> Pink does not even look like I have applied it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Colors are not intense as I hoped they would be.  </li>
            <li> Was not at all what I expected, save time and money.</li>
            <li> I came across these liners a while ago and was very hesitant to purchase them due to prior unfortunate experiences with seemingly affordable makeup.</li>
            <li> , I am disappointed with the quality, I need to put the makeup many times and to push on my eyelid until it has the desired color and it kinda irritates my eyelid.</li>
            <li> But got Pink eye after using the black pencil once.</li>
            <li> despite any bad I enjoy it</li>
            <li> As the product info says you get 24.I am not pleased with the fact I got two that said lime green when it was a black one which was a repeat.the other fraudulent lime green was some chalky looking blue color.</li>
            <li> green.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve had it on my arm for a few hours or so and it has faded a bit.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy crease and this happens with a lot of eyeliners I get, just depends on your eyes).</li>
            <li> Feels really heavy, not waterproof at all.</li>
            <li> The lip liners were missing two of the colors listed, and these eyeliners came with a pencil labelled lime green that was actually black (as well as a pink eyeliner that was broken).</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re not good quality dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re hard to go on</li>
            <li> Common ??</li>
            <li> Seriously....</li>
            <li> ( i feel like its common to put the color at the bottom anyways!</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> does not say anything in the ad about receiving random colors.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Useless</li>
            <li> i tresh them. :(</li>
            <li> but this is really disappointing!</li>
            <li> but these have horrible pigmented</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Loved this product. I came in way earlier than expected. The colors are exactly what you see in the picture. They are awesome for the price. You can also use them as lipliner ! great buy.</li>
            <li> I bought these liners because I love the NYX liners but they were kind of expensive. I thought that these would be a good alternative but these have horrible pigmented, they&#x27;re hard to go on and they&#x27;re not good quality dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> I came across these liners a while ago and was very hesitant to purchase them due to prior unfortunate experiences with seemingly affordable makeup. I was more than thrilled to discover that this product is worth every penny I spent on it and then some! The pencils are delightfully smooth and pigmented and for someone that is slowly working on their makeup skills that ease of use is a must! I am of a darker complexion and the fact that these show up on my skin tone so flawlessly is everything! I will include a photo with the swatches that I did on the back of my hand so that you can take a look at the color pay off. There is also a link to a quick video review that I did on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;218O-zm3h_4</li>
            <li> Excellent color and coverage!!! AAA+++!!!</li>
            <li> not water proof, runs easy, nice colors though</li>
            <li> The pencils are wonderful and beautiful colors but you have to be careful when using them as they are very soft. I got duplicates of medium brown and did not get pink and that&#x27;s a color I really wanted.</li>
            <li> Some colors are great, some you can barely see.</li>
            <li> I just received  them and they look pretty good for my money....</li>
            <li> The product is way better than I expected!! So many colors and it applies smoothly. My daughter and I love them.&lt;br /&gt;Also... arrived on time as expected.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and usually have to use Almay or other products that don&#x27;t irritate. These eyeliners go on really smooth, they blend well and most importantly I have been able to wear all day and they have not irritated my skin or eyes. They sharpen easily without wasting too much pencil. The colors are great and show up well (I have a medium tan skin tone) I am really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Awesome product,came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what it said i was getting  good quality  lip liners.</li>
            <li> I bought the Nabi lip liners and they worked great so I figured the quality of the eyeliners would be the same or a close second. I was wrong. The colors are not what I expected, some are actually the same colors of my lip pencils. The quality was not on point either. They don&#x27;t glide on, feel kind of waxy. Didn&#x27;t work well on my water line either.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of colors provided, it looks great with the mascara I purchased</li>
            <li> Different vibrant colors.. Very smooth</li>
            <li> Good quality and easy to use on eyes and eyebrows. Some of the colors are good for your lips.</li>
            <li> Pros :&lt;br /&gt;The colors are good.&lt;br /&gt;No pigmentation&lt;br /&gt;They stay long enough for 4-5 hours without any touch up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons :&lt;br /&gt;Too many repetitive colors I got 4 browns. 2 whites. 2 blue.2 green. Common ??&lt;br /&gt;Pencil looks fragile&lt;br /&gt;Have to apply 2-3 strokes to get the desired look. Very light colors. Pink does not even look like I have applied it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps. i wont be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> Gave most of these away. Italia is a better brand and shows up much darker.</li>
            <li> The colors are really nice and glides on smooth. You get so many for such a low price. Nice quality too. I defiantly recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and good quality</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s a product of the USA.  It could be a tad bit creamier.  Nice colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a computer. I&#x27;m not a fake costumer. Here is my absolute honest opinion. I love these. I have no complains. The colors are beautiful and stuck all day for me!! I love how they look. I had NO repeat colors! Worth the money. And they got here super fast. I ordered mine Tuesday morning at 12 am or so and got them Thursday morning!!</li>
            <li> Yeah their great and I got them on time. But got Pink eye after using the black pencil once. Will never purchase again.</li>
            <li> First off, I did not receive the colors shown. I got lots of brown, but none of the whites (Which is why I wanted this to begin with). I Received: Khaki, Black, Dark Gold, Hot Blue, Baby Blue, Lime Green (actually a Navy Blue color), Charcoal Grey, Satin Blue, Medium Brown, M. green, Cosmos, Silver, Purple Glitter, Emerald Green, Dark Brown, Gold, Lime, Ocean Blue, Light Brown, Peacock, Charcoal, Taupe, Brown, and Cafe.&lt;br /&gt;It does not say anything in the ad about receiving random colors.&lt;br /&gt;When I applied the eyeliner I had to make multiple passes for it to show up well. I at first thought I was maybe not being firm enough, but it draws on my hand with light application. However 24 pencils for $9 is a nice price, I just wish it was slightly better quality and that they disclose random color assortments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and beautiful on my eyes.Great for lip line</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, cheap material you have too put so many times for you can see the lines. I have to put a start for it can let me write a review bit it doesn&#x27;t deserve none.</li>
            <li> The pencils arrived very quickly and OMG I Love these pencils! 😍 I really love the variety, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because I&#x27;m not sure of pigment. I may be looking for high pigment in products that aren&#x27;t supposed to be high pigment, LOL 😶 The bottom line is I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Came on time, and are very easy to use. I haven&#x27;t used all of them yet. Great for lip liners as well!</li>
            <li> They are completely amazing and so worth it, they go with every skin tone and they are very high pigmented, they also are just like in the picture! FLAWLESS</li>
            <li> Colors are not intense as I hoped they would be.  I am light skin and had to apply this product at least 10 times in order to get the result as other Brand Name pencils WHICH REQUIRES ONE STROKE!!!  Eye skin irritated after so many stokes.  Perhaps I rec&#x27;d a dud!</li>
            <li> Useless i tresh them. :(</li>
            <li> Love these!!!! The colors are true to photo, but without any finishing spray this will not stay on all day!</li>
            <li> although this product is very light ( except for the darker colors) even than i have to apply planty of coats... BUT i love the bulk order and i use them daily. the light blue is by far my favorite out of all of these, and i love Nabi products</li>
            <li> Was not at all what I expected, save time and money. Do not waste money on this! Seriously....</li>
            <li> Great pencils!! Arrived quickly- excellent service would order again!!</li>
            <li> Got It sooner then I thought I would ^^  really enjoying it,  the lighter colors don&#x27;t really show up that well on my skin tone that much (probably because I&#x27;m basically albino) I got some colors that did sorta have a metallic look to them,it seems like it&#x27;ll be good for costumes, I&#x27;ve had it on my arm for a few hours or so and it has faded a bit. despite any bad I enjoy it and I feel like it was a really good price.</li>
            <li> I have found that if you have more inset eyes, putting some of the colors on the top of the eye lid rubs off fairly easily but on the bottom of the eyelid it stays very well ( i feel like its common to put the color at the bottom anyways! So don&#x27;t worry about that, plus it depends on your eyes! I have a heavy crease and this happens with a lot of eyeliners I get, just depends on your eyes). The colors were correct, arrived very quickly and the colors show up vibrantly. Love it! Definitely worth to buy especially because of how many you get for so cheap!</li>
            <li> Feels really heavy, not waterproof at all.</li>
            <li> Nabi has always been wonbderful. I love their &amp;#34;wholesale&amp;#34; options, and that their products live up to EXACTLY what they say. They are long lasting and really easy to apply and very hard to smudge. I recently went to a funeral of a very very dear friend of mine and cried the whole time. The eyeliner didn&#x27;t move, smudge or even whip away. These are so worth it, for yourself or even for professional use. These guys are amazing!</li>
            <li> Love them! They go on very easy and wash off easy too!</li>
            <li> It is nice but it makes my eyelids stick together  every time I blink . Colors are nice and soft otherwise.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed!! I ordered 24 EYE AND BROW LINERS I received 10 eye liners and 14 different shade brown lip liners I will be contacting them to see if they can make it right! I like nabi cosmetics as I already own the whole line of lip liners but this is really disappointing! The price is good but I want what I ordered I could have spent a little extra from a different seller if I knew this would happen. I will post update once I contact them.</li>
            <li> Great buy deff a variety of colors but still like all ew yeliner on me it smudges easily</li>
            <li> Lovely eyeliners!! I love all the colors and the price is reasonable.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Nice price/quantity. The color is nice and there are many colors, I am disappointed with the quality, I need to put the makeup many times and to push on my eyelid until it has the desired color and it kinda irritates my eyelid.</li>
            <li> Received them on time, love the color selection. There were some similar colors but that just means I can share! Beyond worth it for the price. I&#x27;m most excited I got the color cosmos!! I didn&#x27;t think I would but its gonna be my favorite for sure :) love this product already</li>
            <li> I Am In So Love With These Products</li>
            <li> I am Very pleased with my order! Colors are great! Recieved my shipment quick!!! Totally recommended this product and other Nabi products to the make up lovers out there!! The lipsticks i fell inlove with too!</li>
            <li> Color goes on light and alot of them look the same color</li>
            <li> Girls your going to love it</li>
            <li> Good quality eyeliners for a great price, so I definitely can&#x27;t complain about that. This was my second purchase from Nabi Cosmetics, and I liked the lip liners a bit more than the eyeliners. They seemed to go on a bit smoother and last longer. Still, these go on relatively smoothly and last for several hours without needing to be reapplied. The colors are very bold, and overall quite true to the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing worth pointing out is that both of my orders were missing pieces. The lip liners were missing two of the colors listed, and these eyeliners came with a pencil labelled lime green that was actually black (as well as a pink eyeliner that was broken). Not the end of the world, but I&#x27;ve either gotten unlucky twice or they&#x27;re prone to messing up orders. Still, for the price, they&#x27;re worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I really like these :) For the price they are wonderful. I always stick to my basic black pencil, but its nice to be able to switch things up for sooo cheap. Normally I can&#x27;t even buy one eyeliner for this price~</li>
            <li> These pencils were really pigmented except for the gold I couldn&#x27;t get it to transfer color very well but the other pencils were very pigmented and lasted all day</li>
            <li> Cons: Didn&#x27;t get the same colors 50% browns 45% blue/greens. I love &amp;#34;ITALIA&amp;#34; eyeliners better than these ITALIA glides on smooth,opaque and painless! These glide on rough,sharp and transparent so you have to keep gliding and it&#x27;s really painful.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> I received them just in time, no duplicates I&#x27;m so happy with my product I cant wait to start using them. :)</li>
            <li> Well let me start off by saying this shipping was awesomely fast.As the product info says you get 24.I am not pleased with the fact I got two that said lime green when it was a black one which was a repeat.the other fraudulent lime green was some chalky looking blue color.I had repeate on the white one as well as the light brown.so 24 different colors is not what I got it was 18 plus 6 four repeats.I did order the 54 piece lip liner set as well and had about 2 different repeats on color but that was a better ratio compared to this.If I could give no stars I would.Hope this seller contacts me to make this order right because.I do love the lip liners but the eyeliners not at all.</li>
            <li> some of the pencils are creamy but not all. pretty good for the price. alot of beautiful colors! shipping was very fast and the packaging was great.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth. Smudges/wears kinda fast. Colors weren&#x27;t as vibrant as i expected, but still like them. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> Great products. Very easy to apply. Great pigmentation. Will 100% repurchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used Nabi pencils and I am SOLD on them. Being a stylist, we&#x27;re known for our style and every color compliments my skin well. Without irritation or breakouts! Applies smoothly and without flaw!</li>
            <li> Got here pretty fast only about 2 or 3 came repeated but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I received this product and I only received 14 different colors they duplicate almost every color</li>
            <li> Received my order sooner than I expected and was 100% satisfied with the the quality of the liners.</li>
            <li> Love the color easy to apply 😃😃😃</li>
            <li> Excellent product worth the experience</li>
