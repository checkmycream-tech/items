            <li>He says it is one of  the top two of his favorites.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the smell and so do the ladies.</li>
            <li>absolutely love it and would buy again</li>
            <li>i get a lot of compliments when i wear this cologne although not my favorite</li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance ever</li>
            <li>one of my favorite perfumes</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love HM.</li>
            <li>I simply love it and the women will compliment you on it.</li>
            <li>It smells better over time and the scent evolves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong scent however it is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Strong yet airy.</li>
            <li>first time he wore it a saleswoman commented on how nice the fragrance was and asked him for the name.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li>Purchase and enjoy.</li>
            <li>Smells Good, and Soft</li>
            <li>Penguin Original (in a brown bottle).I just found this to be tacky for my taste</li>
            <li>I absolutely love fall and even as an adult I love Halloween.</li>
            <li>I knew it was special.</li>
            <li>Slightly sweet</li>
            <li>good scent and last all day</li>
            <li>too sweet for my taste, but was not bad at all.</li>
            <li>however if somebody like sweet cologne, here is an option</li>
            <li>Well it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>I  just smile and say &amp;#</li>
            <li>The scent you smell when you initially put it on is nice</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy and it seems to last a while.  </li>
            <li>So making a cologne under such a challenging title I gave it a shot...</li>
            <li>When I first put on Halloween Man</li>
            <li>If you are in the search for a long lasting great smell try this cologne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been almost 12 hours since my first application</li>
            <li>the first spray Halloween Man has a smooth, enticing, masculine fragrance that grows even better after the dry down.&lt;br /&gt;~ Mrs. B.</li>
            <li>Only positive thing would be, it&#x27;s cheap, decent for gym use.</li>
            <li>This cologne is amazing, and its smell stays so long ,i really like it, and recommend it to anyone likes strong long lasting cologne.</li>
            <li>I see the similarities to Paco Rabanne 1 Million others have mentioned, mainly at the beginning...</li>
            <li>I was also complimented by multiple women the very first day I wore it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li>If I would have paid $5 more, I would&#x27;ve been a little upset.</li>
            <li>Its earthy and very masculine with out being domineering.</li>
            <li>no local source to test it first.</li>
            <li>I see this as a clubbing or hot date for the younger crowd cologne.</li>
            <li>What I also love about this scent is that it isn&#x27;t that common.  </li>
            <li>There are other scents that I have that are very recognizable.  </li>
            <li>I almost want to give it a poor review so no one else buys it because I want it to be my own.  </li>
            <li>Similar to the highly overrated 1 Million by Paco Rabanne, but it&#x27;s cheaper and the leather and musk that dominate 1Mill take a backseat to amber, vanilla, and cinnamon.  </li>
            <li>It is long lasring and potent and a greta price for such a long lasting cologne.</li>
            <li>i expected some like this i recommended for use diary early or later really when you desire use it,the smell during all day long,spectacular!!</li>
            <li>but as it mixes with your skin and warms up you really can begin to pick out some passionate flavors.</li>
            <li>similar but not as clear.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> similar but not as clear.</li>
            <li> Powerful yet subtle.</li>
            <li> It does smell a little bit like paco rabane One Million but slightly different.</li>
            <li> Although its named Halloween Man and is technically a fall scent, I can see wearing it year round.</li>
            <li> I mean wow.</li>
            <li> It kills any other cologne when it&#x27;s being compared</li>
            <li> Its hard to pick out the final flavours.</li>
            <li> Definately a dark smell.  </li>
            <li> If the color purple were to meet a dark spirit</li>
            <li> You will either love it or hate it.</li>
            <li> Could be a little stronger but no worries.</li>
            <li> It just means females need to get a little closer.</li>
            <li> A little leather in there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not original and has an overhyped name.</li>
            <li> but it does persist for approximately 6-8hrs.</li>
            <li> Since when was that a bad thing?</li>

            <li> Excellent. Smells so good</li>
            <li> I think it smells good.. Females think it smells good. Could be a little stronger but no worries. It just means females need to get a little closer. Since when was that a bad thing? Definately a dark smell.  If the color purple were to meet a dark spirit this is what would come of it. Slightly sweet but nothing about this is overpowering. Purchase and enjoy.</li>
            <li> Similar to the highly overrated 1 Million by Paco Rabanne, but it&#x27;s cheaper and the leather and musk that dominate 1Mill take a backseat to amber, vanilla, and cinnamon.  My signature fragrance and NO ONE wears this stuff around here.  I almost want to give it a poor review so no one else buys it because I want it to be my own.  A great deal.</li>
            <li> I get compliments every time I wear it. It&#x27;s a strong scent however it is not overpowering. It&#x27;s not going to last all day but it does persist for approximately 6-8hrs. or so.</li>
            <li> Great smell... I recommend it ... Good value too..</li>
            <li> good scent and last all day</li>
            <li> This is awesome.You will either love it or hate it.It has several layers that keep coming out as you wear it.It is definitely a fall scent to wear.The pumpkin and cinnamon are prominent with undertones of apple with woodsy tones.</li>
            <li> excellent product... its like One Million</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing I had to get it for my husband</li>
            <li> Oh My! Love this Halloween Man fragrance on my husband. He says it is one of  the top two of his favorites.&lt;br /&gt;The first time he wore it a saleswoman commented on how nice the fragrance was and asked him for the name.&lt;br /&gt;From the first spray Halloween Man has a smooth, enticing, masculine fragrance that grows even better after the dry down.&lt;br /&gt;~ Mrs. B.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good, could not believe how good smells. Not a everyday cologne, but for clubbing is excellent, buy it</li>

            <li> smells like a sweeter version of paco rabbane one million.  absolutely love it and would buy again</li>
            <li> This cologne is awesome I mean wow. The smell is like nothing you have ever experienced. It has a really good amount of range on it and the most surprising thing is that this cologne smells like this and it&#x27;s waaaaayy under a $100 bucks. It kills any other cologne when it&#x27;s being compared I kid you not.</li>
            <li> Smells Good, and Soft</li>
            <li> i get a lot of compliments when i wear this cologne although not my favorite</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance ever</li>
            <li> This cologne is absolutely the best fragrance! Although it is very inexpensive it happens to be one of the best fragrances I have ever purchased for a man. A dear friend of mine wears it and I just had to ask what was he wearing. You can&#x27;t find it in stores!  I looked everywhere and can only find it on Amazon!  I had to buy this for my son.  And his girlfriend loves it as well! I am so happy I found it here! This is a must buy!</li>
            <li> Smells very very similar to 1 Million, yet slightly different. 4.2oz excellent price.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite perfumes</li>
            <li> Great smell. Love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love fall and even as an adult I love Halloween.So making a cologne under such a challenging title I gave it a shot...no local source to test it first.Well it&#x27;s not bad.The apple note note is present to make a fall season essence.A little leather in there.But with all the rest of the overall scent it&#x27;s like a hazy version of Joop Homme...similar but not as clear.It&#x27;s just not original and has an overhyped name.I see this as a clubbing or hot date for the younger crowd cologne.If you&#x27;re looking for a good fall scent that doesn&#x27;t stray from it&#x27;s apple and harvest character? Penguin Original (in a brown bottle).I just found this to be tacky for my taste but someone will like it.</li>
            <li> When I first put on Halloween Man I knew it was special. All the women I&#x27;ve encountered gave me an affectionate compliment like, &amp;#34;Damn! you smell good&amp;#34;. I  just smile and say &amp;#34;That&#x27;s what&#x27;s up!&amp;#34; I got couple of my friends to try HM and they&#x27;ve gotten the same response from women. I love HM. I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> If you are in the search for a long lasting great smell try this cologne. Its priced below its value.</li>
            <li> Not a fan at all. If I would have paid $5 more, I would&#x27;ve been a little upset. Only positive thing would be, it&#x27;s cheap, decent for gym use. However, the women&#x27;s version is AMAZING, if you&#x27;re looking to get your partner a perfume.</li>
            <li> This cologne had a great smell. I simply love it and the women will compliment you on it. I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I gave five stars when smelled this cologne is really amazing!! i expected some like this i recommended for use diary early or later really when you desire use it,the smell during all day long,spectacular!!</li>
            <li> I have been waiting a year for this cologne to debut on the market for men.  This is a manly smelling cologne and it a HUGE bottle at this amazing price.  It&#x27;s a must have for men!</li>
            <li> My fiance and I loves the smell of this cologne. It is long lasring and potent and a greta price for such a long lasting cologne.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cologne. It does smell a little bit like paco rabane One Million but slightly different. I would recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells inexpensive - like a knock off.  Best description - purple jelly beans; you smelly grape(y).</li>
            <li> One Million!!! Same smell.</li>
            <li> I see the similarities to Paco Rabanne 1 Million others have mentioned, mainly at the beginning...but after the dry-down it&#x27;s fairly different.  Overall, I am happy and it seems to last a while.  It&#x27;s been almost 12 hours since my first application and I can still smell it on my skin.  I was also complimented by multiple women the very first day I wore it so that&#x27;s always a plus.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best smelling colognes that I have ever used.  I have quite of a collection and I get complimented everytime I wear this one.  What I also love about this scent is that it isn&#x27;t that common.  There are other scents that I have that are very recognizable.  Sometimes I like to mix them as I like to be different.  No mixing required here.  When people ask me about this scent I tell them and 9 times out of 10 they have never heard of it.</li>
            <li> Perfume excente recommend.&lt;br /&gt;arrived in good condition</li>
            <li> this is the third time I&#x27;ve ordered this, and I get nothing but compliments from women about it. highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I received the Halloween Man today. It truly is a great scent. Its earthy and very masculine with out being domineering. Although its named Halloween Man and is technically a fall scent, I can see wearing it year round. It reminds me of the Creed scents. Powerful yet subtle. Strong yet airy. It smells better over time and the scent evolves. The scent you smell when you initially put it on is nice but as it mixes with your skin and warms up you really can begin to pick out some passionate flavors. It reminds me of leather, herbs, tobacco, amber, ginger, spices. There is not one scent or flavor that is domineering. It truly is an even blend. Its not garish. It&#x27;s like an iron fist in a velvet glove. Its hard to pick out the final flavours. It speaks to me. I love it!! She said it smells like power, sex, money!! Yet its comforting, alluring and welcoming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lady doesn&#x27;t want me to wear it when I&#x27;m not around her.</li>
