            <li>I love the sponges that comes with the set, too.  </li>
            <li>The smell of it is overwhelming and chemically smelling.  </li>
            <li>but Essencell has sent so many helpful tips on the use of the featured brushes and make up application.</li>
            <li>I love everything about it: from the color to the quality of the brushes.  </li>
            <li>I love everything about them.  </li>

            <li>Don&#x27;t love the foam though.</li>
            <li>It has so many options.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I got to try these</li>
            <li>one of the better sets I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li>My friend recommended this set to me, the set includes a foundation brush, and liner brush and more</li>
            <li>And will be ordering some more for my friends as gifts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>also very well made and the case is even very nice.</li>
            <li>brushes are easy to clean without changing the quality of the brush itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, two thumbs up to the seller for giving me a very smooth transaction!</li>
            <li>beautiful and so soft.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this brush set!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are totally worth the price and work amazing.</li>
            <li>I love all the brush and the free sponge is a plus.</li>
            <li>they deliver a flawless finish and I use these over my other brushes now.</li>
            <li>It feels very soft and comfortable, and works very nicely.</li>
            <li>brushes are great for me because I am currently trying new looks with my eye shadow and it has been great for applying and blending the shades I am trying to use.</li>
            <li>, it snaps easily</li>
            <li>they fall apart easily....</li>
            <li>and they make applying all makeup smooth and easy</li>
            <li>It comes with a nice variety of sizes, which I found very helpful being a first-time makeup brush user.  </li>
            <li>And the case is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The ebook that was sent by the seller was great not only did it show me what each brush is used for but it shows me how to properly clean them as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also had a chance to use a couple of the brushes from the original set, and they work just as well as any &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this case.</li>
            <li>I love how high and quality they are and easy to use!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works great with loose or pressed types.</li>
            <li>I got these right away!</li>
            <li>Luckily I have a GF that can help me with that.</li>
            <li>It went away quickly.</li>
            <li>The came packaged individually with more sturdy package on top of the bristles for protection.</li>
            <li>There is a good variety and the case rolls up small enough to fit in my purse, which is great.  </li>
            <li>Very quick delivery, all brushes are very soft overall great first set of brushes</li>
            <li>and they answered my questions and responded promptly to my defaultey brushes and were able to send me new brushes.</li>
            <li>I was able to pack them up with me on my trip to New York</li>
            <li>I love this 12pc professional brush set!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!!</li>
            <li>the 2 beauty blender it came with was really nice and has helped a lot on my daily routine.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it</li>
            <li>was kind of hoping for blue, but hey can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>Brushed are soft , good quality.</li>
            <li>The bag is also soft and easy to store.</li>
            <li>It looks very high ended!</li>
            <li>The brush pouch could be of better quality, the little flap to protect your brushes is very flimsy and I am sure its going to get trashed.  </li>
            <li>what you see is what you get I really like the sponges that were sent!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it to my friends!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>The brushes are good, although some drop a few hairs during use.</li>
            <li>i like very much and fast..</li>
            <li>all of the brushes are super soft!</li>
            <li>they are super soft and not shedding at all.  </li>
            <li>All brushes are super soft and dense, and the bristles didn&#x27;t fall out when applying my makeup and even when cleaning them.</li>
            <li>I really like them</li>
            <li>set really includes all the brushes you will ever need.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shipping is sooooo fast, I ordered on Friday afternoon, and it showed on Sunday.  </li>
            <li>That one really saved this brush set.</li>
            <li>â€¦ These brushes WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to use these the next time I do my makeup!</li>
            <li>I only seem to use only a couple of the eyeshadow brushes out of here right now and love how soft they are</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really bummed, because the brushes were very soft</li>
            <li>The case is very soft and flexible as much as the brushes will go.</li>
            <li>Very soft!  </li>
            <li>they are high quality synthetic brushes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>These brushes are very very soft, the case is sleek and good quality and the sponges are thick and soft.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t wait to use them, they are soft as can be!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the make up world</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone looking for a new set.</li>
            <li>I am VERY upset over that, the pink one however was super soft, and expanded like it should.</li>
            <li>They are so soft!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell for certain what material it is, but it smells like vinyl, which I try to avoid, if at all possible.  </li>
            <li>The only problem so far is that the brush I&#x27;m  using for blush doesn&#x27;t pick up much.  </li>
            <li>The brush really soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes are durable but soft.</li>
            <li>soft texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of the sponge are soft</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves this and has discarded her old set.</li>
            <li>All the rushes feel so soft on your skin.</li>
            <li>The brushes seem sturdy and the bristles are soft.</li>
            <li>she likes them, and says they are soft, and do pick up product.</li>
            <li>They make applying product easy with hardly any fall out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen reviews about an initial smell,  the company emailed me after purchase laying new know how to fix that.  </li>
            <li>These brushes actually feel soft but not too soft like other brushes can be and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I wish they had what each one was for embossed on the handle like the Bare Minerals brushes do for those of us that are not makeup savvy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried 3 of them so far.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I wish there was a nice firm brush that I could use to blend products on my face</li>
            <li>the only complain I have is that at first you will notice a little fall out on the brushes but it will eventually wear off after several use.</li>

            <li> Definitely worth it</li>
            <li> was kind of hoping for blue, but hey can&#x27;t complain.</li>

            <li> It looks very high ended!</li>
            <li> The brush pouch could be of better quality, the little flap to protect your brushes is very flimsy and I am sure its going to get trashed.  </li>
            <li> what you see is what you get I really like the sponges that were sent!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>

            <li> /&gt;The shipping is sooooo fast, I ordered on Friday afternoon, and it showed on Sunday.  </li>
            <li> That one really saved this brush set.</li>
            <li> â€¦ These brushes WOW!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to use these the next time I do my makeup!</li>
            <li> I only seem to use only a couple of the eyeshadow brushes out of here right now and love how soft they are</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really bummed, because the brushes were very soft</li>
            <li> The case is very soft and flexible as much as the brushes will go.</li>
            <li> Very soft!  </li>
            <li> they are high quality synthetic brushes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very very soft, the case is sleek and good quality and the sponges are thick and soft.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to use them, they are soft as can be!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the make up world</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone looking for a new set.</li>
            <li> I am VERY upset over that, the pink one however was super soft, and expanded like it should.</li>
            <li> They are so soft!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell for certain what material it is, but it smells like vinyl, which I try to avoid, if at all possible.  </li>
            <li> The only problem so far is that the brush I&#x27;m  using for blush doesn&#x27;t pick up much.  </li>
            <li> The brush really soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes are durable but soft.</li>
            <li> soft texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of the sponge are soft</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this and has discarded her old set.</li>
            <li> All the rushes feel so soft on your skin.</li>
            <li> The brushes seem sturdy and the bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> she likes them, and says they are soft, and do pick up product.</li>
            <li> They make applying product easy with hardly any fall out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen reviews about an initial smell,  the company emailed me after purchase laying new know how to fix that.  </li>
            <li> These brushes actually feel soft but not too soft like other brushes can be and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I wish they had what each one was for embossed on the handle like the Bare Minerals brushes do for those of us that are not makeup savvy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried 3 of them so far.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish there was a nice firm brush that I could use to blend products on my face</li>
            <li> the only complain I have is that at first you will notice a little fall out on the brushes but it will eventually wear off after several use.</li>
            <li> it was really long.</li>
            <li> Only a few days later, I received a box with the set of replacement brushes in the mail.</li>
            <li> However, there isn&#x27;t anything really special about these brushes, I bought them because I thought the pencil brush was going to be small enough for what I was looking for, and while it was thin</li>
            <li> There is very little shedding with the larger brushes and none with smaller ones.</li>
            <li> Hardly any fallout which is big big plus to</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m really not sure how long they&#x27;ll last for me.</li>
            <li> But, not a whole lot, so I can say that.</li>
            <li> I got a purple and a pink one.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> the other one is a little sturdy.</li>
            <li> the black ones look nicer, however I bought them when they were on sale.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves, do shed a little.</li>
            <li> Already washed and dried them and the quality stayed the same,.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ,  they are now my everyday make-up brushes.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are just a little too stiff.  </li>
            <li> Overall this set did the job for me holding my makeup well into the brushes and besides it came in an expensive looking case as well.</li>
            <li> The purple one was hard, and did not expand what so ever.  </li>
            <li> I have been meaning to buy them, however it has been so pricey lately.</li>
            <li> There was a chemical smell that came from the pouch, but I laid it out for a few days and it&#x27;s not so bad now.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this set!! Great price and quality and it looks good too</li>
            <li> I love these brushes and the blending sponge.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really love this 12pc brush set! I only seem to use only a couple of the eyeshadow brushes out of here right now and love how soft they are and I can apply my eye shadow nicely with them. they are high quality synthetic brushes. they deliver a flawless finish and I use these over my other brushes now. However, I&#x27;m noticing the hairs on my brushes are falling out each I time I use them. So I&#x27;m really not sure how long they&#x27;ll last for me. update* contacted seller and they answered my questions and responded promptly to my defaultey brushes and were able to send me new brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are good, although some drop a few hairs during use. sponges are nice. I like the case, it snaps easily</li>
            <li> This is a perfect make up brush set, I loved using this product. The brush really soft.</li>
            <li> I love this set!! The brushes are durable but soft. No shedding after I cleaned them and the case is gorgeous. The two makeup sponges were the cherry on top!</li>
            <li> Pretty good set for the price!  It comes with a nice variety of sizes, which I found very helpful being a first-time makeup brush user.  -I can try out the various sizes to find the one that works the best for me.  I love the sponges that comes with the set, too.  Nice density and velvety soft texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con for me is the bag/case it comes in.  I can&#x27;t tell for certain what material it is, but it smells like vinyl, which I try to avoid, if at all possible.  The smell of it is overwhelming and chemically smelling.  So I&#x27;ll likely just toss the bag, and put the brushes in a regular makeup bag instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the smell/possible vinyl issue, I&#x27;d recommend trying these!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve receive my make up brushes and what you see is what you get I really like the sponges that were sent! I&#x27;m new to the make up world but Essencell has sent so many helpful tips on the use of the featured brushes and make up application. My only complaint is that I wish there was a nice firm brush that I could use to blend products on my face all of the brushes are super soft! These brushes plus my old brushes gives a great finish!</li>
            <li> The search is over, I found the perfect makeup brush set for me! I love everything about it: from the color to the quality of the brushes.  you can do all the makeup tricks with this brush set even if you&#x27;re not a pro on makeup. I also love that it comes with a very handy bag/case that makes it easier to bring with during travels. brushes are easy to clean without changing the quality of the brush itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, two thumbs up to the seller for giving me a very smooth transaction!</li>
            <li> These are great quality brushes. They make applying product easy with hardly any fall out. They make blending shadows a breeze.</li>
            <li> These are the most incredible brushes.  They are superior quality and absolutely gorgeous.  There is a brush for everything.  And the case is fantastic.  I love everything about them.  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> This has been one of my best buy yet. the brush itself are very smooth and very good quality. The set includes everything you may need for personal use or a s starting makeup artist. I love the blush brush and eyebrow brush the best! The pouch it came with is very elegant with it&#x27;s brown-ish color. the 2 beauty blender it came with was really nice and has helped a lot on my daily routine. I have been meaning to buy them, however it has been so pricey lately. So when I got it together with the set, I was so happy! have been using this set since I got it and the only complain I have is that at first you will notice a little fall out on the brushes but it will eventually wear off after several use. Already washed and dried them and the quality stayed the same,.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product  was received at a discount for my honest and unbiased review</li>
            <li> These brushes actually feel soft but not too soft like other brushes can be and very sturdy. I really like them I was able to pack them up with me on my trip to New York and I was happy that I had all the brushes that I needed and more. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with them shedding at all. I think that this makeup brush set is definitely can be use for  beginners and advance makeup artists. I like the fact that it came with the two sponges as well. One of the sponge are soft the other one is a little sturdy. Overall this set did the job for me holding my makeup well into the brushes and besides it came in an expensive looking case as well. I received this product discounted in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I just received these today. They are amazing I love how high and quality they are and easy to use!!&lt;br /&gt;They are totally worth the price and work amazing.</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery, all brushes are very soft overall great first set of brushes (:</li>
            <li> Beautiful brush set and very nice case. If you include the blender sponges and the case it&#x27;s actually a 15 piece set. The brushes all appear to be good quality. I wish they had what each one was for embossed on the handle like the Bare Minerals brushes do for those of us that are not makeup savvy. Luckily I have a GF that can help me with that. I&#x27;m excited to use these the next time I do my makeup!</li>
            <li> I got these right away! can&#x27;t wait to use them, they are soft as can be!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product I am so happy with this brush, they arrived on time and they are just so beautifulðŸ˜˜</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this brush set! It was a good price for a good variety of brushes, packaged in a great soft carrying case that doesn&#x27;t have the plastic/chemical smell that so many brush sets have; and bonus sponges as well. However, when I pulled the powder brush out of its spot in the case, the brush tip promptly fell off onto the floor! I think the metal wasn&#x27;t stamped together fully, because the bristles basically fell out of it. I&#x27;m really bummed, because the brushes were very soft and I think this would have been the perfect powder brush for blending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED TO ADD: Wow. The same day of my review, I was contacted by Essencell&#x27;s customer service apologizing for the faulty brush, explaining that they are handmade and from time to time there may be human error. They said they were going to send me a replacement set. Only a few days later, I received a box with the set of replacement brushes in the mail. All of the brushes are fully put together, nothing fell apart. Amazing customer service to check up on reviews and take care of a customer&#x27;s concerns, and so promptly, too! I&#x27;ve also had a chance to use a couple of the brushes from the original set, and they work just as well as any &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; brushes I have that cost much, much more. As such, I am raising my review from 2 stars to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this and has discarded her old set. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this 12pc professional brush set! It feels very soft and comfortable, and works very nicely. It looks very high ended! I&#x27;d highly recommend it to my friends!!</li>

            <li> beautiful set and they make applying all makeup smooth and easy</li>
            <li> Nice brushes, nice price!</li>
            <li> Brushes aren&#x27;t good...they fall apart easily.... only plus side are the beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> Overall I like the brushes.  There is a good variety and the case rolls up small enough to fit in my purse, which is great.  I&#x27;ve seen reviews about an initial smell,  the company emailed me after purchase laying new know how to fix that.  It went away quickly. The only problem so far is that the brush I&#x27;m  using for blush doesn&#x27;t pick up much.  Other than that no complaints.</li>

You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like it well enough, some of the bristles get stuck to my face though.</li>
            <li> these brushes are soft to the touch yet strongly made, perfect for beginners to makeup or even professionals. one of the better sets I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had LancÃ´me foundation brush, I paid about $40 for it and I loved it.  But I lost during the summer vacation. My friend recommended this set to me, the set includes a foundation brush, and liner brush and moreâ€¦ These brushes WOW!!! The foundation brush really is as good as the one I had before. All brushes are super soft and dense, and the bristles didn&#x27;t fall out when applying my makeup and even when cleaning them. Another plus, the case is so slim, nice looking.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love these makeup brushes! Highly recommended!! And will be ordering some more for my friends as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping is sooooo fast, I ordered on Friday afternoon, and it showed on Sunday.  Amazon, you are amazing!!</li>
            <li> A great full set. Good quality.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are so soft! The bag is also soft and easy to store. There is very little shedding with the larger brushes and none with smaller ones. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased these, and can&#x27;t say I am too impressed.  The brush pouch could be of better quality, the little flap to protect your brushes is very flimsy and I am sure its going to get trashed.  The brushes themselves, do shed a little. But, not a whole lot, so I can say that. However, there isn&#x27;t anything really special about these brushes, I bought them because I thought the pencil brush was going to be small enough for what I was looking for, and while it was thin it was really long. I have no use for. I got the expresso colored ones. the black ones look nicer, however I bought them when they were on sale. with that being said. The two sponges that come with it..... I got a purple and a pink one. was kind of hoping for blue, but hey can&#x27;t complain. The purple one was hard, and did not expand what so ever.  I ended up tossing it. I am VERY upset over that, the pink one however was super soft, and expanded like it should. That one really saved this brush set. I ended up just giving the brushes to my sister, since I have brushes coming out of brushes! she likes them, and says they are soft, and do pick up product.</li>
