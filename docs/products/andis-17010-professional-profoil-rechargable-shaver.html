            <li>it is great.</li>
            <li>but I am now happy and prefer to use the Profoil vs. shaving with a reg blade razor and cream not to mention the savings from not buying blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>it cut really good but did not hold up battery  </li>
            <li>This is a good shaver for the price.  </li>
            <li>SO I GOT IT GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li>I bought this to shave my head, it works great ,nice shave close/same to the razor ,</li>
            <li>good item for the price up to now.</li>
            <li>havent had any problems use wise.</li>
            <li>THE RAZOR IS GOOD, HOWEVER, I HAVE TO KEEP GOING OVER THE HAIR</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>I think the power and charge is also fairly sufficient given that I use it about 1-2 times a week for about 20 mins each time.</li>
            <li>Product good job andis.</li>
            <li>the weight and shape feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li>Good shaver but no electric shavers shave as close as a razor blade.</li>
            <li>He loved the fact that it did not cause him any razor bumps.  </li>
            <li>good price, cuts close.</li>
            <li>I love it great shaver...</li>
            <li>But this is a great purchase, and I can&#x27;t see why anyone would pay more for an electric razor...</li>
            <li>all the cons, I&#x27;m still very pleased with the results I&#x27;ve gotten.  </li>
            <li>Decided to order product and is very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Their products are superior to the Walh&#x27;s IMO (I do own one Walh - the Detailer) and Andis is made in the USA (the Profoil is made in China).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most important - ALWAYS use the lightest touch because that lets the shaver do the best work.</li>
            <li>This is the best electric shaver I have ever used (and I have tried a &amp;#34;bunch&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>This is a very good shaver that has a great battery life and offers a close shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>they do the trick, they get me real smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda nice to have in the car.  </li>
            <li>Nice shaver.  </li>
            <li>I own Masters, T-Liners, and a Styliner II.</li>
            <li>The pop-up trimmer is a good tool to use in this case because it can do the job of the shaver without as many passes on the chin.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is the best I have ever used, cuts close and straight.</li>
            <li>I own Andis T Outliner and has never had this experience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought rechargeable electric shavers for $15 that are as good or better than this shaver.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s just somewhat popular because it has the Andis name on it.</li>
            <li>Why there are so many good reviews on this shaver?</li>
            <li>it is ok not as good as I thought</li>
            <li>this shaver is good, but not the best out there for daily use in a shop</li>
            <li>This is a great product, the best 44.99 I&#x27;ve spent in sometime.</li>
            <li>This unit is also very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is by far the very best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever purchased (and I&#x27;m 58).  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best shaver we have used.</li>
            <li>Andis by far is the best choice for men with razor bumps or stubble.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is by far the best Ive used with the closest shave.</li>
            <li>price is also fair and its light weight makes it even more amazingly comfortable!</li>
            <li>I first experienced the quality of this shaver at the barber shop.</li>
            <li>Good for the bold head guy.</li>
            <li>Kinda ok, oughta been better, coulda bought something else.  </li>
            <li>I still love the Andis brand just not this shaver.</li>
            <li>and they are the best, battery last up to 3 to 4 days.</li>
            <li>No reason to spend more money for others when you can get this for 25-50% of the \\&quot;name\\&quot; brand razors.</li>
            <li>The shaver has a nice fit in your hand plus gives close shaves holds charge</li>
            <li>AND I THINK HE LIKE BETTER THAN</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this one.</li>
            <li>Also, the factory recommends replacing the cutter blocks and foil every 6 months instead of one year which is what most shavers manufacturers recommend.</li>
            <li>I DID BUMPS EVEN MORE</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband thinking he would shave more often.</li>
            <li>I like Jappan better.</li>
            <li>The Andis 17010 electric razor is ok.  </li>
            <li>I have shaved with razors and used many electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Suoer close shave for sure..</li>
            <li>this is working good for me so far so good</li>
            <li>Kind of light</li>
            <li>The Wahl groomer is much better but the you have to replace the heads too often.</li>
            <li>A better product may be coming soon, I hope.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many many electric razors.</li>
            <li>This one is the top of the top.</li>
            <li>well i use this product about ten or eleven times a day at my barbershop and they are awesome.</li>
            <li>It looks better than a 5star in my opinion and</li>
            <li>(most of that is beard and face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As soon as I get rid of my beard, I will save even more money.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t grown much more than a goatee.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve gotten, but am a bit turned off by the toy like construction/</li>
            <li>Better plastic for the body (like the t-outliners)&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>If the trimmer was more like the T-Outliners</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve gotten, but am a bit turned off by the toy like construction/</li>
            <li>Better plastic for the body (like the t-outliners)&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>If the trimmer was more like the T-Outliners</li>
            <li>My head is now bald and smooth with no bumps!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like a cheap dollar store item with a brand name on it.</li>
            <li>It cuts razor close, and my skin is so smooth with no bumps!</li>
            <li>I always love Adnis product.</li>
            <li>I love the close shave this product gives.</li>
            <li>This is the best shaver in the world , the only shaver that handle&#x27;s ingrow hairs.</li>
            <li>This one gives him a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good shaver, the Wahl bump free cordless super close shaver is the way to go...</li>
            <li>This shaver is very light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>It turned out pretty good.</li>
            <li>This shaver works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Love this strong shaver .</li>
            <li>Leaves, a clean shave will recommend this product to others!</li>
            <li>far it works great,</li>
            <li>Its cheap and works pretty good.</li>
            <li>This is a much more comfortable shave than my T-Outliners.  </li>
            <li>I go through the day just touching my face, because I&#x27;m not used to being shaven so close and my face feeling so smooth.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy this if I had to do it again as it really isn&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he loved it so much</li>
            <li>They shave good at first, but the battery degrades quickly.</li>
            <li>The Andis Profoil shaver is hands down the best product I have used.</li>
            <li>I have used many other clippers that have cost more and these work great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li>Nice product fast delivery</li>
            <li>SO MY BATTLE WITH SHAVING IS IMPORTANT</li>
            <li>IT WAS SMOOTH</li>
            <li>NO BUMPS OR IRRITATION SMOOTH AS BUTTER  </li>
            <li>Use light pressure and keep both foils in contact with your skin.</li>
            <li>This Profoil gets a smooth smooth shave.</li>
            <li>its easy to clean and doesnt spray hair everywhere</li>
            <li>It feels extremely cheap.  </li>
            <li>I went against the grain in order to achieve the silky smooth dome.....</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve learned two important things with electric shavers.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not nearly enough power, the designed look is great.</li>
            <li>Thanks for providing such great service!&lt;br /&gt;Oskie!</li>
            <li>I have had this shaver for one month, so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Not as good as my old Remington Microscreen or even my cheap Braun.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s placement on top right in line with the shavers 2 cutter blocks.</li>
            <li>Just like shaving with a straight edge razor!!!</li>
            <li>My main method of shaving has always been the electric razor and to be honest I was expecting a huge difference with this one, and did not notice one.</li>
            <li>I let it charge for the recommended 16 hours and it was well worth it!</li>
            <li>It is the first electric razor that I have used that cuts you more than the hair.</li>
            <li>Most shavers these days come with many functions that are not necessary and just cost more money.</li>
            <li>If it lasts as long as my Andis hair clippers, my great grandson can update this review.</li>
            <li>If anyone is reading this from Andis: I&#x27;d be willing to pay much more if you made a newer model with some of those changes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If anyone is reading this from Andis: I&#x27;d be willing to pay much more if you made a newer model with some of those changes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This machine shaves hair shorter than any balding clipper (6x0) but not quite as smooth as a full razor</li>
            <li>It gives a clean close shave everytime.  </li>
            <li>I can clean them with running them thru water</li>
            <li>Bought these for my barber as a gift and they work perfect, and his old pair, same brand burned out.</li>
            <li>I used to use the connair clean head</li>
            <li>I get a nice and smooth shave every time, I would buy this Andis 17010 Professional Profoil again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure for many of you, this isn&#x27;t unexpected.  </li>
            <li>although this shaver does not compare the only good feature is that you can run it under the sink to clean it off.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get a clean shave with it as I thought I would, and have been following it up with a Fusion ProGlide with good results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I invested in an Andis quality shaver and not another over-rated Braun that probably would&#x27;ve went out on me for another unknown reason.</li>
            <li>Cuts quickly and cleanly.  </li>
            <li>The shave is way closer than my Braun and the wife loved it, she noticed it instantly!</li>
            <li>Even though it cannot be overcharged as the manual says I need to know when battery is full lest I would disconnect premature that can cause battery deterioration.</li>
            <li>Spend the extra money and get a really good shaver like a Panasonic linear.</li>
            <li>As a word of advice when I purchased the shaver I also put an order for the Cool Care Plus disinfectant spray and additional foils in case the foils break over time.</li>
            <li>I no longer have to go to the barbershop for a full haircut.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, the shaver seems to struggle cleaning up the hairs above my throat.  </li>
            <li>Another disadvantage is that it is an obsolete NiCd battery with memory, about which special care must be taken lest it would die quickly.</li>
            <li>Received it super fast must have to the collection,  I had a five star shaver, but this shaver is way better</li>
            <li>Heard good things abiout this from other African Americans, but there results not so great here.</li>
            <li>i use these every other day and they work great</li>
            <li>and it was great while the blades remained sharp...</li>
            <li>but it did cause mild skin irritation ( note:</li>
            <li>it started to lose its charge relatively quickly to the point where I had to recharge almost every day.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a super close shave this is not it.</li>
            <li>My first time using this shaver I experienced no irritation which has always been a problem for me with other shavers.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little on the light duty side, but does a good job.</li>
            <li>but it is comfortable and looks reasonably good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only used it twice but its working great so far.</li>
            <li>The shave was as smooth as the fusion, yet not quite as smooth as the straight razor (nothing really is though).</li>
            <li>This device isn&#x27;t as powerful as I thought it&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li>This product has become my own personal at-home barber.</li>
            <li>Finally, a product that truly accomplishes this task with spectacular results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s maybe good for getting the big stuff off but doesn&#x27;t shave very close at all.</li>
            <li>So far I love it.</li>
            <li>This is new to me as I&#x27;ve never gotten a super smooth feel after shaving with my T-Outliners.  </li>
            <li>This is new to me as I&#x27;ve never gotten a super smooth feel after shaving with my T-Outliners.  </li>
            <li>As far as this being an all-in one product i have this to not be true, so its good to have a back up plan for hair longer than 2 days growth!</li>
            <li>just right in order for it to work.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get any bumps and they cut just right.</li>
            <li>It cuts real low, quickly and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Waste of $60...not good for course hair, I am Brown w/ very curly hair &amp; need to shave daily for work, this was supposed to eliminate shave bumps, I had to go over My face more times(leading to more irritation) than w/ the safety razor.  </li>
            <li>This product is ok could be better but its about average.</li>
            <li>I have had several different brands over the years, but this is the one I like best so far.</li>
            <li>Battery doesn&#x27;t last long but cuts good!</li>
            <li>The Andis Pro Foil is a flat out more reliable machine than the Wahl, which matters most if you are always in need of a shave or are using this product for professional barber use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are black like I am, you need a bump stopper cream to apply after each shave and your good to go.</li>
            <li>Louder sound when turned on than other shavers, but cheaper than most too.</li>
            <li>It shaves clean and it is powerful enough unlike many other even of famous brands.</li>
            <li>I use it daily for a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li>This is my first foil shaver.  </li>
            <li>This is the first electric razor I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>First(-</li>
            <li>THE FIRST DAY OF USE</li>
            <li>ALSO USED THE FIRST DAY</li>
            <li>First off, I am a Andis fan.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as my husband had hoped.</li>
            <li>Love it especially when on the go...</li>
            <li>Remove the foils and cutter and rinse with hot water.  </li>
            <li>Feeling defeated, i packaged it up better than i received it, and paid the post office charges to mail it back.</li>
            <li>I have since purchased the norelco 7810 shaver from Amazon, and been satisfied every since delivery 5 days later.</li>
            <li>Shaved my head pretty close for the price</li>
            <li>last long like three or more times, not too noise and easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li>On top of that you don&#x27;t need to pass over and over the same spot of your face.</li>
            <li>There are many shavers that back men can use.</li>
            <li>First time I shave with no razor bumps.</li>
            <li>It works pretty close to razor level</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I was only able to use this product 3x.</li>
            <li>This is likely more of a testament to this style of shaver than the product itself.  </li>
            <li>I should mention it is loud and feels really cheap made.</li>
            <li>Most days he has to shave twice if we are going out and now only once.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>This product works ECCELLENT on facial hair  and a super smooth bald scalp...</li>
            <li>its ok I like the  way it hold a charge for a long time but it does cut as close</li>
            <li>For the price its a good way to get your feet wet with foil shavers but unless you have very flat chiseled features and very straight hair it will most likely be hit or miss with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>The foil itself is smaller than the Wahl shaver and the motor does not run as strong.</li>
            <li>The motor, while less powerful, is more consistant and reliable than the Wahl unit.</li>
            <li>but overall this shaver does quite a fine job.</li>
            <li>This product is highly recommended for anybody that is interested in it.</li>
            <li>It feels good in hand and wasn&#x27;t hard to get use too.</li>
            <li>I also had the older model of the profoil, this new model is just as powerful as the Wahl 5 star and now cuts just as close with the micro-screen breaking by week two.  </li>
            <li>The directions say to not apply too much pressure.  </li>
            <li>Really sturdy product.</li>
            <li>some days.&lt;br /&gt;Andis 17010 is very noisy compared to my Braun.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do you replace the whole thing, re[place</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It does shave close and fast.</li>
            <li>My husband uses a fusion cartridge to shave his head and a straight razor to shave his face.</li>
            <li>This one really does what you want it to do.</li>
            <li>very close shave, caused some bumps</li>
            <li>work very well.</li>
            <li>really like my T-Outliners</li>
            <li>really like my T-Outliners</li>
            <li>It shaves me close &amp; does it fast.</li>
            <li>He used this profoil shaver to finish and it left a smooth feel.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t necessary and the best way to avoid irritating your skin.</li>
            <li>He was hoping to be able to use them with out having to shave his beared down first.</li>
            <li>I used other shaving methods (Magic Shave) for the face area but needed a shaver to trim up certain areas.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I started shaving my head over 17yrs ago using a pair of Andis Outliner&#x27;s and then started using the Andis Styliner&#x27;s because of a bigger motor causing the trimmer not to get as hot quick as the Outliner&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>If you are attempting to buy this be aware that there is a new and redesigned version of this shaver that gets five stars.</li>
            <li>so I have nothing to compare it to except other brands and is better than others that I have tried.</li>
            <li>It works decently when plugged in but don&#x27;t expect much life using battery power.</li>
            <li>Never had such a clean shave without any irritation.  </li>
            <li>It is just ok, hard to shave many hairs especially on the neck.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a tool for shaping, but it looks more like a tool for knocking your beard down so the foil trimmer can handle</li>
            <li>Does a better job than some of my previous shavers.  </li>
            <li>this is the main reason that lead me to buy this shaver.</li>
            <li>The shaver left huge patches of hair completely unshaved, mostly on the neck, and at other places it cut too close, even going so far as to cut the skin.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>Having owned Andis hair clippers, i have high regard for their craftsmanship.</li>
            <li>A LITTLE BETTER</li>
            <li>He does say however that the side trimmer is useless and hopes they improve it in the next model, which he most surely will buy!</li>
            <li>My son has been using this since it arrived, but so far he hasn&#x27;t gotten anything approaching a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Thus far I really like it.</li>
            <li>Although this is a nice looking shaver, I can&#x27;t recommend it in the least.</li>
            <li>The extra money is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t cut my hair with a razor, I cut my hair normally with clippers.  </li>
            <li>First day, smooth shave with few patches on my chin irrespective of how even I tried to make my shave.</li>
            <li>and then I would try to shave with a normal blade and would end up with razor bumps and ingrown hairs for weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only had it for about a month and already not cutting as close/low as it did.</li>
            <li>While I am not happy about not receiving the model ordered, the unit works fairly well.</li>
            <li>brand Andis is new to me</li>
            <li>We just received our new shavers and I could not wait to try them out.</li>
            <li>After shaving yesterday, we used the shaver to see if it would catch any of the new stubble.</li>
            <li>So when I was shopping for a new electric shaver (for head and face)</li>
            <li>In closing I will continue on my hunt for a new shaver.</li>
            <li>The new replacement is a joke ,took away the pop up trimmer.</li>
            <li>and I like that you can wet clean this with water as well.</li>
            <li>Overall for the price this worked well to help me determine if my face can adjust to foil shavers, but once i realized I could use foil shavers I quickly moved onto a better, but more expensive, foil shaver that works much better, fully charges in less than an hour and makes a whole lot less noise.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>That flaw is easily worked around by not holding the shaver with the switch-side down while shaving, which comes easy once it&#x27;s used a few times and it becomes habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery life is superior and the battery does not start to die quickly after a few months as the Wahl always seems to (only charging the machine once fully dead).</li>
            <li>From going on Youtube trying to find a better and closer shave without using a razor brings me to the Andis Profoil, this shaver shaves quicker and alot closer than any of the electrical trimmers that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>It operates only when fully charged, plugged or unplugged, like most other cordless shavers.   </li>
            <li>After multiple try&#x27;s i decided to plug into the outlet first, then tape the cord to the razor if needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the fact that I have much more gray hair is effect in the quality of the shave so take my particulars into account when reading this review.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try this Andis one; usually Andis is a better perfessional product in my opinion but not in this one case.</li>
            <li>I just finished using my new Andis 17010 Professional Profoil Rechargable Shaver.</li>
            <li>IM BLACK LIGHT</li>
            <li>Initially the shaver had adequate power and shaved relatively close however after about 8 months</li>
            <li>I would rate this shaver a 4/5 because on certain areas like my chin, you have you use the shaver multiple times to remove the unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>I received my profoil with the hope of reducing the time I took shaving with my shick hydro 5 (the beat razor in excistance) and after a lengthy waiting period I now feel like that 22 year old kid covered in flaky bumpy nightmarish skin this thing is loud and completely stole my mojo and sincr</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 68 yrs old - don&#x27;t think that my testosterone level warrants shaving twice a day.  </li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;m not bothered by loud shavers</li>
            <li>Unless you want to walk around with days old beard in your cheeks, this is not for you.</li>
            <li>) thing I noticed was how loud it is.</li>
            <li>Im an early raiser and the Andis 17010 buzzing would disturb my family that was still a sleep.</li>
            <li>Shaver works well, the trimmer pulls frequently</li>
            <li>so far so good...gives a close shave and battery</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t shave has close has the Wahl but the Wahl isp 7 mounts old and don&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely loud and does not provide a close shave.</li>
            <li>having a busy schedule, i just use my t-liners and use the shaver to get close to the skin.</li>
            <li>It seems nearly everyone has their product made there, but this seems to be a quality product.</li>
            <li>it dont shave completely, leave part of beard and hurt when it cut de beard, its why i dont like it</li>
            <li>I can not understand how they came up with calling it a professional anything.</li>
            <li>Like the design but not heavy duty like the wahl shaver shaper</li>
            <li>I do have to shave with my hair trimmers first if my bearded is to long .Very close shave</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t nearly as irritated.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional barber with over 20 years experience ....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 76 yrs old</li>
            <li>Like others have said I see Andis as a professional brand</li>
            <li>As far as I know I used it correctly.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve use it three times and never have to recharge it.</li>
            <li>After giving myself the standard month to let my skin adjust to the new shaving method the shave still wasn&#x27;t close enough on a consistent basis.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;super smooth\\&quot; feel I&#x27;ve gotten after shaving doesn&#x27;t last all that long either.  </li>
            <li>First(+) Is that it gives the closest shave from the machines I&#x27;ve owned but sadly only if its short stubble.</li>
            <li>Upon further inspection no damage to the shaver was apparent so i decided upon a much needed shave.</li>
            <li>The gain in relability is worth the slight loss of performance this clipper offers in comparison to its competitor.</li>
            <li>Gets really close but doesn&#x27;t stay charged long.</li>
            <li>Not a very good razor....feels and looks cheap..</li>
            <li>I bought this for my barber to get my fades RIGHT DOWN to the skin on my head.</li>
            <li>-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am male with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I hear some people on here talk about the noise, I could care less as long as my shave gets smooth</li>
            <li>On some areas the shave was close and smooth and other areas where my facial hair laid very flat</li>
            <li>Because my facial hair is coarse, all other shavers had difficulty giving a close &amp; clean shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent a lot more in the past for shavers that were disappointments.  </li>
            <li>That is the trimmer is mounted flush with the foil heads and if brought into contact with a soft part of the face, such as a side of the nose, it tends to nick.</li>
            <li>No pulling and only about three minutes for a complete bald shave on face and head.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s only had it for a day, so as far as durability goes, he can&#x27;t comment on it.</li>
            <li>I like this product and have used it for sometime personally and professionally.</li>
            <li>I had the barber shave my head bald down to the skin for the first time.</li>
            <li>First let me say that the sidburn trimmer will really mess up your beard if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>It has high capacity long lasting battery.</li>
            <li>Once again Andis cuts VERY VERY GOOD no pain while cutting just after a few days .If</li>
            <li>The time needed to charge/recharge the battery per the instructions is a bit ridiculous with the types of batteries available now.  </li>
            <li>The charging time from dead to full takes a very long time as well.</li>
            <li>This shaver is simple, does a great job, and has few things to go wrong.  </li>
            <li>To start: I barely have facial hair.  </li>
            <li>It also takes a long time to even get a decent shave, and even then a shave doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Finally, a shaver for black men that really works.</li>
            <li>ingrown hairs are a result of the Skin Tight stuff, this shaver, or both (and don&#x27;t really care).  </li>
            <li>ingrown hairs are a result of the Skin Tight stuff, this shaver, or both (and don&#x27;t really care).  </li>
            <li>My suggestion for those who purchase this: be certain to not apply heavy pressure when shaving.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have bad luck with traditional razor and bump up with the Andis T outliners but this works great for neck, mustache and bottom half of face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, this inexpensive little machine delivers a very close shave with a minimum of passes.  </li>
            <li>While changing directions and holding the machine upside down or at different angles, the shaver always stays running at a consistant power level (the same cannot be said about the Wahl shaver once it gets older and has been charged multiple times).</li>

            <li> but I am now happy and prefer to use the Profoil vs. shaving with a reg blade razor and cream not to mention the savings from not buying blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I bought this to shave my head, it works great ,nice shave close/same to the razor ,</li>
            <li> good item for the price up to now.</li>
            <li> havent had any problems use wise.</li>
            <li> THE RAZOR IS GOOD, HOWEVER, I HAVE TO KEEP GOING OVER THE HAIR</li>
            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> I think the power and charge is also fairly sufficient given that I use it about 1-2 times a week for about 20 mins each time.</li>
            <li> Product good job andis.</li>
            <li> the weight and shape feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li> Good shaver but no electric shavers shave as close as a razor blade.</li>
            <li> He loved the fact that it did not cause him any razor bumps.  </li>
            <li> good price, cuts close.</li>
            <li> I love it great shaver...</li>
            <li> But this is a great purchase, and I can&#x27;t see why anyone would pay more for an electric razor...</li>
            <li> all the cons, I&#x27;m still very pleased with the results I&#x27;ve gotten.  </li>
            <li> Decided to order product and is very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Their products are superior to the Walh&#x27;s IMO (I do own one Walh - the Detailer) and Andis is made in the USA (the Profoil is made in China).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most important - ALWAYS use the lightest touch because that lets the shaver do the best work.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever used (and I have tried a &amp;#34;bunch&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> This is a very good shaver that has a great battery life and offers a close shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they do the trick, they get me real smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda nice to have in the car.  </li>
            <li> Nice shaver.  </li>
            <li> I own Masters, T-Liners, and a Styliner II.</li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer is a good tool to use in this case because it can do the job of the shaver without as many passes on the chin.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is the best I have ever used, cuts close and straight.</li>
            <li> I own Andis T Outliner and has never had this experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought rechargeable electric shavers for $15 that are as good or better than this shaver.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s just somewhat popular because it has the Andis name on it.</li>
            <li> Why there are so many good reviews on this shaver?</li>
            <li> it is ok not as good as I thought</li>
            <li> this shaver is good, but not the best out there for daily use in a shop</li>
            <li> This is a great product, the best 44.99 I&#x27;ve spent in sometime.</li>
            <li> This unit is also very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is by far the very best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever purchased (and I&#x27;m 58).  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaver we have used.</li>
            <li> Andis by far is the best choice for men with razor bumps or stubble.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is by far the best Ive used with the closest shave.</li>
            <li> price is also fair and its light weight makes it even more amazingly comfortable!</li>
            <li> I first experienced the quality of this shaver at the barber shop.</li>
            <li> Good for the bold head guy.</li>
            <li> Kinda ok, oughta been better, coulda bought something else.  </li>
            <li> I still love the Andis brand just not this shaver.</li>
            <li> and they are the best, battery last up to 3 to 4 days.</li>
            <li> No reason to spend more money for others when you can get this for 25-50% of the \\&quot;name\\&quot; brand razors.</li>
            <li> The shaver has a nice fit in your hand plus gives close shaves holds charge</li>
            <li> AND I THINK HE LIKE BETTER THAN</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this one.</li>
            <li> Also, the factory recommends replacing the cutter blocks and foil every 6 months instead of one year which is what most shavers manufacturers recommend.</li>
            <li> I DID BUMPS EVEN MORE</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband thinking he would shave more often.</li>
            <li> I like Jappan better.</li>
            <li> The Andis 17010 electric razor is ok.  </li>
            <li> I have shaved with razors and used many electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Suoer close shave for sure..</li>
            <li> this is working good for me so far so good</li>
            <li> Kind of light</li>
            <li> The Wahl groomer is much better but the you have to replace the heads too often.</li>
            <li> A better product may be coming soon, I hope.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many many electric razors.</li>
            <li> This one is the top of the top.</li>
            <li> well i use this product about ten or eleven times a day at my barbershop and they are awesome.</li>
            <li> It looks better than a 5star in my opinion and</li>
            <li> (most of that is beard and face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As soon as I get rid of my beard, I will save even more money.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t grown much more than a goatee.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve gotten, but am a bit turned off by the toy like construction/</li>
            <li> Better plastic for the body (like the t-outliners)&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> If the trimmer was more like the T-Outliners</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve gotten, but am a bit turned off by the toy like construction/</li>
            <li> Better plastic for the body (like the t-outliners)&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> If the trimmer was more like the T-Outliners</li>
            <li> My head is now bald and smooth with no bumps!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like a cheap dollar store item with a brand name on it.</li>
            <li> It cuts razor close, and my skin is so smooth with no bumps!</li>
            <li> I always love Adnis product.</li>
            <li> I love the close shave this product gives.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver in the world , the only shaver that handle&#x27;s ingrow hairs.</li>
            <li> This one gives him a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good shaver, the Wahl bump free cordless super close shaver is the way to go...</li>
            <li> This shaver is very light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> It turned out pretty good.</li>
            <li> This shaver works pretty good.</li>
            <li> Love this strong shaver .</li>
            <li> Leaves, a clean shave will recommend this product to others!</li>
            <li> far it works great,</li>
            <li> Its cheap and works pretty good.</li>
            <li> This is a much more comfortable shave than my T-Outliners.  </li>
            <li> I go through the day just touching my face, because I&#x27;m not used to being shaven so close and my face feeling so smooth.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this if I had to do it again as it really isn&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loved it so much</li>
            <li> They shave good at first, but the battery degrades quickly.</li>
            <li> The Andis Profoil shaver is hands down the best product I have used.</li>
            <li> I have used many other clippers that have cost more and these work great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li> Nice product fast delivery</li>
            <li> SO MY BATTLE WITH SHAVING IS IMPORTANT</li>
            <li> IT WAS SMOOTH</li>
            <li> NO BUMPS OR IRRITATION SMOOTH AS BUTTER  </li>
            <li> Use light pressure and keep both foils in contact with your skin.</li>
            <li> This Profoil gets a smooth smooth shave.</li>
            <li> its easy to clean and doesnt spray hair everywhere</li>
            <li> It feels extremely cheap.  </li>
            <li> I went against the grain in order to achieve the silky smooth dome.....</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve learned two important things with electric shavers.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not nearly enough power, the designed look is great.</li>
            <li> Thanks for providing such great service!&lt;br /&gt;Oskie!</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for one month, so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Not as good as my old Remington Microscreen or even my cheap Braun.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s placement on top right in line with the shavers 2 cutter blocks.</li>
            <li> Just like shaving with a straight edge razor!!!</li>
            <li> My main method of shaving has always been the electric razor and to be honest I was expecting a huge difference with this one, and did not notice one.</li>
            <li> I let it charge for the recommended 16 hours and it was well worth it!</li>
            <li> It is the first electric razor that I have used that cuts you more than the hair.</li>
            <li> Most shavers these days come with many functions that are not necessary and just cost more money.</li>
            <li> If it lasts as long as my Andis hair clippers, my great grandson can update this review.</li>
            <li> If anyone is reading this from Andis: I&#x27;d be willing to pay much more if you made a newer model with some of those changes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If anyone is reading this from Andis: I&#x27;d be willing to pay much more if you made a newer model with some of those changes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This machine shaves hair shorter than any balding clipper (6x0) but not quite as smooth as a full razor</li>
            <li> It gives a clean close shave everytime.  </li>
            <li> I can clean them with running them thru water</li>
            <li> Bought these for my barber as a gift and they work perfect, and his old pair, same brand burned out.</li>
            <li> I used to use the connair clean head</li>
            <li> I get a nice and smooth shave every time, I would buy this Andis 17010 Professional Profoil again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure for many of you, this isn&#x27;t unexpected.  </li>
            <li> although this shaver does not compare the only good feature is that you can run it under the sink to clean it off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get a clean shave with it as I thought I would, and have been following it up with a Fusion ProGlide with good results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I invested in an Andis quality shaver and not another over-rated Braun that probably would&#x27;ve went out on me for another unknown reason.</li>
            <li> Cuts quickly and cleanly.  </li>
            <li> The shave is way closer than my Braun and the wife loved it, she noticed it instantly!</li>
            <li> Even though it cannot be overcharged as the manual says I need to know when battery is full lest I would disconnect premature that can cause battery deterioration.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra money and get a really good shaver like a Panasonic linear.</li>
            <li> As a word of advice when I purchased the shaver I also put an order for the Cool Care Plus disinfectant spray and additional foils in case the foils break over time.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to go to the barbershop for a full haircut.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be fair, the shaver seems to struggle cleaning up the hairs above my throat.  </li>
            <li> Another disadvantage is that it is an obsolete NiCd battery with memory, about which special care must be taken lest it would die quickly.</li>
            <li> Received it super fast must have to the collection,  I had a five star shaver, but this shaver is way better</li>
            <li> Heard good things abiout this from other African Americans, but there results not so great here.</li>
            <li> i use these every other day and they work great</li>
            <li> and it was great while the blades remained sharp...</li>
            <li> but it did cause mild skin irritation ( note:</li>
            <li> it started to lose its charge relatively quickly to the point where I had to recharge almost every day.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a super close shave this is not it.</li>
            <li> My first time using this shaver I experienced no irritation which has always been a problem for me with other shavers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the light duty side, but does a good job.</li>
            <li> but it is comfortable and looks reasonably good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only used it twice but its working great so far.</li>
            <li> The shave was as smooth as the fusion, yet not quite as smooth as the straight razor (nothing really is though).</li>
            <li> This device isn&#x27;t as powerful as I thought it&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li> This product has become my own personal at-home barber.</li>
            <li> Finally, a product that truly accomplishes this task with spectacular results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s maybe good for getting the big stuff off but doesn&#x27;t shave very close at all.</li>
            <li> So far I love it.</li>
            <li> This is new to me as I&#x27;ve never gotten a super smooth feel after shaving with my T-Outliners.  </li>
            <li> This is new to me as I&#x27;ve never gotten a super smooth feel after shaving with my T-Outliners.  </li>
            <li> As far as this being an all-in one product i have this to not be true, so its good to have a back up plan for hair longer than 2 days growth!</li>
            <li> just right in order for it to work.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get any bumps and they cut just right.</li>
            <li> It cuts real low, quickly and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Waste of $60...not good for course hair, I am Brown w/ very curly hair &amp; need to shave daily for work, this was supposed to eliminate shave bumps, I had to go over My face more times(leading to more irritation) than w/ the safety razor.  </li>
            <li> This product is ok could be better but its about average.</li>
            <li> I have had several different brands over the years, but this is the one I like best so far.</li>
            <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t last long but cuts good!</li>
            <li> The Andis Pro Foil is a flat out more reliable machine than the Wahl, which matters most if you are always in need of a shave or are using this product for professional barber use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are black like I am, you need a bump stopper cream to apply after each shave and your good to go.</li>
            <li> Louder sound when turned on than other shavers, but cheaper than most too.</li>
            <li> It shaves clean and it is powerful enough unlike many other even of famous brands.</li>
            <li> I use it daily for a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This is my first foil shaver.  </li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> First(-</li>
            <li> THE FIRST DAY OF USE</li>
            <li> ALSO USED THE FIRST DAY</li>
            <li> First off, I am a Andis fan.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as my husband had hoped.</li>
            <li> Love it especially when on the go...</li>
            <li> Remove the foils and cutter and rinse with hot water.  </li>
            <li> Feeling defeated, i packaged it up better than i received it, and paid the post office charges to mail it back.</li>
            <li> I have since purchased the norelco 7810 shaver from Amazon, and been satisfied every since delivery 5 days later.</li>
            <li> Shaved my head pretty close for the price</li>
            <li> last long like three or more times, not too noise and easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> On top of that you don&#x27;t need to pass over and over the same spot of your face.</li>
            <li> There are many shavers that back men can use.</li>
            <li> First time I shave with no razor bumps.</li>
            <li> It works pretty close to razor level</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I was only able to use this product 3x.</li>
            <li> This is likely more of a testament to this style of shaver than the product itself.  </li>
            <li> I should mention it is loud and feels really cheap made.</li>
            <li> Most days he has to shave twice if we are going out and now only once.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li> This product works ECCELLENT on facial hair  and a super smooth bald scalp...</li>
            <li> its ok I like the  way it hold a charge for a long time but it does cut as close</li>
            <li> For the price its a good way to get your feet wet with foil shavers but unless you have very flat chiseled features and very straight hair it will most likely be hit or miss with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> The foil itself is smaller than the Wahl shaver and the motor does not run as strong.</li>
            <li> The motor, while less powerful, is more consistant and reliable than the Wahl unit.</li>
            <li> but overall this shaver does quite a fine job.</li>
            <li> This product is highly recommended for anybody that is interested in it.</li>
            <li> It feels good in hand and wasn&#x27;t hard to get use too.</li>
            <li> I also had the older model of the profoil, this new model is just as powerful as the Wahl 5 star and now cuts just as close with the micro-screen breaking by week two.  </li>
            <li> The directions say to not apply too much pressure.  </li>
            <li> Really sturdy product.</li>
            <li> some days.&lt;br /&gt;Andis 17010 is very noisy compared to my Braun.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do you replace the whole thing, re[place</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It does shave close and fast.</li>
            <li> My husband uses a fusion cartridge to shave his head and a straight razor to shave his face.</li>
            <li> This one really does what you want it to do.</li>
            <li> very close shave, caused some bumps</li>
            <li> work very well.</li>
            <li> really like my T-Outliners</li>
            <li> really like my T-Outliners</li>
            <li> It shaves me close &amp; does it fast.</li>
            <li> He used this profoil shaver to finish and it left a smooth feel.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t necessary and the best way to avoid irritating your skin.</li>
            <li> He was hoping to be able to use them with out having to shave his beared down first.</li>
            <li> I used other shaving methods (Magic Shave) for the face area but needed a shaver to trim up certain areas.  </li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> I started shaving my head over 17yrs ago using a pair of Andis Outliner&#x27;s and then started using the Andis Styliner&#x27;s because of a bigger motor causing the trimmer not to get as hot quick as the Outliner&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> If you are attempting to buy this be aware that there is a new and redesigned version of this shaver that gets five stars.</li>
            <li> so I have nothing to compare it to except other brands and is better than others that I have tried.</li>
            <li> It works decently when plugged in but don&#x27;t expect much life using battery power.</li>
            <li> Never had such a clean shave without any irritation.  </li>
            <li> It is just ok, hard to shave many hairs especially on the neck.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a tool for shaping, but it looks more like a tool for knocking your beard down so the foil trimmer can handle</li>
            <li> Does a better job than some of my previous shavers.  </li>
            <li> this is the main reason that lead me to buy this shaver.</li>
            <li> The shaver left huge patches of hair completely unshaved, mostly on the neck, and at other places it cut too close, even going so far as to cut the skin.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Having owned Andis hair clippers, i have high regard for their craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE BETTER</li>
            <li> He does say however that the side trimmer is useless and hopes they improve it in the next model, which he most surely will buy!</li>
            <li> My son has been using this since it arrived, but so far he hasn&#x27;t gotten anything approaching a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Thus far I really like it.</li>
            <li> Although this is a nice looking shaver, I can&#x27;t recommend it in the least.</li>
            <li> The extra money is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t cut my hair with a razor, I cut my hair normally with clippers.  </li>
            <li> First day, smooth shave with few patches on my chin irrespective of how even I tried to make my shave.</li>
            <li> and then I would try to shave with a normal blade and would end up with razor bumps and ingrown hairs for weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only had it for about a month and already not cutting as close/low as it did.</li>
            <li> While I am not happy about not receiving the model ordered, the unit works fairly well.</li>
            <li> brand Andis is new to me</li>
            <li> We just received our new shavers and I could not wait to try them out.</li>
            <li> After shaving yesterday, we used the shaver to see if it would catch any of the new stubble.</li>
            <li> So when I was shopping for a new electric shaver (for head and face)</li>
            <li> In closing I will continue on my hunt for a new shaver.</li>
            <li> The new replacement is a joke ,took away the pop up trimmer.</li>
            <li> and I like that you can wet clean this with water as well.</li>
            <li> Overall for the price this worked well to help me determine if my face can adjust to foil shavers, but once i realized I could use foil shavers I quickly moved onto a better, but more expensive, foil shaver that works much better, fully charges in less than an hour and makes a whole lot less noise.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> That flaw is easily worked around by not holding the shaver with the switch-side down while shaving, which comes easy once it&#x27;s used a few times and it becomes habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery life is superior and the battery does not start to die quickly after a few months as the Wahl always seems to (only charging the machine once fully dead).</li>
            <li> From going on Youtube trying to find a better and closer shave without using a razor brings me to the Andis Profoil, this shaver shaves quicker and alot closer than any of the electrical trimmers that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> It operates only when fully charged, plugged or unplugged, like most other cordless shavers.   </li>
            <li> After multiple try&#x27;s i decided to plug into the outlet first, then tape the cord to the razor if needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the fact that I have much more gray hair is effect in the quality of the shave so take my particulars into account when reading this review.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try this Andis one; usually Andis is a better perfessional product in my opinion but not in this one case.</li>
            <li> I just finished using my new Andis 17010 Professional Profoil Rechargable Shaver.</li>
            <li> IM BLACK LIGHT</li>
            <li> Initially the shaver had adequate power and shaved relatively close however after about 8 months</li>
            <li> I would rate this shaver a 4/5 because on certain areas like my chin, you have you use the shaver multiple times to remove the unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> I received my profoil with the hope of reducing the time I took shaving with my shick hydro 5 (the beat razor in excistance) and after a lengthy waiting period I now feel like that 22 year old kid covered in flaky bumpy nightmarish skin this thing is loud and completely stole my mojo and sincr</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 68 yrs old - don&#x27;t think that my testosterone level warrants shaving twice a day.  </li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m not bothered by loud shavers</li>
            <li> Unless you want to walk around with days old beard in your cheeks, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> ) thing I noticed was how loud it is.</li>
            <li> Im an early raiser and the Andis 17010 buzzing would disturb my family that was still a sleep.</li>
            <li> Shaver works well, the trimmer pulls frequently</li>
            <li> so far so good...gives a close shave and battery</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t shave has close has the Wahl but the Wahl isp 7 mounts old and don&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely loud and does not provide a close shave.</li>
            <li> having a busy schedule, i just use my t-liners and use the shaver to get close to the skin.</li>
            <li> It seems nearly everyone has their product made there, but this seems to be a quality product.</li>
            <li> it dont shave completely, leave part of beard and hurt when it cut de beard, its why i dont like it</li>
            <li> I can not understand how they came up with calling it a professional anything.</li>
            <li> Like the design but not heavy duty like the wahl shaver shaper</li>
            <li> I do have to shave with my hair trimmers first if my bearded is to long .Very close shave</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t nearly as irritated.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional barber with over 20 years experience ....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 76 yrs old</li>
            <li> Like others have said I see Andis as a professional brand</li>
            <li> As far as I know I used it correctly.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve use it three times and never have to recharge it.</li>
            <li> After giving myself the standard month to let my skin adjust to the new shaving method the shave still wasn&#x27;t close enough on a consistent basis.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;super smooth\\&quot; feel I&#x27;ve gotten after shaving doesn&#x27;t last all that long either.  </li>
            <li> First(+) Is that it gives the closest shave from the machines I&#x27;ve owned but sadly only if its short stubble.</li>
            <li> Upon further inspection no damage to the shaver was apparent so i decided upon a much needed shave.</li>
            <li> The gain in relability is worth the slight loss of performance this clipper offers in comparison to its competitor.</li>
            <li> Gets really close but doesn&#x27;t stay charged long.</li>
            <li> Not a very good razor....feels and looks cheap..</li>
            <li> I bought this for my barber to get my fades RIGHT DOWN to the skin on my head.</li>
            <li> -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am male with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I hear some people on here talk about the noise, I could care less as long as my shave gets smooth</li>
            <li> On some areas the shave was close and smooth and other areas where my facial hair laid very flat</li>
            <li> Because my facial hair is coarse, all other shavers had difficulty giving a close &amp; clean shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot more in the past for shavers that were disappointments.  </li>
            <li> That is the trimmer is mounted flush with the foil heads and if brought into contact with a soft part of the face, such as a side of the nose, it tends to nick.</li>
            <li> No pulling and only about three minutes for a complete bald shave on face and head.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s only had it for a day, so as far as durability goes, he can&#x27;t comment on it.</li>
            <li> I like this product and have used it for sometime personally and professionally.</li>
            <li> I had the barber shave my head bald down to the skin for the first time.</li>
            <li> First let me say that the sidburn trimmer will really mess up your beard if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> It has high capacity long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> Once again Andis cuts VERY VERY GOOD no pain while cutting just after a few days .If</li>
            <li> The time needed to charge/recharge the battery per the instructions is a bit ridiculous with the types of batteries available now.  </li>
            <li> The charging time from dead to full takes a very long time as well.</li>
            <li> This shaver is simple, does a great job, and has few things to go wrong.  </li>
            <li> To start: I barely have facial hair.  </li>
            <li> It also takes a long time to even get a decent shave, and even then a shave doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Finally, a shaver for black men that really works.</li>
            <li> ingrown hairs are a result of the Skin Tight stuff, this shaver, or both (and don&#x27;t really care).  </li>
            <li> ingrown hairs are a result of the Skin Tight stuff, this shaver, or both (and don&#x27;t really care).  </li>
            <li> My suggestion for those who purchase this: be certain to not apply heavy pressure when shaving.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have bad luck with traditional razor and bump up with the Andis T outliners but this works great for neck, mustache and bottom half of face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, this inexpensive little machine delivers a very close shave with a minimum of passes.  </li>
            <li> While changing directions and holding the machine upside down or at different angles, the shaver always stays running at a consistant power level (the same cannot be said about the Wahl shaver once it gets older and has been charged multiple times).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used either product, though I have used other products like the B&amp;C Skin Tight when trying to shave with a razor (without success).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used either product, though I have used other products like the B&amp;C Skin Tight when trying to shave with a razor (without success).  </li>
            <li> , the Wahl 5 Star Shaper Shaver cuts better than this shaver when it is new and running well, however after months of heavy use, the Wahl will most likely fail to offer consistant power levels, fail to charge or will require the use of the power chord in order to operate.</li>
            <li> The only thing the foil doesnt last too long.</li>
            <li> Second, the batteries don&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is very wide and not all that sharp, so I was very underwhelmed with the results.</li>
            <li> The next day my head and the back of my neck was covered in dry flaky bumpy madness.</li>
            <li> I bought this this shaver,  but it does&#x27;nt last long and burn skin alot .  </li>
            <li> however the battery does not last as long as advertised.</li>
            <li> the battery does not hold a long enough charge after months of using it.</li>
            <li> The profoil does not cut any hair, long or short.</li>
            <li> On the areas that it did an alright job, the blades were constantly snagging and catching on hairs, leaving it painful even to use.</li>
            <li> It does an ohh-kayy job, but it kinda chews up my face if I&#x27;m not careful and is also pretty poor on the neck.  </li>
            <li> (atleast for me Im only using it to cut the last bit of hair on my head after taking it down low with another clipper)  </li>
            <li> Im a African American male  who has course black hair ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being a black man it is hard finding the right product for your face, especially since our hair is curly.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m too careful with this shaver, and do not apply ENOUGH pressure.  </li>
            <li> I SHAVED WITH A RAZOR FOR A LONG TIME WITH NO ISSUES</li>
            <li> EXCEPT IT TAKES TO LONG</li>
            <li> Has a close shave but not nearly as comforatble as the Braun 7-790cc</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent between 30 dollars and 200 dollars on different razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with an Andis T-Outliner for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> hell again.ll that long either.  </li>
            <li> Overall the Andis works well, but the trimmers don&#x27;t work as well as expected on the mustache area.</li>
            <li> I do not have much facial hair due to nationality.</li>
            <li> We have tried other brands but they pull the hair and do not shave close enough.</li>
            <li> I have used other electric razors such as Braun.  </li>
            <li> And lastly, I feel that the battery could last a little longer between charges.</li>
            <li> battery lasts a very long time after charging..</li>
            <li> I tried shaving dry &amp; wet/ lathered for a comparison...no difference.</li>
            <li> After opening the parcel i noticed the entire bottom of the blister pack had been broken away as if shattered by an intense impact.</li>
            <li> I like this foil clipper - above average quality build.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve run the batteries down completely several times as advised to prolong their life.</li>
            <li> In contrast, this Andis shaver will operate the same as it did on day one months and years down the road.</li>
            <li> As a Black Man with curly hair doing the traditional routine of shaving creme, razor and aftershave did not work well on my skin.</li>
            <li> Currently I only get about four full days of cutting before needing to plug it up.</li>
            <li> He had tried other more expensive electric shavers in the past; they would not shave as close as a razor and irritate his face.</li>
            <li> is holding up as expected.</li>
            <li> After skinning the remaining carcass of the blister pack off, carefully with shears, i attempted to charge the shaver.</li>
            <li> But I have to charge it everyday and the charge only lasts for one shave.</li>
            <li> But after a few days I bumps on my head and the back of my neck..</li>
            <li> The design of it makes it even harder to use.</li>
            <li> I mean it is gotdang loud.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sitting in my bathroom closet useless right now.</li>
            <li> My husband has a heavy beard and several other brands</li>
            <li> Aren&#x27;t quite as sharp as I expected, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Instead of buying new blades and foils every six months as suggested by the manufacturers, get a small tin of lapping compund and rub a small quantity on the foils while it is running.  </li>
            <li> shaves extremely close as predicted.....</li>
            <li> I shave my husband every other day completly bald on face and head with the Andis t-edger because it is the closest cutters we have found.</li>
            <li> I usually forget when I charged it last time.</li>
            <li> but again  i shave my head every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an african-american man, that shaves his head bald every other day.  </li>
            <li> This model comes with only a wall charger &amp; small brush; no pouch.  </li>
            <li> Now i&#x27;ll give them the other three stars when i get my refund.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a closer shave than I&#x27;ve ever had (other than a</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a smoother shave than the other shaver I have.</li>
            <li> The shaver is extremely loud and the pop up trimmer is useless and can actually cut you because of</li>
            <li> Not worth it, just like all other &#x27;foil&#x27; type shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then it became useless and you have to buy a whole other shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding the proper products to shave my face.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I would like.</li>
            <li> After shaving my mustache you can still see all the hairs so its still dark.</li>
            <li> It is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Average Joe</li>
            <li> The only complaint he had is he wished it came with a protective case.  </li>
            <li> The only two things I can say &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; about it if I were forced to say something would be price.</li>
            <li> I wanna start this out by saying I&#x27;m a black male is my late 20&#x27;s and have been shaving for about 10 years.</li>
            <li> AND PEOPLE PUT YOUR REVEIWS DOWN</li>
            <li> CUT HAIR DOWN TO STUBBLE WITH CLIPPERS WASH FACE</li>
            <li> I would say after about 5-7 uses your skin calms down and doesn&#x27;t aggravate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Closest shave besides a liner which Andis also makes.</li>
            <li> Will keep you looking sharp!</li>
            <li> The price was half what a brand name sells for.</li>
            <li> I use this to shave my head and as black man it did not leave razor bumps if used correctly and</li>
            <li> That also assists with the non burning sensation for a day and a half when your done using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product has longer battery life than previous razor and gives closer shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for an electric shaver but as a black man I was concerned about my face bumping up.</li>
            <li> I previously owned a braun 3 series shaver, it was a waste of money and did half the job of this andis shaver.</li>
            <li> I ordered these, I also ordered some B&amp;C Skin Tight.  </li>
            <li> Tight along with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these, I also ordered some B&amp;C Skin Tight.  </li>
            <li> Tight along with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> THEN USE SHAVER PUT A LITTLE LOTION ON FACE</li>
            <li> This shaver cut&#x27;s close with no irritation and little pressure is needed to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> I think it could be a little be cheaper.</li>
            <li> The little pop up trimmer.  </li>
            <li> If you dont then you would get razor bumps after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Bought this foil shaver because I was tired of using hair clippers/trimmers to shave and just not getting a close enough shave.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> It has trouble with my 3-4 day beard growth.</li>
            <li> He has been using this one everyday for a month and loves it.</li>
            <li> However, I did use the razor a few times before I fried it and found it to be too harsh for my face.  </li>
            <li> but ifd you use it everyday</li>
            <li> but you have to keep going over your face a few times.</li>
            <li> continued using the Shaver over the next 2 periods hoping my skin would get used to it, however the bumps became progressive worse and painful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If the battery is dead, you cannot use the shaver.  </li>
            <li> If I could use it with a dead battery by plugging it into the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I could use it with a dead battery by plugging it into the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to its competitor, the Wahl 5 Star Shaper Shaver, the Pro Foil stands up well but does have a few faults.</li>
            <li> Andis should do a complete recall on this worthless professional barbering tool.</li>
            <li> Oddly, I continued to use and found that after about 4 - 5 days, the irritation went away!</li>
            <li> but the foil cover on mine did get a  tear after about 2 months  that can cause scratches on by scalp if i press down to hard when using it.  </li>
            <li> It gives a close shave with very little irritation to my skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this expecting it to replace my Remington shaver, but once I first tried this, I was greatly disappointed.</li>
            <li> no more razor bumps.</li>
            <li> But this machine sadly feel short IMO.</li>
            <li> Not sure ifs it just a fluke occurrence</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of it&#x27;s purpose.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my lack of razor bumps/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my lack of razor bumps/</li>
            <li> no more razor and cuts for me when i&#x27;m shaving in a hurry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If broken, lost or stolen, I&#x27;d probably go try the Wahl or some other brand instead.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If broken, lost or stolen, I&#x27;d probably go try the Wahl or some other brand instead.  </li>
            <li> I started having razor bumps, which started minimally but became worse and painful over the next few days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You had to push to hard to your face</li>
            <li> As barber I&#x27;m really disappointed in this particular Andis item.</li>
            <li> This razor sucks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, if irritation occurs I would recommend continuing to use for at least 4 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have a thick beard it always feels like my hair is being pulled</li>
            <li> I mean, seriously.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious I&#x27;ve tried norelcos 200 dollar electric razor with the 3 heads</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just simply not a good shaver.</li>
            <li> I had to return this razor because I fried the power supply when I plugged it into a 220 V outlet (dumb move on my part).  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is pretty much pathetic.</li>
            <li> am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with this product especially since it was advertised as ANTI-BUMP.</li>
            <li> The first time I ahaved my head was horrible</li>
            <li> Pressing down keeps the shaver from cutting efficiently - and may cause razor burn with any shaver.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> had the Wahl 5 star but got tired of changing the screen every.  </li>
            <li> I used it about three times and  had to press real hard for it to work.</li>
            <li> This product has no real longevity and with time, is just a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Immediately feel the motor dying down after each shave :(</li>
            <li> Oh well... another lousy &amp;#34;Made-in-China&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> The battery life is sad in my opinion.</li>
            <li> bumps.you cant go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> WTF is it supposed to be used for?&lt;br</li>
            <li> wrong.</li>
            <li> The popup trimmer is useless and it&#x27;s time to look for an alternative.</li>
            <li> Just a mustache and very thin goatee.</li>
            <li> This is a very poorly designed shaver.</li>
            <li> It is powerless, I remember reading the reviews and being naive enough to buy this piece of miserable  worthless garbage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black and have a problem with in-grown hairs and after using this I had the worst break out ever in my life.</li>
            <li> It keeps pulling my hairs and cutting my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not Recommend.</li>
            <li> The shaver head that covers  the cutting blades has a hole in it.</li>
            <li> Bad move.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I bought this terrible shaver.</li>
            <li> The Andis 17010 is a peace of crap.</li>
            <li> I have used everything form nasty smelly paste products I have put on my face, to using a razor in which my face would bump up like crazy.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product...</li>
            <li> The worst product Andis has made.</li>
            <li> WORTHLESS!!</li>
            <li> This shaver is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Kinda ok, oughta been better, coulda bought something else.  This is my first foil shaver.  I&#x27;m 68 yrs old - don&#x27;t think that my testosterone level warrants shaving twice a day.  The directions say to not apply too much pressure.  Maybe I&#x27;m too careful with this shaver, and do not apply ENOUGH pressure.  It&#x27;s kinda nice to have in the car.  I&#x27;ll work with it.  tlc</li>
            <li> shaves extremely close as predicted.....If you are black like I am, you need a bump stopper cream to apply after each shave and your good to go. If you dont then you would get razor bumps after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Bought this foil shaver because I was tired of using hair clippers/trimmers to shave and just not getting a close enough shave. So after almost 10 yrs I decided to try a foil shaver again.  The clippers I use are Andis so i trust the brand.  After giving myself the standard month to let my skin adjust to the new shaving method the shave still wasn&#x27;t close enough on a consistent basis.  On some areas the shave was close and smooth and other areas where my facial hair laid very flat it didn&#x27;t shave at all. Also I&#x27;m not bothered by loud shavers but I have to say this was even louder than my clippers!  The time needed to charge/recharge the battery per the instructions is a bit ridiculous with the types of batteries available now.  Overall for the price this worked well to help me determine if my face can adjust to foil shavers, but once i realized I could use foil shavers I quickly moved onto a better, but more expensive, foil shaver that works much better, fully charges in less than an hour and makes a whole lot less noise.  For the price its a good way to get your feet wet with foil shavers but unless you have very flat chiseled features and very straight hair it will most likely be hit or miss with this shaver.  I still love the Andis brand just not this shaver.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver.  Does a better job than some of my previous shavers.  Prefer this unit to the rotary shavers that are gaining popularity.</li>
            <li> These sucked, battery only lasted 5 minutes... I ordered the Whals Profoil  and they are the best, battery last up to 3 to 4 days.</li>
            <li> Husband uses it faithfully</li>
            <li> They work great!!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> it cut really good but did not hold up battery  life  too short</li>
            <li> This is by far the very best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever purchased (and I&#x27;m 58).  Cuts quickly and cleanly.  No reason to spend more money for others when you can get this for 25-50% of the \\&quot;name\\&quot; brand razors.</li>
            <li> Just received my Andis shaver last night! I let it charge for the recommended 16 hours and it was well worth it! My shave time was reduced to about a minute; where as my Braun 5000 series took anywhere from 3-5 minutes. The shave is way closer than my Braun and the wife loved it, she noticed it instantly! I&#x27;m so happy I invested in an Andis quality shaver and not another over-rated Braun that probably would&#x27;ve went out on me for another unknown reason. I recommend this Andis shaver over any Braun.</li>
            <li> This is a good shaver for the price.  It would be excellent except for one flaw, which is mentioned by Dr. Goode in review #2.  That is the trimmer is mounted flush with the foil heads and if brought into contact with a soft part of the face, such as a side of the nose, it tends to nick. That flaw is easily worked around by not holding the shaver with the switch-side down while shaving, which comes easy once it&#x27;s used a few times and it becomes habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this inexpensive little machine delivers a very close shave with a minimum of passes.  I&#x27;ve spent a lot more in the past for shavers that were disappointments.  This one isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I like the shaver it is great. The shaver has a nice fit in your hand plus gives close shaves holds charge</li>
            <li> Nice product fast delivery ***********</li>
            <li> I BROUGHT IT FOR MY HUSBAND AND I THINK HE LIKE BETTER THAN HE LIKE IF HE COULD SLEEP WITH HE WOULD</li>
            <li> This razor sucks. It is the first electric razor that I have used that cuts you more than the hair.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor I have ever owned. I do not have much facial hair due to nationality. Just a mustache and very thin goatee. This seems to work however my only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I would like. After shaving my mustache you can still see all the hairs so its still dark. The charging time from dead to full takes a very long time as well. The trimmer on this does not seem to work at all for me either.</li>
            <li> This thing sounds like a lawn mower.  I mean it is gotdang loud.  It does an ohh-kayy job, but it kinda chews up my face if I&#x27;m not careful and is also pretty poor on the neck.  The trimmer is very wide and not all that sharp, so I was very underwhelmed with the results.</li>
            <li> Only used it twice but its working great so far. I have sensitive skin and have bad luck with traditional razor and bump up with the Andis T outliners but this works great for neck, mustache and bottom half of face.  Finally my shaving problems have been solved!</li>
            <li> While I am not happy about not receiving the model ordered, the unit works fairly well. I ordered the 17010 with trimmer and received a TS-1 without the trim function. In using this TS-1 shaver it does not shave as close as a blade but it is comfortable and looks reasonably good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brand Andis is new to me so I have nothing to compare it to except other brands and is better than others that I have tried. I plan to keep it. I would have preferred to have it manufactured in the USA. As a result of the above comments I have rated this order only 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this one. The price was half what a brand name sells for. It turned out pretty good. I get a close shave and the battery holds a charge for several days before needing recharging. It&#x27;s a little on the light duty side, but does a good job. I don&#x27;t think it would take a drop to the floor though.</li>
            <li> I ordered this expecting it to replace my Remington shaver, but once I first tried this, I was greatly disappointed. The shaver left huge patches of hair completely unshaved, mostly on the neck, and at other places it cut too close, even going so far as to cut the skin. On the areas that it did an alright job, the blades were constantly snagging and catching on hairs, leaving it painful even to use. I&#x27;m sending it back to Amazon. Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> i use these every other day and they work great you cant beat andis quality. Goes well with my Masters and T outliners.</li>
            <li> ITS OKAYY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not work that well for me. It keeps pulling my hairs and cutting my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not Recommend.</li>
            <li> I shave my husband every other day completly bald on face and head with the Andis t-edger because it is the closest cutters we have found. He cannot use a rasor because it gives him rasor bumps. We were at a barber show where this shaver was advertised but they sold out of them before we could get one. We just received our new shavers and I could not wait to try them out. We have tried other brands but they pull the hair and do not shave close enough. After shaving yesterday, we used the shaver to see if it would catch any of the new stubble. WOW!!! We could not believe how well they shaved. All hair is gone as if we had used a razor. No pulling and only about three minutes for a complete bald shave on face and head. This is by far the best shaver we have used. Finally, a shaver for black men that really works.</li>
            <li> This shaver works like a pro!  My husband has a heavy beard and several other brands didn&#x27;t work.  This one gives him a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a shaver that does what it says it does.  My first time using this shaver I experienced no irritation which has always been a problem for me with other shavers.  Andis by far is the best choice for men with razor bumps or stubble.  It gives a clean close shave everytime.  I also like the push up trimmer. An extra added touch.  I HIGHLY recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Really sturdy product. Leaves, a clean shave will recommend this product to others! Thanks for providing such great service!&lt;br /&gt;Oskie!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave close at all. Unless you want to walk around with days old beard in your cheeks, this is not for you. It&#x27;s sitting in my bathroom closet useless right now.</li>
            <li> Most shavers these days come with many functions that are not necessary and just cost more money. This shaver is simple, does a great job, and has few things to go wrong.  Thus far I really like it.</li>
            <li> I love it great shaver...no more razor bumps. I order two just in case they stop making them... So I could have a backup</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shavers I have ever had. It shaves clean and it is powerful enough unlike many other even of famous brands. It has high capacity long lasting battery. When I have to recharge it I usually forget when I charged it last time. However it does not have charge indicator. Even though it cannot be overcharged as the manual says I need to know when battery is full lest I would disconnect premature that can cause battery deterioration. Another disadvantage is that it is an obsolete NiCd battery with memory, about which special care must be taken lest it would die quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever used (and I have tried a &amp;#34;bunch&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> After a couple of months, it needs to be charged almost daily.</li>
            <li> Big fan of  their T-Blade Trimmer and Master Clipper. So when I was shopping for a new electric shaver (for head and face) I immediately gravitated to the Andis brand. But this machine sadly feel short IMO. First(-) thing I noticed was how loud it is. Im an early raiser and the Andis 17010 buzzing would disturb my family that was still a sleep. Secondly(-) was how short the charge lasted and length of time to fully charge it. First(+) Is that it gives the closest shave from the machines I&#x27;ve owned but sadly only if its short stubble. It has trouble with my 3-4 day beard growth. In closing I will continue on my hunt for a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Although this is a nice looking shaver, I can&#x27;t recommend it in the least. The shaver is extremely loud and the pop up trimmer is useless and can actually cut you because of It&#x27;s placement on top right in line with the shavers 2 cutter blocks. It also takes a long time to even get a decent shave, and even then a shave doesn&#x27;t last long. I&#x27;m sorry I bought this terrible shaver. Spend the extra money and get a really good shaver like a Panasonic linear. The extra money is well worth it. Also, the factory recommends replacing the cutter blocks and foil every 6 months instead of one year which is what most shavers manufacturers recommend. This is a very poorly designed shaver. It is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Does the best job out of any I&#x27;ve purchased for my husband.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> LET ME START IM BLACK LIGHT SKINNED AND RAZOR BUMPS MAKE ME LOOK LIKE I GOT A DISEASE ON MY FACE SO MY BATTLE WITH SHAVING IS IMPORTANT I SHAVED WITH A RAZOR FOR A LONG TIME WITH NO ISSUES EXCEPT IT TAKES TO LONG SO I WENT TO WALLY WORLD AND PAID 180 BUCKS FOR A SENSO TOUCH 3D RAZOR AND THE FIRST DAY OF USE IT WAS SMOOTH AS BUTTER THEN THE NEXT DAY ALL MY WORK WITH RAZOR AND NO BUMPS CHANGED OVER NIGHT SO I CALLED THEM THEY  SAID GIVE IT TIME TO ADJUST TO MY FACE I DID BUMPS EVEN MORE CAME SO I SENT IT BACK ON THE 44TH DAY THEY  HAVE MONEY BACK 45 DAY SO I DID SOME RESEARCH AND PEOPLE PUT YOUR REVEIWS DOWN BECAUSE THEY ARE SO HELPFUL TO ME AND OTHERS I THANK YOU  MY RESERACH CAME UP WITH THIS SHAVER SO I GOT IT GOOD PRICE FOR IT ALSO USED THE FIRST DAY THE NEXT DAY NO BUMPS OR IRRITATION SMOOTH AS BUTTER  CUT HAIR DOWN TO STUBBLE WITH CLIPPERS WASH FACE THEN USE SHAVER PUT A LITTLE LOTION ON FACE WHILE SHAVING WORKS A LITTLE BETTER I HOPE THIS HELPS CHANGE SOME LIVES THANK EVERYBODY ON YOU TUBE AND HERE FOR HELPING ME MAKE MY DECISION</li>
            <li> I bought this to shave my head, it works great ,nice shave close/same to the razor , The only thing the foil doesnt last too long. With mine 3 months max but again  i shave my head every other day. Good for the bold head guy.</li>
            <li> Has a close shave but not nearly as comforatble as the Braun 7-790cc Pulsonic.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use the Andis 17010 as a trimmer to replace using a straight-edge razoe some days.&lt;br /&gt;Andis 17010 is very noisy compared to my Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> First off, I am a Andis fan. I own Masters, T-Liners, and a Styliner II. Their products are superior to the Walh&#x27;s IMO (I do own one Walh - the Detailer) and Andis is made in the USA (the Profoil is made in China).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am male with very sensitive skin. The Andis Profoil irritated my skin each use for several days. Oddly, I continued to use and found that after about 4 - 5 days, the irritation went away! I don&#x27;t know if there is some sort of substance on the razor that wore off with use, or if my skin just became acclimated... but I am now happy and prefer to use the Profoil vs. shaving with a reg blade razor and cream not to mention the savings from not buying blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if irritation occurs I would recommend continuing to use for at least 4 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life seems to last about a week before needing to be charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars as I wish was made in US.</li>
            <li> its ok I like the  way it hold a charge for a long time but it does cut as close I have to go over it several times .  I like that  I can clean them with running them thru water</li>
            <li> Bought these for my barber as a gift and they work perfect, and his old pair, same brand burned out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an african-american man, that shaves his head bald every other day.  This shaver is great for that purpose.  I heighly recommend it.  Tip: Use light pressure and keep both foils in contact with your skin.</li>
            <li> Love this strong shaver . Received it super fast must have to the collection,  I had a five star shaver, but this shaver is way better</li>
            <li> Shaver works well, the trimmer pulls frequently</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband thinking he would shave more often. He had tried other more expensive electric shavers in the past; they would not shave as close as a razor and irritate his face. He would return them within a week. He has been using this one everyday for a month and loves it. It actually shaves closer than his razor, which amazes him. He does say however that the side trimmer is useless and hopes they improve it in the next model, which he most surely will buy!</li>
            <li> I bought this this shaver,  but it does&#x27;nt last long and burn skin alot .  I hope this one reduce the price,  I like Jappan better.</li>
            <li> so far so good...gives a close shave and battery is holding up as expected. good item for the price up to now. Louder sound when turned on than other shavers, but cheaper than most too.</li>
            <li> I did not like this razor at all. Did not cut my beard without causing irritation to my face. You had to push to hard to your face and then it still did not work. Very disappointed. Returned it.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as my husband had hoped.</li>
            <li> The Andis 17010 electric razor is ok.  I have used other electric razors such as Braun.  My main method of shaving has always been the electric razor and to be honest I was expecting a huge difference with this one, and did not notice one.</li>
            <li> My son has been using this since it arrived, but so far he hasn&#x27;t gotten anything approaching a clean shave.  I just had to redo his face with a razor, as he is heading to a formal event.  Maybe he will get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> The Andis Profoil shaver is the truth as I have always been an Andis hair care product user thru out the years. I started shaving my head over 17yrs ago using a pair of Andis Outliner&#x27;s and then started using the Andis Styliner&#x27;s because of a bigger motor causing the trimmer not to get as hot quick as the Outliner&#x27;s. From going on Youtube trying to find a better and closer shave without using a razor brings me to the Andis Profoil, this shaver shaves quicker and alot closer than any of the electrical trimmers that I have used in the past. Wish I could have been turned on this shaver over 17yrs ago !!!</li>
            <li> I hope this don&#x27;t turn out to be like the Wahl. This razor work great it doesn&#x27;t shave has close has the Wahl but the Wahl isp 7 mounts old and don&#x27;t work at all this is why I got this one. Hopefully it will make it longer then seven mounts .so far it works great,</li>
            <li> I have shaved with razors and used many electric shaver. This shaver is by far the best Ive used with the closest shave. Product is somewhat noisy though....</li>
            <li> Im a African American male  who has course black hair ...This product works ECCELLENT on facial hair  and a super smooth bald scalp...battery lasts a very long time after charging.. Love it especially when on the go...Average Joe</li>
            <li> The worst product Andis has made. It&#x27;s extremely loud and does not provide a close shave. I immediately sent it back for a refund</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t cut my hair with a razor, I cut my hair normally with clippers.  This is the closest that I&#x27;ve ever gotten my hair.  This unit is also very easy to use.</li>
            <li> There noisy but they do the trick, they get me real smooth.  I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.  I hear some people on here talk about the noise, I could care less as long as my shave gets smooth and I don&#x27;t get any hair bumps I&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li> This shaver works pretty good. havent had any problems use wise. however the battery does not last as long as advertised. the pop-up liner doesnt seem to want to cut well, it seems you have to get the hair in between its blades just right in order for it to work.  having a busy schedule, i just use my t-liners and use the shaver to get close to the skin. I have found this to be the routine that works best for me. As far as this being an all-in one product i have this to not be true, so its good to have a back up plan for hair longer than 2 days growth!</li>
            <li> Really great and truly gets the job done! I would recommend this product to those looking for a great shave</li>
            <li> I previously owned a braun 3 series shaver, it was a waste of money and did half the job of this andis shaver. This shaver cut&#x27;s close with no irritation and little pressure is needed to get a close shave. I use this as a face shaver and for bald fades/tapers. Best bang for the buck, Andis never disappoints.</li>
            <li> I had to return this razor because I fried the power supply when I plugged it into a 220 V outlet (dumb move on my part).  Andis does not ship out the power supply by itself, so I had to return it.  However, I did use the razor a few times before I fried it and found it to be too harsh for my face.  I have used Panasonic and Braun models and was thinking this might help with razor bumps...and it did.  However, it gave me razor burn something fierce.  Maybe I just needed time to adjust, which I won&#x27;t know because I returned the razor.  Oh well...resorted to using a Mach 3 while I am still deployed here in Iraq.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver because I had a severe issue with razor bumps. As a Black Man with curly hair doing the traditional routine of shaving creme, razor and aftershave did not work well on my skin. After consulting with barbers and doing some independent research online I looked into this shaver. For those who have experienced the razor bump/ingrown hair issue I would recommend this shaver to you. I would rate this shaver a 4/5 because on certain areas like my chin, you have you use the shaver multiple times to remove the unwanted hair. The pop-up trimmer is a good tool to use in this case because it can do the job of the shaver without as many passes on the chin. As a word of advice when I purchased the shaver I also put an order for the Cool Care Plus disinfectant spray and additional foils in case the foils break over time. I have had this shaver for one month, so far so good. Also read the instructions that the shaver comes in. Please remember that the shaver is not charged, so you have to do that yourself.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> THE RAZOR IS GOOD, HOWEVER, I HAVE TO KEEP GOING OVER THE HAIR TO GET THE DESIRED CLOSENESS.  tHIS IS THE CASE ON MY FACE AND HEAD.</li>
            <li> I use this to shave my head bald. I&#x27;ve had it for about 1 month and use it once a day. So far so good. Its a close shave and the charge last for about 4 days. I like that i can get replacement blades also. I used to use the connair clean head and it was great while the blades remained sharp...maybe 3 months and then it became useless and you have to buy a whole other shaver. I recommend this. Its cheap and works pretty good.</li>
            <li> I used it about three times and  had to press real hard for it to work. The shaver head that covers  the cutting blades has a hole in it. I cannot use it because it will cut my head, which it did already.  What is your procedure for returns of this item?  Do you replace the whole thing, re[place the shaver head or give a refund?  Please let me know.  Thanks</li>
            <li> The closest and fastest and noisiest shave I have ever had. I was introduced to ANDIS products when I was in Barber College 47 years ago. Their hair clippers were always excellent ( I still have the one I bought in 1963) and when I saw they made a clipper with the Andis name on it I knew I had to have one. I have had several different brands over the years, but this is the one I like best so far. Never mind that it, like everything else anymore, is made in China. It seems nearly everyone has their product made there, but this seems to be a quality product. If it lasts as long as my Andis hair clippers, my great grandson can update this review. It does shave close and fast. It feels good in hand and wasn&#x27;t hard to get use too. The trimmer is the best I have ever used, cuts close and straight. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Some websites state the Andis 17010 (model AS-1) is corded and cordless.  It is not!  It operates only when fully charged, plugged or unplugged, like most other cordless shavers.   I&#x27;m shopping for a corded shaver.    This model comes with only a wall charger &amp; small brush; no pouch.  The trimmer in the retracted position is flush with the foils so it interferes with shaving properly.  It is scratchy and does not shave as close as my Carrera, which will operate with the battery uncharged when plugged into an outlet, as a corded shaver.    The Andis charge lasted six days.  My Carrera will last two weeks!  I THREW THE ANDIS AWAY!    P.S.  Instead of buying new blades and foils every six months as suggested by the manufacturers, get a small tin of lapping compund and rub a small quantity on the foils while it is running.  Remove the foils and cutter and rinse with hot water.  You then will have sharpened blades!</li>
            <li> Having owned Andis hair clippers, i have high regard for their craftsmanship. Upon receiving the paper mailing pouch from UPS, the sack appeared quite distressed upon arrival, as if it were dragged underneath the truck for delivery. After opening the parcel i noticed the entire bottom of the blister pack had been broken away as if shattered by an intense impact. Upon further inspection no damage to the shaver was apparent so i decided upon a much needed shave. After skinning the remaining carcass of the blister pack off, carefully with shears, i attempted to charge the shaver. To my dismay the plug would not stay plugged into the handle of the shaver. After multiple try&#x27;s i decided to plug into the outlet first, then tape the cord to the razor if needed. Just my luck the charger unit wood not adhere to any outlet i had,, it was as if the prongs were  two short. Feeling defeated, i packaged it up better than i received it, and paid the post office charges to mail it back. This was over a month ago, and i&#x27;m still waiting for my refund on my mastercard. I have since purchased the norelco 7810 shaver from Amazon, and been satisfied every since delivery 5 days later. Now boy&#x27;s i give this 2 stars cause they did ship to my address,, and they did admit they received it back. Now i&#x27;ll give them the other three stars when i get my refund. Thank You!</li>
            <li> Best shaver I ever had. No razor bumps</li>
            <li> Shaver does the job….. Shaved my head pretty close for the price</li>
            <li> My husband uses a fusion cartridge to shave his head and a straight razor to shave his face. This Profoil gets a smooth smooth shave. The shave was as smooth as the fusion, yet not quite as smooth as the straight razor (nothing really is though). He loves it. He&#x27;s only had it for a day, so as far as durability goes, he can&#x27;t comment on it. But this is a great purchase, and I can&#x27;t see why anyone would pay more for an electric razor...</li>
            <li> it dont shave completely, leave part of beard and hurt when it cut de beard, its why i dont like it</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery. Works good. But I have to charge it everyday and the charge only lasts for one shave. Immediately feel the motor dying down after each shave :(</li>
            <li> This saver is the business. I use this to shave my head and as black man it did not leave razor bumps if used correctly and this is the main reason that lead me to buy this shaver. It cuts real low, quickly and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I get a nice and smooth shave every time, I would buy this Andis 17010 Professional Profoil again. thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> If you are attempting to buy this be aware that there is a new and redesigned version of this shaver that gets five stars. although this shaver does not compare the only good feature is that you can run it under the sink to clean it off. the battery does not hold a long enough charge after months of using it. this unit cannot be used while charging a big flaw in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Suoer close shave for sure..just noisy.</li>
            <li> does not cut close enough</li>
            <li> Waste of $60...not good for course hair, I am Brown w/ very curly hair &amp; need to shave daily for work, this was supposed to eliminate shave bumps, I had to go over My face more times(leading to more irritation) than w/ the safety razor.  Not worth it, just like all other &#x27;foil&#x27; type shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI I tried shaving dry &amp; wet/ lathered for a comparison...no difference.</li>
            <li> very good shaver, battery last long like three or more times, not too noise and easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> I received this product in a timely fashion and that is why I rated it with a one star...The Andis 17010 is a peace of crap. The profoil does not cut any hair, long or short. I can not understand how they came up with calling it a professional anything. I am very disappointed in this product...Andis should do a complete recall on this worthless professional barbering tool. I should had went with the low rating reviews and not made a purchase. Please do not make the same mistake as I have....WORTHLESS!! If you are looking for a good shaver, the Wahl bump free cordless super close shaver is the way to go...</li>
            <li> Andis 17010 performs as advertised. i got the closest shave ever with this thing but it did cause mild skin irritation ( note: I am an AA male and although I didn&#x27;t suffer razor bumps, it was close). My suggestion for those who purchase this: be certain to not apply heavy pressure when shaving. It isn&#x27;t necessary and the best way to avoid irritating your skin.</li>
            <li> I like this foil clipper - above average quality build.  I think the power and charge is also fairly sufficient given that I use it about 1-2 times a week for about 20 mins each time. its easy to clean and doesnt spray hair everywhere (atleast for me Im only using it to cut the last bit of hair on my head after taking it down low with another clipper)  Not sure ifs it just a fluke occurrence but the foil cover on mine did get a  tear after about 2 months  that can cause scratches on by scalp if i press down to hard when using it.  But the foils are replaceable</li>
            <li> Aren&#x27;t quite as sharp as I expected, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Shave is not as close as I thought it would. Might have to try another brand.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.</li>
            <li> Great anniversary gift for my spouse. He loves it</li>
            <li> this is working good for me so far so good no razor bumps it works as advertise will recommend to any one</li>
            <li> This is the second Andis 17010 shaver I&#x27;ve purchased, and both are the same. They shave good at first, but the battery degrades quickly. I have let the battery charge for 8 hours. Then, I&#x27;ll shave once and when I go to use it the following day, it has no power. Eventually the battery won&#x27;t charge at all even after hours of charging. This product has no real longevity and with time, is just a piece of crap. Oh well... another lousy &amp;#34;Made-in-China&amp;#34; product. I DO NOT recommend this product. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> This device isn&#x27;t as powerful as I thought it&#x27;d be. The battery life is sad in my opinion. It works decently when plugged in but don&#x27;t expect much life using battery power. The trimmer is pretty much pathetic. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this if I had to do it again as it really isn&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li> Like the design but not heavy duty like the wahl shaver shaper</li>
            <li> Kind of light but ifd you use it everyday it may do the trick for you as it does me. The Wahl groomer is much better but the you have to replace the heads too often. A better product may be coming soon, I hope.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver. I don&#x27;t get the razor bumps like I use too. I do have to shave with my hair trimmers first if my bearded is to long .Very close shave but you have to keep going over your face a few times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many many electric razors. This one is the top of the top. I&#x27;ve spent between 30 dollars and 200 dollars on different razors. This one really does what you want it to do. On top of that you don&#x27;t need to pass over and over the same spot of your face. I have very sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve also used a shave butter sometimes if I have the time. That also assists with the non burning sensation for a day and a half when your done using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor doesn&#x27;t take two weeks to a month for your skin to get used to it. I would say after about 5-7 uses your skin calms down and doesn&#x27;t aggravate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Closest shave besides a liner which Andis also makes. I&#x27;m serious I&#x27;ve tried norelcos 200 dollar electric razor with the 3 heads and I have a thick beard it always feels like my hair is being pulled out.&lt;br /&gt;Def try this razor out it won&#x27;t disappoint especially in the price point it&#x27;s in.</li>
            <li> very close shave, caused some bumps</li>
            <li> This shaver works well for me. It gives a close shave with very little irritation to my skin. I have to be careful with the extra sensitive areas of my face but overall this shaver does quite a fine job.</li>
            <li> well i use this product about ten or eleven times a day at my barbershop and they are awesome. work very well.</li>
            <li> This shaver is great. There are many shavers that back men can use. This one works well. First time I shave with no razor bumps.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best one I have ever owned and it also cuts the closes with out shave bumps.you cant go wrong with this. Product good job andis.</li>
            <li> I like this product and have used it for sometime personally and professionally. It looks better than a 5star in my opinion and the weight and shape feels good in your hand. It cuts close and I use this on my and my customers bald heads as well as face and necks. It works pretty close to razor level and I like that you can wet clean this with water as well. The only two things I can say &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; about it if I were forced to say something would be price. I think it could be a little be cheaper. And lastly, I feel that the battery could last a little longer between charges. Currently I only get about four full days of cutting before needing to plug it up. (most of that is beard and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> This Product has saved me money a lot of money every week. I no longer have to go to the barbershop for a full haircut. I just go to get my beard shaved. As soon as I get rid of my beard, I will save even more money. This product has become my own personal at-home barber. I simply LOVE It !!!! It beats using a razor.</li>
            <li> Gets really close but doesn&#x27;t stay charged long.</li>
            <li> First day, smooth shave with few patches on my chin irrespective of how even I tried to make my shave. Within 24 hrs. I started having razor bumps, which started minimally but became worse and painful over the next few days.&lt;br /&gt;I continued using the Shaver over the next 2 periods hoping my skin would get used to it, however the bumps became progressive worse and painful.&lt;br /&gt;I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with this product especially since it was advertised as ANTI-BUMP. I own Andis T Outliner and has never had this experience. I can&#x27;t believe I was only able to use this product 3x. Pls if possible, I want my refund.</li>
            <li> Good shaver but no electric shavers shave as close as a razor blade.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  Never had such a clean shave without any irritation.  Finally, a product that truly accomplishes this task with spectacular results.</li>
            <li> To start: I barely have facial hair.  I can&#x27;t grown much more than a goatee.  I&#x27;ve been shaving with an Andis T-Outliner for as long as I can remember.  Every now and then I would try to shave with a normal blade and would end up with razor bumps and ingrown hairs for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try something different, so my choices were between this Andis model or the similar Wahl.  I went with the Andis based on my experience with the T-Outliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. This is a much more comfortable shave than my T-Outliners.  My skin isn&#x27;t nearly as irritated.  Actually, let me rephrase.  My skin is NOT irritated at all.  I don&#x27;t even realize it&#x27;s shaving me.  I&#x27;m sure for many of you, this isn&#x27;t unexpected.  For me: Mind &#x3D; Blown!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s a closer shave than I&#x27;ve ever had (other than a blade)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I don&#x27;t get razor bumps or 5 billion ingrown hairs afterwards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The little pop up trimmer.  I&#x27;m not sure of it&#x27;s purpose.  I thought it was a tool for shaping, but it looks more like a tool for knocking your beard down so the foil trimmer can handle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It feels extremely cheap.  I bought this assuming it would have the same heft and quality construction of my T-Outliners.  This thing literally feels like a toy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. If the battery is dead, you cannot use the shaver.  It doesn&#x27;t actually run on AC power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Did I mention the wack pop up trimmer?  I mean, seriously.  WTF is it supposed to be used for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all the cons, I&#x27;m still very pleased with the results I&#x27;ve gotten.  This is likely more of a testament to this style of shaver than the product itself.  I&#x27;m a bit upset that I&#x27;ve been bothering with my T-Outliners for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, the shaver seems to struggle cleaning up the hairs above my throat.  I also have to go over some areas multiple times, but its still faster than using my T-Outliners.  The \\&quot;super smooth\\&quot; feel I&#x27;ve gotten after shaving doesn&#x27;t last all that long either.  This is new to me as I&#x27;ve never gotten a super smooth feel after shaving with my T-Outliners.  I don&#x27;t consider it a con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If broken, lost or stolen, I&#x27;d probably go try the Wahl or some other brand instead.  I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve gotten, but am a bit turned off by the toy like construction/feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would get 5 stars if:&lt;br /&gt;1. Better plastic for the body (like the t-outliners)&lt;br /&gt;2. If the trimmer was more like the T-Outliners&lt;br /&gt;3. If there was some type of battery gauge&lt;br /&gt;4. If I could use it with a dead battery by plugging it into the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I really like my T-Outliners if you haven&#x27;t noticed.  If anyone is reading this from Andis: I&#x27;d be willing to pay much more if you made a newer model with some of those changes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure:&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered these, I also ordered some B&amp;C Skin Tight.  I&#x27;d never used either product, though I have used other products like the B&amp;C Skin Tight when trying to shave with a razor (without success).  I&#x27;ve been using the Skin Tight along with this shaver.  I&#x27;m not sure if my lack of razor bumps/ingrown hairs are a result of the Skin Tight stuff, this shaver, or both (and don&#x27;t really care).  Whatever...I will never have to go through ingrown hair hell again.ll that long either.  This is new to me as I&#x27;ve never gotten a super smooth feel after shaving with my T-Outliners.

            <li> I purchased this shaver for my son in college.  He loved the fact that it did not cause him any razor bumps.  In fact, when he does use any disposable razor, he can  definitely tell the difference on his skin.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my brother. He was hoping to be able to use them with out having to shave his beared down first. But he has to otherwise it pulls the hair on his face</li>
            <li> This razor is just as advertised it shaves close with no razor bumps. Just like shaving with a straight edge razor!!!</li>
            <li> Not a very good razor....feels and looks cheap..I don&#x27;t think I would by this razor again. Save yourself the trouble.</li>
            <li> not as close as I thought. I thought it would be a smoother shave than the other shaver I have. Ilike to use on my head also.</li>
            <li> had the Wahl 5 star but got tired of changing the screen every.  I also had the older model of the profoil, this new model is just as powerful as the Wahl 5 star and now cuts just as close with the micro-screen breaking by week two.  My head is now bald and smooth with no bumps!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver on the advice of the reviews. First let me say that the sidburn trimmer will really mess up your beard if you are not careful. Second, the batteries don&#x27;t last long at all. I&#x27;ve run the batteries down completely several times as advised to prolong their life. They have lasted about 9 months. now I have to recharge for every shave. You&#x27;ve got to send the unit back to the factory to replace the batteries. I&#x27;ll not buy another Andis. I&#x27;ve bought rechargeable electric shavers for $15 that are as good or better than this shaver.</li>
            <li> I wanna start this out by saying I&#x27;m a black male is my late 20&#x27;s and have been shaving for about 10 years. About 5 years ago I started shaving my head for the simple fact that I was loosing hair weekly. The first time I ahaved my head was horrible I went against the grain in order to achieve the silky smooth dome.....wrong.The next day my head and the back of my neck was covered in dry flaky bumpy madness. Flash forward to yesterday I received my profoil with the hope of reducing the time I took shaving with my shick hydro 5 (the beat razor in excistance) and after a lengthy waiting period I now feel like that 22 year old kid covered in flaky bumpy nightmarish skin this thing is loud and completely stole my mojo and sincr its used I can&#x27;t return it andis can suck it!!!!</li>
            <li> The Andis 17010 cuts real good things looked real nice after I cut my head and shaved.But after a few days I bumps on my head and the back of my neck.. My 1st time EVER getting bumps on the back and head ... Once again Andis cuts VERY VERY GOOD no pain while cutting just after a few days .If I knew how not to get the bumps like that I would give it a 5 star ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional barber with over 20 years experience .... this shaver is good, but not the best out there for daily use in a shop</li>
            <li> My husband saw this razor where he gets his hair cut. Decided to order product and is very pleased.  Product has longer battery life than previous razor and gives closer shave.  The only complaint he had is he wished it came with a protective case.  Will definitely recommend product to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 76 yrs old and I&#x27;ve used this shaver for about 6 months. Because my facial hair is coarse, all other shavers had difficulty giving a close &amp; clean shave. The Andis is great! It shaves me close &amp; does it fast. But I&#x27;ve learned two important things with electric shavers. I prep my face with Williams Lectric Shave because it helps lubricate my skin. Most important - ALWAYS use the lightest touch because that lets the shaver do the best work. Pressing down keeps the shaver from cutting efficiently - and may cause razor burn with any shaver.</li>
            <li> This product is ok could be better but its about average. I have been using it for about a month.</li>
            <li> Only had it for about a month and already not cutting as close/low as it did. I have to use another machine to finish shaving my head</li>
            <li> Love it. It works like a charm.  This product is highly recommended for anybody that is interested in it. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> It is powerless, I remember reading the reviews and being naive enough to buy this piece of miserable  worthless garbage.</li>
            <li> if you want to feel like toy shaved your head with a razor, use this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;its price is also fair and its light weight makes it even more amazingly comfortable!</li>
            <li> I just finished using my new Andis 17010 Professional Profoil Rechargable Shaver. I purposely grew 7 days of stubble on my scalp and face. I shaved both and got a smoother shave than I do with the razors I&#x27;ve been using. I think I&#x27;ll be saving a lot of money not having to buy razors once a month.</li>
            <li> Heard good things abiout this from other African Americans, but there results not so great here. I don&#x27;t get a clean shave with it as I thought I would, and have been following it up with a Fusion ProGlide with good results.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for well over a year.  Initially the shaver had adequate power and shaved relatively close however after about 8 months it started to lose its charge relatively quickly to the point where I had to recharge almost every day.  If you are looking for a super close shave this is not it. The popup trimmer is useless and it&#x27;s time to look for an alternative. Like others have said I see Andis as a professional brand however they missed the boat on this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for an electric shaver but as a black man I was concerned about my face bumping up. My barber used a Wahl 5 Star shaver on me a couple of times a couple of years ago and I didn&#x27;t get bumps. But, instead of buying that model on Amazon, I made an impulse buy of another Wahl model. Bad move. So I put the Wahl model on my Amazon Wishlist but decided to purchase this shaver based on a YouTube video comparing the Andis to the Wahl... You can guess the rest... I&#x27;m not sure if the fact that I have much more gray hair is effect in the quality of the shave so take my particulars into account when reading this review.</li>
            <li> It is just ok, hard to shave many hairs especially on the neck.</li>
            <li> I have used many other clippers that have cost more and these work great.  I don&#x27;t get any bumps and they cut just right.</li>
            <li> I purchased this rechargeable shaver specifically to shave my head. I first experienced the quality of this shaver at the barber shop. I had the barber shave my head bald down to the skin for the first time. He used this profoil shaver to finish and it left a smooth feel. I use it daily for a clean smooth shave. I have purchased two of these. Onne for me and for my father.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just simply not a good shaver. Not as good as my old Remington Microscreen or even my cheap Braun. It&#x27;s maybe good for getting the big stuff off but doesn&#x27;t shave very close at all. The design of it makes it even harder to use. I guess it&#x27;s just somewhat popular because it has the Andis name on it. Why there are so many good reviews on this shaver? I should mention it is loud and feels really cheap made. It&#x27;s kind of like a cheap dollar store item with a brand name on it.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I have ever used, would of been 5 stars if it would have come with one more row of blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it about 3 weeks but it shaves close. The battery last about a week without charging. So far I love it.</li>
            <li> My husband said best shaver he has ever had.  Most days he has to shave twice if we are going out and now only once.  So great we bought him another one.  5 stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding the proper products to shave my face. I have used everything form nasty smelly paste products I have put on my face, to using a razor in which my face would bump up like crazy. I did find a product Andis clippers T- outliner that I used for years that gave me fewer ingrown hairs and bumps, but it never got as close as I wanted and always had a five o&#x27;clock shadown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a black man it is hard finding the right product for your face, especially since our hair is curly. The Andis Profoil shaver is hands down the best product I have used. It cuts razor close, and my skin is so smooth with no bumps! I go through the day just touching my face, because I&#x27;m not used to being shaven so close and my face feeling so smooth. This is a great product, the best 44.99 I&#x27;ve spent in sometime.</li>
            <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t last long but cuts good!</li>
            <li> This is a very good shaver that has a great battery life and offers a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This machine shaves hair shorter than any balding clipper (6x0) but not quite as smooth as a full razor shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to its competitor, the Wahl 5 Star Shaper Shaver, the Pro Foil stands up well but does have a few faults. The foil itself is smaller than the Wahl shaver and the motor does not run as strong. It will take longer to shave with this shaver in comparison to the Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However there are some upsides to this shaver, one of them being crutial to why I recommend the Andis to the Wahl. The battery life is superior and the battery does not start to die quickly after a few months as the Wahl always seems to (only charging the machine once fully dead). The motor, while less powerful, is more consistant and reliable than the Wahl unit. While changing directions and holding the machine upside down or at different angles, the shaver always stays running at a consistant power level (the same cannot be said about the Wahl shaver once it gets older and has been charged multiple times). The Andis Pro Foil is a flat out more reliable machine than the Wahl, which matters most if you are always in need of a shave or are using this product for professional barber use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will again bluntly state, the Wahl 5 Star Shaper Shaver cuts better than this shaver when it is new and running well, however after months of heavy use, the Wahl will most likely fail to offer consistant power levels, fail to charge or will require the use of the power chord in order to operate. In contrast, this Andis shaver will operate the same as it did on day one months and years down the road. The gain in relability is worth the slight loss of performance this clipper offers in comparison to its competitor.</li>
            <li> This shaver is terrible. I&#x27;m black and have a problem with in-grown hairs and after using this I had the worst break out ever in my life. As far as I know I used it correctly. I suggest getting the wahl 5 star shaver instead, I&#x27;ve been using that recently and have had no problems, it&#x27;s wider and seems to be sharper than the andis.</li>
            <li> I used other shaving methods (Magic Shave) for the face area but needed a shaver to trim up certain areas.  Overall the Andis works well, but the trimmers don&#x27;t work as well as expected on the mustache area.</li>
            <li> I always love Adnis product. This shaver is very light and easy to handle. So far I&#x27;ve use it three times and never have to recharge it. I love the close shave this product gives.</li>
            <li> it is ok not as good as I thought</li>
            <li> Great product. I bought this for my barber to get my fades RIGHT DOWN to the skin on my head. Will keep you looking sharp! Only reason this didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because I feel like the charge on the unit could last longer.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver in the world , the only shaver that handle&#x27;s ingrow hairs. Guest what they discontinued it . The new replacement is a joke ,took away the pop up trimmer. Which actually helps with the ingrow hairs, The marketing (Department) didn&#x27;t handle  , I found about this shaver from a Barber not advertistment .</li>
            <li> As barber I&#x27;m really disappointed in this particular Andis item. There&#x27;s not nearly enough power, the designed look is great. I had the Wahl counterpart but broke it so I decided to try this Andis one; usually Andis is a better perfessional product in my opinion but not in this one case.</li>
            <li> good price, cuts close. no more razor and cuts for me when i&#x27;m shaving in a hurry. my barber uses there for the bald fades/tapers. i use them for my facial hair. legit..</li>
            <li> Perfect!!!  Item arrived as scheduled.  Well packaged.  Exactly as pictured.  I bought this for my husband and he loved it so much, he is now ordering one for his dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
