    <ol>
            <li>They all claim to be the \\&quot;best acne product\\&quot; ever.</li>
            <li>I needed a product that I could use from time to time and this was perfect.</li>
            <li>and I am very impressed with the coverage and the finish!</li>
            <li>that great considering it is superposed to be for guys.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Zit camo is a great solution.</li>
            <li>Applies easily and perfectly hides the unwanted zit or blemish.  </li>
            <li>Overdoing it does not produce good results.</li>
            <li>So far no friend of mine or family member has noticed I have it on so excellent product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, does the job, and was cheap</li>
            <li>And the great thing is that it does exactly that.</li>
            <li>change the screen print on the top.  </li>
            <li>The more vain you are the better this product is.</li>
            <li>Love the name zit camouflage.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention the site is hilarious.</li>
            <li>Now I wish I had more pimples</li>
            <li>so I can use more of it.</li>
            <li>It will change your life for the better.</li>
            <li>Initially, I was worried, because the tone I chose (Amber Ale) seemed to be way lighter than my skin tone, but after massaging it gently into the surrounding area, it blended perfectly and it was as if my pimples and redness magically disappeared.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been fine for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>While traveling for work i got a huge pimple on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>Granted, I don&#x27;t have a daily need for it, but it does a great job of coming to the rescue when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have light to medium brown skin tone, this does not blend into my color</li>
            <li>Fast and effective.</li>
            <li>Awesome product needed it for a hot date and was able to make it through the date without her staring at my little friend on my forehead</li>
            <li>great coverage and product lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>I spin the top off, lightly tap the product with one finger (usually the ring finger), gently dab the beautiful area on my stunning visage, then pat around the area to blend the product.</li>
            <li>even the medium shade is SUPER light.</li>
            <li>You will take a full year to use this all.</li>
            <li>Okay I gave this 2 stars because I guess it can do the job for some certain people that are lucky to match the color of this</li>
            <li>luckily i had packed the zit came in my bag</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m lucky in that my pimples form on the &amp;#34;T Zone&amp;#34; which is on my chin and sideburn area so it blends pretty well specially when I start getting a 5&#x27;oclock shadow.  </li>
            <li>I have to say, this stuff is nothing short of amazing.  </li>
            <li>I got amber ale, and it seems to be a good shade for me, though its possible the next lightest would work better</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it is definitely worth the buy if either selections match your complexion.</li>
            <li>No, seriously - this is a fantastic product that does EXACTLY what it purports to do, a rarity in this day and age.</li>
            <li>I am a very light skinned person and even with the darkest shade it makes your face look white, and as it oxidizes in the sun, orange.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not the solution for acne for me, I&#x27;d much prefer to clear my face, but its a really good product to use until that happens.  </li>
            <li>Still, it blends in pretty well when I spread it out.  </li>
            <li>Similar price point and definitely satisfied with the switch.</li>
            <li>is to develop more shades especially for &amp;#34;MINORITY MEN.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>This will actually make you break out more in places you use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found a better product that simply gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Folks, this is the real deal - give this product a chance!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use as much as the individual in the YouTube video on their... interesting... website.</li>
            <li>ordered the Amber Ale, and the photos accurately reflect the actual product color.  </li>
            <li>; Really?  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s important to not only have a marketable body but a marketable face too.  </li>
            <li>Several have mentioned that it&#x27;s too light.  </li>
            <li>Im light skinned and got amber ale, wayyyyyy to white.</li>
            <li>And real stuff for your face.</li>
            <li>but honestly, I think it will last me my entire life.</li>
            <li>I will probably be able to hand this down to my children and their children&#x27;s children.</li>
            <li>I scanned the ingredients quickly and all I can say is looking at this vs. the back of one of my wife&#x27;s tubes of concealer</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was worried at first that I&#x27;d fly through it based on how small the containers look, but you only need a little bit to cover up one spot that this container is going to last me a good long time.  </li>
            <li>If you have severe acne it may be pretty noticeable if you use it, but for a few spots I think it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m debating whether or not I want to potentially waste $15 more trying out the darkest shade.</li>
            <li>If I do, I&#x27;ll write a new review.</li>
            <li>I really like it, works very well, and isn&#x27;t extremely obvious when blended correctly.</li>
            <li>for color - I&#x27;m a pretty fair-skinned individual</li>
            <li>makes it obvious this stuff isn&#x27;t focused on having too many chemicals or other</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super thick or cake-y, doesn&#x27;t smell perfume-y, and blended great with my skin color.  </li>
            <li>Got  mine in Pale Ale shade and it covers my blemishes just fine.</li>
            <li>, just needs to be minority sensitive.  </li>
            <li>It feels and looks so natural</li>
            <li>BUT NEVER let your girlfriend, wife, sister or any woman do it because they will make you look like  a Drag Queen for fun</li>
            <li>Another nice part is that it didn&#x27;t make my breakout worse like my wife&#x27;s stuff does.  </li>
            <li>Put it on tiny pimples, or leftover marks from previous pimples and they pretty much go away.  </li>
            <li>hard for me to even say if the product is any good or not because it is SO obvious when I use it due to the shade.</li>
            <li>But this product offers a simple solution: hide your pimples.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I made a nice shape in the Medium Lager one, so I&#x27;d rather not return that one. :|</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get zits that often, but when I do they&#x27;re pretty nasty, so I love that I can easily carry the case with me without being questioned by others.</li>
            <li>I hardly use any with each application - I literally carefully touch a tiny part of my finger to the corner of the tray and it&#x27;s more than enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amber Ale worked well with my... generally southeast Asian skin tone.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon Prime, I got this little guy in record time.</li>

            <li> Thanks to Amazon Prime, I got this little guy in record time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t claim to have any magical healing power like the crap you see on TV, and doesn&#x27;t have some wacky overload of ingredients like women&#x27;s products, and costs half as much for something that lasts 3x as long as one of my wife&#x27;s little tubes of concealer.</li>
            <li> If I put it on a big pimple, it won&#x27;t completely hide it, but it definitely lessens the red mark and makes it less obvious.  </li>
            <li> Only used it a handful of times, but I gotta believe that the canister will last a LONG time.</li>
            <li> One container would last an extremely long time.  </li>
            <li> Like the other reviews just a little goes really far.</li>
            <li> Wow - yes it&#x27;s a small container</li>
            <li> but it is still not worth it, especially at the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll get rid of your zits faster than normal ( at least it did for me).</li>
            <li> Product is only getting half the rating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using my wife&#x27;s concealer occasionally, which was fine but never quite matched my skin tone and was always too thick or powdery, or covered the breakout up but made it worse at the same time because of whatever crap is in it (oils, chemicals, magical lady stuff...who</li>
            <li> This little jar should last you a while.  </li>
            <li> based the one I bought on colors the actual product images (not those little color boxes) and</li>
            <li> The item is very small but the contents inside is very thick and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> and I had interviews scheduled in the next few days.</li>
            <li> It is very heavy and it is apparent that you are wearing it when you do use it which is not exactly</li>
            <li> but I can say that a little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> Another benefit is that a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get a ton of zits anymore, but I will get the occasional freak breakout or random big, red one on my cheek.  </li>
            <li> Good for those nasty little guys but also don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> The container may seem small, but trust me, a little goes a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just keep it black - or at least get a classy, higher-end-looking logo (NOT with that phrase) and print it subtly on the case.  </li>
            <li> I deal with clients everyday in the Fitness industry</li>
            <li> a waste of money.</li>

            <li> , I&#x27;m really pale.  </li>
            <li> Not really sure how often you would need to reapply, but the longest I&#x27;ve needed it for is a few hours</li>
            <li> complaint:</li>
            <li> I hate taking medicine and its really expensive, but with this there are no meds and its cheap.</li>
            <li> Or, at the very least, it will restore your confidence.</li>
            <li> (My poor $15...</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago, I was desperately trying to find some sort of concealing product, as I was breaking out</li>

            <li> &amp;#34;They Hate Pimples?&amp;#34</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the shades this comes with are pathetic.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great coverage and product lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Amber Ale worked well with my... generally southeast Asian skin tone. Medium Lager did not. Unfortunately I made a nice shape in the Medium Lager one, so I&#x27;d rather not return that one. :| (My poor $15...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use as much as the individual in the YouTube video on their... interesting... website. I spin the top off, lightly tap the product with one finger (usually the ring finger), gently dab the beautiful area on my stunning visage, then pat around the area to blend the product. Overdoing it does not produce good results.</li>
            <li> Works well, no miracles, but it definitely helps.  If I put it on a big pimple, it won&#x27;t completely hide it, but it definitely lessens the red mark and makes it less obvious.  Put it on tiny pimples, or leftover marks from previous pimples and they pretty much go away.  Not really sure how often you would need to reapply, but the longest I&#x27;ve needed it for is a few hours and it&#x27;s been fine for that purpose.  I got amber ale, and it seems to be a good shade for me, though its possible the next lightest would work better, I&#x27;m really pale.  If you have severe acne it may be pretty noticeable if you use it, but for a few spots I think it&#x27;s fine.  It&#x27;s definitely not the solution for acne for me, I&#x27;d much prefer to clear my face, but its a really good product to use until that happens.  Wish I had tried it sooner</li>
            <li> Wow - yes it&#x27;s a small container but honestly, I think it will last me my entire life. No joke. I will probably be able to hand this down to my children and their children&#x27;s children. Granted, I don&#x27;t have a daily need for it, but it does a great job of coming to the rescue when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for color - I&#x27;m a pretty fair-skinned individual and I bought the Amber Ale color, and I think I would have chosen darker could I choose again. Still, it blends in pretty well when I spread it out.  I hardly use any with each application - I literally carefully touch a tiny part of my finger to the corner of the tray and it&#x27;s more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One complaint: change the screen print on the top.  &amp;#34;They Hate Pimples?&amp;#34; Really?  I don&#x27;t even know what that means.  Who are &amp;#34;they?&amp;#34;  Just keep it black - or at least get a classy, higher-end-looking logo (NOT with that phrase) and print it subtly on the case.  Then I might actually tell people about it rather than hiding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product - they just missed the mark a bit on the name.</li>
            <li> Kinda awkward name but it works. Like the other reviews just a little goes really far. You will take a full year to use this all. Good for those nasty little guys but also don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> Awesome product needed it for a hot date and was able to make it through the date without her staring at my little friend on my forehead</li>
            <li> Was using a similar product by JPG for the last two years and found this as an alternative. Similar price point and definitely satisfied with the switch.</li>
            <li> This product has saved me from being embarrassed with my scarring.  I deal with clients everyday in the Fitness industry so it&#x27;s important to not only have a marketable body but a marketable face too.  Several have mentioned that it&#x27;s too light.  That&#x27;s the only suggestion I would have for the company is to develop more shades especially for &amp;#34;MINORITY MEN.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m Filipino and my skin is like a &amp;#34;Latte&amp;#34; so the &amp;#34;Amber&amp;#34; looks lighter.  But I&#x27;m lucky in that my pimples form on the &amp;#34;T Zone&amp;#34; which is on my chin and sideburn area so it blends pretty well specially when I start getting a 5&#x27;oclock shadow.  It takes a while to &amp;#34;master&amp;#34; applying this (since we are dudes we are not trained to apply make-up) so that it doesn&#x27;t look obvious.  My suggestion is to keep practicing BUT NEVER let your girlfriend, wife, sister or any woman do it because they will make you look like  a Drag Queen for fun, I guess, or it&#x27;s because that&#x27;s how they apply makeup.  This little jar should last you a while.  Take your time applying it and blend it with your skin.  So far no friend of mine or family member has noticed I have it on so excellent product, just needs to be minority sensitive.  If you are darker than a Cafe Latte, don&#x27;t buy this because you will look LEPROTIC, no joke!</li>
            <li> Okay I gave this 2 stars because I guess it can do the job for some certain people that are lucky to match the color of this but it is still not worth it, especially at the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the shades this comes with are pathetic. I am a very light skinned person and even with the darkest shade it makes your face look white, and as it oxidizes in the sun, orange. Not to mention it is not water proof so if you sweat just a bit, it will smear off. It is very heavy and it is apparent that you are wearing it when you do use it which is not exactly that great considering it is superposed to be for guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that noncondogemic remark? Total BS. Along with the tea tree pimple fighting thing. This will actually make you break out more in places you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The more vain you are the better this product is. It&#x27;ll get rid of your zits faster than normal ( at least it did for me). I don&#x27;t get zits that often, but when I do they&#x27;re pretty nasty, so I love that I can easily carry the case with me without being questioned by others.</li>
            <li> Got  mine in Pale Ale shade and it covers my blemishes just fine. I don;t use it every day but I can say that a little goes a long way with this product. Hope it doesn&#x27;t expire</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get a ton of zits anymore, but I will get the occasional freak breakout or random big, red one on my cheek.  I&#x27;d been using my wife&#x27;s concealer occasionally, which was fine but never quite matched my skin tone and was always too thick or powdery, or covered the breakout up but made it worse at the same time because of whatever crap is in it (oils, chemicals, magical lady stuff...who knows).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I based the one I bought on colors the actual product images (not those little color boxes) and ordered the Amber Ale, and the photos accurately reflect the actual product color.  It&#x27;s not super thick or cake-y, doesn&#x27;t smell perfume-y, and blended great with my skin color.  I just needed a tiny bit to pat/rub on, and reapplied as necessary.  Another nice part is that it didn&#x27;t make my breakout worse like my wife&#x27;s stuff does.  I scanned the ingredients quickly and all I can say is looking at this vs. the back of one of my wife&#x27;s tubes of concealer makes it obvious this stuff isn&#x27;t focused on having too many chemicals or other junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried at first that I&#x27;d fly through it based on how small the containers look, but you only need a little bit to cover up one spot that this container is going to last me a good long time.  I&#x27;ve been using it since last fall, so about 3 - 4 months, and I&#x27;ve still got plenty left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line...it works.  It doesn&#x27;t claim to have any magical healing power like the crap you see on TV, and doesn&#x27;t have some wacky overload of ingredients like women&#x27;s products, and costs half as much for something that lasts 3x as long as one of my wife&#x27;s little tubes of concealer. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> A lot of products offer up some miracle acne solution. They all claim to be the \\&quot;best acne product\\&quot; ever. But this product offers a simple solution: hide your pimples. And the great thing is that it does exactly that. Love the name zit camouflage. I reco it.</li>
            <li> While traveling for work i got a huge pimple on my forehead.  All i could think about was how my clients during a pitch were going to be staring at it rather than looking at my power point.  luckily i had packed the zit came in my bag so i could cover it up and not worry about it.  Pitch went well, i got the deal and i cant help but think it helped close the deal.  i would recommend this product to all guys who travel for that occasional embarrassing pimples.</li>
            <li> I am a white guy... not especially tan by any means. I didn&#x27;t know which shade to pick, so I decided to start with the medium (seems to make sense, right?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well even the medium shade is SUPER light. I don&#x27;t know who is using the lightest shade - albinos??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its hard for me to even say if the product is any good or not because it is SO obvious when I use it due to the shade. I end up just immediately wiping it off because it looks ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m debating whether or not I want to potentially waste $15 more trying out the darkest shade. If I do, I&#x27;ll write a new review. Until then, if you decide to buy this, GET THE DARKEST ONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I did decide to get the darker shade after all. I really like it, works very well, and isn&#x27;t extremely obvious when blended correctly. I would recommend it. I upped my review from 3 stars to 4.</li>
            <li> Product is only getting half the rating. I have light to medium brown skin tone, this does not blend into my color what so ever. Waste of money on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is definitely worth the buy if either selections match your complexion. The item is very small but the contents inside is very thick and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a better product that simply gets the job done.  Love it.  Would recommend it to everyone.  IT WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> Zit camo is a great solution. I hate taking medicine and its really expensive, but with this there are no meds and its cheap. Just a simple application and the zit gets covered. Fast and effective. Only used it a handful of times, but I gotta believe that the canister will last a LONG time. Not to mention the site is hilarious.</li>
            <li> I needed a product that I could use from time to time and this was perfect. Now I wish I had more pimples so I can use more of it.</li>
            <li> Im light skinned and got amber ale, wayyyyyy to white. Like clown makeup. I dont reccomend this to any person white, lightskin or brown skinned, ect. They need to make up darker colors. And real stuff for your face. Not clown makeup.</li>
            <li> I have to say, this stuff is nothing short of amazing.  Applies easily and perfectly hides the unwanted zit or blemish.  Another benefit is that a little bit goes a long way.  One container would last an extremely long time.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, does the job, and was cheap</li>
            <li> I used to use this when I still had pimples and I am very impressed with the coverage and the finish! It doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing concealer at all. It feels and looks so natural but my pimples are fully covered, almost invisible.</li>
            <li> No, seriously - this is a fantastic product that does EXACTLY what it purports to do, a rarity in this day and age. A few weeks ago, I was desperately trying to find some sort of concealing product, as I was breaking out and I had interviews scheduled in the next few days. Thanks to Amazon Prime, I got this little guy in record time. Initially, I was worried, because the tone I chose (Amber Ale) seemed to be way lighter than my skin tone, but after massaging it gently into the surrounding area, it blended perfectly and it was as if my pimples and redness magically disappeared. The container may seem small, but trust me, a little goes a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Folks, this is the real deal - give this product a chance! It will change your life for the better. Or, at the very least, it will restore your confidence.</li>
