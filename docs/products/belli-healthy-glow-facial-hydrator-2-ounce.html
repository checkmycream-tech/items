            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>This stuff smells so good</li>
            <li>I assume it would be good to use during spring or summer.</li>
            <li>Of course hormones and healthy eating also helped!</li>
            <li>Product smells nice and gives a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>More breakouts occured over the month that I used the product.  </li>
            <li>I did appreciate the safe ingredients though.</li>
            <li>Seems to sit on top of the skin instead of sinking in.</li>
            <li>Anything that I used to wash/moisturize my face, it made me break out even more.</li>
            <li>and it relaxes me for sure.</li>
            <li>Like most of the Belli line, it has a citrus smell.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is beautiful so far ~ almost no breakouts on my face at all!</li>

            <li>nice product, with fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I started using this product when pregnant.</li>

            <li>I have been using this product along with the spot treatment AND cleanser from Belli and love them all so far.  </li>
            <li>But after just trying it once, my acne cleared right up.</li>
            <li>It cleared my face right up</li>
            <li>but I am almost 6 months pregnant and my skin is nice and soft and less pimply :)</li>
            <li>I am half of 3 months pregnant and pretty good for maternity&#x27;s sensitive skin.my skin can be absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>and I decided to try the healthy glow facial moisturizer and man</li>
            <li>This lotion was okay for the time being but doesn&#x27;t moisturize to my standard.</li>
            <li>I went back to using this stuff again and my skin is doing much better.</li>
            <li>so my skin is very dry and start to breakout til I found this product, pretty good for maternity&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love using it so much, my son is ten mk</li>
            <li>I am definitely buying the full bottle of this stuff!</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a good product, except it&#x27;s a bit dry when using in winter.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but too thin.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s a really light lotions, does not feel greasy and seems to last quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>This lotion worked very well for me during pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>To clean my face, I just used a warm wet washcloth and then after I got all the make up and other jazz off my face, I used the moisturizer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite hydrating enough despite its pleasant smell, especially in the dry winter season.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t particularly hydrating either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, gentle, and has little ingredients.</li>
            <li>I had very clear skin during my fourth pregnancy thanks to this stuff.  </li>
            <li>kept my skin clear during pregnancy.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I chose the one star rating because it made my skin worse.  More breakouts occured over the month that I used the product.  I did appreciate the safe ingredients though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about to expire at 2015/08.I bought two bottles for my wife.Do you think the left time is enough to ues it？？So disappointed！！！！！！</li>
            <li> Smells great, but too thin.  Seems to sit on top of the skin instead of sinking in.</li>
            <li> Product smells nice and gives a healthy glow. The bottle, however , is designed very poorly. When you try to get lotion out it shoots everywhere but if you flip it upside down like a normal bottle the pump doesn&#x27;t work. Annoying!</li>
            <li> I bought this week, but expiration date is Aug,2015, old stuff?</li>
            <li> Once I got into the third trimester my face and skin was extra sensitive. Anything that I used to wash/moisturize my face, it made me break out even more. My local hospital had lots of samples and I decided to try the healthy glow facial moisturizer and man did it do wonders!!! To clean my face, I just used a warm wet washcloth and then after I got all the make up and other jazz off my face, I used the moisturizer and I started doing this every night for 3 days. My face was bad lemme tell yah! But after just trying it once, my acne cleared right up. After just 3 days my face is almost spotless! This stuff smells so good and it relaxes me for sure. I am definitely buying the full bottle of this stuff! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this in replace of my facial lotion during pregnancy. Like most of the Belli line, it has a citrus smell. I didn&#x27;t mind it too much, because I usually use vitamin C serum on my face prior. I have combination skin and need something moist but won&#x27;t break me out. This lotion was okay for the time being but doesn&#x27;t moisturize to my standard. I was still having dry patches.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a good product, except it&#x27;s a bit dry when using in winter. I assume it would be good to use during spring or summer.</li>
            <li> Im in my 3rd month of pregnancy so my skin is very dry and start to breakout til I found this product, pretty good for maternity&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I started using this product when pregnant. I love using it so much, my son is ten mk the and I still use it. It&#x27;s light, gentle, and has little ingredients. I am a fan.</li>
            <li> I left wrong review earlier, this item is very nice, Only used 1 night, I have already see the difference. Smell is very pretty.</li>
            <li> Its a little expensive for the size that it comes in but I am almost 6 months pregnant and my skin is nice and soft and less pimply :)</li>
            <li> nice product, with fast delivery.</li>
            <li> not the best I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite hydrating enough despite its pleasant smell, especially in the dry winter season. And it stings a little bit everytime I apply it on my cheeks and chin areas and I got several red spots in my face after I use it. It just doesn&#x27;t seem moisturizing enough to me.</li>
            <li> I am half of 3 months pregnant and pretty good for maternity&#x27;s sensitive skin.my skin can be absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> So far, I love this moisturizer ~ I&#x27;ve been using it since about 8 weeks pregnant and am now at 21 weeks.  My skin is beautiful so far ~ almost no breakouts on my face at all! I have been using this product along with the spot treatment AND cleanser from Belli and love them all so far.  Plus, it&#x27;s a really light lotions, does not feel greasy and seems to last quite a bit.  I&#x27;ll update to 5 stars if I last the remainder of this pregnancy with clear skin!</li>
            <li> This lotion worked very well for me during pregnancy.  I normally have combination skin and used prescription products prior to pregnancy.  This combined with Basq face wash and Cetaphil kept my skin clear during pregnancy.  Of course hormones and healthy eating also helped!</li>
            <li> This lotion was fine - it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin but it wasn&#x27;t particularly hydrating either.</li>
            <li> I have always battled acne, especially during pregnancy.  I had very clear skin during my fourth pregnancy thanks to this stuff.  I stopped using it after the baby was born and tried non-pregnancy products and immediately started breaking out again and had an allergic reaction to an eyebrow wax.  I went back to using this stuff again and my skin is doing much better.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It cleared my face right up and it smells great! I will definitely be using this after I have my baby.</li>
