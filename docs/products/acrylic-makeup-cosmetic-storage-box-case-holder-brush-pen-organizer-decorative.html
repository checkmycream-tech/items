            <li>Not too light, does not fall over.  </li>
            <li>but it is litterly cheap plastic...</li>
            <li>Cute cup for my new makeup brushes!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gorgeous brush holder with bows on opposite sides of the butterflies.</li>
            <li>it is very beautiful big enough to hold my bushes.</li>

            <li> Too small......</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I can say about it is that one of the corners is uneven</li>
            <li> It is very small and just doesn&#x27;t suit my needs.</li>
            <li> So that why I give 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Really like it, but the quality seems worse according to its price ($9).</li>
            <li> Looks expensive.</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with the price.</li>
