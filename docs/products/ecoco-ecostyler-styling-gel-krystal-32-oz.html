            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>my favorite gel of all time!</li>
            <li>While almost every popular Gel dries and flakes, giving people the impression that you have dandruff.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s excellent for defining my natural curl pattern and it doesn&#x27;t flake!  </li>
            <li>I tried this and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Thank you :)</li>
            <li>This is my FAVORITE gel</li>
            <li>Not getting it from me any more.</li>
            <li>Now if only the seller on Amazon \\&quot;Sally Beauty Store\\&quot; were able to pack it so it gets to the buyer in one piece..it would be a great experience.</li>
            <li>strong hold, etc.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to clean up</li>
            <li>This Gel is totally clean and better yet, totally alcohol free.</li>
            <li>even though they&#x27;re supposed to be alcohol free), it does NOT flake in my hair (try wearing a black top/dress after using most gels, and you&#x27;ll look like you&#x27;ve got a severe case of dandruff; not with Krystal eco styler gel), and it gives me a hold that I love (not a crunchy hold).  </li>
            <li>I received my first jar as a joke prize.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it at my local hairstyler.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My hair regimen is simple - I usually co-wash my hair with Tresemme flawless curls conditioner, I rinse the conditioner out, I use Paul Mitchell &amp;#34;The Conditioner&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s moisturizing (most gels dry my hair out,</li>
            <li>It was the large jar</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like that much hold, I&#x27;ve found that using a light oil like grapeseed oil prior to applying the eco styler gel will decrease the hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>If I so much as touched my head, flakes would get everywhere</li>
            <li>The gel when used alone can make my hair crunchy, but I just add a little coconut oil or extra olive oil first to make the style extra soft with excellent hold.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;no flakes\\&quot; on the side, which was the main reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>I live in a high humidity part of the country (the South)</li>
            <li>I only wish it were available in a larger quantity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that excessive use makes the hair dry, but hold exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>The jar clearly says</li>
            <li>Much to my surprised, I used it.</li>
            <li>I still due, but I was looking for that more shiny wet look with hold, but apparently this didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li>The ONLY gel in the world that offers viscosity without the crusty crunch!&lt;br /&gt;my hair is unruly!</li>
            <li>The shipper clearly knew that the bottles could potentially break</li>
            <li>Odd that it is hard to find and I have to order it online most of the time.</li>
            <li>Now I have a HUGE jar of gel with a broken lid...</li>

            <li> Now I have a HUGE jar of gel with a broken lid...</li>
            <li> So for people with thick and very straight hair who want hold, I don&#x27;t think this will be it.</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful about what you use with this gel to keep white residue from forming in the hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a life long hair gel user.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and straight and I have been using a stronger wax up to this point, and</li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t dry or damage your hair.</li>
            <li> for me was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> For other, I guess this would work for you.</li>
            <li> Other gels leave a sticky residue, where as this one holds without the stickiness.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve replaced all of my other gels and use this one exclusively.  </li>
            <li> I gave this two stars because it makes white little peaces of dried gel all over my hair</li>
            <li> Before people slam this product, they should give other consumers a run down of all of the junk they&#x27;ve put in their hair.  </li>
            <li> But I can use a moderate amount of Eco because it is so thick, but still I don&#x27;t get the plastic head feel like Dep and LA Looks.</li>
            <li> The price was mush less than I thought that I would have to pay.</li>
            <li> This product does not lay down my hair at all!</li>
            <li> I had to throw it out, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The only thing that concern me is that I received it broken.  </li>
            <li> Not true!</li>
            <li> My Barber shop sells a small container of this stuff for five bucks</li>
            <li> And the seller sent me a small jar after I paid for the 32 oz jar, so</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with how these products were packed.  </li>
            <li> but I read other reviews about the lid being broken and lo and behold, happened to me too.</li>
            <li> But doesn&#x27;t mean that it is not what someone else might be looking for.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package, the jar was broken and gel was everywhere.</li>
            <li> I WOULD NEVER BUY TWO BROKEN BOTTLES OF GEL FROM A STORE.  </li>
            <li> I bought two and in delivery one was damaged poor packaging</li>
            <li> false advertisement and shame on them for that.</li>
            <li> think a lot of people who have given this gel bad reviews may have used other products in their hair that didn&#x27;t jive well with the eco styler gel.  </li>
            <li> This gel flakes worse than any gel I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li> and I made me look like I had horrible dandruff, which was disgusting.</li>

            <li> When I opened the package, the jar was broken and gel was everywhere. I had to throw it out, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I received my first jar as a joke prize. Much to my surprised, I used it. It was the large jar and I just finished it. Had to have another. The price was mush less than I thought that I would have to pay. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that excessive use makes the hair dry, but hold exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> I tried this and love it.  it&#x27;s excellent for defining my natural curl pattern and it doesn&#x27;t flake!

            <li> Of all the Gel&#x27;s I have ever used, this is one Styling Gel that does not flake at all. While almost every popular Gel dries and flakes, giving people the impression that you have dandruff. This Gel is totally clean and better yet, totally alcohol free. so it won&#x27;t dry or damage your hair. Glad I found it at my local hairstyler. The product is great !   Now if only the seller on Amazon \\&quot;Sally Beauty Store\\&quot; were able to pack it so it gets to the buyer in one piece..it would be a great experience.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It did what I needed to do.  The only thing that concern me is that I received it broken.  No worries, I had extra containers at home so it worked out.  Thank you :)</li>
            <li> Great product, great value, as always Amazon is the best !</li>
            <li> Great product as always, also good price too</li>
            <li> Best gel ever! Great for styling! No flakes! Great price for amount of quantity. My husband won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> I love this Gel its probably one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. However when it arrived at my house it was enclosed in a sealed bag and the container was open and there was gel all over it (probably about a quarter of it was out the container). It took me a while to clean up but I guess it definitely saved me money. My Barber shop sells a small container of this stuff for five bucks so compared to on here you get more bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> This styling gel works great on the kids hair, it does not flake and holds all day, even after sports activities</li>
            <li> Eco Styler- for me was not what I expected. But doesn&#x27;t mean that it is not what someone else might be looking for. My co-worker swears by this stuff and he is extremely happy with this product. He&#x27;s the one who actually referred me to this product. I however did not like this product for the simple fact that I needed a stronger hold. My hair is thick and straight and I have been using a stronger wax up to this point, and I still due, but I was looking for that more shiny wet look with hold, but apparently this didn&#x27;t do the job. So for people with thick and very straight hair who want hold, I don&#x27;t think this will be it. For other, I guess this would work for you. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a life long hair gel user. This is the best gel that I have come across - took me 20 years to find. Other gels leave a sticky residue, where as this one holds without the stickiness. I actually put this gel in a squeezable container which makes it easier to apply.</li>
            <li> The ONLY gel in the world that offers viscosity without the crusty crunch!&lt;br /&gt;my hair is unruly! But I can use a moderate amount of Eco because it is so thick, but still I don&#x27;t get the plastic head feel like Dep and LA Looks. This should be the only gel made in the world. Odd that it is hard to find and I have to order it online most of the time.</li>
            <li> This product does not lay down my hair at all! I am very dissapointed.And the seller sent me a small jar after I paid for the 32 oz jar, so false advertisement and shame on them for that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use this gel again. The jar clearly says \\&quot;no flakes\\&quot; on the side, which was the main reason I bought it. Not true! This gel flakes worse than any gel I&#x27;ve ever used!! If I so much as touched my head, flakes would get everywhere and I made me look like I had horrible dandruff, which was disgusting.</li>
            <li> product is great and works. strong hold, etc. but I read other reviews about the lid being broken and lo and behold, happened to me too. Now I have a HUGE jar of gel with a broken lid...</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE gel and I&#x27;ve replaced all of my other gels and use this one exclusively.  For me, this gel does what it says it will do - it&#x27;s moisturizing (most gels dry my hair out, even though they&#x27;re supposed to be alcohol free), it does NOT flake in my hair (try wearing a black top/dress after using most gels, and you&#x27;ll look like you&#x27;ve got a severe case of dandruff; not with Krystal eco styler gel), and it gives me a hold that I love (not a crunchy hold).  I live in a high humidity part of the country (the South) so I welcome the hold.  If you don&#x27;t like that much hold, I&#x27;ve found that using a light oil like grapeseed oil prior to applying the eco styler gel will decrease the hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think a lot of people who have given this gel bad reviews may have used other products in their hair that didn&#x27;t jive well with the eco styler gel.  My hair regimen is simple - I usually co-wash my hair with Tresemme flawless curls conditioner, I rinse the conditioner out, I use Paul Mitchell &amp;#34;The Conditioner&amp;#34; as my leave in, then I use my eco styler gel.  Before people slam this product, they should give other consumers a run down of all of the junk they&#x27;ve put in their hair.  I keep things simple.</li>
            <li> I just did the big chop and NOTHING was helping my hair!!  I tried 4 different products and no luck!  I&#x27;m a 4b and this prodcut work wonders!!! I love it!  Found it at Walgreens for only $3.00.</li>
            <li> 60% of the cost of what I paid(no longer) at the barber shop for twice the amount.  My barber(this is my wife&#x27;s account) charges $15 for 16oz container.  Not getting it from me any more.</li>
            <li> The best I ever have.</li>
            <li> I love this gel the best for me others would make my hair fall off but not this one !!!!!</li>
            <li> Shipped well. I only wish it were available in a larger quantity. This product is alcohol free, so great for your hair!</li>
            <li> my favorite gel of all time! hold my hair in place all day.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with how these products were packed.  The shipper clearly knew that the bottles could potentially break so he placed each bottle inside a plastic bag.  But the shipper did NOT use packaging material to absorb any impact which might actually prevent the bottles from breaking and spilling the gel.  It&#x27;s like they knew it was going to break but didn&#x27;t care to stop it from breaking!  I WOULD NEVER BUY TWO BROKEN BOTTLES OF GEL FROM A STORE.  No one has responded to my complaints.</li>
            <li> I gave this two stars because it makes white little peaces of dried gel all over my hair I bought two and in delivery one was damaged poor packaging</li>
