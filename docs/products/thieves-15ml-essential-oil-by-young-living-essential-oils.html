            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Use one or two drops in a cup of warm water, gargle and swallow for toothache, canker sores, onset of colds, sore throats, stomach pains, or with a carrier oil  on a cotton ball for  ear aches, apply to skin rashes, ingrown toenails,,,etc.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Theair quality in the house seems better, smells nice.</li>

            <li>Love to use one drop each morning and night on my toothbrush for a fresh and healthy mouth and whiter teeth!</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>The product smells nice, but certainly did NOT appear to boost anyone&#x27;s immune system.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, but I&#x27;ve been dropping about 12 drops into my himilayan salt block essential oil diffuser, and the smell seems to go away too quickly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s safe for you and the family :) will definitely buy over and over again :)</li>
            <li>As a diabetec good oral hygene is critical.</li>
            <li>This came quickly and as advertised.  </li>
            <li>The item was delivered quickly and as advertised though...</li>
            <li>Save your 38 bucks and go to the Real young living website.&lt;br /&gt;You might pay a bit more</li>
            <li>After seeing the Young Living logo, I felt better.</li>
            <li>(If you could see me, you&#x27;d witness me knocking furiously on wood right now.)  </li>
            <li>I love all Young Living products so much I became a wholesale member.</li>
            <li>Just be aware, it&#x27;s . . .</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s mostly passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  One year later</li>
            <li>Want to buy more of them in the future.</li>
            <li>If anyone is interested you can sign up here https://www.youngliving.com/signup/?site&#x3D;US&amp;sponsorid&#x3D;1593072&amp;enrollerid&#x3D;1593072</li>
            <li>The best way to fight germs is to hand wash, minimize exposure to people who are sick, keep the house clean, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With all junk coming from China one may be very concerned about the purity of a product.</li>
            <li>but you will get the real</li>
            <li>Since most beach houses of Florida have hidden mold, I took it on vacation to the beach house were staying at and ran two bottles through two separate diffusers for the first 24 hours</li>
            <li>(i.e., everyone is indoors more often and in closer proximity to each other).  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The kids are doing far better with their asthma this trip and everyone is breathing easier than we have on other beach trips.</li>
            <li>Young Living has a whole Thieves line consisting of household cleaner, toothpaste, mouthwash, soap, etc.</li>
            <li>In a few more years I&#x27;ll be the lady with tissue up her sleeves.  </li>
            <li>and you can get the same mixture or even make your own for far less.</li>
            <li>He actually doesn&#x27;t snore as much!</li>
            <li>/&gt;But the product can only do so much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural product, and helps improve gum disease.  </li>
            <li>Do not buy from Aroma Planet buy from Young living website.&lt;br</li>
            <li>planet copied young living label and when I compared both labels:&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aroma planet did not have Dr Gary Young&#x27;s name on it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>babies are completely gone--it&#x27;s been 3 months.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get enough sleep and spent most of my time with the germy little guys and found myself succumbing to the illness.  </li>
            <li>First try, we put Dr scholls  wart pads covered with bandaiad during the day, removed at night before shower, scraped black stuff off, put cotton-soaked with thieves oil on wart, covered with bandaid at night every night  for a week.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m certain it has hidden mold in here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to have evaded the cold germs that typically come with flights.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried less expensive versions but find the quality is not as good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I have to add it to water in the little glass cup which perhaps is diluting it too much, or if it&#x27;s because the room is so big........</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Thieves is a blend of herbs that is highly anti-viral, anti-bacterial and has been proven to kill black mold.</li>
            <li> I start using it daily as soon as school starts and have found that I get far less illnesses, ie:</li>
            <li> small bottle lasted my family 3 years with frequent use!!!</li>
            <li> The wart pads caused a black blister,which we removed, but the thieves oil repaired damage and skin wasn&#x27;t too sensitive around wart.</li>
            <li> first let me say, I was shocked when I received my latest order of Thieves Oil as the label was not the same as I usually receive, and I thought I had been tricked into buying a copy cat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The 2 star rating is based on the following average: 4 stars for smell and 0 stars for boosting immune system (which is what the description states).</li>
            <li> I will continue to use the oil and cleaning product, but the others are a little pricey for me to use regularly...</li>
            <li> He was not ready to try it (still isn&#x27;t)</li>
            <li> Seems to be the expected quality and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly and shipped carefully packaged.</li>
            <li> Everything seemed to work, but the wart plus one would come back in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the recommendation of my naturopathic physician to kill mold and other airborne pathogens.</li>
            <li> possibilities are endless.  </li>
            <li> We kept putting thieves oil on cotton at night and nail polish at day for a month and removed calloused skin every other day before the thieves oil was put on.</li>
            <li> Now I just put a drop in my palm and lick it, having learned to avoid my lips and knowing which spot on my tongue is least likely to succumb to numbness.</li>
            <li> This is a must-have for my family for sore throat and other infections!</li>
            <li> I believe that I am on my third bottle of this stuff, not sure how I lived without Thieves!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with slight gum irritationg for a couple of years</li>
            <li> At first it made my tongue numb too</li>
            <li> My kids have a lot of trouble with their asthma when we stay at beach homes for vacation.  </li>
            <li> Then after a week, when no more black appeared, we did thieves oil at night and removed cotton that had been soaked and put on wart in morning and painted nail polish  on wart.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the sinus misery that I usually feel right in the days before I start sounding sick to everyone else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am not sure</li>
            <li> and so I rub a small amount of Thieves oil on my gums nightly with a small dental brush.  </li>
            <li> In a small spray bottle, add 7-10 drops and you can disinfect anything PLUS</li>
            <li> I also use the cleaning solution, and have used the mouthwash, lozenges, and toothpaste in the past.</li>
            <li> not sure.</li>
            <li> think that getting sick is inevitable when (1) you have small children; (2) the children go to school with other children; and (3) it is wintertime</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually the person who catches every little cold and has perpetual allergies.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> Dabbed a bit on, it relaxed me and the fragrance helped me get through the stale, recycled air on the planes.</li>
            <li> Still, the cold didn&#x27;t seem as bad as it usually is.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had a cold.  </li>
            <li> kits(too painful and destructive), apple cider vinegar every night and day for 2 mos, duct tape for months(it wouldn&#x27;t stick), banana peels for 2 months.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get sick anymore.......</li>
            <li> Nobody in the family has gotten sick at all this winter.</li>
            <li> We bought this product because everyone in the house kept getting sick.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I enjoyed the product but I am not sure if the ingredients/process is what YL claims to be. With all junk coming from China one may be very concerned about the purity of a product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, and so convenient to be able to source on line.  I use it in my dishwater for it&#x27;s antibacterial properties and its delightful scent.</li>
            <li> This came quickly and as advertised.  Very good for cold/flu prevention.</li>
            <li> My aunt turned me on to Thieves Oil about a year ago after my Dad was diagnosed with cancer.  He was not ready to try it (still isn&#x27;t) but I thought I&#x27;d give it a go.  I think it works!  I&#x27;m usually the person who catches every little cold and has perpetual allergies.  In a few more years I&#x27;ll be the lady with tissue up her sleeves.  Now, I&#x27;m the one who people ask for a tissue and I pull a wad out of my purse/pocket and assure the asker, \\&quot;Yes, they&#x27;re clean.\\&quot;  Since I started taking one drop each day, my daughter and my sweetie have both had colds But I Didn&#x27;t Get Them!  That&#x27;s practically unheard of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the product can only do so much.  I spent three weeks with my sister helping her with her 4 year old twin boys and her newborn, while both boys had colds.  I didn&#x27;t get enough sleep and spent most of my time with the germy little guys and found myself succumbing to the illness.  Still, the cold didn&#x27;t seem as bad as it usually is.  I didn&#x27;t have the sinus misery that I usually feel right in the days before I start sounding sick to everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it.  I put one drop into a spoon every evening and add water.  I add water to the spoon several times before I go all in and lick the spoon.  Heavens.  Just be aware, it&#x27;s . . . spicy, for lack of a better word.  At first it made my tongue numb too but that&#x27;s mostly passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  One year later and I haven&#x27;t had a cold.  (If you could see me, you&#x27;d witness me knocking furiously on wood right now.)  Now I just put a drop in my palm and lick it, having learned to avoid my lips and knowing which spot on my tongue is least likely to succumb to numbness.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong this is a good product, but I now know that it is way overpriced and you can get the same mixture or even make your own for far less. The item was delivered quickly and as advertised though...</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  It&#x27;s a natural product, and helps improve gum disease.  I&#x27;ve struggled with slight gum irritationg for a couple of years and so I rub a small amount of Thieves oil on my gums nightly with a small dental brush.  It&#x27;s improved my gums.  As a diabetec good oral hygene is critical.</li>
            <li> My family uses this for treated colds.  Very good product.  We&#x27;ve tried less expensive versions but find the quality is not as good.</li>
            <li> Seems to be the expected quality and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff.......I don&#x27;t get sick anymore.......just a drop or so on the tongue and you&#x27;re good to go........awesome product..........z</li>
            <li> I have used this product for twenty years and it keeps me from getting the flu even though I work in the schools and do not get a flu shot  I wear it every day and use it in diffusers</li>
            <li> Every household should have thieves oil in their home</li>
            <li> Have used this for years in treating gingivitis around crown work in my mouth. Just apply with Qtip and wait before rinsing.</li>
            <li> Do not buy from Aroma Planet buy from Young living website.&lt;br /&gt;Different ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Aroma planet copied young living label and when I compared both labels:&lt;br /&gt;Aroma planet did not have Dr Gary Young&#x27;s name on it.&lt;br /&gt;This is a scam. Save your 38 bucks and go to the Real young living website.&lt;br /&gt;You might pay a bit more but you will get the real product.&lt;br /&gt;I finally got scammed by amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a must-have for my family for sore throat and other infections!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this at night time to help with snoring. He says he can&#x27;t tell bit i sure can.... He actually doesn&#x27;t snore as much!</li>
            <li> I have been using this Essential Oil for several years.  I start using it daily as soon as school starts and have found that I get far less illnesses, ie: colds and such, than I did prior to starting.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> One of the best. My dentist was even happy. I have implants and use this instead of toothpaste . I just love it</li>
            <li> Works great...Love to use one drop each morning and night on my toothbrush for a fresh and healthy mouth and whiter teeth!</li>
            <li> Use one or two drops in a cup of warm water, gargle and swallow for toothache, canker sores, onset of colds, sore throats, stomach pains, or with a carrier oil  on a cotton ball for  ear aches, apply to skin rashes, ingrown toenails,,,etc.&lt;br /&gt;One small bottle lasted my family 3 years with frequent use!!!</li>
            <li> Our family love thieves oil for many uses in the house...mainly for disinfecting :) In a small spray bottle, add 7-10 drops and you can disinfect anything PLUS it&#x27;s safe for you and the family :) will definitely buy over and over again :)</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Want to buy more of them in the future.</li>
            <li> Great product...I create sprays to use on the skin and as an aromatic. Product arrived promptly and shipped carefully packaged.</li>
            <li> Great again!  My kids have a lot of trouble with their asthma when we stay at beach homes for vacation.  Since most beach houses of Florida have hidden mold, I took it on vacation to the beach house were staying at and ran two bottles through two separate diffusers for the first 24 hours we were there.  The kids are doing far better with their asthma this trip and everyone is breathing easier than we have on other beach trips. And let me say there is some visible water damage in this beautiful 1.2 million dollar beach house so I&#x27;m certain it has hidden mold in here. This stuff works!</li>
            <li> I bought this at the recommendation of my naturopathic physician to kill mold and other airborne pathogens. Theair quality in the house seems better, smells nice. Nobody in the family has gotten sick at all this winter.</li>
            <li> I use this for everything!  I dilute it in juice, diffuse, disinfect...possibilities are endless.  I believe that I am on my third bottle of this stuff, not sure how I lived without Thieves!</li>
            <li> first let me say, I was shocked when I received my latest order of Thieves Oil as the label was not the same as I usually receive, and I thought I had been tricked into buying a copy cat. After seeing the Young Living logo, I felt better. I use this product for many things. I use it on my toothbrush as a booster for my oral health, I drink a drop in my water every day to take my vitamins, I mix it with Coconut oil as an antiseptic on blemishes/cuts/bruises. I also use the cleaning solution, and have used the mouthwash, lozenges, and toothpaste in the past. I will continue to use the oil and cleaning product, but the others are a little pricey for me to use regularly...boo!</li>
            <li> It was used during some travel from FL to NH with connecting flights. Dabbed a bit on, it relaxed me and the fragrance helped me get through the stale, recycled air on the planes. I&#x27;m happy to have evaded the cold germs that typically come with flights.</li>
            <li> Excellent product to have in times of need...</li>
            <li> Thieves is a blend of herbs that is highly anti-viral, anti-bacterial and has been proven to kill black mold. When diffused it will kill 99.9% of pathogens in the air. This product is amazing! I even put a drop on my toothbrush and it kills bacteria in my mouth. Young Living has a whole Thieves line consisting of household cleaner, toothpaste, mouthwash, soap, etc. I love all Young Living products so much I became a wholesale member. I now get all their products at wholesale price.

            <li> My daughter had a plantar wart that just wouldn&#x27;t go away. We tried home freezing kits(too painful and destructive), apple cider vinegar every night and day for 2 mos, duct tape for months(it wouldn&#x27;t stick), banana peels for 2 months. Everything seemed to work, but the wart plus one would come back in a few weeks. Then we tried thieves oil and nail polish. First try, we put Dr scholls  wart pads covered with bandaiad during the day, removed at night before shower, scraped black stuff off, put cotton-soaked with thieves oil on wart, covered with bandaid at night every night  for a week. The wart pads caused a black blister,which we removed, but the thieves oil repaired damage and skin wasn&#x27;t too sensitive around wart. Then after a week, when no more black appeared, we did thieves oil at night and removed cotton that had been soaked and put on wart in morning and painted nail polish  on wart. in two weeks, the wart and surrounding warts were gone-replaced with calloused skin. We kept putting thieves oil on cotton at night and nail polish at day for a month and removed calloused skin every other day before the thieves oil was put on. The wart and it&#x27;s babies are completely gone--it&#x27;s been 3 months.Hopefully they will not be back...will let you know if they do, but i have a good feeling they are gone for good!</li>
            <li> Smells great, but I&#x27;ve been dropping about 12 drops into my himilayan salt block essential oil diffuser, and the smell seems to go away too quickly. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I have to add it to water in the little glass cup which perhaps is diluting it too much, or if it&#x27;s because the room is so big........not sure. I haven&#x27;t tried it on the soles of my feet yet. I&#x27;m still deciding what carrier oil I want to purchase to mix it with. But I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> We bought this product because everyone in the house kept getting sick.  The product smells nice, but certainly did NOT appear to boost anyone&#x27;s immune system.  The flu, stomach bug, and colds kept coming (even with everyone getting the flu shot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that getting sick is inevitable when (1) you have small children; (2) the children go to school with other children; and (3) it is wintertime (i.e., everyone is indoors more often and in closer proximity to each other).  The best way to fight germs is to hand wash, minimize exposure to people who are sick, keep the house clean, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2 star rating is based on the following average: 4 stars for smell and 0 stars for boosting immune system (which is what the description states).</li>
