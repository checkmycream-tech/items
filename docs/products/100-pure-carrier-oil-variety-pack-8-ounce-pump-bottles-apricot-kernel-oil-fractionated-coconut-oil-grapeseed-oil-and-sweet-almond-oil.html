            <li> I expected better Apricot oil.  </li>
            <li> These are high quality oils</li>
            <li> I just recently started using Young Living oils and I needed carrier oils.  </li>
            <li> Wish they were bigger because I&#x27;ve already used half of these up!</li>
            <li> My only disappointment was that the Apricot oil was cosmetic grade.  </li>
            <li> but I thought at the least the apricot oil and almond oils would have had a scent.</li>
            <li> there was absolutely no scents to these which is disappointing since I wanted to mix them with shea butter.</li>
            <li> Horrible!!!</li>
            <li> The smell was horrific</li>

            <li> Easy to use and all 4 of the pumps work well.  I would definitely buy again.  I only wish they had more than just the 4.  If they had a different 4 I would buy them, too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a variety of oils to choose from when making blends for my essential oils! These are high quality oils and I enjoy all of them!</li>

            <li> Great oiils. love the variety</li>
            <li> will certainly buy this again.  Love the pump bottles and the quality oil.</li>
            <li> I like these and for the price they are a fair deal.  The Coconut and Almond are labeled organic and highest grade.  The Grapeseed is highest grade available, but is not labeled organic which seems reasonable and honest if you know a little about Grapeseed oil.  My only disappointment was that the Apricot oil was cosmetic grade.  I expected better Apricot oil.  Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> GREAT oils for the price.Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Oil exactly as described. Delivered quickly. Great carrier oil for massage :)</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my ignorance but I thought at the least the apricot oil and almond oils would have had a scent. there was absolutely no scents to these which is disappointing since I wanted to mix them with shea butter. Nice size bottles though.</li>
            <li> great products..... love them!</li>
            <li> These fell great and were actually much larger bottles than I was expecting.  It will take me a while to get through all of these.  Great variety and you can feel a difference in each.  I&#x27;m glad I went with this variety.</li>
            <li> each one is very good</li>
            <li> Great Variety Pack...wish it was still available!</li>
            <li> Great for making body oils.</li>
            <li> These are great oils to dilute essential oils. Good quality for body products, perfume and massage. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> These oils came in sampler pack and except for one leaking they worked well as a gift set for my friend.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and is wonderful to use!</li>
            <li> Horrible!!! The oils were rancid.The smell was horrific</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything like these before.  I just recently started using Young Living oils and I needed carrier oils.  I have tried each of these oils, they are all unscented, light and don&#x27;t leave an oily feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love love love these oils. I will definitely be buying again when mine run out!</li>
