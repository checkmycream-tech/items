            <li>I have short hair and it works great after blow-drying to difine the hair and give it a finished look.</li>
            <li>I have the #1, light control.  </li>
            <li>This is a light, pleasant-smelling product that de-frizzes and smooths hair.</li>
            <li>This is awesome wax not too much hold but enough and has that added shine.</li>

            <li>thanks for making it available online.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it makes hair look shiny and feel soft.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>Love this product for my short haircuts.</li>
            <li>this product is very easy to use on dry hair and promotes shine and separation</li>
            <li>Having thick course hair is sometimes a curse, but this product is amazing!</li>
            <li>I have silver hair, so the curl is pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very shiny</li>
            <li>It provides hold and shine for the whole day.</li>
            <li>My clients love the shine and the product isn&#x27;t heavy.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware it came in different control  </li>
            <li>It gets rid of frizz, makes it smooth and shiny and holds it ever so slightly.  </li>
            <li>If used in this way it&#x27;s not heavy and your hair still has plenty of movement.</li>
            <li>Used in small quantities it washes out easily.</li>
            <li>This product is great because you rub a small amount into dry hair, and if gives your hair lift and shine, without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is that you have to be careful that this is wax and it will melt if you live in area where weather is hot.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m back to my old gel, its crew.</li>
            <li>After apply to hair, I rinse my hand with a little water and it came right off.  </li>
            <li>This product is oily if u use to much and will way ur hair down and look greasy.</li>

            <li> This product is oily if u use to much and will way ur hair down and look greasy.</li>
            <li> Its hard to control how much to apply to the hair.  </li>
            <li> It lasts forever because you only need a tiny amount - on short hair, a dab no bigger than a small pea.</li>
            <li> It improves thick, dull, or curly hair, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Rub it between both hands, then rub your hands over and through dry hair.</li>
            <li> Amazon sells this product for half the price of my local salon.</li>
            <li> Remember though, when applying you only need a quarter of a pinkie amount to tame your hair (&amp; I have long hair!)</li>
            <li> This hair product is what I expected from this brand.</li>
            <li> It does add some hold but the hair is still \\&quot;loose\\&quot;, meaning you don&#x27;t get the gunk you would get from other products.</li>
            <li> i have short thick hair that has lost it&#x27;s luster (</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a power gel, but I can separate strands in my bangs and mess up my hair a bit</li>
            <li> After blow-drying my hair, I rub a little into my hands, then sort of &amp;#34;style&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not too heavy, not gummy,</li>
            <li> For medium/long lengths I would suggest a small amount so it doesn&#x27;t weight the hair down over time.</li>
            <li> I hope they keep making this item because its not easy to find anymore.</li>
            <li> I have learned to use small amounts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an alright product, but after using this, its really hard to take this off from your hair, like even if you shampoo your hair couple times you can still feel like its still on your hair</li>
            <li> I use at least twice or three times a week.</li>
            <li> Every time I put this in my thick, wavy hair</li>

            <li> My hair salon doesn&#x27;t stock this product anymore so I figured Amazon would have it and they did! Love this stuff! I have short hair and it works great after blow-drying to difine the hair and give it a finished look. great stuff!</li>
            <li> This is awesome wax not too much hold but enough and has that added shine. Schwarzkopf is the best product. Try them all.</li>

Its more to improve the texture of your hair. It does add some hold but the hair is still \\&quot;loose\\&quot;, meaning you don&#x27;t get the gunk you would get from other products.

            <li> Excellent product great price only a quarter  amount and you are ready to go easily washes out try it you will like it</li>
            <li> This product is oily if u use to much and will way ur hair down and look greasy. I have learned to use small amounts. My hair gets frizzy and this product helps.</li>
            <li> Love this product, have been using it for years. Not greasy just perfect for molding hair while giving it a bit of shine.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair crunchy or too oily.</li>
            <li> I had a haircut and the stylist used this wax on my hair and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. It is light weight, gives a very nice shine and if I rinse my hair in the morning (flat hair from sleeping) it still stays shiny. It&#x27;s not a power gel, but I can separate strands in my bangs and mess up my hair a bit and it&#x27;ll hold. I have silver hair, so the curl is pretty much gone. This makes my gray hair very pretty.</li>
            <li> Every time I put this in my thick, wavy hair I get compliments.  Tames frizz, makes my hair shiny, sperates curls but doesn&#x27;t leave a ton of greasy residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect for everyday use!</li>
            <li> Not too heavy, not gummy, just right. Makes my hair very shiny and I get lots of compliments when I use it.</li>
            <li> This is better than powder that Osis+ also make. The powder they make is very fine and light. Its hard to control how much to apply to the hair.  I use at least twice or three times a week. It last for two years for me. The only thing is that you have to be careful that this is wax and it will melt if you live in area where weather is hot. Keep it in below 80 degree.&lt;br /&gt;The odor is mild. It&#x27;s not sticky. After apply to hair, I rinse my hand with a little water and it came right off.  I hope they keep making this item because its not easy to find anymore.</li>
            <li> The best product I have ever tried. Love the light texture!&lt;br /&gt;Sad I cannot find it in beauty store anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  Aside from the humidity which nothing works in, it&#x27;s always reliable.  Remember though, when applying you only need a quarter of a pinkie amount to tame your hair (&amp; I have long hair!) otherwise you&#x27;ll look greasy.</li>
            <li> Perfect weight for my fine light hair, great in my beard too. Perfect for today&#x27;s neat and clean grooming.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product..</li>
            <li> I have been using this wax for a while now. In my opinion it is the best wax out there if you want shine and if you want to be able to run your fingers thru your hair. It does not flake and it won&#x27;t itch your scalp.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Have been using it for over a year now.  Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, but was thrilled to find it on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;This is not for hold.  It is more of a shine wax.  After blow-drying my hair, I rub a little into my hands, then sort of &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; my short hair with my fingers.  It gets rid of frizz, makes it smooth and shiny and holds it ever so slightly.  Don&#x27;t buy this if you want any kind of strong hold, but if you want glossy hair with no frizz this stuff is the best!!!!</li>
            <li> I like the shine factor.  Most waxes I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t provide the shine this product does.  I wasn&#x27;t aware it came in different control  levels such as 1,2,or 3.  I have the #1, light control.  This does have a nice light sweet fragrance. I like this product very much as it makes my silver hair look brighter and healthy.</li>
            <li> Having thick course hair is sometimes a curse, but this product is amazing! It provides hold and shine for the whole day.</li>
            <li> This hair product is what I expected from this brand. I really feel satisfied with the results given by this product.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly! Thank you. Love this product for my short haircuts. My clients love the shine and the product isn&#x27;t heavy. For medium/long lengths I would suggest a small amount so it doesn&#x27;t weight the hair down over time.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thinning hair.  This product is great because you rub a small amount into dry hair, and if gives your hair lift and shine, without weighing it down.  I can no longer find it at my beauty supply store, so thanks for making it available online.</li>
            <li> Actually I only meant to order one.  I don&#x27;t know,why two came.  I do like the product but one jar will last for years.  Holds hair in place.</li>
            <li> This is a light, pleasant-smelling product that de-frizzes and smooths hair. It improves thick, dull, or curly hair, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for fine hair. It lasts forever because you only need a tiny amount - on short hair, a dab no bigger than a small pea. Rub it between both hands, then rub your hands over and through dry hair. If used in this way it&#x27;s not heavy and your hair still has plenty of movement. Used in small quantities it washes out easily. Amazon sells this product for half the price of my local salon.</li>
            <li> i have short thick hair that has lost it&#x27;s luster (im 60).  this product is very easy to use on dry hair and promotes shine and separation</li>
