            <li>I have always loved coconut.</li>
            <li>My search is over, and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Bath &amp; Body Works has and you&#x27;ll receive many compliments, as it is admired by all !</li>
            <li>But hey, most people can&#x27;t tell they just think I smell good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good coconut perfume and/or body spray, and I have found that most of them smell like vanilla instead.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t a nice one.</li>
            <li>but it seems that coconut oil doesn&#x27;t smell very strongly of coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but she is really glad to be able to get it through Amazon!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far their best for us coconut lovers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle on the skin and very refreshing!  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Such a great product!</li>
            <li>BUY it if you like coconut, it smells just like the beach :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t just like the smell of this, I love it.  </li>
            <li>I condition my hair with it, I moisturize my skin with it, I keep my mouth healthy by oil pulling with it</li>
            <li>top of this my husband hates every scent I&#x27;ve ever worn except this one.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent and was glad to find it so cheap!  </li>
            <li>If you like coconut you will love this scent - more coconut than vanilla I think.  </li>
            <li>I love everything coconut</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>love it.....</li>
            <li>The exotic coconut body spray smells just like coconut.</li>
            <li>Love amazon.</li>
            <li>sure does smell like the beach</li>
            <li>Love it p</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always preferred to be fresh and clean smelling from a shower with a great body wash than to cover up with a strong perfume.</li>
            <li>Bath and Body Works&#x27; Exotic Coconut Splash has a strong hint of coconut, but is by no means overpowering.</li>
            <li>Exotic Coconut is a light and (mostly) natural/clean scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been into perfumes as they are way too overpowering for me and give me a pain in my head from the strong smell.</li>
            <li>Loved receiving this product which I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I really prefer strong natural coconut scents, but this really is the best I&#x27;ve been able to find!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li>Of course, it was available on amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this smell so much I&#x27;m so upset that bath and body discontinued it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d used this product before, and thus was familiar and knew which one I wanted . . .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the exotic coconut for years from when it was first at Bath &amp; Body.</li>
            <li>It still a pleasant smell but possibly because I don&#x27;t tend to wear scented things my nose can now tell that it doesn&#x27;t smell 100% like coconut.</li>
            <li>and i will be purchasing more real soon.....</li>
            <li>I am not a perfume girl, but decided to give this a chance because I love coconut and this perfume was even better than I expected.</li>
            <li>this is the only one I feel captures any kind of coconut, and I have tried all of there coconut perfumes.</li>
            <li>Its just right.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m glad to have it back after breaking my habit of using it for 3+</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>My wife loves the coconut smell and has tried many different coconut smelling products and none have come close.</li>
            <li>thanks for the candy cane!</li>
            <li>Thanks for the timely shipping!</li>
            <li>It was not available on Prime but the shipping was still pretty quick, the packaging was perfect and it was really exactly what I expected!!</li>
            <li>am a person who uses pure coconut oil for everything I can.</li>
            <li>It def has a nice coconut smell, but it&#x27;s not obviously coconut at first, being that it&#x27;s also really floral, which is the only reason I took a star off.</li>
            <li>I wore it for the first time today and got lots of compliments again, \\&quot;Mainly ones telling me that I smelled like an island or a day at the beach.\\</li>
            <li>they are much cheaper at the bath and body works store.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I filled up a tiny spray bottle of it from the dollar store to carry with me wherever I go!</li>
            <li>Do I really have to say something about this?</li>
            <li>thanks so much.</li>
            <li>I am very upset with the bogus reviews that I read and the lack of coconut.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this scent!</li>
            <li>It is such a sweet scent and makes you feel like you are at the beach.</li>
            <li>I do not use other fragrances as it is either too flowery or strong for me.</li>
            <li>This scent smells like a fresh coconut just cracked open.</li>
            <li>being said, I took off a star because it smells more chemical than I remember it smelling in the past.</li>
            <li>and I was able to buy lots of small sprays and creams which have still lasted</li>
            <li>It smells like vanilla, pure and simple.</li>
            <li>I have a passion for coconut, so needless to say, was disapointed with my past purchases, and numerous shopping trips searching for my perfect perfume.</li>
            <li>It is not to strong and not to weak.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love it reminds me of summer time but can be worn all year long cannot go wrong</li>
            <li> a while after I spray it, but it doesn&#x27;t linger very long.</li>
            <li> yet I&#x27;m down to my last bottle.</li>
            <li> Other coconut scents have a fake sweet coconut smell but not this scent.</li>
            <li> It is disappointing that it is no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li> To me it just smells like perfume, and really no coconut</li>
            <li> It is not worth it.</li>
            <li> the bottle i just received from amazon about a few weeks ago is almost gone....</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the smell is</li>
            <li> Very heavy smell.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a couple of hours too [at least on me it does].</li>
            <li> Winter sucks, and this makes me happier.</li>
            <li> charge a ridiculous amount.</li>
            <li> Definitely a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is expensive and hard to find.</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> Not sure why some people said this smells bad.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that they have discontinued this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was going crazy trying to find this body splash everywhere and was unable to find it.</li>
            <li> Too bad this fragrance has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> this smells bad.</li>
            <li> so bad yuck headaches</li>
            <li> I hate floral smells</li>
            <li> The worst thing Bath and Body Works could&#x27;ve done was discontinue the sell of this fragrance in their stores.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy from amazon tho. they are much cheaper at the bath and body works store. the only thing is they only sell the discontinued product out the store once a year..</li>
            <li> To me it just smells like perfume, and really no coconut.....&lt;br /&gt;which is why you buy.  Gave it away.  If you have allergies to perfume, this will trigger&lt;br /&gt;problems.  Very heavy smell.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells great. It is not to strong and not to weak. Its just right. It smells like suntan lotation and coconuts.</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume I have at the moment, and I use it almost every day! It def has a nice coconut smell, but it&#x27;s not obviously coconut at first, being that it&#x27;s also really floral, which is the only reason I took a star off. I really prefer strong natural coconut scents, but this really is the best I&#x27;ve been able to find! It&#x27;s a shame they don&#x27;t sell this scent it stores anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get lots of compliments a while after I spray it, but it doesn&#x27;t linger very long. Luckily, I filled up a tiny spray bottle of it from the dollar store to carry with me wherever I go! One bottle lasts forevvvver!</li>
            <li> El vendedor es excelente ya he comprado otros productos al mismo y son muy buenos, siempre llega a tiempo y en buen estado.  La fragancia COCO EXÓTICA es realmente divino, me encanta el olor a coco y ademas perdura el olor. Recomiendo este producto a quienes les gusta el coco.</li>
            <li> I love this smell so much I&#x27;m so upset that bath and body discontinued it! Such a great product! And great price!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something about the scent of coconut that transports me back to my native Singapore - be it the smell of coconut oil, coconut milk and yes, coconut fragrance! Bath and Body Works&#x27; Exotic Coconut Splash has a strong hint of coconut, but is by no means overpowering. It is sensual and exotic - a perfect pick-me-up! It lasts for a couple of hours too [at least on me it does].</li>
            <li> Do I really have to say something about this? c&#x27;mom it does not need words. BUY it if you like coconut, it smells just like the beach :)</li>
            <li> I was sent the body spray instead of the splash that is pictured.  I&#x27;d used this product before, and thus was familiar and knew which one I wanted . . . Definitely a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t just like the smell of this, I love it.  It reminds me of summer and the beach.  Winter sucks, and this makes me happier.</li>
            <li> I know that Bath &amp; Body works no longer sells this scent in its stores so I had to go online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a person who uses pure coconut oil for everything I can. I condition my hair with it, I moisturize my skin with it, I keep my mouth healthy by oil pulling with it but it seems that coconut oil doesn&#x27;t smell very strongly of coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of this my husband hates every scent I&#x27;ve ever worn except this one. I wore it for the first time today and got lots of compliments again, \\&quot;Mainly ones telling me that I smelled like an island or a day at the beach.\\&quot; So I&#x27;m glad to have it back after breaking my habit of using it for 3+ years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I took off a star because it smells more chemical than I remember it smelling in the past. It still a pleasant smell but possibly because I don&#x27;t tend to wear scented things my nose can now tell that it doesn&#x27;t smell 100% like coconut. But hey, most people can&#x27;t tell they just think I smell good. Exotic Coconut is a light and (mostly) natural/clean scent.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so good, so delicious! I am not a perfume girl, but decided to give this a chance because I love coconut and this perfume was even better than I expected. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  The worst thing Bath and Body Works could&#x27;ve done was discontinue the sell of this fragrance in their stores.  It&#x27;s very light and refreshing.  I get compliments each time I wear it and the scent stays all day.  You&#x27;ll be turning heads with this one.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and was glad to find it so cheap!  Fast shipping!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> My wife loves the coconut smell and has tried many different coconut smelling products and none have come close. This is the exception, she loves it! She wishes Bath and Body Works would keep it in stock but she is really glad to be able to get it through Amazon!</li>
            <li> thanks so much. the product is great, came on time and in wonderful packaging! thanks for the candy cane!</li>
            <li> Too bad this fragrance has been discontinued. It is expensive and hard to find. I have to buy this from Amazon at $40 a bottle for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and Christmas. Great smell.</li>
            <li> This is honestly one of the best scents Bath &amp; Body Works has and you&#x27;ll receive many compliments, as it is admired by all !</li>
            <li> It smells like vanilla, pure and simple. I am very upset with the bogus reviews that I read and the lack of coconut. It is not worth it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the version I was expecting. The picture is misleading... It does not smell the same!! Not happy</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good coconut perfume and/or body spray, and I have found that most of them smell like vanilla instead. I have a passion for coconut, so needless to say, was disapointed with my past purchases, and numerous shopping trips searching for my perfect perfume. The exotic coconut body spray smells just like coconut. My search is over, and I am very pleased with my purchase. Thanks for the timely shipping!</li>
            <li> I have always loved coconut. This exotic coconut is the best fragrance of coconut. Other coconut scents have a fake sweet coconut smell but not this scent. This scent smells like a fresh coconut just cracked open. I&#x27;ve never been into perfumes as they are way too overpowering for me and give me a pain in my head from the strong smell. I&#x27;ve always preferred to be fresh and clean smelling from a shower with a great body wash than to cover up with a strong perfume. I&#x27;ve been using the exotic coconut for years from when it was first at Bath &amp; Body. It is disappointing that it is no longer available in stores. I do not use other fragrances as it is either too flowery or strong for me. I try to keep writing to bring it back as well as continue to mention it when I go into the store. Perhaps if enough people ask for it it may return. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to me for it not to be in stores. For me, the exotic coconut is their best scent or one of the fragrances that should always be sold. There was an annual sale back in 2006 and I was able to buy lots of small sprays and creams which have still lasted yet I&#x27;m down to my last bottle. I&#x27;m so happy to see that amazon has it. Yay. Love amazon.</li>
            <li> sure does smell like the beach</li>
            <li> Irresistible scent!!!! Love it p</li>
            <li> Got this for my GF. She said they stopped selling it at bath and body works and she loves it. So I got it and she his very happy.</li>
            <li> Producto de mucha sensacion de frescura y excelente aroma que dura buen tiempo en la piel.&lt;br /&gt;deberia venir en presentaciones mas grandes para mantener en el hogar y mas pequeñas para poder tener en la cartera.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something like smelled like coconut and this doesn&#x27;t even come close. I am not sure what the smell is but it isn&#x27;t a nice one.</li>
            <li> this is a great product, and I think bath an body works is at a lose for discontinueing this products</li>
            <li> smells just like you cracked open a coconut with a hint of vanilla! :) A wonderful smell from bath and body works!</li>
            <li> I was going crazy trying to find this body splash everywhere and was unable to find it. Of course, it was available on amazon. It was not available on Prime but the shipping was still pretty quick, the packaging was perfect and it was really exactly what I expected!! Loved receiving this product which I highly recommend. It is such a sweet scent and makes you feel like you are at the beach.</li>
            <li> Not sure why some people said this smells bad.  I guess it&#x27;s a matter of taste. But out of all the coconut scents from bath and body works this is the only one I feel captures any kind of coconut, and I have tried all of there coconut perfumes. It has a creamy coconut smell with a hint of flower. I hate floral smells so when I say hint, it&#x27;s just that. It&#x27;s unfortunate that they have discontinued this fragrance. It&#x27;s by far their best for us coconut lovers. Hopefully they will bring it back as the people sell it charge a ridiculous amount.</li>
            <li> Love it reminds me of summer time but can be worn all year long cannot go wrong I do recommend it.</li>
