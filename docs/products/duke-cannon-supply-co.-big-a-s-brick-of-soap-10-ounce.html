    <ol>
            <li>Bought this for my hubby, he loved it!!!</li>
            <li>Perfect to quench the fires burning in Commie Honey Pots.</li>
            <li>mitt sized palms perfectly.</li>
            <li>Great stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li>The exfoliation aspect feels great against my skin while showering with it.</li>
            <li>Great suds, great aroma, and the size fits my catcher</li>
            <li>This soap is great.</li>
            <li>It smells great.</li>
            <li>Great gift, for a good cause.  </li>

            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Good soap.</li>
            <li>Good scent.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 scents, Naval Supremacy and Accomplishment, and they both smelled really good</li>
            <li>You can buy cheaper bars but they are 1/3rd the size and don&#x27;t smell nearly as good.  </li>
            <li>Which sounds great but its kind of a pain to find someplace to store it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Good soap.</li>
            <li>Cleans well and has a good odor.</li>
            <li>smelled nice.</li>
            <li>Nice scent without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>nice lather and exfoliates nicely.</li>
            <li>Call the fragrance &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; if you must put a label on it, but the scent is light, very nice and my wife loves the smell of it on me.  </li>
            <li>great smell and lather, leaves you clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Does not linger after the shower and does a good job leaving you feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Good soap, nice clean scent and easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>You guys complaining about this product need to get better water.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Justin Bieber, guys who get pedicures and mans scape would be better off using their wife&#x27;s soap and loofa.</li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>It smells like a really sexy cologne for men.</li>
            <li>And if you&#x27;re going to push a product the way this company does, you&#x27;d better measure up.</li>
            <li>Really love the smell on this for my guy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s for the guys who put in 50+ a week and knock it out on their days off by doing more work</li>
            <li>Also, I drink pretty good Scotch, and again, the smell eludes me.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like a fine scotch in a wood den though, more of a mixture of scotch and something as else</li>
            <li>Lathers up nice, smell is just right.</li>
            <li>sent is clean, strong and exotic.</li>
            <li>because soap at that size is EASY TO HOLD.  </li>
            <li>But the scent was described as evoking thoughts of drinking fine scotch in wood-paneled den.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine smelling bar of soap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Its a HUGE bar of soap.  </li>
            <li>Big and great smelling.  </li>
            <li>give it two stars for the size and the charitable donations, but really it&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
            <li>if rather light.</li>
            <li>Fantastic soap.</li>
            <li>The rich lather it produces rinses clean</li>
            <li>I am 6&#x27;1&amp;#34; and perhaps if I was in the NBA this would seem the right size, but it&#x27;s not!  </li>
            <li>It does a good job, too, although guys with smaller hands will be bending over a lot to pick it up after dropping it.</li>
            <li>Only stickler is the steel cut oats can turn into hound&#x27;s teeth that do not feel good in cirtain areas if you catch my drift.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, it just doesn&#x27;t measure up to the hype.</li>
            <li>It fortunately washes right away, but</li>
            <li>arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>and I wish it was cheaper as it does seem to dwindle rather quickly.</li>
            <li>and you pay what would be the cost of 3 normal sized bar or more.  </li>
            <li>While it describes a very masculine smell on the box, the wife and I find it much more neutral.</li>
            <li>It does well in that it is a nice big ass brick of soap</li>
            <li>When the &amp;#34;Most interesting Man In The World&amp;#34; needs advice, (which is quite frequent)</li>
            <li>Personally I was kind of hoping for something manly smelling that my wife would like.  </li>
            <li>Also I think there is a reason actually that most soap is made to fit in the palm of your hand.  </li>
            <li>While the concept is good the bar is just way to big for normal sized hands.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my manly man and I love the scent, it&#x27;s long lasting and mixes nicely with his glorious man</li>
            <li>Young men and old men would love this super size bar of soap and the smell</li>
            <li>As many reviewers have said, this is a BIG ASS bar of soap.</li>
            <li>What scent are these people talking about exactly?  </li>
            <li>Not quite sure why anyone ever buys a second bar.  </li>
            <li>Pretty self explanatory and intuitive functionality.</li>
            <li>Got this for my husband&#x27;s Christmas stocking, and he actually really loves it!</li>
            <li>The only thing that would be more manly would be not cleaning yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also smells good when mixed with sweat because you can&#x27;t make it back to the shower.</li>
            <li>I did what any real man would do, (if there are any others left out there) I had my hands surgically altered to be able to hold and lift this MAN sized bar of soap.</li>
            <li>Wife noticed the scent after I got out of the shower, positive response.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty accomplished, and I don&#x27;t recognize the smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe the scent as anything overly pleasant.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand reviews that state</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very reminiscent of cheap hotel soap from the 80&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;-Dries out my skin.</li>
            <li>There were absolutely zero problems operating it.</li>
            <li>Really manly.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;smells like accomplishment&amp;#34; is a black soap with a very light scent.</li>
            <li>But I tried it anyway and discovered that, like all comically over-sized versions of ordinary household objects, clowns are exactly who it is for.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely order more in the future!</li>
            <li>Kind of like going into a public restroom and smelling the urinal cake doing its job, and its a little sense of reassurance,</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a new sheriff in town</li>
            <li>When I first bought it, was amazed at truly how big it is.</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t be old enough to know the scent of that crappy pink soap from public school bathrooms of the 70&#x27;s but that is what it smells like, its a clean scent but not a favorable clean smell.</li>
            <li>My most basic suggestion is if you must try this soap avoid this black one.</li>
            <li>The soap doesn&#x27;t seem to last that much longer</li>
            <li>and it gets ya clean with a little bit of exfoliation from the steel cut oats.</li>
            <li>also gave a bar to my brother as a kind-of joke (thinking he&#x27;d like it or at least find the packaging hilarious) and he says it&#x27;s his new favorite, though his only complaint is that it lives up to being a &amp;#34;brick&amp;#34; if you drop it on your foot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Funny, I just read a dozen reviews and nobody mentioned that this lathers up and goes on BLACK which is kind of a little freaky.  </li>
            <li>Good soap, wife hates the black color because of the soap scum it leaves.</li>
            <li>Speaking as someone who has been a professional clown for nearly 40 years, I was a little unsure whether this product would be for me, given the slogan &amp;#34;not for clowns&amp;#34; - it seemed pretty emphatic.  </li>
            <li>It is a masculine smelling soap, but does not last for months and months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this is kind of expensive soap</li>
            <li>This soap is very cool, the two things it does is clean and turns you into a bad a</li>
            <li>, I mean what is more manly than cleaning yourself with black soap suds?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> , I mean what is more manly than cleaning yourself with black soap suds?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember the last time I have given a product a single star rating, but this one qualifies.</li>
            <li> A big draw back that the soap residue it leaves behind is black and much more noticeable and has to be cleaned every few days.</li>
            <li> I wish they made their other scents in white.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s black as is the lather which permanently stains white face cloths.</li>
            <li> Giant bar of black soap.</li>
            <li> Maybe the makers could possibly make some sort of line in the bar to break it in half so</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using in a prison shower as soap is extremely hard to hold on to and will be dropped frequently.</li>
            <li> The foam is black, the soap bar does not move effortlessly across your skin, and it is so large that it is awkward to handle, particularly when it sticks to your skin.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that given its size I was hoping it would last even longer.</li>
            <li> just a little sad that it went so quick.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try the other varieties.</li>
            <li> so I was more than a little disappointed by the purchase.</li>
            <li> She was off put by the dark lather, but it does its job.</li>
            <li> Those that get close tell me the scent is deep and complex.</li>
            <li> here is the down side</li>
            <li> After lathering up you realize that you now have to scrub down the walls of your shower, unless of course if your shower walls are black which is probably not the case unless your in a shower is in the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see black foam or residue on me, the shower or anything else.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some Poltroons on here write complaints that this soap leaves black stuff all over the shower and bathroom.</li>
            <li> It does come off black on the skin, but it washes away.</li>
            <li> suds up black</li>
            <li> I used every day in the shower and lasted little less than a month.</li>

            <li> The fragrance is terrible and not masculine AT ALL.</li>

            <li> It is a masculine smelling soap, but does not last for months and months. I used every day in the shower and lasted little less than a month. A big draw back that the soap residue it leaves behind is black and much more noticeable and has to be cleaned every few days.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly. great smell and lather, leaves you clean and refreshed. here is the down side it&#x27;s black as is the lather which permanently stains white face cloths. I don&#x27;t mind but everyone else in the house does.</li>
            <li> Speaking as someone who has been a professional clown for nearly 40 years, I was a little unsure whether this product would be for me, given the slogan &amp;#34;not for clowns&amp;#34; - it seemed pretty emphatic.  But I tried it anyway and discovered that, like all comically over-sized versions of ordinary household objects, clowns are exactly who it is for.  I can only assume that the slogan was some sort of reverse psychology.  Well played, Duke Cannon Supply Company.  Well played.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;smells like accomplishment&amp;#34; is a black soap with a very light scent. Does not linger after the shower and does a good job leaving you feeling clean. While it describes a very masculine smell on the box, the wife and I find it much more neutral. She was off put by the dark lather, but it does its job.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Duke Cannon Big Ass Brick of Soap smells like accomplishment&amp;#34; is without a doubt the finest shower product I have ever used.  The rich lather it produces rinses clean and I don&#x27;t see black foam or residue on me, the shower or anything else.  Call the fragrance &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; if you must put a label on it, but the scent is light, very nice and my wife loves the smell of it on me.  You guys complaining about this product need to get better water.  One caution:  If you like to play &amp;#34;drop the soap&amp;#34; in the shower, try to miss your feet because this truly is one Big Ass Brick Of Soap and it&#x27;s gonna hurt.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hubby, he loved it!!! just a little sad that it went so quick. massive brick of soap, only lasted 2-3 weeks. smelled nice.</li>
            <li> This soap is very cool, the two things it does is clean and turns you into a bad a**. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> It is big. Smells like the barracks bathroom when I was in the army. Love it. John Wayne, Patton and Steve McQueen&lt;br /&gt;Would like it. Justin Bieber, guys who get pedicures and mans scape would be better off using their wife&#x27;s soap and loofa.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. The exfoliation aspect feels great against my skin while showering with it. Nice scent without being overpowering. And that big ass size, what&#x27;s not to like about that!</li>
            <li> It does well in that it is a nice big ass brick of soap and it gets ya clean with a little bit of exfoliation from the steel cut oats. But the scent was described as evoking thoughts of drinking fine scotch in wood-paneled den. And this it does not. It&#x27;s hard to describe the scent as anything overly pleasant. I shouldn&#x27;t be old enough to know the scent of that crappy pink soap from public school bathrooms of the 70&#x27;s but that is what it smells like, its a clean scent but not a favorable clean smell. Kind of like going into a public restroom and smelling the urinal cake doing its job, and its a little sense of reassurance, but it&#x27;s not something you want to smell in someone&#x27;s home.</li>
            <li> Smells like a man...who fells trees...wrestles grizzly bears...and makes a jacket out of the Bears hide. Good soap, nice clean scent and easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> It is indeed a big ass brick of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; but I acknowledge thats subjective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the scent seems to only be on the outside. Now that I&#x27;ve used it a few times, the scent is almost non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, since the soap is black, its a little bit unnerving to see the black soap all over the place and the black streaks on the shower from where it runs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy this again, but I might would try a white colored variety.</li>
            <li> All business no nonsense. Giant bar of black soap. Those that get close tell me the scent is deep and complex. It also smells good when mixed with sweat because you can&#x27;t make it back to the shower. Go ahead, take your beer or scotch with you to the shower and toast Mr. Duke Cannon.</li>
            <li> like the label says its a brick!!  Wife noticed the scent after I got out of the shower, positive response.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my manly man and I love the scent, it&#x27;s long lasting and mixes nicely with his glorious man-musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also gave a bar to my brother as a kind-of joke (thinking he&#x27;d like it or at least find the packaging hilarious) and he says it&#x27;s his new favorite, though his only complaint is that it lives up to being a &amp;#34;brick&amp;#34; if you drop it on your foot. MAN UP, BRO.</li>
            <li> Just a little background info so my review does not seem ego-driven. When the &amp;#34;Most interesting Man In The World&amp;#34; needs advice, (which is quite frequent) He calls me. I was the inspiration for Superman. That being said, Duke Cannon&#x27;s &amp;#34;Big A Bar of Soap, is BIG. &amp;#34;How big?&amp;#34; you ask. Well, lesser men would attempt to cut it into smaller bricks. But, alas, I&#x27;m not lesser men. I did what any real man would do, (if there are any others left out there) I had my hands surgically altered to be able to hold and lift this MAN sized bar of soap. I did not even allow the Surgeon to put me under for the procedure. Duke Cannon&#x27;s Big A Bar of Soap, not for the timid, or faint of heart.</li>
            <li> This is it, Men. The soap that can get you through the tough times still smelling like Curtis LeMay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some Poltroons on here write complaints that this soap leaves black stuff all over the shower and bathroom. Well guess what? This is the soap that is so Manly (yes capital M) that it marks its territory. Hey, Dove for &amp;#34;men&amp;#34;! There&#x27;s a new sheriff in town and he sleeps with your wife when you leave the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sent is clean, strong and exotic. Perfect to quench the fires burning in Commie Honey Pots. And when they face a firing squad at the behest of&lt;br /&gt;Kim Il-sung, they&#x27;ll still be thinking of you, Mac.</li>
            <li> Good soap.Good scent.Gets you clean!!!</li>
            <li> This bar of soap is about the size of 2 regular bars put together. I ordered 2 scents, Naval Supremacy and Accomplishment, and they both smelled really good but the Accomplishment scent is my recommendation! It smells like a really sexy cologne for men. I will definitely order more in the future!</li>
            <li> Big and great smelling.  I think this will be my soap for years to come.  You can buy cheaper bars but they are 1/3rd the size and don&#x27;t smell nearly as good.  Soap for a man&#x27;s man.</li>
            <li> Turned the washcloth black/grey, but my husband loves it anyway!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try the other varieties. Great suds, great aroma, and the size fits my catcher mitt sized palms perfectly.</li>
            <li> Not as big as I thought.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Big Ass Brick of Soap&amp;#34; that is no joke you can cut this big bitch into 1/3&#x27;s and will last you a couple of months each. The smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> nice lather and exfoliates nicely.</li>
            <li> As many reviewers have said, this is a BIG ASS bar of soap. It does a good job, too, although guys with smaller hands will be bending over a lot to pick it up after dropping it. Why not more stars, you ask? It&#x27;s the smell. I&#x27;m pretty accomplished, and I don&#x27;t recognize the smell. Also, I drink pretty good Scotch, and again, the smell eludes me. It&#x27;s not bad, it just doesn&#x27;t measure up to the hype. And if you&#x27;re going to push a product the way this company does, you&#x27;d better measure up.</li>
            <li> 1) While the concept is good the bar is just way to big for normal sized hands.  I am 6&#x27;1&amp;#34; and perhaps if I was in the NBA this would seem the right size, but it&#x27;s not!  Maybe the makers could possibly make some sort of line in the bar to break it in half so non-NBA handed people could use this soap. 2) The soap doesn&#x27;t seem to last that much longer and you pay what would be the cost of 3 normal sized bar or more.  And 3) what seems to be my biggest complaint!! Why in the F%#! Would you decide to make a bar of soap BLACK!!.  After lathering up you realize that you now have to scrub down the walls of your shower, unless of course if your shower walls are black which is probably not the case unless your in a shower is in the 80&#x27;s.  My most basic suggestion is if you must try this soap avoid this black one.</li>
            <li> Great gift, for a good cause.  Young men and old men would love this super size bar of soap and the smell</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand reviews that state this soap has a &amp;#34;pleasant scent&amp;#34;.  What scent are these people talking about exactly?  You know what this soap smells like?  NOTHING.  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  I lathered up and rinsed off twice.  I can&#x27;t smell anything at all.  If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, then I guess this soap is for you.  Personally I was kind of hoping for something manly smelling that my wife would like.  Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a HUGE bar of soap.  Which sounds great but its kind of a pain to find someplace to store it in the shower.  Also I think there is a reason actually that most soap is made to fit in the palm of your hand.  Want to know what that reason is?  Its because soap at that size is EASY TO HOLD.  Unlike this gigantic bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny, I just read a dozen reviews and nobody mentioned that this lathers up and goes on BLACK which is kind of a little freaky.  It fortunately washes right away, but I didn&#x27;t really like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is kind of expensive soap so I was more than a little disappointed by the purchase.</li>
            <li> When I first bought it, was amazed at truly how big it is. It doesn&#x27;t smell like a fine scotch in a wood den though, more of a mixture of scotch and something as else I can&#x27;t put my finger on.</li>
            <li> It is indeed a big bar of soap. Really love the smell on this for my guy.</li>
            <li> Let me start with the good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;-Huge, it&#x27;s going to outlast me.&lt;br /&gt;-Proceeds go to Vets&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;-Smell. The fragrance is terrible and not masculine AT ALL. It&#x27;s very reminiscent of cheap hotel soap from the 80&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;-Dries out my skin. It&#x27;s going to make you itch like Irish Spring did all those years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it two stars for the size and the charitable donations, but really it&#x27;s going in the trash. The generic feminine scent is unacceptable to me.</li>
            <li> Soap for mysogynists.</li>
            <li> Not quite sure why anyone ever buys a second bar.  The foam is black, the soap bar does not move effortlessly across your skin, and it is so large that it is awkward to handle, particularly when it sticks to your skin.  I can&#x27;t remember the last time I have given a product a single star rating, but this one qualifies.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine smelling bar of soap. There were absolutely zero problems operating it. Pretty self explanatory and intuitive functionality.</li>
            <li> Great stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li> This soap is great. Really manly. I wish the smell stuck with you longer though and I wish it was cheaper as it does seem to dwindle rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Solid product. Manly aroma if rather light. Only stickler is the steel cut oats can turn into hound&#x27;s teeth that do not feel good in cirtain areas if you catch my drift.&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t for axe clowns who think a sugary smelling body spray and a douchebag haircut are going to help you score. It&#x27;s for the guys who put in 50+ a week and knock it out on their days off by doing more work</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband&#x27;s Christmas stocking, and he actually really loves it! It smells great. It does come off black on the skin, but it washes away.</li>
            <li> Good soap, wife hates the black color because of the soap scum it leaves. I wish they made their other scents in white.</li>
            <li> Good soap. Cleans well and has a good odor. I also like the scrubbing that the particulates in the soap generate on the skin. My only complaint is that given its size I was hoping it would last even longer. I also like that a portion of the proceeds is suppose to go to support US veterans, something I wish I could confirm.</li>
            <li> Fantastic soap. Lathers up nice, smell is just right. I would not recommend using in a prison shower as soap is extremely hard to hold on to and will be dropped frequently.</li>
            <li> In the shower you need to feel like a man. This big brick of soap will do just that. This is the manliest man soap ever manned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It suds up black, I mean what is more manly than cleaning yourself with black soap suds?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll tell you, nothing. The only thing that would be more manly would be not cleaning yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like that one summer in college where I did that. That was horrible. I reeked. Who does that?</li>
