            <li>i never bought a diferent kind.</li>
            <li>I heard that L&#x27;ancome manufactured it, so if that is true this product is a fraction of the cost with great quality.</li>
            <li>So when I washed it off my skin was more even toned and just better looking!</li>
            <li>Soft Ivory is a perfect match.</li>
            <li>This product was a better price than what I could find elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I am extremely impressed and will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>nice make-up Goes on smoothly and also works as a cover-up.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Good coverage, smooth finish, easy to blend and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is easy to apply, no streaking or caking-</li>
            <li>I am 37 and my skin has changed and I need a high performance foundation at a good price.</li>
            <li>I am 56 with fairly good skin for my age and was really looking forward to using this product since there were so many positive reviews.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I choose either heavier coverage or light...</li>
            <li>It covers so very well but feels so light weight!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is lightweight and goes from liquid to an almost powder finish quickly.</li>
            <li>Great foundation, not too heavy</li>
            <li>My one problem is that sometimes the pump does not work right.  </li>
            <li>It does not accentuate my fine lines, and it provides complete coverage to conceal age spots.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I love trying all the different Kinds of foundations and concealers.</li>
            <li>I like them very much, but i was very disapointed  </li>
            <li>and I certainly will not be purchasing it again.  </li>
            <li>you have lines and medium to large pores</li>
            <li>Anyways I was in  search of a foundation that blurred and covered my fine lines/ wrinkles and large pores (they are only large and noticeable when foundation cakes in them).  </li>
            <li>I really like this foundation.  </li>
            <li>Really should not have  to pay this price and break the lid off to get to the product.</li>
            <li>drugstore and high end!</li>
            <li>I bought 4 or 5 different make-ups and this was definitely my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>It is silky smooth, lasts a long time, didnt make my face break out</li>
            <li>I have bought many kinds and have been let down.</li>
            <li>I hate my winter skin,  but this does a great job with covering imperfections naturally while giving a healthy glowing look.  </li>
            <li>a light feeling- smooths skin and looks natural all day long</li>
            <li>but sure does come close for such little money.</li>
            <li>first off I realized I&#x27;ve been wearing foundation that is too dark.</li>
            <li>I like the pump as it doesnt get all over your hands and isn&#x27;t messy and you don&#x27;t get more or less than you would want in the pump.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great makeup, great price</li>
            <li> The pump on this bottle stopped working after three applications.  It took a lot of product to cover my face.  I would not recommend this product to anyone and I certainly will not be purchasing it again.  F. Parker</li>
            <li> It looks like I have paste on my face when I put it on,It is awful!!!not at all what was represented!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this foundation.  I hate my winter skin,  but this does a great job with covering imperfections naturally while giving a healthy glowing look.  My one problem is that sometimes the pump does not work right.  Has anyone else experienced that?  Over all, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is easy to apply, no streaking or caking- a light feeling- smooths skin and looks natural all day long</li>
            <li> The ad stated &amp;#34;One luxuriously lightweight, luminous makeup formula, providing anti-aging benefits, that instantly evens skin tone and doesn&#x27;t settle into lines and wrinkles&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Well, it does in fact settle into lines, wrinkles and pores. I am 56 with fairly good skin for my age and was really looking forward to using this product since there were so many positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It is lightweight and goes from liquid to an almost powder finish quickly. I don&#x27;t know about the other benefits stated since I can&#x27;t wear this in public without looking like a clown.&lt;br /&gt;If you have lines and medium to large pores I would absolutely NOT recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;So the search continues for a good foundation.....</li>
            <li> Good coverage, smooth finish, easy to blend and smooth.  This product was a better price than what I could find elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation! It does not accentuate my fine lines, and it provides complete coverage to conceal age spots.  I have a little row of age spots between my nose and lips, making it appear that I have a mustache.  Now, no mustache!  My skin tone looks even, because all of the various discolorations are now invisible. My skin feels softer, too.  My husband and I agree that it makes me look 10-15 years younger (I am 60).</li>
            <li> Great product that has been a favorite for many years. I heard that L&#x27;ancome manufactured it, so if that is true this product is a fraction of the cost with great quality.</li>
            <li> I have purchased at least 6 bottles of this makeup. The makeup itself is great. However, every single bottle quits pumping after only a few days use. It is very frustrating because the lid has to be broken off to get to the makeup.  Then, of course, it is nearly impossible to transport without leaking.  Really should not have  to pay this price and break the lid off to get to the product.</li>
            <li> I used a very expensive Guerlain product and have tryed all lines at one time or the other. Recent unemployment sent me to supermarket with a coupon for this. Bought a bottle in sun beige for 11.25. Great coverage. Built in serum. Lasted till about 12 hours. Of course it doesn&#x27;t stack up to expensive chanel&#x27;s etc., but sure does come close for such little money.</li>
            <li> I like them very much, but i was very disapointed  that I did not get the  sensetive line&lt;br /&gt;smoother. I did not get a notes untill May30 that I was not geting it.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with any and all makeup! I have bought and tried tons of foundations from hard candy brand (affordable) to Dior brand (expensive). I lived at Sephora and tried just about everything there! I just bought this (not from Amazon) and I had to review it! I have recently had some bad experiences with foundation. I have bought many kinds and have been let down. I am on a strict budget these days and I can&#x27;t waste money on ones that don&#x27;t work. I am 37 and my skin has changed and I need a high performance foundation at a good price. I absolutely recommend this product! It floats on my skin and covers all my imperfections weightlessly all while looking luminous and beautiful! It covers so very well but feels so light weight! I am extremely impressed and will definitely buy again! So when I washed it off my skin was more even toned and just better looking! This is a must have and you won&#x27;t be disappointed! I have combination skin Ina fair skin tone. Perfect color as well.</li>
            <li> nice make-up Goes on smoothly and also works as a cover-up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I got this...first off I realized I&#x27;ve been wearing foundation that is too dark. I like the pump as it doesnt get all over your hands and isn&#x27;t messy and you don&#x27;t get more or less than you would want in the pump. Love the product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I been using this make up for 5 months and ever since o found this foundation i never bought a diferent kind. This make up goes on perfectly and its not oily at all i cn wear this for 12 hours and it will still look amazing!!! I wear this with primer and use a seting powder and it looks gorgeous! But it can be used alone too.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 or 5 different make-ups and this was definitely my favorite by far. This is the one I would choose and buy again! It is silky smooth, lasts a long time, didnt make my face break out and I dont have to use a lot of it for great coverage. Color option was perfect for me too.</li>
            <li> I like all the products in this line.  Depending on state of my complexion I choose either heavier coverage or light...l are great.&lt;br /&gt;Package was well packed and arrived promptly. Very happy customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the last 6 or 7 years. During that time I&#x27;ve tried Urban Decay, Revlon, MUFE HD, Clinique, Physicians Formula, and Marc Jacobs foundations but given up after a couple weeks and gone back to this. Soft Ivory is a perfect match. It has buildable coverage and I only need a little under my eyes, around my nose if I&#x27;m red there, and on any blemishes to look natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting the last third of the bottle out is annoying but I do prefer the pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> Great foundation, not too heavy, it works great for me!</li>
            <li> I love trying all the different Kinds of foundations and concealers. I am 27 with dry acne prone skin. Have no wrinkles except under my eyes ....which I feel are so bad. Anyways I was in  search of a foundation that blurred and covered my fine lines/ wrinkles and large pores (they are only large and noticeable when foundation cakes in them).  And sadly this foundation was drying, caked in my eye wrinkles and showed every pore.... so back to testing foundations.....drugstore and high end! Ugh</li>
