It didn&#x27;t come with a brush though which is really dumb because theres no other way to apply it! i just used my old Kiss nails brush for it. this stuff rules dude.</li>
            <li> A lot of product, no inside brush, so I ordered another smaller size and will use this as a refill. Can probably refill my other bottle at least 6 - 7 times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true it didn&#x27;t burn and I had some really weak nails sanded from doing my acrylics a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I work with my hands a lot and this product kept the acrylics to my natural nails a day longer than without any primer at all.
