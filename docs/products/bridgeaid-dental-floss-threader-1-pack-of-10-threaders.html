            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>The eye of the threader is of good size for threading floss thread.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have used to clean under my bridge.  </li>
            <li>These are great to clean hard-to-reach areas of dental work.</li>
            <li>When wearing braces these things make it very easy to floss with.  </li>
            <li>They are much better that those in drugstores, grocery stores, and dental offices</li>
            <li>These are much more sturdy</li>
            <li>THESE floss threaders aren&#x27;t like that. :)</li>
            <li>love the curved design which makes it easier to thread under bridge</li>
            <li>It shipped fast for great price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so important to do what You can to take care of Your teeth!</li>
            <li>Ask Your Dentist ,He has samples :-)</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t not a lot of room to try one of the hard sticks under my bridge, but this is perfect, nice, bendy, and uses floss!</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for love them!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t buy these in the stores, and these are the best to help clean under your bridge or other mouth appliances.</li>
            <li>but the price was kind of high.</li>
            <li>I had bought this item before and was familiar with it.  </li>
            <li>so I substituted with these, and even though I honestly find the other ones much better these will do!</li>
            <li>I like the shape and the ease in which I can place my floss and clean under my bridge.  </li>
            <li>I have a bridge and this helps keep the under part clean.  </li>
            <li>so must use floss threaders to clean under them.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just right!</li>
            <li>and I could return them for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>I was given a sample pack at the dentist office &amp; I have used them since I had My first crown put in!</li>
            <li>Any amount available and the turnaround was fast.  </li>
            <li>These are just the right size to use for bridges.  </li>
            <li>Just that short time without using,I found My glum bleeding but after a week it was fine!</li>
            <li>It was first given to me by my dentist.  </li>
            <li>Plus they charged $4.95 for shipping an envelope that was delivered first class mail.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Wasn&#x27;t able to find them in local drug or pharmacies</li>
            <li>This product is exactly like the one my dentist carries.</li>
            <li>the eye is large enough to easily pass the floss through.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>For flossing between a bridge that is &#x27;locked&#x27; very, very helpful...doesn&#x27;t irritate gum tissue, is gentle, highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>so they work MUCH better!&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I really like that it curves.</li>
            <li>I normally get this from my dentist, but had run out.  </li>
            <li>Just what I needed to fit under my bridge - the other brands are too flimsy and bend.  </li>
            <li>The product does exactly what I wanted to do with no long explanation needed to perform what I needed done</li>
            <li>satisfied with this product, not sure about pricing.</li>
            <li>I am sure to get this curve it would have to be thick.</li>
            <li>I recommend to anyone wanting to clean the tight areas in their teeth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a tight fit, and this is the only brand, out of three total, we have found that is small enough for her to be able to thread the floss</li>
            <li>only ones in my local stores are longer, thinner, and much too flexible.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> only ones in my local stores are longer, thinner, and much too flexible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The material is kind of too thick to go through the gap underneath the bridge; and it&#x27;s tough to the gum.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price for hard to find product.  </li>
            <li> disappointed in size and weight of the threader, glad I only ordered the smallest amount.  </li>
            <li> Why couldn&#x27;t they just send what I expected when I ordered.  </li>
            <li> It was as I expected</li>
            <li> I had previously used another floss threader but they were too long and flimsy.</li>
            <li> but it serves the purpose and it is cheaper than other products.</li>
            <li> This is only threader thin enough to get in-between my teeth and maneuver around the retainers on the backs of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have a bridge and one of the teeth is impossible to get under to clean.  </li>
            <li> If you have a bridge you&#x27;ll appreciate the way these little threaders allow&lt;br /&gt;you</li>
            <li> For my bridge the loop section of this threader is slightly too thick for my bridge  </li>
            <li> Each one of these threaders are small and convenient to use.  </li>
            <li> bought this small package to try.</li>
            <li> I lost the small pack once  &amp; couldn&#x27;t find in Drug stores?</li>
            <li> its really hard to use.</li>
            <li> Needle opening is hard to thread through.</li>
            <li> These work, but are too thick.</li>
            <li> It seems little too expensive for what they are</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are very difficult to put through under the bridge because they are so flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This product works well. It seems little too expensive for what they are but it serves the purpose and it is cheaper than other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years to floss around my bridge.  It was first given to me by my dentist.  Each one of these threaders are small and convenient to use.  I have no complaints at all about them.</li>
            <li> I ordered the bridge threaders and the description read  10 per pack, 10 envelopes so I ordered a quantity of six expecting to receive a quantity of 600.  Instead I received a quantity of 60.  When I contacted the company they explained that there was an error in the description and I could return them for a full refund.  Why couldn&#x27;t they just send what I expected when I ordered.  Plus they charged $4.95 for shipping an envelope that was delivered first class mail.  I will not be ordering these again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t buy these in the stores, and these are the best to help clean under your bridge or other mouth appliances. I would be lost without it. There isn&#x27;t not a lot of room to try one of the hard sticks under my bridge, but this is perfect, nice, bendy, and uses floss!</li>
            <li> If you have a metal retainer like I do these are a must.</li>
            <li> I lost the ones my dentist gave me for my braces so I substituted with these, and even though I honestly find the other ones much better these will do!</li>
            <li> Happy with everything</li>
            <li> If you have a bridge you&#x27;ll appreciate the way these little threaders allow&lt;br /&gt;you to floss in the gum line area regular flossing doesn&#x27;t reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wasn&#x27;t able to find them in local drug or pharmacies so was very great to find them on amazon</li>
            <li> When wearing braces these things make it very easy to floss with.  This product is exactly like the one my dentist carries.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for love them!</li>
            <li> I like the shape and the ease in which I can place my floss and clean under my bridge.  Good product.</li>
            <li> These are great to clean hard-to-reach areas of dental work. They are much better that those in drugstores, grocery stores, and dental offices and they are reusable.</li>
            <li> I have a bridge and this helps keep the under part clean.  I would recommend it to anyone with a bridge.</li>
            <li> They are great.  Easy to use. Recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to fit under my bridge - the other brands are too flimsy and bend.  These are much more sturdy</li>
            <li> Product works as it was supposed to work</li>
            <li> I had bought this item before and was familiar with it.  It was as I expected but the price was kind of high.</li>
            <li> Using these for beading in crochet beading projects.  They&#x27;re just right!</li>
            <li> I normally get this from my dentist, but had run out.  same thing and quality. satisfied with this product, not sure about pricing.</li>
            <li> The material is kind of too thick to go through the gap underneath the bridge; and it&#x27;s tough to the gum.</li>
            <li> my wife uses these to floss between her retainer. it&#x27;s a tight fit, and this is the only brand, out of three total, we have found that is small enough for her to be able to thread the floss</li>
            <li> I have two dental bridges so must use floss threaders to clean under them.&lt;br /&gt;The only ones in my local stores are longer, thinner, and much too flexible.&lt;br /&gt;They are very difficult to put through under the bridge because they are so flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;But THESE floss threaders aren&#x27;t like that. :)&lt;br /&gt;These are shorter, thicker, and sturdier so they work MUCH better!&lt;br /&gt;And the eye is large enough to easily pass the floss through.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, best brand I have found.</li>
            <li> love the curved design which makes it easier to thread under bridge</li>
            <li> the only ones my grandson will use!</li>
            <li> For my bridge the loop section of this threader is slightly too thick for my bridge  but I really like that it curves. I am sure to get this curve it would have to be thick. If your bridge is in the back and you enter from the inside of your mouth this could be too short in length.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this small package to try. It shipped fast for great price.</li>
            <li> These are just the right size to use for bridges.  I had previously used another floss threader but they were too long and flimsy.</li>
            <li> The product does exactly what I wanted to do with no long explanation needed to perform what I needed done</li>
            <li> disappointed in size and weight of the threader, glad I only ordered the smallest amount.  My dental assistant suggested I use these threaders</li>
            <li> I was given a sample pack at the dentist office &amp; I have used them since I had My first crown put in! Maybe 7 years ago! They are so GREAT! I lost the small pack once  &amp; couldn&#x27;t find in Drug stores? I found them on Amazon it gives You the choice of 100,Plus a container to keep them in ! Just that short time without using,I found My glum bleeding but after a week it was fine! After 50 It&#x27;s so important to do what You can to take care of Your teeth! This a a great way to do it! if You have a crown You deserve to try this product ! Ask Your Dentist ,He has samples :-)</li>
            <li> This is only threader thin enough to get in-between my teeth and maneuver around the retainers on the backs of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I like the shorter threaders over the longer ones and these are the ones the Dentist recommended by giving them out.</li>
            <li> The floss threader is sturdy but too short for back teeth. The eye of the threader is of good size for threading floss thread.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price for hard to find product.  Any amount available and the turnaround was fast.  Would reccommend to anyone and will order again when needed.</li>
            <li> its really hard to use. Just buy a water pick!</li>
            <li> These work, but are too thick. Needle opening is hard to thread through. Will look for a different floss threader next time.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have used to clean under my bridge.  It is durable and inserts well into the space below my bridge.</li>
            <li> I have a bridge and one of the teeth is impossible to get under to clean.  This threader works well for its intended purpose.  I recommend to anyone wanting to clean the tight areas in their teeth.</li>
            <li> For flossing between a bridge that is &#x27;locked&#x27; very, very helpful...doesn&#x27;t irritate gum tissue, is gentle, highly recommend to anyone.</li>
