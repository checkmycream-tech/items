            <li>Today I will be doing a review on this pretty great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very important that Vitamin C products be packaged in an air-tight and DARK-colored bottle - which this is.  </li>

            <li>I have reviewed many Vitamin C serums, creams, lotions, potions, and you would think I would have one that mimics another, but I have yet to find one that is identical in formulation.</li>
            <li>I think in the end the source of the product matters and being able to take that leap of faith and trust that what you are buying, is what you are getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wrinkle reduction because the product aids with hydration absorption, causing a more &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; appearance&lt;br /&gt;Improvement in skin texture where you may achieve better elasticity and Vitamin C serums with the ingredients listed, have also been proven to help moisturizers perform better by increasing the time the skin stays hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>

            <li>/&gt;Another favorite part of this product that all you Made in USA lovers will love …..</li>
            <li>Because this is not a moisturizer it is more of a toner.</li>

            <li>But, it goes on my face easily and absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>; a unique &amp;#34;stabilized&amp;#34; Vitamin C component.</li>
            <li>This is a really unique vitamin C formulation.</li>
            <li>I used the product twice a day to achieve better results and the serum was gentle enough to be used around my eyes and great for plumping and nourishing lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I first off love the idea of Vitamin C.</li>
            <li>If as much as possible minimizing your use of harmful chemicals in your body, is important and way better than not bothering at all as to what kind of products you have been putting on your skin.</li>
            <li>Many thanks!</li>
            <li>Well, I have been religiously putting on the Joyal C Serum both morning and night after washing and drying my face, and the change is remarkable.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t finished my first bottle yet, but wanted to make sure I had another on hand...</li>
            <li>but when I do, because I probably will, I&#x27;m excited to see if this helps.</li>
            <li>I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li>really cool site lets you test stuff for free</li>
            <li>This particular serum is rich in anti-oxidants and makes my skin look more and more vibrant and healthy every day.  </li>
            <li>The product also absorbed very quickly and started to plump my skin up instantaneously.  </li>
            <li>These kind of chemicals are present in most products we use daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By far this is the best Vitamin C Serum on the market especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Along with the Vit. C,  It is also enriched with vitamin E, ferulic acid, pure vegan hyaluronic acid and many anti-aging formulas to plump skin cells and restore cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure for folks with skin on the normal to oily side, it would be fine.  </li>
            <li>started applying it to my face and neck every evening after I washed, then I add a separate moisturizer on top (that older skin strikes again!).  </li>
            <li>It is grateful minor wrinkles in brown spots on your face definitely worth trying I use it every day with great results .</li>
            <li>It really gives a more luminous</li>
            <li>Overtime, I have seen that good Vit C serums have not only minimized the size of my pores but have made my skin brighter.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After clean my skin, I apply Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li>It’s looks good enough that I don&#x27;t feel embarrassed</li>

            <li>Pretty cool!  </li>
            <li>week I reviewed the Joyal Beauty Vitamin C Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>The company is quick to send a consumer an email with directions for use of their products which saves on printing them on paper and packaging.  </li>
            <li>Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum and Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Serum from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I always start any beauty regimen with a serum because the skin quickly absorbs it</li>
            <li>skin&#x27;s complexion will not only have a better appearance but also be more stable (</li>
            <li>I had no skin reactions and found that it was very easy to use with its pump bottle action.</li>
            <li>This potent anti oxidant serum contains high concentration of 20% of vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>sure the bottle is fine, but too sheer for those of us who are paranoid of light perishing our products with organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with all 3 items that I am currently using.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with all 3 items that I am currently using.  </li>
            <li>Each has it&#x27;s own unique ingredients and the three I have reviewed that sort of were close in formulation, they all behaved differently once applied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to continue using this for several months to continue to see more improvement but so far I&#x27;m extremely impressed with these skincare serums, and I have tried a lot of different things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>had zero issues with interactions and found the serum helped control my &amp;#34;T-Zone&amp;#34; and I experienced less issues with a shiny forehead, nose, and chin come mid-afternoon.  </li>
            <li>The combination of Vitamin C and E together provides a super powerful anti-aging punch.&lt;br</li>

            <li>This is supported by findings that many of the major restorative functions in the body like muscle growth, tissue repair, protein synthesis, and growth hormone release occur mostly, or in some cases only, during sleep, therefore skin cells do benefit and are able to rejuvenate during our nightly sleep cycle.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I like to call that looking still good with a naked face is always a positive.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t asked or expected to leave a positive review, but I&#x27;m happy to give this product 5 stars for all the nourishing, beneficial and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have kicked my skincare routine up a notch in the last few years trying to prevent any more premature aging and take very good care of myself now.</li>
            <li>at night when I applied it seemed to calm, I am going to continue using this serum and see how it does in the longrun....</li>
            <li>serum is light and goes on without any oily feeling, absorbing into your skin quite rapidly.  </li>
            <li>No artificial smell or filmy texture that some Vitamin C products have.</li>
            <li>but I am really surprised and pleased to see that 11 days into my evening application...</li>
            <li>Glycerin is not fully absorbed by the skin</li>
            <li>Using all three products together, my skin is not only brighter, but it feels more moist and smooth, too.</li>
            <li>So far, I love the way it brightens skin as well as provides a dewy and plump appearance.</li>
            <li>this will cause your skin to grow faster, more like it is young.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;“Vitamin C is powerful in the production of collagen, a protein that gives your skin its elasticity.</li>
            <li>It is a powerful antioxidant, shown to reduce the number of sunburned cells as well as reverse age-related damage to skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several weeks and have noticed a nice change in my skin tone and the lessening of wrinkles,</li>
            <li>I never paid much attention to my skin (although I was always good to wear sunscreen) until I hit middle age.  </li>
            <li>received a complimentary sample of Joyal Beauty Vitamin C Serum for testing and review purposes.  </li>
            <li>My sun spots are fading, and I also apply this to my spider veins with success.  </li>
            <li>that I have stated above regarding Joyal Vitamin C serum saving me time in the mornings, and even sometimes in the evenings when I come home late and just need to get to bed, is just one of many reasons why I feel this this serum is an excellent addition for my skin-care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, nice product</li>
            <li>The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft, smooth, and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It dries very fast and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I discovered hyaluronic acid when I tested several samples of other skin care lines, and was very happy with the regeneration of my skin while using it.  </li>
            <li>This is a very effective everyday use serum.</li>
            <li>Be mindful of that if you have to be somewhere right</li>
            <li>Right from day one it went on with no irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a shot of me, right after applying the serum, no makeup.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy feeling, it soaks right into the skin.  </li>
            <li>and if you join their club they will send you another bottle right about the time you are running out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Softening, deeply hydrating and smoothing; Anti-inflammatory and skin-repairing effect, useful for inflammatory skin conditions such as eczema, acne and psoriasis)&lt;br /&gt;-STAY-C 50 (The most stabilized Vitamin C as effective as L-ascorbic acid;</li>
            <li>Joyal Beauty&#x27;s product is protected by an amber bottle with a pump action top and that top is the only criticism I have for any of the Joyal products I have used.  </li>
            <li>, this is my honest opinion.e days I use a soft charcoal sponge to do a light scrubbing and then apply SPF if I’m going to be outside.</li>
            <li>That’s exactly what I’m experiencing right now.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t much care for the smell, but it does go away quickly and it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>But you will see from my posts that I really try to stick to more natural.</li>
            <li>use about four pumps of this in my hand and lightly massage over my face and, while my skin is still wet (sometimes adding a bit more water), I apply the above-mentioned HA serum and that absorb all the water.  </li>
            <li>wise this is in the range of what similar formulated products sell for and my suggestion is shop for the price and formulation (whether you want 20 percent C or other ingredients included) that best suits you as these various brands appear to be from the same US manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Adding Vit C serum to your skin care regimen can help to hold in some of your skin’s natural moisture, prevent or reduce drying and help keep fine line and wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been really interested the vitamin C serum craze and really cautious about the nature of chemicals I use on my skin, and I found Joyal Beauty Natural Skin Care Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum which is alcohol free,</li>
            <li>Just great product, works hard for my skin.</li>
            <li>Since using, I have noticed a reduction in acne when used consistently in the morning and nightly before bedtime.</li>
            <li>No stinging but just a bit of redness that goes away, so I was kinda nervous the first usage.</li>
            <li>Besides, now that my pores are smaller, I can handle products much better, like spray on sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, this serum is lighter &#x3D; absorbs fast!  </li>
            <li>This effect is not short term since Vitamin C serums are potent in repairing and protecting of collagen production and regeneration.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It’s made of Vitamin C, so it enriches the epidermis, and is a health conscience way to pamper yourself and look lovely in your daily skin care</li>
            <li>so I was able to go back and read the email and make sure I had the proper order when it came time to use the serums.</li>
            <li>20% is the highest concentration I can use - anything higher</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is summer time and you will see me outside in the sun most of the day.  </li>
            <li>Although, I am not fond of the pump because the serum is very fluid more than oily, it tends to splash in my palm.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also contains one of my favorite beneficial facial skin aides:  Witch hazel.  </li>
            <li>I use this as the first layer as it&#x27;s the thinnest of the serums I use in my skincare regimen.  </li>
            <li>This company really &amp;#34;gets it&amp;#34; on how to formulate and package their products for maximum efficacy!</li>
            <li>I noticed the quality of this product immediately upon contact with my skin on the first day.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I apply after washing my face in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li>so it’s supposed to be applied first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about 8 months since first using this serum</li>
            <li>Recently though I’ve been reading some interesting articles about all the fillers that are put in moisturizers and make up etc.</li>
            <li>also wanted to touch on the smell of this product just so people are aware.</li>
            <li>but I think I’ve seen enough to say that I love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li>My wife tried this product and she noticed softer skin after the first use.</li>
            <li>If you have the chance to looker younger and have healthier skin, take the chance, you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Joyal Vitamin C serum contains 20% of vitamin C, which is 5% higher than the well-known brand of Skin Ceuticals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, Joyal has printed clearly on their label, they are free of these three classes of chemicals.</li>
            <li>I love Joyal Beauty products and will definitely reorder them once they run out.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Joyal was gracious enough to provide me with a full size product to personally use and then honestly review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You simply apply the product to a clean surface and because it&#x27;s a serum, you apply Joyal Beauty&#x27;s Super Brightening Vitamin C first and allow the skin to absorb the product.</li>
            <li>It comes in a dark amber glass bottle to protect it from the light, with a dropper cap for easy dispensing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>About day 7, my judgmental thinking was turned when I started seeing positive results and</li>
            <li>is always a positive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are also many well-designed scientific studies that demonstrate that topical vitamin C significantly reverses the damage done to the skin by the sun when used for several months.  </li>
            <li>The bottle when applied to the skin absorbs quickly and with no messy residue.</li>
            <li>It projects the serum quickly, so I have learned that if I close my eyes and pump directly onto my lower cheek area, I can avoid wasting the product.  </li>
            <li>The Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum seems to do what it claims so far</li>
            <li>Will certainly be a return customer.</li>
            <li>largely replaced formaldehyde decades ago as a preservative</li>
            <li>I am half way through my first bottle and definitely will order the 2nd bottle, feels good and absolutely love it...</li>
            <li>but my fine lines did not only diminish......</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice little pump style bottle.</li>
            <li>I would not say the skin improvement is immediate on first application, but the next day it starts looking very nice and really kicks it up after a few days of usage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>skin has always been sensitive, but in the last 5 years, it has been more and more difficult to apply just about any kind of moisturizer without having a reaction to any of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This bottle really helps to assist in lightening the skin and for also anti-acne.</li>
            <li>I also noted a decrease in my pores, which is something I really like.</li>
            <li>This has really helped me with wrinkles, crows feet, scar marks and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really fortunate with the appearance of my skin as I ease into my mid forties.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-There’s no irritating scents (I believe they did not add any perfumes or scents to make it smell like oranges like some brands do.</li>
            <li>This product improved my skin so much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I am very picky when it comes to my skincare products.</li>
            <li>I have to notice a real change</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much efficacy in this product.</li>
            <li>I received the above product(s) free of charge from Joyal Beauty.  </li>
            <li>I received the above product(s) free of charge from Joyal Beauty.  </li>
            <li>you always squeeze out too much.</li>
            <li>Skin absorption effortlessly takes place and leaves the surface primed and ready for moisturizer application.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C serum really does work for me-</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve taken several years off my face using primarily vitamin C serums, hyaluronic acid serums, and</li>
            <li>, that is why I really try to take care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>So, this is another thing that I like about the whole Vitamin C serum</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>Thanks Joyal team ..</li>
            <li>All organic products, but especially Vitamin C, must be kept free of air and sunlight.  </li>
            <li>I rub it in gently in circular motions and in minutes it disappears.</li>
            <li>I use Paula’s Choice products and really like them.</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>and i really like how this serum just absorbs without having any sticky feeling of oil or grease.</li>
            <li>The product is reasonable and is guaranteed to work for you.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quite fast.</li>
            <li>I just used it a few days, so far so good.</li>
            <li>And apply new skin care product that I want to test on my neck first.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m right at 50 years old.</li>
            <li>The older I get, the more conscious I am getting about my facial appearance.</li>
            <li>so it is only meant to sort of seal the other ‘good’ ingredients under your skin.  </li>
            <li>but I have seen and tried a variety of brands of these C serums and while there are some slight variations with them (sometimes with more color, sometimes with more of an odor), for the most part, a lot of these seem to be from the same source in similar bottles with different brand name labels on them.  </li>
            <li>I use many other products from this line</li>
            <li>The stable form of Vitamin C is more competitive than some other C serums, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I was excited to put some of those in the back of my drawer to give these a try though.</li>
            <li>I am able to meet my required skin care needs using both Joyal Vitamin C, and Joyal Renewal Serums, in conjunction with each other.  </li>
            <li>I really do use these products and the results (good or bad, are genuinely my own) naturally!    </li>
            <li>I actually really appreciate that this company doesn’t try to sell you a big, full set of stuff.</li>
            <li>The quality of this serum is similar to the many other brands I have tried and absorbs quickly into the skin without any greasy residue or skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Organic Vitamin C serum for just a week, but my skin is noticeably brighter and more even in tone, with less redness.</li>
            <li>Is a slight scent..not overwhelming at all</li>
            <li>At night, I apply Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum and shortly after, I apply Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum (as I did in the morning), but I also apply Joyal Beauty Retinol Correcting Serum at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pump bottle makes it so much easier to use that trying to count the drops from a screw top bottle, which is a waste cause</li>
            <li>On those days I use a soft charcoal sponge to do a light scrubbing and then apply SPF if I’m going to be outside.</li>
            <li>I never really cared about the chemicals in beauty products, I figured they would work better if they weren’t all natural.</li>
            <li>, I still require the necessary essentials for daily nourishment to retain my healthy skin condition.  </li>
            <li>This Super Brightening Vitamin C serum is different from the others.</li>
            <li>particular serum has Vitamin E and C -</li>
            <li>I anticipate them lasting about 6-9 months based on how much is gone out of my bottles right now.</li>
            <li>I anticipate them lasting about 6-9 months based on how much is gone out of my bottles right now.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>, I guess it takes a little more time.</li>
            <li>far, my skin shows no irritation from these products and it works very well.</li>
            <li>So far, my skin shows no irritation from these products and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Obviously not that dewy fresh faced twenty-something anymore</li>
            <li>/&gt;We can change that a bit by starting on your make up or serum by using only a natural skin brightening serum with potent 20% vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li>This 1 ounce bottle seems to be able to get quite a few uses.</li>
            <li>Age spots are essentially sun damage, and vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant, shown to reduce the number of sunburned cells as well as reverse age-related damage to skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been using VC and HA serum for 3 days now, morning and night, after cleaning my face, I put 2 pumps of VC to my palm, then apply to my face with my fingers, followed by the HA serum, again 2 pumps (I add same amount of water to it), apply to my face with fingers, then massage, my skin quickly absorbed the serum</li>
            <li>They are about all thin, and that&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>Really personal customer service set this order up wonderfully right from the start.</li>
            <li>However, if you live in a humid climate (as I do) or have oily skin, you can use this as your moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This ‘pre-test’ allow me to use new cosmetics.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin thus products can cause issues.</li>
            <li>Of course, regular application over a period of many weeks or months is necessary to see the promised benefits&amp;mdash;it is not an instant cure for damaged skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Working beautifully so far!</li>
            <li>After cleansing, I apply Vitamin C first, then Hyaluronic Aced, then Retinol (night only).</li>
            <li>First, I want to mention that I am writing the SAME review on all 3 items on Joyal Beauty Products since I stop using all skin care products except Joyal Beauty listed below.&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>Yes, they made me wary being honest!</li>
            <li>It advised that after a month you will see small results, but more noticeable results take time.</li>
            <li>(If you have dry skin, I strongly suggest following this product with the Ultra Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Serum.)  </li>
            <li>my smile lines have decreased by a tiny bit, I’d say about 15-20% if I had to put a number on it, although if I adhered to the routine better I also might have a little better results</li>
            <li>Five stars for not only the product doing exactly what is described but for the company follow up letter with clear instructions, product info and concern that my package arrive promptly.</li>
            <li>Skin is tight and smooth.</li>
            <li>The formula improves the appearance of the skin by increasing hydration, reducing the effect of fine wrinkles, and removing dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li>Also, it seems skin color changed to lighter color overall because Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum made my scared and bruised area to be even (back to my natural skin tone).  </li>
            <li>Also, it seems skin color changed to lighter color overall because Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum made my scared and bruised area to be even (back to my natural skin tone).  </li>
            <li>and I did notice my skin felt smooth where before I felt a little bump.  </li>
            <li>98% Natural and 72% Organic.</li>
            <li>So far used for a week.</li>
            <li>look.&lt;br /&gt;-Does not sting my incredibly sensitive skin, even after a mask or exfoliating.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Naturally after seeing the composition of this serum I wanted to test it.</li>
            <li>doubled Sun protection).&lt;br /&gt;-Kosher Vegetable Glycerin (Natural skin softener)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oil (Natural moisturizer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>completely (Skin just soaks it up.</li>
            <li>It is real, it is truth that I just use only a week</li>
            <li>So far, this seems to be helping.  </li>
            <li>have to note that I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>suits the sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li>Only this one is gentle which I can continue using it.</li>
            <li>I am 64 years young</li>
            <li>This is really the only serum needed to get both products that I have come to swear by.  </li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t affect it in anyway.  </li>
            <li>Serum, is a must-have beauty regimen for women over 25 years old for the purpose of maintaining that youthful look as well as get the amount of vitamin C as needed.</li>
            <li>I prefer natural, organic ...</li>
            <li>That means that Joyal has packed as much Vitamin C into this bottle as is possible for maximum effect.  </li>
            <li>My pores are smaller and my wrinkles don&#x27;t show as much.  </li>
            <li>It is a complete anti-aging and skin brightning solution in one bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my hands are softer and I don&#x27;t have to use lotion near as often.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying to use healthier products that are all natural</li>
            <li>/&gt;Joyal is 98% Natural, and 72% Organic, there are NO parabens, sulfates, phthalates, or petrochemicals.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with the wrinkles on my face, but I think it&#x27;s to early to tell...</li>
            <li>The delivery was so prompt give the holiday busy season.  </li>
            <li>I really can see the improvement of the skin by using it daily.</li>
            <li>This is really helpful because I usually forget that type of stuff quickly</li>
            <li>It differs from other similar serum in that it only takes a very small amount and it is necessary to massage the face in a circular motion during application to get the best effects from it.</li>
            <li>Because I really like the product which seems to be put together well, addressing a number of issues other than a straight Vitamin C serum would.  </li>
            <li>and they rarely leave any residues that interfere with other products.</li>
            <li>Even on days like today, when I spent the entire day in the sun, hatless, my skin tonight is still soft and smooth, not dry and flaky and itching</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m feeling very soft skin and seeing wrinkles starting to fade from this 57 year old face.</li>
            <li>In order to try new products,  I stop using current skin care and do pre-skin test.  </li>
            <li>This particular serum has a slight yellow/orange tint to it and a slight odor that is similar to what most serums with hyaluronic acids smell like and considering this is one of the ingredients, this is not a surprise.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several similar products and this is very comparable to Kiss My Face Ester-C Serum and</li>
            <li>Just three pumps from the Joyal serum covers both my face and neck, there is no waste as in a vial delivery and since this serum  comes from a pump dispenser, there is no wasted time in screwing back any cap.  </li>
            <li>I am able to eliminate the usage of an extra moisturizer and my usual facial oil.  </li>
            <li>This topical nutrient is safe to combine with all other skin care products and even works synergistically with other antioxidants.  </li>
            <li>This topical nutrient is safe to combine with all other skin care products and even works synergistically with other antioxidants.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rather sceptical about this particular issue because I&#x27;ve had them so long</li>
            <li>If you are already familiar with serums, just skip the next few paragraphs and go to “This serum.”  </li>
            <li>And if the amount is too large, the glycerin dulls your skin</li>
            <li>The first two week after I applied these two serums on my face and neck, my face became very dry and red.</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li>These are common chemical classes the cosmetic industry can use without specifically calling out on an ingredient line, or they do call out the chemical and because the classes are so huge</li>
            <li>C serums in general have some amount of glycerin.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to use it long enough to formulate a real opinion on it.  </li>

            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a complete serum that will put you on the path to repaired, protected, younger looking skin, this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>The length of time from the start of using vitamin C until the visible results are apparent varies with each person.  </li>
            <li>This serum is thin and the most watery of the group.</li>
            <li>It is what we start to loose once we get older.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin especially to sunlight, but this I hope actually will make it</li>
            <li>Always apply this serum first then any other serums you might be using and lastly your moisterizer!</li>

            <li>those who are new to the experiences of Vitamin C and other facial serums, I would like to clear up a misconception regarding how these serums work.  </li>
            <li>For those who are new to the experiences of Vitamin C and other facial serums, I would like to clear up a misconception regarding how these serums work.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised this serum didn&#x27;t have the orange smell that I&#x27;ve come to associate vitamin C serums with, I don&#x27;t mind as long as it works.</li>
            <li>It seems to moisturize a little better than the others, although it is a little more difficult to apply.</li>
            <li>There are three ordinary events that I look forward to each day: my morning cup of freshly brewed coffee, my leisurely skin care routine after my morning shower, and my relaxing beauty regimen in the evenings.  </li>
            <li>I see fine lines around my smile area and very faint crow’s feet.</li>
            <li>I usually follow with moisturizer right away</li>
            <li>We do not need to loose it completely though</li>
            <li>My face feels slightly drier, but a little rich moisturizer helps to solve the problem.</li>

            <li> Many thanks!</li>
            <li> Well, I have been religiously putting on the Joyal C Serum both morning and night after washing and drying my face, and the change is remarkable.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t finished my first bottle yet, but wanted to make sure I had another on hand...</li>
            <li> but when I do, because I probably will, I&#x27;m excited to see if this helps.</li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> really cool site lets you test stuff for free</li>

            <li> The product also absorbed very quickly and started to plump my skin up instantaneously.  </li>
            <li> These kind of chemicals are present in most products we use daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By far this is the best Vitamin C Serum on the market especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Along with the Vit. C,  It is also enriched with vitamin E, ferulic acid, pure vegan hyaluronic acid and many anti-aging formulas to plump skin cells and restore cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure for folks with skin on the normal to oily side, it would be fine.  </li>
            <li> started applying it to my face and neck every evening after I washed, then I add a separate moisturizer on top (that older skin strikes again!).  </li>
            <li> It is grateful minor wrinkles in brown spots on your face definitely worth trying I use it every day with great results .</li>

            <li> week I reviewed the Joyal Beauty Vitamin C Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> The company is quick to send a consumer an email with directions for use of their products which saves on printing them on paper and packaging.  </li>
            <li> Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum and Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Serum from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I always start any beauty regimen with a serum because the skin quickly absorbs it</li>
            <li> skin&#x27;s complexion will not only have a better appearance but also be more stable (</li>
            <li> I had no skin reactions and found that it was very easy to use with its pump bottle action.</li>
            <li> This potent anti oxidant serum contains high concentration of 20% of vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> sure the bottle is fine, but too sheer for those of us who are paranoid of light perishing our products with organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with all 3 items that I am currently using.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with all 3 items that I am currently using.  </li>
            <li> Each has it&#x27;s own unique ingredients and the three I have reviewed that sort of were close in formulation, they all behaved differently once applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue using this for several months to continue to see more improvement but so far I&#x27;m extremely impressed with these skincare serums, and I have tried a lot of different things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> had zero issues with interactions and found the serum helped control my &amp;#34;T-Zone&amp;#34; and I experienced less issues with a shiny forehead, nose, and chin come mid-afternoon.  </li>
            <li> The combination of Vitamin C and E together provides a super powerful anti-aging punch.&lt;br</li>

            <li> This is supported by findings that many of the major restorative functions in the body like muscle growth, tissue repair, protein synthesis, and growth hormone release occur mostly, or in some cases only, during sleep, therefore skin cells do benefit and are able to rejuvenate during our nightly sleep cycle.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I like to call that looking still good with a naked face is always a positive.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t asked or expected to leave a positive review, but I&#x27;m happy to give this product 5 stars for all the nourishing, beneficial and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have kicked my skincare routine up a notch in the last few years trying to prevent any more premature aging and take very good care of myself now.</li>
            <li> at night when I applied it seemed to calm, I am going to continue using this serum and see how it does in the longrun....</li>
            <li> serum is light and goes on without any oily feeling, absorbing into your skin quite rapidly.  </li>
            <li> No artificial smell or filmy texture that some Vitamin C products have.</li>
            <li> but I am really surprised and pleased to see that 11 days into my evening application...</li>
            <li> Glycerin is not fully absorbed by the skin</li>
            <li> Using all three products together, my skin is not only brighter, but it feels more moist and smooth, too.</li>
            <li> So far, I love the way it brightens skin as well as provides a dewy and plump appearance.</li>
            <li> this will cause your skin to grow faster, more like it is young.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;“Vitamin C is powerful in the production of collagen, a protein that gives your skin its elasticity.</li>
            <li> It is a powerful antioxidant, shown to reduce the number of sunburned cells as well as reverse age-related damage to skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several weeks and have noticed a nice change in my skin tone and the lessening of wrinkles,</li>
            <li> I never paid much attention to my skin (although I was always good to wear sunscreen) until I hit middle age.  </li>
            <li> received a complimentary sample of Joyal Beauty Vitamin C Serum for testing and review purposes.  </li>
            <li> My sun spots are fading, and I also apply this to my spider veins with success.  </li>
            <li> that I have stated above regarding Joyal Vitamin C serum saving me time in the mornings, and even sometimes in the evenings when I come home late and just need to get to bed, is just one of many reasons why I feel this this serum is an excellent addition for my skin-care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, nice product</li>
            <li> The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft, smooth, and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It dries very fast and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> I discovered hyaluronic acid when I tested several samples of other skin care lines, and was very happy with the regeneration of my skin while using it.  </li>
            <li> This is a very effective everyday use serum.</li>
            <li> Be mindful of that if you have to be somewhere right</li>
            <li> Right from day one it went on with no irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a shot of me, right after applying the serum, no makeup.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy feeling, it soaks right into the skin.  </li>
            <li> and if you join their club they will send you another bottle right about the time you are running out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Softening, deeply hydrating and smoothing; Anti-inflammatory and skin-repairing effect, useful for inflammatory skin conditions such as eczema, acne and psoriasis)&lt;br /&gt;-STAY-C 50 (The most stabilized Vitamin C as effective as L-ascorbic acid;</li>
            <li> Joyal Beauty&#x27;s product is protected by an amber bottle with a pump action top and that top is the only criticism I have for any of the Joyal products I have used.  </li>
            <li> , this is my honest opinion.e days I use a soft charcoal sponge to do a light scrubbing and then apply SPF if I’m going to be outside.</li>
            <li> That’s exactly what I’m experiencing right now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t much care for the smell, but it does go away quickly and it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> But you will see from my posts that I really try to stick to more natural.</li>
            <li> use about four pumps of this in my hand and lightly massage over my face and, while my skin is still wet (sometimes adding a bit more water), I apply the above-mentioned HA serum and that absorb all the water.  </li>
            <li> wise this is in the range of what similar formulated products sell for and my suggestion is shop for the price and formulation (whether you want 20 percent C or other ingredients included) that best suits you as these various brands appear to be from the same US manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Adding Vit C serum to your skin care regimen can help to hold in some of your skin’s natural moisture, prevent or reduce drying and help keep fine line and wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been really interested the vitamin C serum craze and really cautious about the nature of chemicals I use on my skin, and I found Joyal Beauty Natural Skin Care Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum which is alcohol free,</li>
            <li> Just great product, works hard for my skin.</li>
            <li> Since using, I have noticed a reduction in acne when used consistently in the morning and nightly before bedtime.</li>
            <li> No stinging but just a bit of redness that goes away, so I was kinda nervous the first usage.</li>
            <li> Besides, now that my pores are smaller, I can handle products much better, like spray on sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, this serum is lighter &#x3D; absorbs fast!  </li>
            <li> This effect is not short term since Vitamin C serums are potent in repairing and protecting of collagen production and regeneration.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It’s made of Vitamin C, so it enriches the epidermis, and is a health conscience way to pamper yourself and look lovely in your daily skin care</li>
            <li> so I was able to go back and read the email and make sure I had the proper order when it came time to use the serums.</li>
            <li> 20% is the highest concentration I can use - anything higher</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is summer time and you will see me outside in the sun most of the day.  </li>
            <li> Although, I am not fond of the pump because the serum is very fluid more than oily, it tends to splash in my palm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also contains one of my favorite beneficial facial skin aides:  Witch hazel.  </li>
            <li> I use this as the first layer as it&#x27;s the thinnest of the serums I use in my skincare regimen.  </li>
            <li> This company really &amp;#34;gets it&amp;#34; on how to formulate and package their products for maximum efficacy!</li>
            <li> I noticed the quality of this product immediately upon contact with my skin on the first day.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I apply after washing my face in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li> so it’s supposed to be applied first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 8 months since first using this serum</li>
            <li> Recently though I’ve been reading some interesting articles about all the fillers that are put in moisturizers and make up etc.</li>
            <li> also wanted to touch on the smell of this product just so people are aware.</li>
            <li> but I think I’ve seen enough to say that I love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> My wife tried this product and she noticed softer skin after the first use.</li>
            <li> If you have the chance to looker younger and have healthier skin, take the chance, you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Joyal Vitamin C serum contains 20% of vitamin C, which is 5% higher than the well-known brand of Skin Ceuticals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , Joyal has printed clearly on their label, they are free of these three classes of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I love Joyal Beauty products and will definitely reorder them once they run out.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Joyal was gracious enough to provide me with a full size product to personally use and then honestly review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You simply apply the product to a clean surface and because it&#x27;s a serum, you apply Joyal Beauty&#x27;s Super Brightening Vitamin C first and allow the skin to absorb the product.</li>
            <li> It comes in a dark amber glass bottle to protect it from the light, with a dropper cap for easy dispensing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> About day 7, my judgmental thinking was turned when I started seeing positive results and</li>
            <li> is always a positive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are also many well-designed scientific studies that demonstrate that topical vitamin C significantly reverses the damage done to the skin by the sun when used for several months.  </li>
            <li> The bottle when applied to the skin absorbs quickly and with no messy residue.</li>
            <li> It projects the serum quickly, so I have learned that if I close my eyes and pump directly onto my lower cheek area, I can avoid wasting the product.  </li>
            <li> The Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum seems to do what it claims so far</li>
            <li> Will certainly be a return customer.</li>
            <li> largely replaced formaldehyde decades ago as a preservative</li>
            <li> I am half way through my first bottle and definitely will order the 2nd bottle, feels good and absolutely love it...</li>
            <li> but my fine lines did not only diminish......</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice little pump style bottle.</li>
            <li> I would not say the skin improvement is immediate on first application, but the next day it starts looking very nice and really kicks it up after a few days of usage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin has always been sensitive, but in the last 5 years, it has been more and more difficult to apply just about any kind of moisturizer without having a reaction to any of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> This bottle really helps to assist in lightening the skin and for also anti-acne.</li>
            <li> I also noted a decrease in my pores, which is something I really like.</li>
            <li> This has really helped me with wrinkles, crows feet, scar marks and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really fortunate with the appearance of my skin as I ease into my mid forties.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-There’s no irritating scents (I believe they did not add any perfumes or scents to make it smell like oranges like some brands do.</li>
            <li> This product improved my skin so much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to my skincare products.</li>
            <li> I have to notice a real change</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much efficacy in this product.</li>
            <li> I received the above product(s) free of charge from Joyal Beauty.  </li>
            <li> I received the above product(s) free of charge from Joyal Beauty.  </li>
            <li> you always squeeze out too much.</li>
            <li> Skin absorption effortlessly takes place and leaves the surface primed and ready for moisturizer application.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum really does work for me-</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve taken several years off my face using primarily vitamin C serums, hyaluronic acid serums, and</li>
            <li> , that is why I really try to take care of my skin.  </li>
            <li> So, this is another thing that I like about the whole Vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> Thanks Joyal team ..</li>
            <li> All organic products, but especially Vitamin C, must be kept free of air and sunlight.  </li>
            <li> I rub it in gently in circular motions and in minutes it disappears.</li>
            <li> I use Paula’s Choice products and really like them.</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> and i really like how this serum just absorbs without having any sticky feeling of oil or grease.</li>
            <li> The product is reasonable and is guaranteed to work for you.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quite fast.</li>
            <li> I just used it a few days, so far so good.</li>
            <li> And apply new skin care product that I want to test on my neck first.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m right at 50 years old.</li>
            <li> The older I get, the more conscious I am getting about my facial appearance.</li>
            <li> so it is only meant to sort of seal the other ‘good’ ingredients under your skin.  </li>
            <li> but I have seen and tried a variety of brands of these C serums and while there are some slight variations with them (sometimes with more color, sometimes with more of an odor), for the most part, a lot of these seem to be from the same source in similar bottles with different brand name labels on them.  </li>
            <li> I use many other products from this line</li>
            <li> The stable form of Vitamin C is more competitive than some other C serums, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was excited to put some of those in the back of my drawer to give these a try though.</li>
            <li> I am able to meet my required skin care needs using both Joyal Vitamin C, and Joyal Renewal Serums, in conjunction with each other.  </li>
            <li> I really do use these products and the results (good or bad, are genuinely my own) naturally!    </li>
            <li> I actually really appreciate that this company doesn’t try to sell you a big, full set of stuff.</li>
            <li> The quality of this serum is similar to the many other brands I have tried and absorbs quickly into the skin without any greasy residue or skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Organic Vitamin C serum for just a week, but my skin is noticeably brighter and more even in tone, with less redness.</li>
            <li> Is a slight scent..not overwhelming at all</li>
            <li> At night, I apply Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum and shortly after, I apply Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum (as I did in the morning), but I also apply Joyal Beauty Retinol Correcting Serum at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> pump bottle makes it so much easier to use that trying to count the drops from a screw top bottle, which is a waste cause</li>
            <li> On those days I use a soft charcoal sponge to do a light scrubbing and then apply SPF if I’m going to be outside.</li>
            <li> I never really cared about the chemicals in beauty products, I figured they would work better if they weren’t all natural.</li>
            <li> , I still require the necessary essentials for daily nourishment to retain my healthy skin condition.  </li>
            <li> This Super Brightening Vitamin C serum is different from the others.</li>
            <li> particular serum has Vitamin E and C -</li>
            <li> I anticipate them lasting about 6-9 months based on how much is gone out of my bottles right now.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend this</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> , I guess it takes a little more time.</li>
            <li> far, my skin shows no irritation from these products and it works very well.</li>
            <li> So far, my skin shows no irritation from these products and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Obviously not that dewy fresh faced twenty-something anymore</li>
            <li> /&gt;We can change that a bit by starting on your make up or serum by using only a natural skin brightening serum with potent 20% vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li> This 1 ounce bottle seems to be able to get quite a few uses.</li>
            <li> Age spots are essentially sun damage, and vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant, shown to reduce the number of sunburned cells as well as reverse age-related damage to skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been using VC and HA serum for 3 days now, morning and night, after cleaning my face, I put 2 pumps of VC to my palm, then apply to my face with my fingers, followed by the HA serum, again 2 pumps (I add same amount of water to it), apply to my face with fingers, then massage, my skin quickly absorbed the serum</li>
            <li> They are about all thin, and that&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> Really personal customer service set this order up wonderfully right from the start.</li>
            <li> However, if you live in a humid climate (as I do) or have oily skin, you can use this as your moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This ‘pre-test’ allow me to use new cosmetics.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin thus products can cause issues.</li>
            <li> Of course, regular application over a period of many weeks or months is necessary to see the promised benefits&amp;mdash;it is not an instant cure for damaged skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Working beautifully so far!</li>
            <li> After cleansing, I apply Vitamin C first, then Hyaluronic Aced, then Retinol (night only).</li>
            <li> First, I want to mention that I am writing the SAME review on all 3 items on Joyal Beauty Products since I stop using all skin care products except Joyal Beauty listed below.&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> Yes, they made me wary being honest!</li>
            <li> It advised that after a month you will see small results, but more noticeable results take time.</li>
            <li> (If you have dry skin, I strongly suggest following this product with the Ultra Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Serum.)  </li>
            <li> my smile lines have decreased by a tiny bit, I’d say about 15-20% if I had to put a number on it, although if I adhered to the routine better I also might have a little better results</li>
            <li> Five stars for not only the product doing exactly what is described but for the company follow up letter with clear instructions, product info and concern that my package arrive promptly.</li>
            <li> Skin is tight and smooth.</li>
            <li> The formula improves the appearance of the skin by increasing hydration, reducing the effect of fine wrinkles, and removing dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> Also, it seems skin color changed to lighter color overall because Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum made my scared and bruised area to be even (back to my natural skin tone).  </li>
            <li> Also, it seems skin color changed to lighter color overall because Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum made my scared and bruised area to be even (back to my natural skin tone).  </li>
            <li> and I did notice my skin felt smooth where before I felt a little bump.  </li>
            <li> 98% Natural and 72% Organic.</li>
            <li> So far used for a week.</li>
            <li> look.&lt;br /&gt;-Does not sting my incredibly sensitive skin, even after a mask or exfoliating.&lt;br</li>

            <li> doubled Sun protection).&lt;br /&gt;-Kosher Vegetable Glycerin (Natural skin softener)&lt;br</li>

            <li> completely (Skin just soaks it up.</li>
            <li> It is real, it is truth that I just use only a week</li>
            <li> So far, this seems to be helping.  </li>
            <li> have to note that I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> suits the sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> Only this one is gentle which I can continue using it.</li>
            <li> I am 64 years young</li>
            <li> This is really the only serum needed to get both products that I have come to swear by.  </li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t affect it in anyway.  </li>
            <li> Serum, is a must-have beauty regimen for women over 25 years old for the purpose of maintaining that youthful look as well as get the amount of vitamin C as needed.</li>
            <li> I prefer natural, organic ...</li>
            <li> That means that Joyal has packed as much Vitamin C into this bottle as is possible for maximum effect.  </li>
            <li> My pores are smaller and my wrinkles don&#x27;t show as much.  </li>
            <li> It is a complete anti-aging and skin brightning solution in one bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my hands are softer and I don&#x27;t have to use lotion near as often.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying to use healthier products that are all natural</li>
            <li> /&gt;Joyal is 98% Natural, and 72% Organic, there are NO parabens, sulfates, phthalates, or petrochemicals.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with the wrinkles on my face, but I think it&#x27;s to early to tell...</li>
            <li> The delivery was so prompt give the holiday busy season.  </li>
            <li> I really can see the improvement of the skin by using it daily.</li>
            <li> This is really helpful because I usually forget that type of stuff quickly</li>
            <li> It differs from other similar serum in that it only takes a very small amount and it is necessary to massage the face in a circular motion during application to get the best effects from it.</li>
            <li> Because I really like the product which seems to be put together well, addressing a number of issues other than a straight Vitamin C serum would.  </li>
            <li> and they rarely leave any residues that interfere with other products.</li>
            <li> Even on days like today, when I spent the entire day in the sun, hatless, my skin tonight is still soft and smooth, not dry and flaky and itching</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m feeling very soft skin and seeing wrinkles starting to fade from this 57 year old face.</li>
            <li> In order to try new products,  I stop using current skin care and do pre-skin test.  </li>
            <li> This particular serum has a slight yellow/orange tint to it and a slight odor that is similar to what most serums with hyaluronic acids smell like and considering this is one of the ingredients, this is not a surprise.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several similar products and this is very comparable to Kiss My Face Ester-C Serum and</li>
            <li> Just three pumps from the Joyal serum covers both my face and neck, there is no waste as in a vial delivery and since this serum  comes from a pump dispenser, there is no wasted time in screwing back any cap.  </li>
            <li> I am able to eliminate the usage of an extra moisturizer and my usual facial oil.  </li>
            <li> This topical nutrient is safe to combine with all other skin care products and even works synergistically with other antioxidants.  </li>
            <li> This topical nutrient is safe to combine with all other skin care products and even works synergistically with other antioxidants.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rather sceptical about this particular issue because I&#x27;ve had them so long</li>
            <li> If you are already familiar with serums, just skip the next few paragraphs and go to “This serum.”  </li>
            <li> And if the amount is too large, the glycerin dulls your skin</li>
            <li> The first two week after I applied these two serums on my face and neck, my face became very dry and red.</li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> These are common chemical classes the cosmetic industry can use without specifically calling out on an ingredient line, or they do call out the chemical and because the classes are so huge</li>
            <li> C serums in general have some amount of glycerin.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to use it long enough to formulate a real opinion on it.  </li>
            <li> Give it a try especially if you have sensitive</li>
            <li> skin.&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for review.t a try especially if you have sensitive</li>
            <li> &gt; The serums immediately absorb into my skin, without any oily or greasy residue, leaving my facial skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> This particular serum is not sticky when dry.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a complete serum that will put you on the path to repaired, protected, younger looking skin, this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> length of time from the start of using vitamin C until the visible results are apparent varies with each person.  </li>
            <li> The length of time from the start of using vitamin C until the visible results are apparent varies with each person.  </li>
            <li> This serum is thin and the most watery of the group.</li>
            <li> It is what we start to loose once we get older.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin especially to sunlight, but this I hope actually will make it</li>
            <li> Always apply this serum first then any other serums you might be using and lastly your moisterizer!</li>
            <li> two-step process covers all my basic essentials, the serums immediately absorb into my skin, without any oily or greasy residue, leaving my facial skin soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> those who are new to the experiences of Vitamin C and other facial serums, I would like to clear up a misconception regarding how these serums work.  </li>
            <li> For those who are new to the experiences of Vitamin C and other facial serums, I would like to clear up a misconception regarding how these serums work.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised this serum didn&#x27;t have the orange smell that I&#x27;ve come to associate vitamin C serums with, I don&#x27;t mind as long as it works.</li>
            <li> It seems to moisturize a little better than the others, although it is a little more difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> There are three ordinary events that I look forward to each day: my morning cup of freshly brewed coffee, my leisurely skin care routine after my morning shower, and my relaxing beauty regimen in the evenings.  </li>
            <li> I see fine lines around my smile area and very faint crow’s feet.</li>
            <li> I usually follow with moisturizer right away</li>
            <li> We do not need to loose it completely though</li>
            <li> My face feels slightly drier, but a little rich moisturizer helps to solve the problem.</li>
            <li> The pump applicator allows you to discharge exactly the amount needed and the 1 fl oz should last a long time, as very little is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also explained that serum has small molecules that penetrate further into the skin, while moisturizer has large molecules that sit on the surface.</li>
            <li> really any &#x27;cons&#x27; but do note that it can turn sensitive skin red for a few minutes (sometimes a little longer) upon application.  </li>
            <li> On the days I don’t wear makeup sometimes I get lazy and don’t do my whole routine every morning and night.</li>
            <li> The serum itself in on the thin side, a little more liquidy than I prefer.</li>
            <li> Skin rejuvenates, from deep inside, and eventually after several weeks to at least a month this nourished new skin, reaches our upper surface levels.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far</li>
            <li> Joyal Vitamin C serum also contains MSM, which is a facial softener, and other moisturizing elements such as Aloe, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, and Jojoba Oil, and Joyal Renewal Serum contains all the antioxidants, anti-inflammatory and astringent properties - skin repair properties, including Royal Jelly and Honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The dark spots keep getting lighter and my overall tone is smoother, pores smaller and skin holds moisture.  </li>
            <li> Once my skin breaks out, it takes long time to heal and always ended up visiting dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Brightening of skin and with long term use smoothness in texture</li>
            <li> The bottles are sealed and there is little marketing waste, a positive in my book.  </li>
            <li> I’ve tried some of skin care new products advertised to help even skin , tone that does not contain Acid in the past, but it didn’t improved my skin tone and it ended up wasting my time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You only use a little, it goes a long way and makes your skin look and feel younger.</li>
            <li> Now, in one of my other reviews, I had a comment that I didn&#x27;t have enough wrinkles to review skincare products.  </li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like the spray pump as I can&#x27;t spray it on my face without it getting other places</li>
            <li> It has an immediate soothing effect on dry, flakey skin.  </li>
            <li> It made my skin so dry when I thought it would make it moister.</li>
            <li> You do need to allow it time to dry, though.  </li>
            <li> I am hesitant when it comes to proprietary blends because a company may hide behind what they really are, but I could not state the same when it came to Joyal Beauty.  </li>
            <li> and now I can go out in the public without covering dark spots.  </li>

            <li> I am young so there are really not many things that I need to be concerned off for my skin.</li>

            <li> The bottle is on the smaller size compared to previous serums I have used, but you do not need a lot to get the job done.</li>
            <li> However, sometimes I need to be up and out for a very early appointment and although I am forced to minimize my morning skin care routine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Vitamin C serums and find the Joyal Beauty serum a pleasure, because it is gentler to my sensitive skin, with none of the warmth or tingle I&#x27;ve felt in the past.</li>
            <li> The serum is not oily its a very thin liquidy glides on my face smoothing doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy or oily shine on my face what this serum does is absorbs quickly on to my skin</li>
            <li> in my sixties and my skin needs a little extra pampering.</li>
            <li> These serums generally have a thin consistency due to the fact their molecular character is tiny in order to actually penetrate through the dermis (skin), to nourish the lower layers.  </li>

            <li> so it does not make my skin too dry as described by some other users.</li>
            <li> This time of year when the humidity levels in my house go down, my skin starts to dry out, leaving bumpy, reddish dry skin on my forehead and around my nose.  </li>
            <li> Apply a moisturizer a few minutes later to prevent drying the skin.  </li>
            <li> At this point, in my humble opinion, this Serum gets a definite thumbs up from me.</li>
            <li> So I carefully tried the two serums again.</li>
            <li> This process only takes a few minutes and you then follow up with a moisturizer, and don&#x27;t forget SPF for daytime use.</li>
            <li> I wet my face well,</li>
            <li> If you are looking at this, you are trying to get rid of wrinkles, spots or rough aged skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Below are a few facts regarding the actual skin-care value of Joyal Vitamin C Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After approximately 6 months, the maximum benefits are generally accomplished.  </li>
            <li> The product contains a nice formulation centered around a 20% Vitamin C base and blended with complementary substances including Ferulic and Hyaluronic acids.</li>
            <li> It is a lot less red and less flaky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of multiple serious skin breakouts in the past, my skin looks uneven and some areas on my face has large pores.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> There is also the convenience in that I do not have to take the time to unscrew the cap and then carefully squeeze out the drops, because when I am in a rush, I will squeeze out way too much which is a waste because I am unable to put it back.  </li>
            <li> This serum in comparison to some of the other brands I tried was that this contained what they called &amp;#34;Stay-C</li>
            <li> I know they have other items, which I haven’t tried them yet, but I am planning on trying out other items by Joyal</li>
            <li> I know they have other items, which I haven’t tried them yet, but I am planning on trying out other items by Joyal Beauty.</li>
            <li> I started using this vitamin C serum in combination with two other products from this company: the Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum and the Retinol Correcting Serum.</li>
            <li> with other vitamin C serums, the claims remain the same:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free</li>
            <li> I wanted to tell you it was just like any other Vitamin C serum I have used</li>
            <li> I use organic coconut butter (a small amount) as my moisturizer and cleanse with Simple face wash.  </li>
            <li> You may have seen some of my other products reviews for this company&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li> This helps pull water, and apparently other products, into the skin.</li>
            <li> I put it on at night after the other two serums, before my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use to use something similar from Estee Lauder that cost me $60 for the small size.  </li>
            <li> Joyal Vitamin C serum also incorporates the necessary Hyaluronic Acid, which saves me yet another application step from my usual skin care routine.  </li>
            <li> and this is the only the second Vitamin C product that I have found that I can get away with using during the day.&lt;br /&gt;-Non irritating formula</li>
            <li> At that point I realized the age spots, wrinkles and drooping skin on jowls and neck were only going to get worse if I didn&#x27;t counteract it as much as possible.  </li>
            <li> I’m 32 years old and starting to pay the price for being careless with my skin for my teens and 20’s.</li>
            <li> During the day, the antioxidants Neutralize free radicals UVA, UVB, and infrared radiation A, which are from the harmful rays of the sun, and is the cause of those ugly brown age/sun spots.  </li>

            <li> I like an opaque or dark bottle.</li>
            <li> I always have to put foundation to cover the dark spots on my face before I run to the store and</li>

            <li> If you are in your late twenties and above.</li>
            <li> Their serum comes in a dark brown bottle with an airtight pump dispenser, a sensible delivery that eliminates bacterial contamination.  </li>
            <li> Even their ingredient list is forthcoming when it comes to what makes their ingredients and even down to what purpose they serve.  </li>
            <li> During the aging process, collagen breaks down and wrinkles begin to form.  </li>
            <li> From what I understand, dramatic results require surgery, skin care products have the potential to help with minor changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a skin regimen that takes less time, literally one minute morning and night, including the time I spend massaging the serums into my face.</li>
            <li> than I did the previous week...</li>
            <li> I got serious hydration and in just 7 days noticed smoother skin that remained with the same texture after washing.  </li>
            <li> I am a month and a half into it</li>
            <li> and my skin has been slightly brighter</li>
            <li> so I get less sunburnt this summer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found this to help a lot with razor burn; I have a lot less rash around my neck.</li>
            <li> After approximately 6 months, the maximum benefits are generally accomplished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Collagen is basically what keeps your skin tight and bouncy and youth looking.</li>
            <li> My skin was delicate enough that it took very little to feel a tingling or irritation.  </li>
            <li> This Joyal beauty serum has almost no scent (maybe a little bit like lime zest).  </li>
            <li> and it remove my dark spots from my faces!</li>
            <li> - The aloe base helps it absorb, the witch hazel tones a bit, and the jojoba makes a fine barrier to help moisturize so it stays in, plumping up the skin.  </li>
            <li> I didn’t realized how uneven my skin tone was until now.  </li>
            <li> I didn’t realized how uneven my skin tone was until now.  </li>
            <li> The serum is sparingly released through a pump dispenser and a few droplets will cover the entirety of your face.</li>
            <li> one has a few things I like</li>
            <li> This one is yellow, thin, and watery.  </li>
            <li> My face becomes supple and firm.</li>
            <li> It does have a scent to it, but it&#x27;s not strong at all.</li>
            <li> The solution is slightly thick but is not at all oily and just a few drops massaged into the skin immediately causes a slight tingly sensation because it is so concentrated.  </li>
            <li> But I know skin brightening types of products usually contain some types of Acid and/or Vit C, which usually irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li> Very open in a world of beauty where products are treated like secret potion recipes, that are never to be shared!  </li>
            <li> I also like the pump dispenser - no more dripping and wasting product from a dropper.  </li>
            <li> and I see some small results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product and have hardly seen any changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin tone has not even out completely, but it didn’t get this bad overnight, so I don’t expect overnight miracle from it.</li>
            <li> My skin tone has not even out completely, but it didn’t get this bad overnight, so I don’t expect overnight miracle from it.</li>
            <li> It was just too cold to do anything, but am back at it</li>
            <li> I sincerely mean this, combined with the hyalauronic acid and retinol A....</li>
            <li> Seriously, look at their product line and it&#x27;s serum heaven.</li>
            <li> Even with all of them on, there is no stinging, drying or any other unpleasant side effects.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> I have struggled with poor skin all my life.</li>
            <li> Now dont get me wrong,</li>
            <li> Smoking, tanning and just being generally careless with myself has taken its toll.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> The cold keeps it from oxidizing before your bottle</li>
            <li> I did because of the cold, ice weather.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately this one caused me to break out :(.  </li>
            <li> It doesn’t smell bad but it doesn’t have any fragrance added to it, so don’t expect some flowery smelling serum.</li>
            <li> has an aloe base with witch hazel and jojoba oil</li>

            <li> This Vitamin C serum has a pleasant sweet smell with a hint of citrus. It comes in a dark amber glass bottle to protect it from the light, with a dropper cap for easy dispensing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the bottle is blend of helpful ingredients such as aloe, vitamin C , vitamin E , MSM, hyaluronic acid, and jojoba oil, in an herbal infusion.  The formula improves the appearance of the skin by increasing hydration, reducing the effect of fine wrinkles, and removing dead skin cells.  It has an immediate soothing effect on dry, flakey skin.  I have also found that regular application seems to minimize the appearance of facial pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also many well-designed scientific studies that demonstrate that topical vitamin C significantly reverses the damage done to the skin by the sun when used for several months.  Of course, regular application over a period of many weeks or months is necessary to see the promised benefits&amp;mdash;it is not an instant cure for damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is best applied after a bath or shower.  The solution is slightly thick but is not at all oily and just a few drops massaged into the skin immediately causes a slight tingly sensation because it is so concentrated.  Apply a moisturizer a few minutes later to prevent drying the skin.  Storing it in the refrigerator makes it feel even more refreshing and also keeps it safe from light and heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyal Beauty provided vitamin C serum for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> **I received this free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week I reviewed the Joyal Beauty Vitamin C Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum. This serum in comparison to some of the other brands I tried was that this contained what they called &amp;#34;Stay-C 50&amp;#34; a unique &amp;#34;stabilized&amp;#34; Vitamin C component. This serum is 20% Vitamin C and is very friendly to all skin types. I had no skin reactions and found that it was very easy to use with its pump bottle action. The bottle when applied to the skin absorbs quickly and with no messy residue. There is no odor and it stays in the skin for 72 hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum will help assist you in sun burned skin, sun spots and discoloration. The serum is FDA approved and is made in the USA. 98% Natural and 72% Organic. Alcohol and Cruelty Free. This bottle really helps to assist in lightening the skin and for also anti-acne. Since using, I have noticed a reduction in acne when used consistently in the morning and nightly before bedtime. I also noted a decrease in my pores, which is something I really like. The older I get, the more conscious I am getting about my facial appearance. This has really helped me with wrinkles, crows feet, scar marks and</li>
            <li> So far used for a week. Pretty good.</li>
            <li> Working beautifully so far! I&#x27;ve used several similar products and this is very comparable to Kiss My Face Ester-C Serum and the Suki range in overall results on my skin and freshness. No artificial smell or filmy texture that some Vitamin C products have. I would not say the skin improvement is immediate on first application, but the next day it starts looking very nice and really kicks it up after a few days of usage.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-A little goes a long way.  One or two pumps is plenty to cover your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;-Skin has been looking great. It really gives a more luminous look.&lt;br /&gt;-Does not sting my incredibly sensitive skin, even after a mask or exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s not oily at all.  However, if you live in a humid climate (as I do) or have oily skin, you can use this as your moisturizer.  In the morning, I just use this followed by sunblock sometimes and the skin looks great and my makeup isn&#x27;t greasy.  Then, at night I follow with a moisturizer (emu oil) after this.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Not really any &#x27;cons&#x27; but do note that it can turn sensitive skin red for a few minutes (sometimes a little longer) upon application.  No stinging but just a bit of redness that goes away, so I was kinda nervous the first usage. Be mindful of that if you have to be somewhere right after.&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m sure the bottle is fine, but too sheer for those of us who are paranoid of light perishing our products with organic ingredients.  I like an opaque or dark bottle. Not a problem but just in case, I store in a drawer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really fortunate with the appearance of my skin as I ease into my mid forties. Obviously not that dewy fresh faced twenty-something anymore but that&#x27;s life! So I&#x27;ve been really interested the vitamin C serum craze and really cautious about the nature of chemicals I use on my skin, and I found Joyal Beauty Natural Skin Care Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum which is alcohol free, Paraben-free, cruelty free 100% Vegan and Phthalate Free as well as 72% Organic!    It differs from other similar serum in that it only takes a very small amount and it is necessary to massage the face in a circular motion during application to get the best effects from it. However, like most similar serum products, it is really important to follow with a great moisturizer!    Joyal was gracious enough to provide me with a full size product to personally use and then honestly review. ..I really do use these products and the results (good or bad, are genuinely my own) naturally!    So I have these stubborn sun spots that haven&#x27;t gone away no matter what I have tried. Perfect way to test a brightening serum, methinks!  I&#x27;m rather sceptical about this particular issue because I&#x27;ve had them so long but I am really surprised and pleased to see that 11 days into my evening application...the two darkest spots are noticeably lighter!  At this point, in my humble opinion, this Serum gets a definite thumbs up from me. I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I frankly don’t know a lot about these types of beauty products but I have seen and tried a variety of brands of these C serums and while there are some slight variations with them (sometimes with more color, sometimes with more of an odor), for the most part, a lot of these seem to be from the same source in similar bottles with different brand name labels on them.  This particular serum has a slight yellow/orange tint to it and a slight odor that is similar to what most serums with hyaluronic acids smell like and considering this is one of the ingredients, this is not a surprise.  The quality of this serum is similar to the many other brands I have tried and absorbs quickly into the skin without any greasy residue or skin irritation.  The serum is just as affective at making the skin softer and smoother as the others I have used.  I will not call these types of products any miracle but this like the others I have used seem to work.  Price wise this is in the range of what similar formulated products sell for and my suggestion is shop for the price and formulation (whether you want 20 percent C or other ingredients included) that best suits you as these various brands appear to be from the same US manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I’ve been trying Vit C serums for about several months now.  I know they work it’s just a matter of time and consistency.  If you are already familiar with serums, just skip the next few paragraphs and go to “This serum.”  Otherwise, here it’s my story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has always been sensitive, but in the last 5 years, it has been more and more difficult to apply just about any kind of moisturizer without having a reaction to any of the ingredients.  I began to use Vit C serums.  My skin was delicate enough that it took very little to feel a tingling or irritation.  I began to experiment making my own Vit C serums just to know how much my skin could handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vit C serums in general have some amount of glycerin.  And if the amount is too large, the glycerin dulls your skin (I have tried serums like that).  Glycerin is not fully absorbed by the skin so it is only meant to sort of seal the other ‘good’ ingredients under your skin.  Overtime, I have seen that good Vit C serums have not only minimized the size of my pores but have made my skin brighter.  Not whiter, not shinier, just brighter - like when someone turns the lights on from the inside! Pretty cool!  So I know they work.  Besides, now that my pores are smaller, I can handle products much better, like spray on sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This serum.&lt;br /&gt;So now then, how does this serum compare to others? Well, this serum is lighter &#x3D; absorbs fast!  The consistency is not too heavy or thick, it is more liquid than gelatinous.  It has sodium ascorbyl phosphate rather than ascorbic acid, which means it won’t irritate your skin.  If you have sensitive skin, this is definitely a good Vit C serum to try, it won’t make your skin itchy or tingly.  This Joyal beauty serum has almost no scent (maybe a little bit like lime zest).  It doesn’t compete with your moisturizer, it goes under your moisturizer.  It is milder but with time, you will see the benefits of it.  Vit C serums work! Give it a try especially if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for review.t a try especially if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for review.</li>
            <li> looks great until now except price</li>
            <li> I just used it a few days, so far so good.</li>
            <li> I like it, easy to apply and get a brighter skin after two weeks</li>
            <li> This stuff us great. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this on my face for a week but already I can see a difference. Fantastic. Five stars for not only the product doing exactly what is described but for the company follow up letter with clear instructions, product info and concern that my package arrive promptly.</li>
            <li> I like the Vitamin C and the strength of it.</li>
            <li> I am half way through my first bottle and definitely will order the 2nd bottle, feels good and absolutely love it...</li>
            <li> Products are living up to advertisements  I have very sensitive skin thus products can cause issues. Very pleased and seeing results in first month. Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Organic Vitamin C serum for just a week, but my skin is noticeably brighter and more even in tone, with less redness. I&#x27;ve used other Vitamin C serums and find the Joyal Beauty serum a pleasure, because it is gentler to my sensitive skin, with none of the warmth or tingle I&#x27;ve felt in the past. Right from day one it went on with no irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it along with the Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Acid and Organic Retinol. After cleansing, I apply Vitamin C first, then Hyaluronic Aced, then Retinol (night only). I&#x27;ve never had a skin regimen that takes less time, literally one minute morning and night, including the time I spend massaging the serums into my face. Using all three products together, my skin is not only brighter, but it feels more moist and smooth, too. Even on days like today, when I spent the entire day in the sun, hatless, my skin tonight is still soft and smooth, not dry and flaky and itching like it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Samples provided for review**</li>
            <li> This is a really unique vitamin C formulation. I already use Vitamin C serums but I don’t think I’ve run across a brand that includes some of the ingredients that this one does. Naturally after seeing the composition of this serum I wanted to test it. The company provided a free bottle for my review purposes and I’ve been using it for 2 weeks. So far, I love the way it brightens skin as well as provides a dewy and plump appearance. This effect is not short term since Vitamin C serums are potent in repairing and protecting of collagen production and regeneration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;-Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe) (Moisturizer, Wound healing and anti-inflammatory)&lt;br /&gt;-Hyaluronic acid (to holds in moisture, attract moisture as well as protect collagen and assist the skin in regeneration)&lt;br /&gt;-MSM (Nutrient in superfood.

            <li> This product improved my skin so much.</li>
            <li> i believe this serum made my skin feel rejuvenated, every morning second thing i did was wash, and apply to my face and I have felt more awake each morning than I did the previous week...Now dont get me wrong, at night when I applied it seemed to calm, I am going to continue using this serum and see how it does in the longrun....</li>
            <li> I have struggled with poor skin all my life. I am 33 ans get acne and have always used creams and topicals from the derm. I am getting married in June and decided to try the Joyal vitamin C and hydrolauric serums and my skin has nevet looked and felt so good. I highly recommend! I have not had one pimple in the week ive been using it. I hope the results continue!</li>
            <li> This is a fragrance free, clear liquid that is really good for moisturizing your skin.  My favorite part is the organic factor.  It’s made of Vitamin C, so it enriches the epidermis, and is a health conscience way to pamper yourself and look lovely in your daily skin care regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample for review, and found it to be non-irritating, a greaseless way to indulge in a beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum when applied chilled is a nice morning pick me up.  Joyal Beauty&#x27;s product is protected by an amber bottle with a pump action top and that top is the only criticism I have for any of the Joyal products I have used.  It projects the serum quickly, so I have learned that if I close my eyes and pump directly onto my lower cheek area, I can avoid wasting the product.  Why is this important to me?  Because I really like the product which seems to be put together well, addressing a number of issues other than a straight Vitamin C serum would.  The company is quick to send a consumer an email with directions for use of their products which saves on printing them on paper and packaging.  The bottles are sealed and there is little marketing waste, a positive in my book.  A sample was provided for review.</li>
            <li> It is real, it is truth that I just use only a week and it remove my dark spots from my faces! Amazing! Highly recommend!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have not seen my skin getting any better yet. But this shrink the pimple on my face.</li>
            <li> I love it. I use it morning and night. I&#x27;ve only had it for a week, but I already see improvements.  For starters, when I wake up, my face has a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to it.  I don&#x27;t have to wear foundation anymore.  I also have psoriasis on my forehead.  So far, this seems to be helping.  It is a lot less red and less flaky. I know it says to use a &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; after this serum.  However, I just apply and oil like jojoba, or emu.  I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I really like it. My skin looks much better after applying it twice a day.</li>
            <li> First, I want to mention that I am writing the SAME review on all 3 items on Joyal Beauty Products since I stop using all skin care products except Joyal Beauty listed below.&lt;br /&gt;1) Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum&lt;br /&gt;2) Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum&lt;br /&gt;3) Joyal Beauty Retinol Correcting Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to note that I have extremely sensitive skin.  Once my skin breaks out, it takes long time to heal and always ended up visiting dermatologist.  In order to try new products,  I stop using current skin care and do pre-skin test.  And apply new skin care product that I want to test on my neck first.  If skin on my neck doesn’t show any irritation, I know it will be ok to use it on my face.  This ‘pre-test’ allow me to use new cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of multiple serious skin breakouts in the past, my skin looks uneven and some areas on my face has large pores.  But I know skin brightening types of products usually contain some types of Acid and/or Vit C, which usually irritates my skin.  So,  I was reluctant to try Joyal Beauty products, since it contains Vit C, Acid and Vit E,  when they asked me to test it and write my review on it.  I’ve tried some of skin care new products advertised to help even skin , tone that does not contain Acid in the past, but it didn’t improved my skin tone and it ended up wasting my time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Joyal Beauty has good rating from their customers, I decided to try Joyal Beauty after I did skin tests. My skin test shows no irritation; No breakout from Joyal Beauty products.  So, I start using combination of all 3  Joyal Beauty products as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After clean my skin, I apply Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum and shortly after, I apply Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum. I do this in the morning.  At night, I apply Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum and shortly after, I apply Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum (as I did in the morning), but I also apply Joyal Beauty Retinol Correcting Serum at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been now 10 days since I used all 3 products and my skin feels and looks great. Overall my skin tone is even and less blotch.  Also, it seems skin color changed to lighter color overall because Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum made my scared and bruised area to be even (back to my natural skin tone).  I didn’t realized how uneven my skin tone was until now.  I always have to put foundation to cover the dark spots on my face before I run to the store and now, I don’t have to put any foundation. It’s looks good enough that I don&#x27;t feel embarrassed and now I can go out in the public without covering dark spots.  My skin tone has not even out completely, but it didn’t get this bad overnight, so I don’t expect overnight miracle from it. But, I know it is doing the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, my skin shows no irritation from these products and it works very well. I am very satisfied with all 3 items that I am currently using.  I am so glad that I was introduced to Joyal Beauty product. I know they have other items, which I haven’t tried them yet, but I am planning on trying out other items by Joyal Beauty.ly Joyal Beauty Retinol Correcting Serum at night.

            <li> I am very picky when it comes to my skincare products. I have to notice a real change or else I will move on to something else. Of course you must give products some time to work, your skin may take several regeneration cycles to show changes. I started using this vitamin C serum in combination with two other products from this company: the Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum and the Retinol Correcting Serum. The first thing that impressed me after I placed my order was I received an in-depth email for each product regarding the correct way to use it (including the correct order to use each product in) and the benefits of each product. This is really helpful because I usually forget that type of stuff quickly so I was able to go back and read the email and make sure I had the proper order when it came time to use the serums. They arrived in Amber glass bottles with droppers. I was surprised this serum didn&#x27;t have the orange smell that I&#x27;ve come to associate vitamin C serums with, I don&#x27;t mind as long as it works. It has a very light, watery texture so according to the instructions you use this one first, and can use it in the morning or both morning and night as your skin gets used to the serum. I didn&#x27;t have any problems, my skin drank it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Since I am using three products at once I am assuming the combination of these products gave my skin a triple dose of care and nourishment. Vitamin C for brightening and skin correcting, hyaluronic acid for moisturizing and Retinol for anti-aging. My skin looks bright, even, clear and healthy. I&#x27;m going to continue using this for several months to continue to see more improvement but so far I&#x27;m extremely impressed with these skincare serums, and I have tried a lot of different things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Product sent by Joyal Beauty for testing and review)</li>
            <li> Excellent product. suits the sensitive skin too. Adding Vit C serum to your skin care regimen can help to hold in some of your skin’s natural moisture, prevent or reduce drying and help keep fine line and wrinkles at bay.This product is a great value for money. If you are in your late twenties and above. Include this product in your skincare routine. Improves skin tone, Reduces red spots and acne. Highly recommend this</li>
            <li> Have Tried several Vc prodoct, skinceutical, philosophy.. all makes my skin red irritated, I guess it is because of the acidity. Only this one is gentle which I can continue using it. Hopfully will have brighter complexion.</li>
            <li> The ingredients list looks great, I&#x27;m just waiting to see results then I may upgrade it to a 5.  Set at a nice price point so I&#x27;m giving it a trial on arms and legs, too!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product  It is grateful minor wrinkles in brown spots on your face definitely worth trying I use it every day with great results .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much efficacy in this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this on my face hands legs sun damage this has worked miracles.I will use this from now on.love it what a difference when nothing else worked you will be amazed. Love it!!!!! Pat</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin after two weeks.</li>
            <li> I ordered Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum and Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Serum from Amazon. The first two week after I applied these two serums on my face and neck, my face became very dry and red. I had to stop using them. After one week, the rash and dryness were gradually disappeared and I noticed my face became brighter, and spots were lighter.  I went to their website and checked the ingredients of their products again and they were all really good and natural.  So I carefully tried the two serums again. Now I already used them for almost two weeks. My face has no rash, no redness and my skin looks really great!  I love the products! I will recommend them to my friends and continue ordering the products!</li>
            <li> Always apply this serum first then any other serums you might be using and lastly your moisterizer! A must have nightly ritual.... I use many other products from this line and I could not be any more happier with my results.  I am 64 years young but my skin still looks nice and feels great to the touch.. Hydration is the key to skin health!!</li>
            <li> I find that the Organic Vitamin C leaves clients skin brighter n glowing . Facial lines are less noticeable. I will purchase this product again</li>
            <li> I have reviewed many Vitamin C serums, creams, lotions, potions, and you would think I would have one that mimics another, but I have yet to find one that is identical in formulation. Each has it&#x27;s own unique ingredients and the three I have reviewed that sort of were close in formulation, they all behaved differently once applied. I think in the end the source of the product matters and being able to take that leap of faith and trust that what you are buying, is what you are getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyal Beauty is a company, which satisfies the serum junkie in me. Seriously, look at their product line and it&#x27;s serum heaven. I always start any beauty regimen with a serum because the skin quickly absorbs it and they rarely leave any residues that interfere with other products. What&#x27;s not to love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with other vitamin C serums, the claims remain the same:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free Radical Protection caused from oxidation to sunburns&lt;br /&gt;Antioxidant protection and nourishment&lt;br /&gt;Brightening of skin and with long term use smoothness in texture&lt;br /&gt;Helps reduce age spots, dark spots and such from aging, acne to sun damage&lt;br /&gt;Wrinkle reduction because the product aids with hydration absorption, causing a more &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; appearance&lt;br /&gt;Improvement in skin texture where you may achieve better elasticity and Vitamin C serums with the ingredients listed, have also been proven to help moisturizers perform better by increasing the time the skin stays hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Your skin&#x27;s complexion will not only have a better appearance but also be more stable (better skin&#x27;s health)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big difference is what ingredients were used with Joyal Beauty, is the use of STA.Y-C® 50 The manufacture states this is a more stable and superior form of Vitamin C and the proprietary blend will actually hydrate up to 72 hours. That is a huge difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indications:&lt;br /&gt;You simply apply the product to a clean surface and because it&#x27;s a serum, you apply Joyal Beauty&#x27;s Super Brightening Vitamin C first and allow the skin to absorb the product. This process only takes a few minutes and you then follow up with a moisturizer, and don&#x27;t forget SPF for daytime use. I used the product twice a day to achieve better results and the serum was gentle enough to be used around my eyes and great for plumping and nourishing lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;I had zero issues with interactions and found the serum helped control my &amp;#34;T-Zone&amp;#34; and I experienced less issues with a shiny forehead, nose, and chin come mid-afternoon.  The product also absorbed very quickly and started to plump my skin up instantaneously.  I am hesitant when it comes to proprietary blends because a company may hide behind what they really are, but I could not state the same when it came to Joyal Beauty.  Even their ingredient list is forthcoming when it comes to what makes their ingredients and even down to what purpose they serve.  Very open in a world of beauty where products are treated like secret potion recipes, that are never to be shared!  I am not use to that, so I still even approached the use and performance with greater judgement.  Yes, they made me wary being honest! :) About day 7, my judgmental thinking was turned when I started seeing positive results and because I use Vitamin C serums daily, followed after with retinol, I am again just jumping from one Vitamin C serum to another.  Okay, I must admit that whatever makes up that STA.Y-C® 50, the potion works! I wanted to tell you it was just like any other Vitamin C serum I have used and if you changed the labels I would not be the wiser but my fine lines did not only diminish......they went poof!  I like poof when it comes to wrinkles!  I got serious hydration and in just 7 days noticed smoother skin that remained with the same texture after washing.  That means a face that is clean and residue free still remained hydrated and plumped because the benefits were kept (mine all mine!).  I like to call that looking still good with a naked face is always a positive.  I received the above product(s) free of charge from Joyal Beauty.

            <li> REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my sixties and my skin needs a little extra pampering.Joyal Beauty products  save time and yet all the benefits that are necessary for the skin&#x27;s daily health are still being received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump bottle makes it so much easier to use that trying to count the drops from a screw top bottle, which is a waste cause you always squeeze out too much. Joyal Vitamin C serum incorporates the Hyaluronic Acid which saves another step in your skin routine.  The last step i applying the Joyal Skin Renewal Serum.  Using Vitamin C from Joyal with the Renewal serum covers the routine skin treatment.&lt;br /&gt; Joyal Vitamin C serum also contains MSM, which is a facial softener, and other moisturizing elements such as Aloe, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, and Jojoba Oil, and Joyal Renewal Serum contains all the antioxidants, anti-inflammatory and astringent properties - skin repair properties, including Royal Jelly and Honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The serums immediately absorb into my skin, without any oily or greasy residue, leaving my facial skin soft and hydrated. I can instantly apply my sunscreen and cosmetic makeup, thereby saving me a substantial amount of time, while still meeting all my skin-care requirements.&lt;br /&gt;Some people will see some changes in 2-4 weeks, it may take longer for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another wonderful product from Joyal.  They are also a wonderful company to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample  of Joyal Beauty The Best Organic Vitamin C Serum for my view of the product.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective everyday use serum. The product contains a nice formulation centered around a 20% Vitamin C base and blended with complementary substances including Ferulic and Hyaluronic acids. The serum is sparingly released through a pump dispenser and a few droplets will cover the entirety of your face. Skin absorption effortlessly takes place and leaves the surface primed and ready for moisturizer application. There is a light and pleasant fragrance to the serum that reminds me of wood bark with refreshing hints of citrus afternotes. Designed for twice daily use this is a great serum for use particularly during daylight hours as the Vitamin C compounds are effective at fighting sun damage (be sure to wear alongside a layer of sunscreen). -- product sample provided for review--</li>
            <li> Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m right at 50 years old. I&#x27;ve used and reviewed a lot of vitamin c products, and this is a good one.  Vitamin C serum really does work for me- it takes a while but I&#x27;ve taken several years off my face using primarily vitamin C serums, hyaluronic acid serums, and occasional at home chemical peels and dermaroller sessions.&lt;br /&gt;This one has a few things I like&lt;br /&gt;-20% vitamin C- this will cause your skin to grow faster, more like it is young.  It helps me keep freckles away, and brightens my skin.  20% is the highest concentration I can use - anything higher leaves me looking like I&#x27;ve been slapped and burned for a day.&lt;br /&gt;-It has an aloe base with witch hazel and jojoba oil - The aloe base helps it absorb, the witch hazel tones a bit, and the jojoba makes a fine barrier to help moisturize so it stays in, plumping up the skin.  Also, this combination never breaks me out.&lt;br /&gt;-Contains hyaluronic acid- This is really the only serum needed to get both products that I have come to swear by.  The hyaluronic acid helps skin retain moisture and will help plump very fine lines and under-eye crepe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A serum&#x27;s job is to absorb into skin and deliver nutrients.  It&#x27;s not a moisturizer, so make sure to wear a moisturizer too. This one is yellow, thin, and watery.  They are about all thin, and that&#x27;s good, it absorbs in quickly.&lt;br /&gt; Here&#x27;s a shot of me, right after applying the serum, no makeup.  Now, in one of my other reviews, I had a comment that I didn&#x27;t have enough wrinkles to review skincare products.  Using Vitamin C serum in my skincare routine, every night, is one of the reasons I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives - This has a herbal smell to it- I think it&#x27;s the ferulic acid because it smells like fennel.  I don&#x27;t much care for the smell, but it does go away quickly and it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> Today I will be doing a review on this pretty great product. It is Vitamin C Serum.  Now I first off love the idea of Vitamin C. If you have any knowledge on Vitamin C you would know its benefits are immense. I am young so there are really not many things that I need to be concerned off for my skin. At the same time the best way to continue having the youthful skin that I have in my 20s is to maintain it. There are many products on the market that are great. But you will see from my posts that I really try to stick to more natural. This serum is suppose to help boost your collagen production, increase elasticity and firmness. what is collagen you may ask? Collagen is basically what keeps your skin tight and bouncy and youth looking. It is what we start to loose once we get older. We do not need to loose it completely though, that is why I really try to take care of my skin.  Along with the Vit. C,  It is also enriched with vitamin E, ferulic acid, pure vegan hyaluronic acid and many anti-aging formulas to plump skin cells and restore cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another favorite part of this product that all you Made in USA lovers will love ….. IT IS MADE IN THE USA!!!! &amp;#60;3 yes !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Vitamin C is powerful in the production of collagen, a protein that gives your skin its elasticity. Stabilizing your skin’s levels of vitamin C can help to counteract wrinkle formation by increasing collagen production. It is a powerful antioxidant, shown to reduce the number of sunburned cells as well as reverse age-related damage to skin. While it’s not a replacement for sunscreen, vitamin C protects against and repair UV damage like discoloration and fine lines. “&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is summer time and you will see me outside in the sun most of the day.  This means I am getting burnt, and sun spots and all that good stuff that comes with it. Am I going to stop going in the sun, no. So, this is another thing that I like about the whole Vitamin C serum that no it is not an SPF, but it does help my skin protect against the damage. There is nothing that I dislike more than my beautiful skin getting discolored or having to see fine lines appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To date, I have used this product I believe for about 2 weeks. Honestly, I do see my skin glowing and more clear. I also feel like it has softened my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in a glass bottle with a pump. Although, I am not fond of the pump because the serum is very fluid more than oily, it tends to splash in my palm. Or if I try to put on my fingers then again it is too fluid and drips out of my fingers. But this is not a big problem. I recommend using 3 pumps on your palm and then just use your fingers to apply on to face. This should be enough. Then another two pumps for neck. Just massage the product on to your skin in circles. It dries very fast and absorbs quickly.  After applying the serum, it is recommended by the company that you use a moisturizer. Because this is not a moisturizer it is more of a toner. I would just use any of your best moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I recommend buying this product. Purchase on Amazon  #PROVCS1</li>
            <li> Good Serum, worked great on dark spots. I also have sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t affect it in anyway.  Blends in well too!</li>
            <li> I noticed my face has brightened up quite a bit a month after using this. I am on my second bottle now. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I USED THIS ON MY STRECH MARKS ON MY STOMACH AFTER BIRTH AND I HAVE TO SAY THIS WORKS WONDERFUL I USE IT ALONG WITH MY DERMA ROLLER AND MY SCARS HAVE FADED SO MUCH I AM SO HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS . . . I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN AN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li> Great Product and Excellent Customer Service ..Thanks Joyal team ..</li>
            <li> Amazing, and lovely serum in a pretty bottle. Really personal customer service set this order up wonderfully right from the start. A great, high quality Vitamin C, that smells wonderful,feels light on my skin and brings out a youthful glow. I use it daily in conjunction with my moisturizer with spf and this summer I glow. I love it. A great product..feels soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Try this great product.  After a week or two I started to notice my skin was firmer and even toned.  I definitely recommend Joyal Beauty&#x27;s Organic Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> If as much as possible minimizing your use of harmful chemicals in your body, is important and way better than not bothering at all as to what kind of products you have been putting on your skin. These chemicals with over time use can eventually cause harm than repair or what you intended to hope on your skin/body. These kind of chemicals are present in most products we use daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can change that a bit by starting on your make up or serum by using only a natural skin brightening serum with potent 20% vitamin c serum. I am specifically talking about this great serum for a while now called Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum. This potent anti oxidant serum contains high concentration of 20% of vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it does is that, helps brighten your skin providing antioxidant protection , fading sun spots and discoloration. It also refines skin texture and reduces wrinkles formation. Personally, I love this product for it truly wonders onto my skin. I notice my face&#x27;s color evenness after just three weeks of usage. I have never felt smoother before until I use serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would want to have it forever. Serum, is a must-have beauty regimen for women over 25 years old for the purpose of maintaining that youthful look as well as get the amount of vitamin C as needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost 3 weeks I&#x27;m using this product and have hardly seen any changes in my skin. Will wait for another 2 more as they promised within a month or so you notice changes.</li>
            <li> I could not even use it. It made my skin so dry when I thought it would make it moister.</li>
            <li> I use the Joyal Beauty product every day. It is the best organic product with Vitamin C that helps to get rid of facial wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This wonderful serum is made in the USA!  Contains ingredients that are good for your skin. t contains: hyaluronic acid (holds in moisture and helps skin regenerate), Vitamin C (reverses sun damage), Vitamin E (repairs sun damage, reduces wrinkles), witch hazel (anti-inflammatory, anti-aging, anti-microbial), ferulic acid (anti-oxidant, bonds with the vitamins C&amp;E, multiplying their effects). And it&#x27;s, organic, and contains no parabens or alcohol. I have been using this for several weeks and have noticed a nice change in my skin tone and the lessening of wrinkles, both are a big plus.My skin does feel well moisturized after applying this. It has a pump dispenser which I prefer.  This is another great product from Joyal.  I have recommended it to family and friends.  I received a free sample of Joyal Beauty Vitamin C Serum for testing and review purposes, all opinions are mine own.</li>
            <li> So far so good !!  Love this product!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product....I sincerely mean this, combined with the hyalauronic acid and retinol A....they truly are excellent products for my skin.  I will most definitely recommend to anyone wanting an excellent value for money product.  I use organic coconut butter (a small amount) as my moisturizer and cleanse with Simple face wash.  My skin feels and looks wonderful.  I have never bought or used a product on my skin that is laden with chemicals.  I prefer natural, organic ...kind to skin products.</li>
            <li> bought this vitamin c serum specifically hoping to fade my brown age spot at the corner of my eyes. have used it for three weeks and haven&#x27;t found any obvious improvement yet. will continue to use it and hope it does some miracle!! otherwise it&#x27;s a great serum. not as watery as expected and does not make my skin too dry. I usually follow with moisturizer right away so it does not make my skin too dry as described by some other users. Found it does brighten my skin a bit and hopefully it keeps doing so.</li>
            <li> They sent me the serum for free for reviewing purposes. I couldn´t be happier that they´ve sent it to me! I´m 40 years oled and my skin never looked more beautiful! This serum has hyaluronic acid, 20% vitamin C (which is a lot!), ferulic acid, witch hazel and Vitamin E. Couldn´t be more antioxidant!&lt;br /&gt;Is organic and the best thing is not tested on animals! That for me is a must. I love animals and noone who tests on animals will have a good review from me. Even if the product works great!&lt;br /&gt;Going back to my skin, I´ve been using the serum for a couple of weeks now and eventhough is not enough time, I´ve seen changes on my skin! It looks smoother, plumper, and brighter! The serum has a scent carachteristic from vitamin C serums, I don´t mind it at all. Is a slight scent..not overwhelming at all and I happen to like it! So if you are thinking about getting a vitamin C serum which is organic, doesn´t test in animals and vegan, this is the one for you!</li>
            <li> I regularly use a Vitamin C serum.  I&#x27;ve been using this one from Joyal for several weeks now.  I wanted to use it long enough to formulate a real opinion on it.  I am finding it to be a very effective Vitamin C Serum.  It feels good on my face and is not sticky.  My facial skin is not reacting unfavorably to using it every day.  I&#x27;m seeing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum has a Vitamin C concentration of 20%.  That means that Joyal has packed as much Vitamin C into this bottle as is possible for maximum effect.  This particular serum is rich in anti-oxidants and makes my skin look more and more vibrant and healthy every day.  The anti-oxidants in the Vitamin C serum repair and renew the cells in my facial skin.  The Vitamin C also helps produce collagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also contains one of my favorite beneficial facial skin aides:  Witch hazel.  Witch hazel as a toner is always part of my skin regime, and it seems to keep blemishes at bay.  It helps to minimize the size of my pores.  This serum also includes aloe and hyaluronic acid.  There is a touch of jojoba oil, but I don&#x27;t notice any oiliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scarring on my face is fading.  My skin seems &amp;#34;lifted&amp;#34;, and has more buoyancy and elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to use this serum is to apply it after you&#x27;ve washed your face and the skin is still damp.  It goes on smoothly and spreads thinly and evenly.  This particular serum is not sticky when dry.  You do need to allow it time to dry, though.  Apply moisturizer after the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts longer if you keep it in the frig.  I do, especially during the summer months.  The cold keeps it from oxidizing before your bottle empties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from Joyal Beauty.</li>
            <li> the product arrived as promised and the company follow up and guidance was a very nice extra.  would recommend</li>
            <li> Smooth transaction, good product!</li>
            <li> Very Satisfied with the result after two months. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful Vitamin C Serum ever.  It feels wonderful on my face and I am already seeing results.  My pores are smaller and my wrinkles don&#x27;t show as much.  Used with their Hyaluronic Acid Serum, I feel like I&#x27;ve been to a spa.  Great product.  Will certainly be a return customer.</li>
            <li> I will purchase this again and again.  Great serum.  My skin never felt this good and I did notice my skin felt smooth where before I felt a little bump.  It has to be an ongoing process.  Don&#x27;t stop.  I did because of the cold, ice weather.  It was just too cold to do anything, but am back at it and I do notice my 11&#x27;s disappearing.  I hope it works on my lines above my lips.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Have bought the second one.</li>
            <li> Just great product, works hard for my skin.</li>
            <li> You may have seen some of my other products reviews for this company&#x27;s products.  I truly love them all.  I use this as the first layer as it&#x27;s the thinnest of the serums I use in my skincare regimen.  (If you have dry skin, I strongly suggest following this product with the Ultra Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Serum.)  Vitamin C is a wonderful product to add to your anti-aging skincare routine.  It can be drying though.  I&#x27;m sure for folks with skin on the normal to oily side, it would be fine.  I wet my face well, use about four pumps of this in my hand and lightly massage over my face and, while my skin is still wet (sometimes adding a bit more water), I apply the above-mentioned HA serum and that absorb all the water.  It&#x27;s very important that Vitamin C products be packaged in an air-tight and DARK-colored bottle - which this is.  All organic products, but especially Vitamin C, must be kept free of air and sunlight.  I tuck mine in a drawer when I&#x27;m not using it.  This company really &amp;#34;gets it&amp;#34; on how to formulate and package their products for maximum efficacy!</li>
            <li> Great change of my skin!</li>
            <li> I noticed the quality of this product immediately upon contact with my skin on the first day. Its been 2 weeks and I&#x27;m feeling very soft skin and seeing wrinkles starting to fade from this 57 year old face. Many thanks!</li>
            <li> Seems good so far, we&#x27;ll see....</li>
            <li> I never paid much attention to my skin (although I was always good to wear sunscreen) until I hit middle age.  At that point I realized the age spots, wrinkles and drooping skin on jowls and neck were only going to get worse if I didn&#x27;t counteract it as much as possible.  I discovered hyaluronic acid when I tested several samples of other skin care lines, and was very happy with the regeneration of my skin while using it.  I did some research on Vitamin C and its ability to reverse sun damage, and started applying it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this bottle of Joyal Beauty serum, I read the ingredients and realized it had all the good stuff in one bottle!  It contains: hyaluronic acid (holds in moisture and helps skin regenerate), Vitamin C (reverses sun damage), Vitamin E (repairs sun damage, reduces wrinkles), witch hazel (anti-inflammatory, anti-aging, anti-microbial), ferulic acid (anti-oxidant, bonds with the vitamins C&amp;E, multiplying their effects). And it&#x27;s USA made, organic, and contains no parabens or alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started applying it to my face and neck every evening after I washed, then I add a separate moisturizer on top (that older skin strikes again!).  I&#x27;m very pleased with the results I&#x27;m seeing - newer, fresher, more supple looking skin, and a reduction of the spots and wrinkles from sun damage.  I also like the pump dispenser - no more dripping and wasting product from a dropper.  The pump (along with the brown glass bottle) protects the ingredients from light and air, and allows me to dispense just the amount I need on my fingertip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a complete serum that will put you on the path to repaired, protected, younger looking skin, this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of Joyal Beauty Vitamin C Serum for testing and review purposes.  I wasn&#x27;t asked or expected to leave a positive review, but I&#x27;m happy to give this product 5 stars for all the nourishing, beneficial and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> Excellent product amazing customer support!! Just adore working with that company !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Joyal Vitamin C Serum for about 2 weeks now, and I have to see I see a big difference in the condition of my skin.  This time of year when the humidity levels in my house go down, my skin starts to dry out, leaving bumpy, reddish dry skin on my forehead and around my nose.  Well, I have been religiously putting on the Joyal C Serum both morning and night after washing and drying my face, and the change is remarkable.  The redness and bumps are gone.  I wish I had taken pictures to post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is light and goes on without any oily feeling, absorbing into your skin quite rapidly.  I rub it in gently in circular motions and in minutes it disappears. The pump applicator allows you to discharge exactly the amount needed and the 1 fl oz should last a long time, as very little is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, as I think this Joyal Vitamin C Serum will improve anybody&#x27;s complexion even if you don&#x27;t think you need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided for this review.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a bout 3 weeks now, and use it twice a day. I can see the hyperpigmentation on my face faded sightly, and more evenly toned. My face feels slightly drier, but a little rich moisturizer helps to solve the problem. I will buy another bottle once I finish up the current one. The stable form of Vitamin C is more competitive than some other C serums, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I’m 32 years old and starting to pay the price for being careless with my skin for my teens and 20’s. Smoking, tanning and just being generally careless with myself has taken its toll. I see fine lines around my smile area and very faint crow’s feet. I have kicked my skincare routine up a notch in the last few years trying to prevent any more premature aging and take very good care of myself now. I eat well, drink a ton of water and wear SPF religiously. I fully realize that there are no miracle products. From what I understand, dramatic results require surgery, skin care products have the potential to help with minor changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said I’ve incorporated the Vitamin C serum, Hyaluronic acid and Retinol from this company into my skin care routine. I’m going to just post a brief summary of the products and how they’ve worked for me:&lt;br /&gt;• Vitamin C: This is the first product I apply after washing my face in the morning and at night. It’s thinner so it’s supposed to be applied first. It rubs in well and absorbs within about 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;• Hyaluronic acid: This helps pull water, and apparently other products, into the skin. I apply this serum shortly after the Vitamin C. The instructions note that it doesn’t product water, it helps pull water into the skin, so they recommend you put on a damp face.&lt;br /&gt;• Retinol: I am always hearing about how great retinol is for the skin, so I think it’s probably a beneficial component. I put it on at night after the other two serums, before my moisturizer. My skin feels nice and smooth after all the serums and retinol. Even with all of them on, there is no stinging, drying or any other unpleasant side effects.&lt;br /&gt;• Instructions: One thing that really impressed me was that after I ordered the products I got an email regarding each product with wonderful information and instructions. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve got products and either I’m like “why do I need this” or “when do I use this” or “can I use this with _____ product”. The email explained each product in detail along with step by step instructions for using them together. It explained why the order is important, which I didn’t know. It also explained that serum has small molecules that penetrate further into the skin, while moisturizer has large molecules that sit on the surface. That’s why a serum is so important, I didn’t know that either. I was EXTREMELY impressed with how helpful the information was!&lt;br /&gt;• Routine:  I use Paula’s Choice products and really like them. I was excited to put some of those in the back of my drawer to give these a try though. I still used my face wash, toner and moisturizer from my Paula’s Choice line. I actually really appreciate that this company doesn’t try to sell you a big, full set of stuff. They say in their introductory email to use whichever cleanse, toner and moisturizer that you like.&lt;br /&gt;• Results: Another thing the introductory email said was that it takes awhile to see results with retinol. It advised that after a month you will see small results, but more noticeable results take time. That’s exactly what I’m experiencing right now. I am a month and a half into it and I see some small results. I do so my smile lines have decreased by a tiny bit, I’d say about 15-20% if I had to put a number on it, although if I adhered to the routine better I also might have a little better results The email also points out that Retinol and SPF products are the #1 thing we can do to prevent aging, which I’ve heard time and time again. Just having the company being realistic and give good information makes me trust their brand so much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me admit something real quick. I do my full routine about 70% of the time. I only work 2 days a week and wear makeup about 3 days a week. On the days I don’t wear makeup sometimes I get lazy and don’t do my whole routine every morning and night. On those days I use a soft charcoal sponge to do a light scrubbing and then apply SPF if I’m going to be outside. I have seen good results with this product, but I think I would probably see even more results if I adhered to it better. I have no complaints about it and am very happy with the products. They all came in a nice, dark bottle with a handy pump dispenser. I anticipate them lasting about 6-9 months based on how much is gone out of my bottles right now. I will post more pictures as time goes on. I did receive this to test and review. That has no bearing on the rating or review I give a product, this is my honest opinion.e days I use a soft charcoal sponge to do a light scrubbing and then apply SPF if I’m going to be outside.

            <li> I had to come back and add to my review.  It&#x27;s been about 8 months since first using this serum and I have to say the longer you use it the more benefits you see.  The dark spots keep getting lighter and my overall tone is smoother, pores smaller and skin holds moisture.  I only wish there was a bigger bottle to purchase as one bottle lasts about 6 weeks.  By far this is the best Vitamin C Serum on the market especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Skin is tight and smooth.</li>

You won&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product and also with the customer service -they provided all info how to use this vitamin C serum to get best results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t finished my first bottle yet, but wanted to make sure I had another on hand...I love the Vitamin C Serum! Working great on my skin making the wrinkles softer and finer!</li>
            <li> I like the extra ingredients that come with this Vitamin C Serum, Vitamin E, Jojoba Oil, Aloe, Witch Hazel.  I don&#x27;t like the hyaluronic acid as my face breaks out with this product.  Took me a while to figure out that is what was causing this.  This product comes with a spray pump and not a dropper.  I personally don&#x27;t like the spray pump as I can&#x27;t spray it on my face without it getting other places I don&#x27;t want it.  I do spray it into the palm of my hand then apply with my fingers.  I feel that the serum is thinner than others I have tried and probably because of the spray pump.  It isn&#x27;t greasy feeling, it soaks right into the skin.  My sun spots are fading, and I also apply this to my spider veins with success.  I just now keep it off my face. I&#x27;ve noticed that my hands are softer and I don&#x27;t have to use lotion near as often.  If my face didn&#x27;t break out from using this, I would have given it a 4 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out Mom&#x27;s Thumb Reviews for full review.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to use healthier products that are all natural and I’m happy to say I’ve found Joyal beauty. I never really cared about the chemicals in beauty products, I figured they would work better if they weren’t all natural. Recently though I’ve been reading some interesting articles about all the fillers that are put in moisturizers and make up etc. Did you know parabens largely replaced formaldehyde decades ago as a preservative and it’s a cheap preservative that is added into our beauty products. You can read about all that on your own if you’re interested. I just wanted to bring that up to say that I’m happy Joyal Beauty is all natural and doesn’t use dyes, chemicals or fragrances in their products.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this serum, it’s been a nice boost of moisture before I put on my face cream, it has hyaluronic acid in it to help your skin retain water and helps your moisturizer work better, or whatever you put on top of this serum. I use to use something similar from Estee Lauder that cost me $60 for the small size.  So this is a nice price for what you’re getting and if you join their club they will send you another bottle right about the time you are running out.&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to touch on the smell of this product just so people are aware. It doesn’t smell bad but it doesn’t have any fragrance added to it, so don’t expect some flowery smelling serum. It smells like wood to me, like being outdoors and barbecuing. And when you put on your face cream the smell dissipates.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this serum. It’s a healthier option and will save you some money, it’s also a good moisturizer and my skin has been slightly brighter and I’ve only been using it for about a week now. I was going to wait to do my review but I think I’ve seen enough to say that I love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> The serum is not oily its a very thin liquidy glides on my face smoothing doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy or oily shine on my face what this serum does is absorbs quickly on to my skin i also applied on my neck area where i need it the most and i really like how this serum just absorbs without having any sticky feeling of oil or grease.</li>
            <li> This serum feels so refreshing on the skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue or feel on the skin.  The scent is faint and not bad at all.  This 1 ounce bottle seems to be able to get quite a few uses. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far but it seems to do what it claims!  I have very sensitive skin especially to sunlight, but this I hope actually will make it so I get less sunburnt this summer.  Heres hoping!</li>
            <li> If you are looking at this, you are trying to get rid of wrinkles, spots or rough aged skin. My wife tried this product and she noticed softer skin after the first use. You only use a little, it goes a long way and makes your skin look and feel younger. If you have the chance to looker younger and have healthier skin, take the chance, you will be glad you did. The product is reasonable and is guaranteed to work for you. This vitamin c serum works good for my wife and i&#x27;m sure it will work good for you. The things I like better with Joyal Vitamin C serum is they list all their ingredients and they give you directions how to use the product. It is great to know what you are putting on your skin and how to do it correctly.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more affordable vit c serum but unfortunately this one caused me to break out :(.  It might work well for someone who doesn&#x27;t break out easily.</li>
            <li> easy to be absorbed,no irritation, very good buy. The shipping was quite fast. Satisfied.</li>
            <li> There are three ordinary events that I look forward to each day: my morning cup of freshly brewed coffee, my leisurely skin care routine after my morning shower, and my relaxing beauty regimen in the evenings.  These customary things give me pleasure, regardless of my daily schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reached my sixties, but I still take the time to look attractive and my skin care procedures are important.  However, sometimes I need to be up and out for a very early appointment and although I am forced to minimize my morning skin care routine, I still require the necessary essentials for daily nourishment to retain my healthy skin condition.  Joyal Beauty products have met these requirements regarding saving time and yet still receiving all the benefits that are crucial for the daily health of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my morning cleansing and toner, I use Joyal Vitamin C serum, enriched with Vitamin E and Hyaluronic Acid.  Their serum comes in a dark brown bottle with an airtight pump dispenser, a sensible delivery that eliminates bacterial contamination.  There is also the convenience in that I do not have to take the time to unscrew the cap and then carefully squeeze out the drops, because when I am in a rush, I will squeeze out way too much which is a waste because I am unable to put it back.  Just three pumps from the Joyal serum covers both my face and neck, there is no waste as in a vial delivery and since this serum  comes from a pump dispenser, there is no wasted time in screwing back any cap.  Joyal Vitamin C serum also incorporates the necessary Hyaluronic Acid, which saves me yet another application step from my usual skin care routine.  My last and final step is the application of Joyal Skin Renewal Serum.  Using Joyal Vitamin C in conjunction with the Joyal Renewal serum covers my essential daily skin care requirements.  I am able to eliminate the usage of an extra moisturizer and my usual facial oil.  Joyal Vitamin C serum also contains MSM, which is a facial softener, and other moisturizing elements such as Aloe, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, and Jojoba Oil, and Joyal Renewal Serum contains all the antioxidants, anti-inflammatory and astringent properties - skin repair properties, including Royal Jelly and Honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This two-step process covers all my basic essentials, the serums immediately absorb into my skin, without any oily or greasy residue, leaving my facial skin soft and hydrated.  I can instantly apply my sunscreen and cosmetic makeup, thereby saving me a substantial amount of time, while still meeting all my skin-care requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that I have stated above regarding Joyal Vitamin C serum saving me time in the mornings, and even sometimes in the evenings when I come home late and just need to get to bed, is just one of many reasons why I feel this this serum is an excellent addition for my skin-care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below are a few facts regarding the actual skin-care value of Joyal Vitamin C Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyal is 98% Natural, and 72% Organic, there are NO parabens, sulfates, phthalates, or petrochemicals.  This serum is 100% Vegan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyal Vitamin C serum contains 20% of vitamin C, which is 5% higher than the well-known brand of Skin Ceuticals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C – is an antioxidant that evens skin tone and helps build collagen, which gives skin its elasticity.  During the aging process, collagen breaks down and wrinkles begin to form.  In stabilizing, the skin’s levels of vitamin C this can help to counteract wrinkle formation by increasing collagen production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C helps to diminish Age Spots similar to both chemical peels and lasers.  Age spots are essentially sun damage, and vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant, shown to reduce the number of sunburned cells as well as reverse age-related damage to skin.  Although it is NOT a replacement for sunscreen, vitamin C protects against and may repair UV damage like discoloration and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyal Vitamin C Serum also contains both Vitamin E and Ferulic Acid,&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E – is an antioxidant, it helps to increase firmness while reducing wrinkles, and the combination of Vitamin C &amp; E +Ferulic Acid is used to extend the life and effectiveness of vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyal Vitamin C Serum includes Hyaluronic Acid - one of the most powerful hydrating and moisturizing ingredients on the market today.  HA holds up to 1000 times its weight in water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are new to the experiences of Vitamin C and other facial serums, I would like to clear up a misconception regarding how these serums work.  These serums generally have a thin consistency due to the fact their molecular character is tiny in order to actually penetrate through the dermis (skin), to nourish the lower layers.  Skin rejuvenates, from deep inside, and eventually after several weeks to at least a month this nourished new skin, reaches our upper surface levels.  When our cosmetic make-up wears off during the day, IT HAS NO EFFECT ON THESE SERUMS, the serums have penetrated deep down to the lower levels of the skin.  Therefore, it is important to nourish your skin twice a day with serums.  During the day, the antioxidants Neutralize free radicals UVA, UVB, and infrared radiation A, which are from the harmful rays of the sun, and is the cause of those ugly brown age/sun spots.  The antioxidants also help to protect our skin from the environmental pollution that we are subject to in our daily lives.  Then in the evenings, before bed is another crucial time to nourish your skin.  This is supported by findings that many of the major restorative functions in the body like muscle growth, tissue repair, protein synthesis, and growth hormone release occur mostly, or in some cases only, during sleep, therefore skin cells do benefit and are able to rejuvenate during our nightly sleep cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definition of ‘Growth Hormone” –&lt;br /&gt;A hormone secreted by the pituitary gland that promotes growth of the body and influences the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids.

Applying vitamin C to the skin can be 20 times more effective than taking it orally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application of topical vitamin C is ideal after the morning skin exfoliation to utilize the vitamin C sun-protecting properties.  This topical nutrient is safe to combine with all other skin care products and even works synergistically with other antioxidants.  The combination of Vitamin C and E together provides a super powerful anti-aging punch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length of time from the start of using vitamin C until the visible results are apparent varies with each person.  While some see changes as soon as 2-4 weeks, it may take others 6-8 weeks to see a difference.

            <li> Not bad... The Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum seems to do what it claims so far and I&#x27;ve only been using this product for just two weeks. I love that it has a lot of Vitamin C in because that&#x27;s suppose to be really good for your skin. It comes in a nice little pump style bottle. The bottle is on the smaller size compared to previous serums I have used, but you do not need a lot to get the job done. It does have a scent to it, but it&#x27;s not strong at all. The serum itself in on the thin side, a little more liquidy than I prefer. But, it goes on my face easily and absorbs quickly and it doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of greasy or oily feeling on my face. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with the wrinkles on my face, but I think it&#x27;s to early to tell... But, I have notice my skin has a healthier, brighter look to it and my tone does seem to be improving. This product does also claim to reduce and restore sunburn cells up to 96%... I have not had the pleasure of a sunburn yet this year (yay!) but when I do, because I probably will, I&#x27;m excited to see if this helps. Overall, nice product and I&#x27;ll definitely recommend giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post.

            <li> Joyal has four different serums that are all very similar. This Super Brightening Vitamin C serum is different from the others. This serum is thin and the most watery of the group. It seems to moisturize a little better than the others, although it is a little more difficult to apply. Frankly, the Joyal products are all wonderful, you could simply close your eyes and pick one. They have virtually no odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An important label claim to look for with cosmetics is paraben, sulfate, and phthalate free. These are common chemical classes the cosmetic industry can use without specifically calling out on an ingredient line, or they do call out the chemical and because the classes are so huge, a consumer can never figure out one of these three are in the cosmetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great news, Joyal has printed clearly on their label, they are free of these three classes of chemicals. That&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular serum has Vitamin E and C - both shown to be excellent for skin health. And it contains hyaluronic acid; a compound shown to improve collagen development in skin cells (makes cells fatter so wrinkles disappear). These are all wonderful things to have in a skin treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply this after you have exfoliated or cleaned your skin. Then apply a moisturizer. For men, that&#x27;s about all you need to do. For women, it is best to apply at night; makeup tends to flake off if you do this in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found this to help a lot with razor burn; I have a lot less rash around my neck. My skin feels smooth after applying this. It works well on tender areas. My wife&#x27;s skin glows more than it ever did. She wears less makeup and looks wonderful. It has softened her skin a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product that works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
            <li> I learned Joyal Beauty products from an article, I decided to give it a try. I ordered 4 bottles ( 2 HA serum, 1 VC, and 1 timeless) from Amason. The delivery was so prompt give the holiday busy season.  I have been using VC and HA serum for 3 days now, morning and night, after cleaning my face, I put 2 pumps of VC to my palm, then apply to my face with my fingers, followed by the HA serum, again 2 pumps (I add same amount of water to it), apply to my face with fingers, then massage, my skin quickly absorbed the serum, finally I put on day or night cream. I already see the difference. My skin is so soft, smooth, and comfortable.  My face becomes supple and firm. I haven’t see my skin become brighter, I guess it takes a little more time. I love Joyal Beauty products and will definitely reorder them once they run out. Thanks to Joyal Beauty for such wonderful products!!!</li>
