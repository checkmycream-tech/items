    <ol>
            <li>This product is great!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and it seems to be working great.  </li>
            <li>and I am happy with that</li>
            <li>and I do not see great results.</li>
            <li>are there any good deals available&#x3D;&#x3D;would like to pick up one if so.</li>
            <li>So I think it works good after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I think after 6 bottles in a year and a good diet</li>
            <li>Thank you for reading, and good luck.</li>
            <li>Not a lot of growth but has made my hair beautiful and strong!</li>
            <li>Very pleased</li>
            <li>This product is ok, but does not make great results as promised at the website of Mira.</li>
            <li>On top of that, my hair has begun to grow at a rapid pace!</li>
            <li>and I have been receiving so many compliments on my hair!</li>
            <li>After just one week I have seen amazing results.</li>
            <li>Its amazing , its works the way my wife imagined .</li>
            <li>If u want to try it, go ahead, but honestly I think you&#x27;ll be wasting your time AND your money.</li>
            <li>One of the best products I have used so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong, healthy and shiny!</li>
            <li>I have two observations to make that are very important if you are considering buying Mira Hair Oil:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My grandmother is bald on the top of her head.  </li>
            <li>and it breaks off just by me touching it and styling.</li>
            <li>In about 6 months my hair should be better than before I lost it.</li>
            <li>Most of them said it works.</li>
            <li>This oil is ok.</li>
            <li>hair density did not improve, but it did seem that more hair was falling out.</li>
            <li>If you have dry hair, excellent product</li>
            <li>The problem is that when you start rubbing oil into your scalp the surrounding hair absorbs most of it very quickly.</li>
            <li>This oil is true to it&#x27;s claims in every way!</li>
            <li>At $100 for 5 oz and with so many one star reviews, you cannot possibly, in good conscious, buy it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This might be great for people of different racial backgrounds/ hair types, but not me.</li>
            <li>I would be very interested in other opinions about this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I tried ordering more right away, but Amazon was out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>You will also notice a significant decrease in shedding when you wash and brush your hair.  </li>
            <li>Take a teaspoon or even a tablespoon full of olive oil and try to rub it into your scalp and see what&#x27;s going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but even so, I am able to retain that new growth because my hair is not breaking of anymore!</li>
            <li>I suspect that the scalp massage was responsible for pulling out hair before it was ready to fall out on its own.  </li>
            <li>This product will make your hair soft, manageable and healthy right away.  </li>
            <li>Doing treatments on the scalps is what grows the hair and part of it is using the right products for you.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to pull hair out before it&#x27;s ready to fall out on its own, as this increases the probability that it will NOT grow back.  </li>
            <li>I was very nervous spending so much money on this product but it is worth it!</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work!</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Thanks a million!</li>
            <li>This product started producing results within the first week I started using it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend trying that first.</li>
            <li>If you care about your hair, use healthy hair products without any harmful ingredients and gently massage your scalp regularly.</li>
            <li>I have had positive reviews after using after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>MY HAIR FEEL SO MUCH HEALTHIER AND THICKER.</li>
            <li>This has Really helped my hair.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this costly purchase to anyone really.</li>
            <li>I was very upset and had to buy a wig.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very grateful for having found it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not really what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I know that is said that it makes it grow as fast as nature intended and with me smoking nicotine, drinking coffee, and taking klonopin,</li>
            <li>By the way I leave it on the whole day till I am with a woman.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This product absolutely will not help you.</li>
            <li>But after that first month the growth rate returned to my normal rate of 3/8&amp;#34; every 2 1/2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was gentle with the application of Mira Hair Oil, to avoid this, but it seemed to increase fall out</li>
            <li>100 bucks...at least put it towards a good cause that will be tax deductible.</li>
            <li>You would be better off using coconut oil to moisturizer your hair and promote less breakage which leads to hair growth.</li>
            <li>I tried Surface and had decent results.</li>
            <li>My hair is not falling out near as much</li>
            <li>I saved up 3 months worth of money for nothing, and I still have a teaspoon of oil left in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Hair grows with normal rate.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal rate</li>
            <li>I did see a lot of new growth than I did when I would have my hair in kinky twist.  </li>
            <li>I expect to order a new bottle of mira hair oil to soon .</li>
            <li>Took about 7 weeks to get here (email confirmation estimated 6-8 weeks) and I live in Ohio.</li>
            <li>I did exactly as they said, only try using the amount recommended 1/2-1tsp per use</li>
            <li>My hair is growing in thicker and the hair that I have left has stopped shedding as much!</li>
            <li>At first it seemed that my hair actually grew slower.  </li>
            <li>The only positive thing I can say about this oil is the scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am a 33 year veteran cosmetologist, and I color my hair every two and a half weeks because it already grows more quickly than the average rate of 1/2&amp;#34; per month.  </li>
            <li>I have the most delicate hair on the planet</li>
            <li>Note however, that we gently massage our scalp daily.</li>
            <li>(yes, I know, too young, but hear me out)</li>
            <li>year old, African-American (Nigerian decent).&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li>, curly/coiled hair in it&#x27;s natural state, curly when relaxed.</li>
            <li>I was getting a receding line near my temples</li>
            <li>It means that each time you can use only one teaspoon of oil to rub it over your whole scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair feels the same way it would be putting in normal hair oil.</li>
            <li>After using two bottles in the course of more than three months, I can firmly state that there is absolutely no difference in hair growth before and after applying Mira Hair Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While the product is a little pricey, it is definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>like 4 times to barely cover the parts of the hair they tell u.....</li>
            <li>The Mira Hair Oil company offers buyers a chance to get $50 back if they submit a review of their Mira oil experience.</li>

            <li> The Mira Hair Oil company offers buyers a chance to get $50 back if they submit a review of their Mira oil experience.</li>
            <li> This is probably just for my fine, dry hair, but it&#x27;s way too heavy even using a little on the ends.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would help my hair grow, or at least prevent it from falling out so much.  </li>
            <li> Just so everyone knows I also have no chemicals in my hair, only use heat roughly once a week (hair dryer or straightener) and wash my hair about every three days.</li>
            <li> That was NOT clearly stated in their mailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, a little of this oil goes such a long way!</li>
            <li> Following the &#x27;cover at night with silk covering&#x27; directions, I typically go 3 days without washing it out for maximum benefits and then use Garnier Fructis Length and Strength shampoo to wash it out (no conditioner)</li>
            <li> It causes little, red bumps to appear on your head, but they are the pores that hair follicles start to grow in again.  </li>
            <li> In the end you are minus about 100 bucks...</li>
            <li> Usually, I use up to 3, and that&#x27;s a bare minimum.</li>
            <li> Tho I am not really seeing growth but am seeing fullness and thickness.</li>
            <li> Like a former reviewer stated, it&#x27;s impossible for me to use one teaspoon to massage the oil in with a full head of hair.</li>
            <li> The biggest waste of money I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.</li>
            <li> Very little oil actually gets to the scalp.</li>
            <li> I have used other products and it did not help her.</li>
            <li> disappointed.i hope you guys have better luck than me:(</li>
            <li> Combing it and blow-drying makes me lose the same, if not more, amount of hair.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions, using 1/2 teaspoon of Mira Hair Oil every other day.  </li>
            <li> Certainly not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Think about it for a minute: if you want to get your $50 back, would you write a negative review?</li>
            <li> Very expensive but Absolutely worth it..</li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t believe me, try a little experiment.</li>
            <li> disappointed caused itching and lost of hair would like my full refund,need address to return oil thank you.</li>
            <li> bottom line is: don&#x27;t waste your money on Mira Hair Oil.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product roughly once a week or every other week (using it sparingly since it is so expensive) and leave it on for a few hours while I&#x27;m home then wash it out.</li>
            <li> 2 WEEKS AGO MY HAIR WERE NOT TOUCHING MY SHOULDER</li>
            <li> No more dandruff and</li>
            <li> This oil actually stops it from being broken!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t put it by my mustache until it grows past my chin.</li>
            <li> I had thoughts that reviews are not sincere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to be rude but this was a total lie.</li>
            <li> It would be difficult to do this even for a bald person, but to rub it over the head full of hair is just impossible.  </li>
            <li> seriously I had to up the dose</li>
            <li> I guess the only benefit is that I bought it on eBay (or is that a bad thing?)</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this expensive scam.</li>
            <li> This is less expensive and less painful than the surgical alternative.</li>
            <li> My hair grew very thick .</li>
            <li> It made her hair fall wayy worse</li>
            <li> would advise anyone considering the use of this product to be wary of empty promises and unprofessionalism by the manufacturer of Mira Hair Oil, not to mention that it is unlikely to make any difference in your hair in terms of rate of growth, or density of hair on the scalp.rofessionalism by the manufacturer of Mira Hair Oil, not to mention that it is unlikely to make any difference in your hair in terms of rate of growth, or density of hair on the scalp.</li>
            <li> Please please please...consider donating money that you would spend on this product to the poor or blind.  </li>
            <li> It plays on your hope and steals from you blind.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;m almost finished with the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad and</li>
            <li> but I was desperate to try anything.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any growth or change in the condition if my hair in any way hood or bad.</li>
            <li> ::((( I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I hated it</li>
            <li> As a woman, losing my hair has been devastating.</li>

            <li> appears to be lesser amount for same price as before. are there any good deals available&#x3D;&#x3D;would like to pick up one if so. Barbara.</li>
            <li> When the weather cooled, it thickened like butter or margarine</li>
            <li> This is probably just for my fine, dry hair, but it&#x27;s way too heavy even using a little on the ends.</li>
            <li> I purchase this 2012 and used it for about 4 months and it did work. I did see a lot of new growth than I did when I would have my hair in kinky twist.  My hair grew very thick . My grandmother is bald on the top of her head.  I purchase for her as well. I would wash her hair with the growth shampoo and use the oil.  This is the truth- my grandmother hair started growing with her being on a lot of med&#x27;s.  I have used other products and it did not help her. Every person scalp is not the same.  Doing treatments on the scalps is what grows the hair and part of it is using the right products for you.  I plan on buying it again in 2014.</li>
            <li> Please please please...consider donating money that you would spend on this product to the poor or blind.  This product does NOT work. It plays on your hope and steals from you blind. In the end you are minus about 100 bucks...so if you want to be out 100 bucks...at least put it towards a good cause that will be tax deductible.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED IT 4 TIMES NOW AND I CAN DEFFINITELY SEE IT WORKING. 2 WEEKS AGO MY HAIR WERE NOT TOUCHING MY SHOULDER AND SO MY HAIR DID GROW AFTER THE 2ND USE ALREADY. MY HAIR FEEL SO MUCH HEALTHIER AND THICKER. WILL BE BUYING AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend on the actual site for around $80. It made her hair fall wayy worse and we actually threw it away. I would never buy it again and I would save my money on buying essential oils like lavendar, cedar, jojoba, coconut, and olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, beware!</li>
            <li> This has Really helped my hair. No more dandruff and it feels thicker. I get about an inch per month. Not a lot of growth but has made my hair beautiful and strong!</li>
            <li> This oil is true to it&#x27;s claims in every way! I can&#x27;t believe how it softens and protects m hair from braking. I have the most delicate hair on the planet and it breaks off just by me touching it and styling. This oil actually stops it from being broken! On top of that, my hair has begun to grow at a rapid pace! Instead of 1/2 of an inch each month, I am getting around 1 and 1/2 inch! but even so, I am able to retain that new growth because my hair is not breaking of anymore! I am so gad that I purchased this and will continue to do so! Also, a little of this oil goes such a long way! It&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> We started using the oil immediately after shampooing our hair.  Within days there was evidence of hair growth.  Note however, that we gently massage our scalp daily. Just a dab will do it.  I plan to purchase this oil again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this faithfully for almost 3 months. I have been using as directed 3-4 times a week. I have not noticed any growth or change in the condition if my hair in any way hood or bad. Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this expensive scam. You would be better off using coconut oil to moisturizer your hair and promote less breakage which leads to hair growth. This product does not work.</li>
            <li> What a joke and a scam. I&#x27;m sorry to be rude but this was a total lie. The biggest waste of money I&#x27;ve spent in a long time. I did exactly as they said, only try using the amount recommended 1/2-1tsp per use and you will never get through even/10th of your hair geesh seriously I had to up the dose like 4 times to barely cover the parts of the hair they tell u..... and then NOTHING I repeat NOTHING ::((( I was so disappointed. I really wanted this to work! I tried it up to 4 times a week as they recommend and I&#x27;m still waiting to see even the remotest of results ... Needless to say I&#x27;m almost finished with the bottle. I do not recommend this costly purchase to anyone really. If u want to try it, go ahead, but honestly I think you&#x27;ll be wasting your time AND your money. Believe me I&#x27;m sad and disappointed.i hope you guys have better luck than me:(</li>
            <li> One of the best products I have used so far. Keeps hair moisturizer and shiny. If you have dry hair, excellent product</li>
            <li> This product is great! It really works! Thanks a million!</li>
            <li> I have hyperthyroidism which caused my hair to shed in clumps. I was very upset and had to buy a wig. I have been applying this Mira oil on my scalp at night and covering it with a sleep cap. After just one week I have seen amazing results. My hair is growing in thicker and the hair that I have left has stopped shedding as much! I was reluctant to buy this because of the price but I was desperate to try anything. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. I will order again. I have also ordered a hair growth shampoo and conditioner from verseo.com and it is helping also. As a woman, losing my hair has been devastating. I was skeptical but I am glad that I tried this. In about 6 months my hair should be better than before I lost it. I&#x27;m very grateful for having found it.</li>
            <li> I saved up 3 months worth of money for nothing, and I still have a teaspoon of oil left in the bottle. The only positive thing I can say about this oil is the scent.&lt;br /&gt;I am a 15 (yes, I know, too young, but hear me out) year old, African-American (Nigerian decent).&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, I have somewhat short (neck-length), curly/coiled hair in it&#x27;s natural state, curly when relaxed. I used this 5 times after I relaxed my hair, and to be honest,there is about 1/4-3/8 inch of growth since then. But hey, what would you expect in 3 weeks? Following the &#x27;cover at night with silk covering&#x27; directions, I typically go 3 days without washing it out for maximum benefits and then use Garnier Fructis Length and Strength shampoo to wash it out (no conditioner) then re-apply the oil because if I don&#x27;t, my hair resumes a wool-like state.&lt;br /&gt;Not really what I was hoping for. Like a former reviewer stated, it&#x27;s impossible for me to use one teaspoon to massage the oil in with a full head of hair. Usually, I use up to 3, and that&#x27;s a bare minimum. It&#x27;s not softer, not stronger. Combing it and blow-drying makes me lose the same, if not more, amount of hair. My hair feels the same way it would be putting in normal hair oil. I guess the only benefit is that I bought it on eBay (or is that a bad thing?) for $80.30 (shipping included).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might be great for people of different racial backgrounds/ hair types, but not me. Certainly not worth the money. I think I&#x27;ll try the mint-rosemary Ren conditioner I bought to use the remaining oil out...</li>
            <li> disappointed caused itching and lost of hair would like my full refund,need address to return oil thank you.</li>
            <li> Very expensive but Absolutely worth it.. This will be my second bottle and can defiantly see the result...will definatly recommend this oil</li>
            <li> This product started producing results within the first week I started using it.  It causes little, red bumps to appear on your head, but they are the pores that hair follicles start to grow in again.  You should apply this oil all over your scalp where your hairline used to be as well as on the ends of your hair.  I am very happy with this product.  This is less expensive and less painful than the surgical alternative.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would help my hair grow, or at least prevent it from falling out so much.  Someone told me of the scalp healing properties of almond oil, so I looked it up on the web.  In my search, I found this Miro Oil and decided to try it.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and it seems to be working great.  My hair is not falling out near as much and I even started using it on my husband&#x27;s scalp, seems to be working on him as well.  Very pleased</li>
            <li> Purchased two bottles of Mira hair oil earlier this month, have been using it for two weeks.  This product will make your hair soft, manageable and healthy right away.  You will also notice a significant decrease in shedding when you wash and brush your hair.  While the product is a little pricey, it is definitely worth the price.  I liked it so much I tried ordering more right away, but Amazon was out.  I am hoping Amazon will bring this product back as soon as possible and keep it in stock.  I would be very interested in other opinions about this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have had positive reviews after using after 3 weeks. I remember my beard was real short and I made 5 braids after 20 days. I&#x27;ve been using it again for 10 days. So I think it works good after 2 weeks. I know that is said that it makes it grow as fast as nature intended and with me smoking nicotine, drinking coffee, and taking klonopin, that will help me a lot cause I had faster growing hair when I was 20. I had to regrow my beard cause I ripped out the middle. I hope I get some books money so I can buy another bottle. I think after 6 bottles in a year and a good diet I might have a beard to the floor by then. A blonde beard. I won&#x27;t put it by my mustache until it grows past my chin. By the way I leave it on the whole day till I am with a woman.</li>
            <li> Its amazing , its works the way my wife imagined . I expect to order a new bottle of mira hair oil to soon . Thanks</li>
            <li> Tho I am not really seeing growth but am seeing fullness and thickness. I was getting a receding line near my temples and I hated it but now I DO see hair growing there  now and I am happy with that</li>
            <li> This product absolutely will not help you. At $100 for 5 oz and with so many one star reviews, you cannot possibly, in good conscious, buy it. Also, ignore anything Jany SM comments on the one star reviews, as she is working with the company. Please save your money! I tried Surface and had decent results. I&#x27;d recommend trying that first.</li>
            <li> I watched over 20 reviews about this product. Most of them said it works. Well, I am using it 3 weeks and I do not see great results. The same results you can get with any coconut oil. Hair grows with normal rate. Hair still falls at the same rate as it was before I used Mira oil. I had thoughts that reviews are not sincere. This oil is ok. This product is ok, but does not make great results as promised at the website of Mira. And of course, its does not cost this price at all.</li>
            <li> I received a &amp;#34;double your money back&amp;#34; guarantee from Mira Hair Oil, which offered a 60 day trial of the hair oil and sent shampoo and conditioner, plus information booklets.  I followed the instructions, using 1/2 teaspoon of Mira Hair Oil every other day.  At first it seemed that my hair actually grew slower.  I am a 33 year veteran cosmetologist, and I color my hair every two and a half weeks because it already grows more quickly than the average rate of 1/2&amp;#34; per month.  When I began using this product, I went an entire month before needing to cover my very white roots.  But after that first month the growth rate returned to my normal rate of 3/8&amp;#34; every 2 1/2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair density did not improve, but it did seem that more hair was falling out. I suspect that the scalp massage was responsible for pulling out hair before it was ready to fall out on its own.  This is a hairdressing &amp;#34;no-no.&amp;#34;  You don&#x27;t want to pull hair out before it&#x27;s ready to fall out on its own, as this increases the probability that it will NOT grow back.  I was gentle with the application of Mira Hair Oil, to avoid this, but it seemed to increase fall out anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for 60 days, I contacted Mira Hair Oil on day 61 to alert them that I had received no benefits as promised.  They encouraged me to continue using Mira Hair Oil for another 3 weeks.  Little did I know that they also intended to NOT fulfill their guarantee with this extended offer.  I used the product for the 3 additional weeks, again with no improvement in hair density or rate of growth and on the appointed day, I contacted them again.  Their representative told me the guarantee time was over and that in order to have received double my money back I would have had to return the product BEFORE the 60 days trial period.  That was NOT clearly stated in their mailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would advise anyone considering the use of this product to be wary of empty promises and unprofessionalism by the manufacturer of Mira Hair Oil, not to mention that it is unlikely to make any difference in your hair in terms of rate of growth, or density of hair on the scalp.rofessionalism by the manufacturer of Mira Hair Oil, not to mention that it is unlikely to make any difference in your hair in terms of rate of growth, or density of hair on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous spending so much money on this product but it is worth it! Took about 7 weeks to get here (email confirmation estimated 6-8 weeks) and I live in Ohio. I have been using this product roughly once a week or every other week (using it sparingly since it is so expensive) and leave it on for a few hours while I&#x27;m home then wash it out. My hair is growing about double it&#x27;s normal rate and I have been receiving so many compliments on my hair! It&#x27;s strong, healthy and shiny! This also helped cut the amount of dandruff I used to have to almost none! Just so everyone knows I also have no chemicals in my hair, only use heat roughly once a week (hair dryer or straightener) and wash my hair about every three days.</li>
            <li> This works. I see the difference in my hair</li>
            <li> After using two bottles in the course of more than three months, I can firmly state that there is absolutely no difference in hair growth before and after applying Mira Hair Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have two observations to make that are very important if you are considering buying Mira Hair Oil:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The bottle contains only 4 ounces of oil. You are supposed to use it over 8 weeks three times a week.  That is 24 times for one bottle. It means that each time you can use only one teaspoon of oil to rub it over your whole scalp. It would be difficult to do this even for a bald person, but to rub it over the head full of hair is just impossible.  The problem is that when you start rubbing oil into your scalp the surrounding hair absorbs most of it very quickly. Very little oil actually gets to the scalp. If you don&#x27;t believe me, try a little experiment. Take a teaspoon or even a tablespoon full of olive oil and try to rub it into your scalp and see what&#x27;s going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The Mira Hair Oil company offers buyers a chance to get $50 back if they submit a review of their Mira oil experience. That is like bribing people to advertise their products. Think about it for a minute: if you want to get your $50 back, would you write a negative review? Now I know where all those glowing reviews on the Internet come from. Is it also a coincidence all those reviews are on sites that sell Mira Oil or are affiliated with the company?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is: don&#x27;t waste your money on Mira Hair Oil. If you care about your hair, use healthy hair products without any harmful ingredients and gently massage your scalp regularly. I hope you find this review helpful. Thank you for reading, and good luck.</li>
