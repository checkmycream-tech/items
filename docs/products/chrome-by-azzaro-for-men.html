            <li>although after a while, i think the nose gets used to the smell and can&#x27;t smell it as well as it did the first time i applied it, the chrome is an excellent product</li>

            <li>and I love when he wears it!</li>

            <li>I loved being able to get this for about 1/2 the price that I would have to pay in a retail store.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>NICE FRAGRENCE WITH STAYING POWER DOESNT DISSAPATE</li>
            <li>I liked the fragrance in the store but did not want to pay the $60-$100 dollars for the bottle.</li>

            <li>It is his favorite cologne...and mine on him! :)</li>
            <li>im not to fond with some colognes but this one smells pretty good!</li>
            <li>By far one of the best colognes I ever purchase...</li>
            <li>Your best bet for cologne or perfume will be direct from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This was nice because the cologne is fairly close to real curve and smells good..</li>
            <li>My guy loves it, perfect scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming but smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>, men love it and women love it on men, a most have...believe me!</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean scent that is very refreshing when wearing.</li>
            <li>i loved the clean scent on my husband.</li>
            <li>The price here is about as good as I&#x27;ve found, but it&#x27;s widely available, and can probably be sampled at most fragrance counters in stores if you want to see how it works on you.</li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t want you to enjoy the cheap but quality products that they are enjoying!!</li>
            <li>I thought it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good and longevity is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>It is the most consistant fragrance for me to date.</li>
            <li>This smells so good, this is such a great price.  </li>
            <li>I have received many compliments from women.</li>
            <li>It is definitely in my top 3 Colognes that I have EVER used.</li>
            <li>How sexy can that be?</li>
            <li>This smell works better when I spray on my skin rather than clothing.</li>
            <li>Smells great and very reasonbaly priced than leading stores.</li>
            <li>This is my husbands favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>So I am glad I was able to find a better price on Amazon. :)</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>(maybe I do more than him)</li>

            <li>i love this cologne and i was able to get this size for an affordable price.  </li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll avoid the paranoia and assume that this means most people like Chrome...</li>
            <li>Have many to help look at.</li>
            <li>so i will always love this product</li>
            <li>Women just love it...</li>
            <li>Girls love this.</li>
            <li>Well, I have been once more taken by another unscrupulous internet seller.</li>
            <li>I WILL NOT BUY ANY MORE COLOGNES FROM AMAZON.COM</li>
            <li>make sure you test it out when you get it.</li>
            <li>The ladies love this cologne.</li>
            <li>I read so many comments about the cologne being knockoffs from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have received so many compliments from woman that I don&#x27;t even know with those 3 colognes.</li>
            <li>I receive more compliments over this scent than I do my Armani or Gucci colognes.</li>
            <li>:) but I definitely love the smell and so did my husband.</li>
            <li>He has used this cologne for quite a while and this purchase was just cuz he had ran out and needed more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a refreshing scent, energizes me in the am.</li>
            <li>I love the scent on him.</li>
            <li>This is my sons favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>i might be ok..  </li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments on it when I first started wearing it to work and would highly recommend it as a great, cheaper scent useable almost anytime!  </li>
            <li>It is cool in the summer and warm in the winter.  </li>
            <li>The price on Amazon tends to be pretty good compared to dept stores.</li>
            <li>Pretty good product.</li>
            <li>for the price it is a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>My husband first loved this cologne and alternated between it and Chanel Bleu.</li>
            <li>Ok, this product was a good price and good packaging, but the delivery time was long!</li>
            <li>I love this, it smells absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great fragrance, amazing price, fast shipping and very well protected so it won&#x27;t break on the way.</li>
            <li>I like it very much, and IÂ¨ll by more!</li>
            <li>I brought this cologne as a Christmas present for my fiance and he loved it!</li>
            <li>And its a really big bottle for a really good price!</li>
            <li>The smells also fades very quickly and is about gone in a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>The smell is really easy and not too strong like others.</li>
            <li>it came very quickly</li>
            <li>This cologne is really the best smelling on the market as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not too strong or overpowering.</li>
            <li>it does not overpower you with too strong a smell.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way too strong and the scent lingers in the air for over 30 minutes overpowering everything else.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite colognes that I own and I own about 10-12 different ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is better than Cool Water and Nautica.</li>
            <li>Works fine now.  </li>
            <li>The smell is great, not to strong but strong enough to leave an impression.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did, as the product came in sealed original box, made in Paris, and the original scent.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not to strong, and I looked around and found it on Amazon, it&#x27;s alot cheap here.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly!</li>
            <li>The smell is not too strong and not too light.</li>
            <li>spend a lot of money on original perfumes but most of them are fade away quickly</li>
            <li>As soon as I run out I plan on getting more or at least more from this company a very good brand of cologne</li>
            <li>This fragrance is smooth.  </li>
            <li>I would more then likely buy from this company again, there prices were by far the best.</li>
            <li>Its a great unobtrusive perfume which I plan to use on a daily basis</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li>My wife is very picky and vocal about what scents I wear and she actually liked Chrome.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s light, clean and still manly.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.. a classic.</li>
            <li>It has a very fresh and clean smell.</li>
            <li>The product came in its original box just like the ones you would buy at the mall.</li>
            <li>He was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Not even close to the original stuff.</li>
            <li>but it must not for original one , isn&#x27;t it ??</li>
            <li>He has since switched to the Sport version and my son has taken over wearing this original version.</li>
            <li>The scent is clean, masculine and very sexy.</li>
            <li>it smelled amazing, was sold at an excellent price, and was larger than i expected!</li>
            <li>why not, w/ free shipping (amazon&#x27;s super saver)?</li>
            <li>He loves it and uses it frequently, and I love how it smells on him  :)</li>
            <li>The reviews on here are accurate in regards to this scent&#x27;s quality and it does last a fair amount of the day.  </li>
            <li>I like the clean fragrance, my wife loves it, and</li>
            <li>Smells great--fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>The smell is not too strong, it smells shower fresh.  </li>
            <li>The scent is so soft that you will be tempted to spray more because you think it&#x27;s not there, but trust me, it&#x27;s there!</li>
            <li>Meaning, there are many out there that one pump of the spray can be too much in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like smelling a more gentle side of a man&#x27;s personality.</li>
            <li>I have worn it for years alternating with Cool Water.  </li>
            <li>Only one man should smell this good: me.</li>
            <li>WOMEN LIKE THE FRESH AND LIGHT SCENT AS I DO.</li>
            <li>It is good to the last spray.</li>
            <li>Everybody wants to know what it is, women love it and even guys ask what the name of that cologne is, so they can add it to their arsenal of colognes.</li>
            <li>It is a really good sent that stays with you at the same time</li>
            <li>Really big and good smell</li>
            <li>found it at such a good price</li>
            <li>and I do enjoy the way it smells, it does not seem right.</li>
            <li>Service was quick and product was received as I expected - new and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Smells Fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean fresh scent and not overpowering when used in moderation.</li>
            <li>This is actually my wife&#x27;s favorite Cologne that I have,and I have many.</li>
            <li>I Quickly Ordered A replacement one</li>
            <li>AS QUICKLY AS OTHERS.</li>
            <li>i kinda wasnt sure about this until i smelled this particular version...</li>
            <li>I receive compliments on it, and enjoy the scent very much.</li>
            <li>and you are good to go all night long.</li>
            <li>It is very fresh and clean and very distinctive.</li>
            <li>Its got a great smell but tends to wear off by the end of the day though still slightly noticable.</li>
            <li>I am not gonna say too much because I want just my husband wearing it!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone interested in this product!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>While DN has a strong, masculine spicy seductive tone of smell to it, Chrome has a soft, under the surface, hint of citrus, intoxicating kind of effect.</li>
            <li>The Next Day, This Fragrance Smells Amazing, And</li>
            <li>Great year round scent.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it, not heavy like some of them out there.   </li>
            <li>anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the package way earlier than expected, (Awesome!!)</li>
            <li>This is by far his favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not as exciting to me as it once was.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try to anyone on the fence.</li>
            <li>ok thanks much</li>
            <li>This scent is sweet and crisp.</li>
            <li>its smells really good and it lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li>Great, but very strong only need a little</li>
            <li>The Chrome came quickly and in pretty condition.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always being asked by other women why my husband always smells so good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m telling you right now</li>
            <li>The product arrived fully wrapped as if I had bought it right from the store.</li>
            <li>My top 3 favorite colognes for my body chemistry, because lets face it, it does mix with your own pheromones, is Chrome by Azzaro, Aqua Di Gio, and Gucci Guilty.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, and lasts fairly long as well.</li>
            <li>Has a really nice crisp smell that is not too overpowering and yet lasts a surprisingly long time.</li>
            <li>I questioned Versace Dreamer so much that i called Amazon to make sure they got they&#x27;re colognes direct..</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m becoming more and more addicted to the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have been using Azzaro Chrome since 2004, when I first found my Roommate&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I never thought that I&#x27;d find an equal to my favorite Hugo cologne.</li>
            <li>I rarely buy it for him because it is very pricey.</li>
            <li>But price is higher on Amazon</li>
            <li>Although I wasn&#x27;t able to receive this item by Christmas, it was delivered shortly after.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite men&#x27;s cologne and definitely one of my husband&#x27;s favorites as well..</li>
            <li>The first day i wore it work</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>bought this colone 2nd time one month ago from AMAZON and love it  </li>
            <li>smells great,getting many compliments  will buy it again in the future  </li>
            <li>It lasts me the whole day and keeps me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>It was even considerably cheaper than the prices on duty free store.</li>
            <li>Overall, refreshing.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware of this cologne, until someone suggested it to me.</li>
            <li>My husband has worn the same cologne for years and makes sure to buy it himself.</li>
            <li>had this perfume already and love it so had to get a next one</li>
            <li>Respond to this if anyone has any recommendations!&lt;br /&gt;Areas sprayed: Front and back of neck, on the top of head (hair), and both forearms.&lt;br /&gt;Any</li>
            <li>He needs more actually!</li>
            <li>Will back for more.</li>
            <li>If you order anything online especially cologne make sure it says, &amp;#34;Ships and Sold from Amazon&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>First heard about it from a gospel group.</li>
            <li>I felt better and the colognes i bought after that case definitely seem legit..</li>
            <li>Hi,&lt;br /&gt;It is very strong perfume but it is an old fashion , even that It is my first azzaro perfume , like it but still the same problem which is fade away quickly .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Do a test for few days make sure the smell is strong and doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li>Found it for less on Amazon and was very pleased.</li>
            <li>They both smell great when they wear them, but there are subtle differences between the two</li>
            <li>This is a good quality product that should last awhile, if used properly.</li>
            <li>Though not the longest lasting cologne, it does smell good and that is after all the only reason to buy a cologne</li>
            <li>Lots of positive remarks from people I meet.</li>
            <li>I got one after reading all the positive reviews and I have to say, I agree with them.</li>
            <li>I used his until he pretty much cut me off</li>
            <li>It has such a fresh, clean scent...</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THE CLEAN AND MASCULINE SMELL OF THIS COLOGNE FOR MEN.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed Chrome Cologne for a very long time.</li>
            <li>and I can still smell it quite strongly when he comes back home from work.</li>
            <li>certainly do this again.</li>
            <li>but it has a pure smell to it.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s nice, but it&#x27;s getting a little played out</li>
            <li>I would describe it as being very fresh or crisp, like a cool ocean breeze with a hint of some sort of spice and slightly grassy or herby (Citrus notes maybe?</li>
            <li>that day he&#x27;d be like whaattt haha.</li>
            <li>But this is a deffinite pick for any guy that wants to smell yummyyy.</li>
            <li>This has really grown on me.</li>
            <li>I recommend for a light scent only requiring 1 spray on pulsating points.</li>
            <li>cologne itself was sealed in plastic and the whole inside of the box was protected perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>But dont tell everyone hahaha</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It came well packaged and arrived rather fast.</li>
            <li>I thought he would like the scent as much as my husband did.</li>
            <li>thanks AMAZON...........M.P.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Chrome!</li>
            <li>It was the real thing, at a real bargain price.</li>
            <li>you want to overpower your date&#x27;s perfume (or if you want to make everyone around you tell you, \\&quot;Man, you put on too much cologne.\\&quot;)and</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li>I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li>tips on where I should spray and how much?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>smell is gentle and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It stays one the whole night</li>
            <li>let me tell you it not the same the 1.5 0z spray that i buy at a store smell great it last all day the smell the 3.4 oz that i bought on here smell last about 20 minutes tops before it wares off</li>
            <li>I hear a lot of people say its too much of a metallic smell....</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I just want the real deal seeing as that&#x27;s what i paid for..</li>
            <li>btw Chrome was real</li>
            <li>Lasting, soft scent makes me love it too.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant but does not last very long - withing a few hours it will be mostly gone.</li>
            <li>I usually never buy cologne without knowing what it smells like first.</li>
            <li>Got this based on other reviews and was quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>But seriously its good cologne and i recommend it.</li>
            <li>It will last well through a full 8 hr shift at work using 2 sprays.</li>
            <li>Here, it was easy to find, affordable and exactly what I needed for a last minute birthday present.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously, I tried to stay away from the typical \\&quot;LADIES LOVE IT\\</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m used paying allot more for less...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a male and the only reason why you&#x27;re buying this cologne is because \\&quot;women love it,\\</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cologne</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for everyone.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>which reveals a high percentage of alcohol.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to certain scents and this does not bother me</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is definitely the REAL deal! !</li>
            <li>Not the real chrome, less strong.</li>
            <li>Have gotten compliments on this scent,  its great and not too expensive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what I use most days and have for a few years now.  </li>
            <li>I have trouble keeping track of how many complements I get wearing this out to bars and parties.</li>
            <li>I bought a few colognes after making sure all of them were SHIPPED and SOLD by AMAZON after reading reviews of that</li>
            <li>Other then that it seems to be fine.</li>
            <li>I get him a new cologne every year.</li>
            <li>My wife and I both live the smell.</li>
            <li>THE BOX WAS SEALED AND NEW</li>
            <li>you haven&#x27;t tried it and are looking for a new fragrance, give it a try if it interests you.  </li>
            <li>My biggest preference always goes to a fragrance which is not only good but also lasts at least 6-8hours</li>
            <li>my wife who has rhinitis is very sensitive to smell and chrome passed with flying colors.</li>
            <li>Very masculine.</li>
            <li>Just to let you know right now, this scent is the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for someone looking for a light, long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>I first heard about this cologne from a female co-worker.</li>
            <li>people were just like WOW!</li>
            <li>Honestly there are colognes that last longer, but few get the Wow reaction that Chrome provides.  </li>
            <li>He was very surprised to get this and that he genuinely likes wearing it everyday to work.</li>
            <li>Great smell, long lasting, however... not strong enough.</li>
            <li>the orginal would last the whole day.</li>
            <li>But then again, you have to find a cologne that works well with your natural scent.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 16 year old son solely on reviews alone.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 36 yr old husband</li>
            <li>My husband puts it on early in the morning</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s masculine, not woodsy..</li>
            <li>where or which perfume fixed with you all the day , please let me know ?</li>
            <li>I kept the old bottle from 2008 around</li>
            <li>Or at least I am told by those who get close enough to me to make a ranking of their own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to go for a cologne without smelling it yourself, but I would highly highly recommend this one as a good everyday scent.  </li>
            <li>The scent is not so strong as usual for men fragrances yet it has a manly thing in it.</li>
            <li>be sure, I sprayed some from a small sample vial the next day and sure thing it lasted until late evening.</li>
            <li>I can pretty much sum this up in a few words.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone who is thinking about buying, Delivery took about a week because i used standard shipping</li>
            <li>it takes me back to High School!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot even get out of the house before there&#x27;s barely a trace of it on me!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Chrome is a subtle and clean scent that lasts all day, but isn&#x27;t over-powering... as long as you don&#x27;t use too much, right?  </li>
            <li>Its not overbearing, just crisp and sharp.</li>
            <li>I bumped in to it recently cleaning out some old boxes and VIOLA!</li>
            <li>Doesnt matter what anyone thinks but her (though the general consensus seems to be that females like it)</li>
            <li>men are going to say this cologne isn&#x27;t masculine enough</li>
            <li>Seems to last pretty long especially on your clothes...</li>
            <li>So I decided to take a chance especially since it was shipped directly by Amazon.</li>
            <li>the scent is strong and lasting, so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>It is so much cheaper on here that it is other places.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say anything about other suppliers that Amazon works with, but Amazon ships the real thing.</li>
            <li>whenever I go to social gatherings is a+++++</li>
            <li>It is mainly floral with some fruity tones and minimal spice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then I expected which only means it will last that much longer..</li>
            <li>However not long lasting and often accompanied by that after scent (this is not a technical term)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have used this in the Clubs and just going to work, when I feel like smelling great.</li>
            <li> We stumbled across this scent passing through a department store one day and couldn&#x27;t get over how great it was, except for the price.</li>
            <li> I took my chances this time, and based my decision on the great reviews this cologne got.</li>

            <li> I saw the great reviews and decided to take a chance since it is so cheap vs. department stores.  </li>

            <li> My Dad is going to be thrilled.</li>
            <li> I loved being able to get this for about 1/2 the price that I would have to pay in a retail store.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> NICE FRAGRENCE WITH STAYING POWER DOESNT DISSAPATE</li>
            <li> I liked the fragrance in the store but did not want to pay the $60-$100 dollars for the bottle.</li>
            <li> Excellent + fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice, husband loves it..</li>

            <li> This cologne is very strong yet not over powering.</li>
            <li> It is his favorite cologne...and mine on him! :)</li>
            <li> im not to fond with some colognes but this one smells pretty good!</li>
            <li> By far one of the best colognes I ever purchase...</li>
            <li> Your best bet for cologne or perfume will be direct from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This was nice because the cologne is fairly close to real curve and smells good..</li>
            <li> My guy loves it, perfect scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming but smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> , men love it and women love it on men, a most have...believe me!</li>
            <li> It has a nice clean scent that is very refreshing when wearing.</li>
            <li> i loved the clean scent on my husband.</li>
            <li> The price here is about as good as I&#x27;ve found, but it&#x27;s widely available, and can probably be sampled at most fragrance counters in stores if you want to see how it works on you.</li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t want you to enjoy the cheap but quality products that they are enjoying!!</li>
            <li> I thought it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good and longevity is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> It is the most consistant fragrance for me to date.</li>
            <li> This smells so good, this is such a great price.  </li>
            <li> I have received many compliments from women.</li>
            <li> It is definitely in my top 3 Colognes that I have EVER used.</li>
            <li> How sexy can that be?</li>
            <li> This smell works better when I spray on my skin rather than clothing.</li>
            <li> Smells great and very reasonbaly priced than leading stores.</li>
            <li> This is my husbands favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> So I am glad I was able to find a better price on Amazon. :)</li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> (maybe I do more than him)</li>

            <li> i love this cologne and i was able to get this size for an affordable price.  </li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll avoid the paranoia and assume that this means most people like Chrome...</li>
            <li> Have many to help look at.</li>
            <li> so i will always love this product</li>
            <li> Women just love it...</li>
            <li> Girls love this.</li>
            <li> Well, I have been once more taken by another unscrupulous internet seller.</li>
            <li> I WILL NOT BUY ANY MORE COLOGNES FROM AMAZON.COM</li>
            <li> make sure you test it out when you get it.</li>
            <li> The ladies love this cologne.</li>
            <li> I read so many comments about the cologne being knockoffs from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments from woman that I don&#x27;t even know with those 3 colognes.</li>
            <li> I receive more compliments over this scent than I do my Armani or Gucci colognes.</li>
            <li> :) but I definitely love the smell and so did my husband.</li>
            <li> He has used this cologne for quite a while and this purchase was just cuz he had ran out and needed more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a refreshing scent, energizes me in the am.</li>
            <li> I love the scent on him.</li>
            <li> This is my sons favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li> i might be ok..  </li>
            <li> I have gotten many compliments on it when I first started wearing it to work and would highly recommend it as a great, cheaper scent useable almost anytime!  </li>
            <li> It is cool in the summer and warm in the winter.  </li>
            <li> The price on Amazon tends to be pretty good compared to dept stores.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product.</li>
            <li> for the price it is a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> My husband first loved this cologne and alternated between it and Chanel Bleu.</li>
            <li> Ok, this product was a good price and good packaging, but the delivery time was long!</li>
            <li> I love this, it smells absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, amazing price, fast shipping and very well protected so it won&#x27;t break on the way.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, and IÂ¨ll by more!</li>
            <li> I brought this cologne as a Christmas present for my fiance and he loved it!</li>
            <li> And its a really big bottle for a really good price!</li>
            <li> The smells also fades very quickly and is about gone in a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> The smell is really easy and not too strong like others.</li>
            <li> it came very quickly</li>
            <li> This cologne is really the best smelling on the market as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too strong or overpowering.</li>
            <li> it does not overpower you with too strong a smell.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way too strong and the scent lingers in the air for over 30 minutes overpowering everything else.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes that I own and I own about 10-12 different ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is better than Cool Water and Nautica.</li>
            <li> Works fine now.  </li>
            <li> The smell is great, not to strong but strong enough to leave an impression.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did, as the product came in sealed original box, made in Paris, and the original scent.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not to strong, and I looked around and found it on Amazon, it&#x27;s alot cheap here.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly!</li>
            <li> The smell is not too strong and not too light.</li>
            <li> spend a lot of money on original perfumes but most of them are fade away quickly</li>
            <li> As soon as I run out I plan on getting more or at least more from this company a very good brand of cologne</li>
            <li> This fragrance is smooth.  </li>
            <li> I would more then likely buy from this company again, there prices were by far the best.</li>
            <li> Its a great unobtrusive perfume which I plan to use on a daily basis</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li> My wife is very picky and vocal about what scents I wear and she actually liked Chrome.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s light, clean and still manly.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.. a classic.</li>
            <li> It has a very fresh and clean smell.</li>
            <li> The product came in its original box just like the ones you would buy at the mall.</li>
            <li> He was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not even close to the original stuff.</li>
            <li> but it must not for original one , isn&#x27;t it ??</li>
            <li> He has since switched to the Sport version and my son has taken over wearing this original version.</li>
            <li> The scent is clean, masculine and very sexy.</li>
            <li> it smelled amazing, was sold at an excellent price, and was larger than i expected!</li>
            <li> why not, w/ free shipping (amazon&#x27;s super saver)?</li>
            <li> He loves it and uses it frequently, and I love how it smells on him  :)</li>
            <li> The reviews on here are accurate in regards to this scent&#x27;s quality and it does last a fair amount of the day.  </li>
            <li> I like the clean fragrance, my wife loves it, and</li>
            <li> Smells great--fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> The smell is not too strong, it smells shower fresh.  </li>
            <li> The scent is so soft that you will be tempted to spray more because you think it&#x27;s not there, but trust me, it&#x27;s there!</li>
            <li> Meaning, there are many out there that one pump of the spray can be too much in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like smelling a more gentle side of a man&#x27;s personality.</li>
            <li> I have worn it for years alternating with Cool Water.  </li>
            <li> Only one man should smell this good: me.</li>
            <li> WOMEN LIKE THE FRESH AND LIGHT SCENT AS I DO.</li>
            <li> It is good to the last spray.</li>
            <li> Everybody wants to know what it is, women love it and even guys ask what the name of that cologne is, so they can add it to their arsenal of colognes.</li>
            <li> It is a really good sent that stays with you at the same time</li>
            <li> Really big and good smell</li>
            <li> found it at such a good price</li>
            <li> and I do enjoy the way it smells, it does not seem right.</li>
            <li> Service was quick and product was received as I expected - new and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Smells Fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean fresh scent and not overpowering when used in moderation.</li>
            <li> This is actually my wife&#x27;s favorite Cologne that I have,and I have many.</li>
            <li> I Quickly Ordered A replacement one</li>
            <li> AS QUICKLY AS OTHERS.</li>
            <li> i kinda wasnt sure about this until i smelled this particular version...</li>
            <li> I receive compliments on it, and enjoy the scent very much.</li>
            <li> and you are good to go all night long.</li>
            <li> It is very fresh and clean and very distinctive.</li>
            <li> Its got a great smell but tends to wear off by the end of the day though still slightly noticable.</li>
            <li> I am not gonna say too much because I want just my husband wearing it!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone interested in this product!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> While DN has a strong, masculine spicy seductive tone of smell to it, Chrome has a soft, under the surface, hint of citrus, intoxicating kind of effect.</li>
            <li> The Next Day, This Fragrance Smells Amazing, And</li>
            <li> Great year round scent.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it, not heavy like some of them out there.   </li>
            <li> anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the package way earlier than expected, (Awesome!!)</li>
            <li> This is by far his favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not as exciting to me as it once was.  </li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try to anyone on the fence.</li>
            <li> ok thanks much</li>
            <li> This scent is sweet and crisp.</li>
            <li> its smells really good and it lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li> Great, but very strong only need a little</li>
            <li> The Chrome came quickly and in pretty condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always being asked by other women why my husband always smells so good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m telling you right now</li>
            <li> The product arrived fully wrapped as if I had bought it right from the store.</li>
            <li> My top 3 favorite colognes for my body chemistry, because lets face it, it does mix with your own pheromones, is Chrome by Azzaro, Aqua Di Gio, and Gucci Guilty.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, and lasts fairly long as well.</li>
            <li> Has a really nice crisp smell that is not too overpowering and yet lasts a surprisingly long time.</li>
            <li> I questioned Versace Dreamer so much that i called Amazon to make sure they got they&#x27;re colognes direct..</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m becoming more and more addicted to the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have been using Azzaro Chrome since 2004, when I first found my Roommate&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I never thought that I&#x27;d find an equal to my favorite Hugo cologne.</li>
            <li> I rarely buy it for him because it is very pricey.</li>
            <li> But price is higher on Amazon</li>
            <li> Although I wasn&#x27;t able to receive this item by Christmas, it was delivered shortly after.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite men&#x27;s cologne and definitely one of my husband&#x27;s favorites as well..</li>
            <li> The first day i wore it work</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> bought this colone 2nd time one month ago from AMAZON and love it  </li>
            <li> smells great,getting many compliments  will buy it again in the future  </li>
            <li> It lasts me the whole day and keeps me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> It was even considerably cheaper than the prices on duty free store.</li>
            <li> Overall, refreshing.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware of this cologne, until someone suggested it to me.</li>
            <li> My husband has worn the same cologne for years and makes sure to buy it himself.</li>
            <li> had this perfume already and love it so had to get a next one</li>
            <li> Respond to this if anyone has any recommendations!&lt;br /&gt;Areas sprayed: Front and back of neck, on the top of head (hair), and both forearms.&lt;br /&gt;Any</li>
            <li> He needs more actually!</li>
            <li> Will back for more.</li>
            <li> If you order anything online especially cologne make sure it says, &amp;#34;Ships and Sold from Amazon&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> First heard about it from a gospel group.</li>
            <li> I felt better and the colognes i bought after that case definitely seem legit..</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;It is very strong perfume but it is an old fashion , even that It is my first azzaro perfume , like it but still the same problem which is fade away quickly .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Do a test for few days make sure the smell is strong and doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> Found it for less on Amazon and was very pleased.</li>
            <li> They both smell great when they wear them, but there are subtle differences between the two</li>
            <li> This is a good quality product that should last awhile, if used properly.</li>
            <li> Though not the longest lasting cologne, it does smell good and that is after all the only reason to buy a cologne</li>
            <li> Lots of positive remarks from people I meet.</li>
            <li> I got one after reading all the positive reviews and I have to say, I agree with them.</li>
            <li> I used his until he pretty much cut me off</li>
            <li> It has such a fresh, clean scent...</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THE CLEAN AND MASCULINE SMELL OF THIS COLOGNE FOR MEN.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed Chrome Cologne for a very long time.</li>
            <li> and I can still smell it quite strongly when he comes back home from work.</li>
            <li> certainly do this again.</li>
            <li> but it has a pure smell to it.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s nice, but it&#x27;s getting a little played out</li>
            <li> I would describe it as being very fresh or crisp, like a cool ocean breeze with a hint of some sort of spice and slightly grassy or herby (Citrus notes maybe?</li>
            <li> that day he&#x27;d be like whaattt haha.</li>
            <li> But this is a deffinite pick for any guy that wants to smell yummyyy.</li>
            <li> This has really grown on me.</li>
            <li> I recommend for a light scent only requiring 1 spray on pulsating points.</li>
            <li> cologne itself was sealed in plastic and the whole inside of the box was protected perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> But dont tell everyone hahaha</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It came well packaged and arrived rather fast.</li>
            <li> I thought he would like the scent as much as my husband did.</li>
            <li> thanks AMAZON...........M.P.</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Chrome!</li>
            <li> It was the real thing, at a real bargain price.</li>
            <li> you want to overpower your date&#x27;s perfume (or if you want to make everyone around you tell you, \\&quot;Man, you put on too much cologne.\\&quot;)and</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li> I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> tips on where I should spray and how much?</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> smell is gentle and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> It stays one the whole night</li>
            <li> let me tell you it not the same the 1.5 0z spray that i buy at a store smell great it last all day the smell the 3.4 oz that i bought on here smell last about 20 minutes tops before it wares off</li>
            <li> I hear a lot of people say its too much of a metallic smell....</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I just want the real deal seeing as that&#x27;s what i paid for..</li>
            <li> btw Chrome was real</li>
            <li> Lasting, soft scent makes me love it too.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant but does not last very long - withing a few hours it will be mostly gone.</li>
            <li> I usually never buy cologne without knowing what it smells like first.</li>
            <li> Got this based on other reviews and was quite pleased.  </li>
            <li> But seriously its good cologne and i recommend it.</li>
            <li> It will last well through a full 8 hr shift at work using 2 sprays.</li>
            <li> Here, it was easy to find, affordable and exactly what I needed for a last minute birthday present.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously, I tried to stay away from the typical \\&quot;LADIES LOVE IT\\</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m used paying allot more for less...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a male and the only reason why you&#x27;re buying this cologne is because \\&quot;women love it,\\</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cologne</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for everyone.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> which reveals a high percentage of alcohol.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to certain scents and this does not bother me</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is definitely the REAL deal! !</li>
            <li> Not the real chrome, less strong.</li>
            <li> Have gotten compliments on this scent,  its great and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I use most days and have for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble keeping track of how many complements I get wearing this out to bars and parties.</li>
            <li> I bought a few colognes after making sure all of them were SHIPPED and SOLD by AMAZON after reading reviews of that</li>
            <li> Other then that it seems to be fine.</li>
            <li> I get him a new cologne every year.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both live the smell.</li>
            <li> THE BOX WAS SEALED AND NEW</li>
            <li> you haven&#x27;t tried it and are looking for a new fragrance, give it a try if it interests you.  </li>
            <li> My biggest preference always goes to a fragrance which is not only good but also lasts at least 6-8hours</li>
            <li> my wife who has rhinitis is very sensitive to smell and chrome passed with flying colors.</li>
            <li> Very masculine.</li>
            <li> Just to let you know right now, this scent is the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for someone looking for a light, long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> I first heard about this cologne from a female co-worker.</li>
            <li> people were just like WOW!</li>
            <li> Honestly there are colognes that last longer, but few get the Wow reaction that Chrome provides.  </li>
            <li> He was very surprised to get this and that he genuinely likes wearing it everyday to work.</li>
            <li> Great smell, long lasting, however... not strong enough.</li>
            <li> the orginal would last the whole day.</li>
            <li> But then again, you have to find a cologne that works well with your natural scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 16 year old son solely on reviews alone.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 36 yr old husband</li>
            <li> My husband puts it on early in the morning</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s masculine, not woodsy..</li>
            <li> where or which perfume fixed with you all the day , please let me know ?</li>
            <li> I kept the old bottle from 2008 around</li>
            <li> Or at least I am told by those who get close enough to me to make a ranking of their own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to go for a cologne without smelling it yourself, but I would highly highly recommend this one as a good everyday scent.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not so strong as usual for men fragrances yet it has a manly thing in it.</li>
            <li> be sure, I sprayed some from a small sample vial the next day and sure thing it lasted until late evening.</li>
            <li> I can pretty much sum this up in a few words.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone who is thinking about buying, Delivery took about a week because i used standard shipping</li>
            <li> it takes me back to High School!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot even get out of the house before there&#x27;s barely a trace of it on me!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Chrome is a subtle and clean scent that lasts all day, but isn&#x27;t over-powering... as long as you don&#x27;t use too much, right?  </li>
            <li> Its not overbearing, just crisp and sharp.</li>
            <li> I bumped in to it recently cleaning out some old boxes and VIOLA!</li>
            <li> Doesnt matter what anyone thinks but her (though the general consensus seems to be that females like it)</li>
            <li> men are going to say this cologne isn&#x27;t masculine enough</li>
            <li> Seems to last pretty long especially on your clothes...</li>
            <li> So I decided to take a chance especially since it was shipped directly by Amazon.</li>
            <li> the scent is strong and lasting, so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It is so much cheaper on here that it is other places.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say anything about other suppliers that Amazon works with, but Amazon ships the real thing.</li>
            <li> whenever I go to social gatherings is a+++++</li>
            <li> It is mainly floral with some fruity tones and minimal spice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then I expected which only means it will last that much longer..</li>
            <li> However not long lasting and often accompanied by that after scent (this is not a technical term)</li>
            <li> To be honest, I was skeptical about ordering online because I had read other reviews of cologne on Amazon stating that the bottle they received was \\&quot;stale\\&quot; or \\&quot;not the same as when [they] smelled in stores.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> certainly has crisp citrus hints that go with any casual outing or even a semi formal one for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> He also adored it and spoke about its long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> I spray a little on my wrist, just as a test and the scent is completely gone in two-three hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually cycle about 7-8 different cologne trying to change it up everyday, but Chrome really got peoples attention especially the ladies!</li>
            <li> I use it almost every day and it has lasted for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long while now, and used to buy from department stores.</li>
            <li> This stuff has the edge because it lasts so long.</li>
            <li> Unlike other fragrances I&#x27;ve used, I can actually smell this one on myself.</li>
            <li> It is a long lasting scent, as others have previously noted....</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that it claimed to be new, yet the plastic on the outside was missing and the box was banged up.</li>
            <li> one barely lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have bought this at local department stores so when I found it on Amazon at half the price</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it didn&#x27;t last very long on me.</li>
            <li> and I know that it usually lasts a long time, almost an entire day.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Although it took probably a few months, I actually use it as my go to cologne these days.</li>
            <li> but the last bottle I got from Amazon must have been old or simply fake because it does not last at all!!</li>
            <li> it it with me to actually keep the scent on me for longer that few hours.</li>
            <li> It seems Kouros &amp; other fragrances sold on Amazon are of similar poor quality; with reviewers saying things like either the products are old or were watered</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong -- all parts -- head, heart and base.</li>
            <li> This is a cologne that I have wanted to try for a long time but is a little pricey in stores.  </li>
            <li> I keep it and wear it  along with with a couple of other scents to change off with.</li>
            <li> usually try something different every time, but i think i&#x27;ll keep a bottle of this on hand</li>
            <li> I use 3 \\&quot;sprays\\&quot; every morning and lasts me an entire 8 hour day if not more.</li>
            <li> Usually the scent would last ALL day,</li>
            <li> Was a bit skeptical at first because of the price</li>
            <li> They also told me to keep the cologne due to the shipping rules..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to review things like fragrances, because everybody has different tastes and different body chemistry to start with.  </li>
            <li> this bottle seems to be old or weak in some way.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this cologne several times from other places (mall, online stores) in the past few years</li>
            <li> But for the price, it looks like you&#x27;d pay the same for 1/2 that much (at least today).</li>
            <li> After reading reviews about the possibility of getting a fake product I was really concerned.</li>
            <li> Smells like its watered down.</li>
            <li> Wouldnt say it smells bad but def the least favorite in my collection</li>
            <li> I bought it at Macy&#x27;s for less.</li>
            <li> the fragrance goes away in less than 1 hour.  </li>
            <li> He already finished up half a bottle.</li>
            <li> Here, I got it at half the price</li>
            <li> The price ($36) was almost half the price of department store prices.</li>
            <li> This is always a gift as I prefer a slightly muskier scent.</li>
            <li> Amazon had it on sale $30-40 less than JC penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was afraid to buy a cologne without smelling it first.  </li>
            <li> The first time I smelled the scent was on one of my 80-year-old patients which I must admit it was a bit awkward because I couldn&#x27;t stop taking a whiff.</li>
            <li> But, that is not true.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re reading this and not using the stuff with the little ship on the bottle, I&#x27;ll assume that you care what you smell</li>
            <li> Package was ripped and the sealed plastic was glued shut not original packaging.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money and time buying this.</li>
            <li> For me, this will be number two all-time only behind the Noir.</li>
            <li> and I have gotten compliments from people, but I have to respray within a few hours.</li>
            <li> for an everyday cologne this is one of my go-to ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not an everyday cologne.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not over-powering if not applied too heavily.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t waste your money like i did</li>
            <li> Some retailers sell fake cologne while others sell old bottles that might have leaked or dried out.</li>
            <li> Turned out that it was in mint condition (packaging and scent) and I got it for half the price of a department store!</li>
            <li> He is pretty picky with his colognes, but had nothing bad to say about this one.</li>
            <li> I usually wear Drakkar Noir by Guy Laroche.</li>
            <li> I can apply several sprays of it and it still smells faint and it can&#x27;t be smelled on me by others.</li>
            <li> Not sure why mfg feel they need to glitz up the packaging at the expense of functionality.  </li>
            <li> i have purchased this item in the past from dept stores</li>
            <li> I have used this Chrome Azzaro in the past and like it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if legit.</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> Of course when checking reviews i usually look at the lowest rated ones.</li>
            <li> Writing a review for cologne is silly since its definitely a matter of opinion in smell..</li>
            <li> I was not sure if i wanted to buy perfume on amazon, but some how got carried away by reviews and price on this item.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if i should chance another cologne or not, but i am  thinking as long as i can spot a fake</li>
            <li> Sorry, I&#x27;m not a professional!).  </li>
            <li> Easily the worst spray head</li>
            <li> Not one was a negative.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken to hiding the stuff because it gives me migraine headaches - massive pain, nausea, bad taste in my mouth...</li>
            <li> this is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely disgusted with this fake item since I have used the real thing for a while now.</li>
            <li> but this is a fake.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I stopped using it until I get this resolved.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe what others say about buying perfume from Amazon being fake.  </li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this if you need a fragrance to wear at work.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend had been asking for this cologne for over a year, but in stores it was so expensive.</li>
            <li> you have priced this fragrance you know how expensive it can be...</li>
            <li> being the way not to get a FAKE...</li>
            <li> he wears a suit to work and this will compliment his attire there or casual wear..</li>
            <li> DUE TO THIS HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE</li>
            <li> Well i got what i paid for....cheap and very poor quality!</li>
            <li> was shocked to see the Mfg date of this product when i received it :01/12/07, this product was made 5years before.</li>
            <li> This is a must buy, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s AWFUL.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I purchased by the reviews. My guy loves it, perfect scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming but smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> i only give this one star cause it kinda smells like chrome and kinda looks like it but this is a fake. once you spray the cologne that&#x27;s all you get. the orginal would last the whole day. don&#x27;t waste your money and time buying this.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell- Wish I smelt it before buying it- I think I used it twice than gave it to my dad.</li>
            <li> Not an overpowering scent.  Meaning, there are many out there that one pump of the spray can be too much in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I can pretty much sum this up in a few words.  I often get comments about how good I smell. \\&quot;Ooh! You smell good!\\&quot; even my daughters tell me, \\&quot;Daddy, you smell good.\\&quot;  This fragrance is smooth.  It is cool in the summer and warm in the winter.  It is the most consistant fragrance for me to date. I would say, that is why this recent purchase was probably my 6th bottle. I recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this cologne! Always buy it for my husband. ðŸ˜» Lol makes wanna hug him all dayyyyy!ðŸ’‹</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, I&#x27;m not giving it to him till Christmas, but of course when it came in the mail I had to open it and smell it! It smelt soooo goood! This is a deffinite pick. I sprayed some on my arm, it stayed ALL day. I just wanted to get a smell sniff, it was there the entire day until I showered the next morning! Good thing I didn&#x27;t hang out with him that day he&#x27;d be like whaattt haha. But this is a deffinite pick for any guy that wants to smell yummyyy.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this cologne, it&#x27;s not to strong, and I looked around and found it on Amazon, it&#x27;s alot cheap here.</li>
            <li> This smells so good, this is such a great price.  The smell is not too strong, it smells shower fresh.  Great stocking stuffer</li>
            <li> My son has been using it for years. Great price from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using Azzaro Chrome since 2004, when I first found my Roommate&#x27;s. I used his until he pretty much cut me off and I bought my own. I have used this in the Clubs and just going to work, when I feel like smelling great. I have received many compliments from women. This is actually my wife&#x27;s favorite Cologne that I have,and I have many. It is definitely in my top 3 Colognes that I have EVER used. If you want to just smell good, or get attention from women with a fragrance, this one will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I brought this cologne as a Christmas present for my fiance and he loved it! For the price, the bottle was huge!!! One or two sprays  lasts all day. This is a good quality product that should last awhile, if used properly.</li>
            <li> I first heard about this cologne from a female co-worker. After going to the mall to have a smell (amazing) and jumping online to read some customer reviews, I was sold. To be honest, I was skeptical about ordering online because I had read other reviews of cologne on Amazon stating that the bottle they received was \\&quot;stale\\&quot; or \\&quot;not the same as when [they] smelled in stores.\\&quot; I&#x27;m telling you right now, I had no problems with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some men are going to say this cologne isn&#x27;t masculine enough and it smells like perfume. It definitely smells like perfume when you smell the bottle, but if you actually spray it on, it smells nothing like it. I usually wear Drakkar Noir by Guy Laroche. Just to let you know right now, this scent is the complete opposite. While DN has a strong, masculine spicy seductive tone of smell to it, Chrome has a soft, under the surface, hint of citrus, intoxicating kind of effect. It&#x27;s like smelling a more gentle side of a man&#x27;s personality. How sexy can that be? The scent is so soft that you will be tempted to spray more because you think it&#x27;s not there, but trust me, it&#x27;s there! This smell works better when I spray on my skin rather than clothing. But then again, you have to find a cologne that works well with your natural scent. For me, this will be number two all-time only behind the Noir. I love getting random whiffs of this cologne throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I tried to stay away from the typical \\&quot;LADIES LOVE IT\\&quot; kind of review. If you&#x27;re a male and the only reason why you&#x27;re buying this cologne is because \\&quot;women love it,\\&quot; you should definitely find another cologne that works for you. If you&#x27;re a female looking for a gift or looking for a scent for her man, look no further. I would recommend Chrome and rate it 9/10 overall (10 for smell, 8 for longevity). It&#x27;s one of the best colognes I&#x27;ve ever worn.</li>
            <li> Chrome Azzaro is one of the best Mens perfumes i have ever used. I would highly recommend this for someone looking for a light, long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume online and it is one of the best perfume i have ever used. Smells great and very reasonbaly priced than leading stores.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s fave cologne - he gets others, but keeps coming back to this one. The price on Amazon tends to be pretty good compared to dept stores. He actually had just bought some from a dept store, looked on here and saw it $10 cheaper for the next size up, so we&#x27;re returning the one to the dept store. why not, w/ free shipping (amazon&#x27;s super saver)?</li>
            <li> This has really grown on me. Although it took probably a few months, I actually use it as my go to cologne these days. I never thought that I&#x27;d find an equal to my favorite Hugo cologne. I recommend for a light scent only requiring 1 spray on pulsating points.</li>
            <li> very good , i was going to buy it at kohls for $60 but found out its cheaper here</li>
            <li> Very good transaction. Would do business with this vendor again in a heartbeat. 5 Stars!</li>
            <li> This is my husbands favorite cologne. I rarely buy it for him because it is very pricey. So I am glad I was able to find a better price on Amazon. :)</li>
            <li> I always receive compliments when wearing this cologne.</li>
            <li> I thought it was too good to be true. The package was a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Chrome is a wonderful Summer sent.  I have worn it for years alternating with Cool Water.  I like to match the deodorant to the cologne so nothing clashes.  Lots of positive remarks from people I meet.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it, not heavy like some of them out there.   But price is higher on Amazon I bought it at Macy&#x27;s for less.</li>
            <li> I think this cologne is a solid buy any time. I have used it before and it lasted well but the last bottle I got from Amazon must have been old or simply fake because it does not last at all!! I plan to buy another bottle from a trusted source just to compare because this product is definitely substandard. I&#x27;ll be asking for a refund once I get the good product to compare. I cannot even get out of the house before there&#x27;s barely a trace of it on me!! Needless to say, I stopped using it until I get this resolved.</li>
            <li> Great product! Wife loves the smell!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriends brother. It smells really great and he loved it. I highly recommend this cologne</li>
            <li> I really love it. The smell is perfect and everyone around you will love it too. Highly recommended for everyone.</li>
            <li> My husband got this as a sample when he bought my Dolce &amp; Gabana... so I got him this for Christmas! He loved it!</li>
            <li> although after a while, i think the nose gets used to the smell and can&#x27;t smell it as well as it did the first time i applied it, the chrome is an excellent product</li>
            <li> Although I wasn&#x27;t able to receive this item by Christmas, it was delivered shortly after.  As the product is cologne, I was concerned that it may have sat on a shelf for a while and the scent may be off.  Turned out that it was in mint condition (packaging and scent) and I got it for half the price of a department store!</li>
            <li> We stumbled across this scent passing through a department store one day and couldn&#x27;t get over how great it was, except for the price. Found it for less on Amazon and was very pleased. I am sensitive to certain scents and this does not bother me, it&#x27;s light, clean and still manly.</li>
            <li> AWESOME!!!! I bought this for my husband! It is his favorite cologne...and mine on him! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely the REAL deal! !00% Legit and the BEST price we have EVER Seen for this size, anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the package way earlier than expected, (Awesome!!) and packaged excellently!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cologne itself was sealed in plastic and the whole inside of the box was protected perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely purchase this product from this seller again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
            <li> While the 3.4 oz bottle of Chrome that I received appears to be in good condition and I do enjoy the way it smells, it does not seem right. I can apply several sprays of it and it still smells faint and it can&#x27;t be smelled on me by others. The smells also fades very quickly and is about gone in a couple of hours. Dilute? Counterfeit? Defective? I don&#x27;t know but I would not recommend purchasing Chrome from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I usually never buy cologne without knowing what it smells like first. I took my chances this time, and based my decision on the great reviews this cologne got. I got it today (it&#x27;s a Christmas gift for my Dad). I couldn&#x27;t wait to smell it. IT IS AMAZING! Wonderful scent. My Dad is going to be thrilled. I get him a new cologne every year.</li>
            <li> this is my second purchase and chrome suits me.  my wife who has rhinitis is very sensitive to smell and chrome passed with flying colors.</li>
            <li> Tuve un poco de miedo antes de comprar el perfume por lo que es considerado clasico y para personas mayores pero DEFINITIVAMENTE LAS MUJERES LO ADORAN jajaja 100% recomendado, incluso se acercan a oler y comprobar si eres tu el del olor o es el ambiente!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Seems to last pretty long especially on your clothes...You will get compliments on it where ever you go!!</li>
            <li> Product good value for the price. I would give it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that I wanted to return the gift, as the person for whom it was for cheated on me. However, because its a liquid it couldn&#x27;t be returned. Ended up giving it to my dad for his bday. Wish I could have returned it tho. Good value of item tho</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 16 year old son solely on reviews alone. This is by far his favorite cologne. It has such a fresh, clean scent...it&#x27;s wonderful. I&#x27;m going to buy this four my.youngest son&#x27;s 5th birthday. He loves it too! This is a must buy, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product. I would recommend it</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband. He loves it and I love it! (maybe I do more than him) The scent is not so strong as usual for men fragrances yet it has a manly thing in it. Good to try. I am not gonna say too much because I want just my husband wearing it!!</li>
            <li> Geat purchase! This is my favorite men&#x27;s cologne and definitely one of my husband&#x27;s favorites as well.. This is an excellent deal!</li>
            <li> I shopped around at my local department stores and this item was much more expensive than what I bought it for online. This product was purchased for my husband. He was pleased with the scent and so was I.</li>
            <li> Ok, this product was a good price and good packaging, but the delivery time was long! it seemed to be in transit forver... I liked the product and gave it as a gift!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and I love when he wears it! The scent is clean, masculine and very sexy. It is a long lasting scent, as others have previously noted.... he puts it on in the morning and I  can still smell it at the end of the day. Guys if you&#x27;re looking for a cologne your wife or girlfriend will love pick this one up!</li>
            <li> I got one after reading all the positive reviews and I have to say, I agree with them. The smell is very strong -- all parts -- head, heart and base. Don&#x27;t know why it is not labelled as unisex.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Amazon.com and compared to the testers at Macy&#x27;s this same one smells different like it is weaker and does not smell the same as the one at Macy&#x27;s. It&#x27;s close but there&#x27;s something off with it. However it still is a good cologne and I have gotten compliments from people, but I have to respray within a few hours.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for the price. The shipping was quick unlike what the prediction was and I am very happy</li>
            <li> My boyfriend wears this and it is amazing had to purchase when he ran out. Not too sweet or spicy just the perfect sent</li>
            <li> I Got This Spray This Week, I Sprayed It Once And It Literally Lasted All Day It Even Smelled Like Chrome The Next Day, This Fragrance Smells Amazing, And It Last&#x27;s All Day, What Else Can You Want?</li>
            <li> The Chrome came quickly and in pretty condition. My only complaint was that it claimed to be new, yet the plastic on the outside was missing and the box was banged up. That led me to wonder if it may have been used because it had obviously been opened before. Other then that it seems to be fine. I would more then likely buy from this company again, there prices were by far the best.</li>
            <li> Though not the longest lasting cologne, it does smell good and that is after all the only reason to buy a cologne</li>
            <li> By far one of the best colognes I ever purchase...</li>
            <li> Smell great , I love it !!!!</li>
            <li> Well i have to say that chrome is great. The first day i wore it work people were just like WOW! I usually cycle about 7-8 different cologne trying to change it up everyday, but Chrome really got peoples attention especially the ladies! Even some guys were like \\&quot;Dude what is that?\\&quot;. This is a must have. But dont tell everyone hahaha</li>
            <li> Chrome belongs in every man&#x27;s collection.  It is a great scent that has no peculiarities that someone out there might hate.  It is mainly floral with some fruity tones and minimal spice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROBLEM:  The spray nozzle is embellished with plastic.  Mine drips on itself when spraying, wasting a bunch.  I took a pair of pliers and tore off all the plastic leaving only the nozzle on the stem.  Works fine now.  Not sure why mfg feel they need to glitz up the packaging at the expense of functionality.  Easily the worst spray head I have ever encountered!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I just have to add after owning this fragrance for a while now, that it is probably my fav out of a dozen others.  It is THAT GOOD.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> bought this for my boyfriend for christmas and he likes it alot.. im not to fond with some colognes but this one smells pretty good!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  Thanks</li>
            <li> i have purchased this item in the past from dept stores and I like the fragrance.  this bottle seems to be old or weak in some way.  the fragrance goes away in less than 1 hour.  I will stick to buying my cologne at dept stores from now on</li>
            <li> My wife and I both live the smell. My Marine son started wearing it and  I tried some. He said its the cologne of the Marines.</li>
            <li> Spray it in your hair, spray it on your junk, brush your teeth with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, don&#x27;t buy this cologne. Only one man should smell this good: me.</li>
            <li> Chrome was always one of my favorites, but it would take me forever to use 3.4 oz up!  But for the price, it looks like you&#x27;d pay the same for 1/2 that much (at least today).</li>
            <li> The price I paid for here was worth it!!!!    I love Chrome and it&#x27;s always been my favourite!</li>
            <li> Great smell, but I&#x27;ve been using it for a while so it&#x27;s not as exciting to me as it once was.  Also, it&#x27;s so popular instead of hearing, \\&quot;Mmmm you smell great, what is that?\\&quot;  I hear, \\&quot;Hey, are you wearing Chrome?  Oh yeah, so-and-so wears that too.\\&quot;  So it&#x27;s nice, but it&#x27;s getting a little played out so to speak.</li>
            <li> good smelling and nicely priced.</li>
            <li> My husband wears this daily.  I loved being able to get this for about 1/2 the price that I would have to pay in a retail store.&lt;br /&gt;Will certainly do this again.</li>
            <li> I love this, it smells absolutely fantastic. Even my daughter says it smells good. Going to give it to my husband for his birthday. He will love it and I can&#x27;t wait to smell it on him ;) The smell is great, not to strong but strong enough to leave an impression. It came well packaged and arrived rather fast. Definitely would consider purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a Christmas gift for a family member.  I thought he would like the scent as much as my husband did.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with everyone else who is giving this product a great review. It&#x27;s really good and longevity is pretty nice. This is def. a summer cologne and I use this mostly as my work cologne. It&#x27;s inoffensive and smells wonderful and clean.</li>
            <li> bought this colone 2nd time one month ago from AMAZON and love it  the price was great (can&#x27;t beat it anywhere)and smells great,getting many compliments  will buy it again in the future  thanks AMAZON...........M.P.</li>
            <li> It was good. Great Price.</li>
            <li> Good buy, and my boyfriend loved the smell and size!</li>
            <li> this cologne is one of my favorites. for the price it is a pretty good deal. for an everyday cologne this is one of my go-to ones. i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i purchased this cologne for a friend of mine for christmas.  it smelled amazing, was sold at an excellent price, and was larger than i expected! (no complaints)!</li>
            <li> Esta fragancia es acu&amp;aacute;tica-met&amp;aacute;lica un poco fuerte al principio pero conforme avanza se torna elegante, fresca y hasta un poco sensual, no me gustaba al inicio pero si es bastante agradable.</li>
            <li> This smells so good and it doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly! I ordered it for my guy and amazon has it at the best price.</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend Purchased Me A Bottle For An Anniversary Gift. AND 2 Days Later It Fell Out Of the Medicine Cabinet into my marble sink and the Bottle Broke&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I Quickly Ordered A replacement one She Didnt Notice The Difference ! Haha SHH Dont Tell!</li>
            <li> This smells so good and my husband (and dog) love wearing this!</li>
            <li> Awesome scent to it. Not that musky but it has a pure smell to it. I have purchased this brand many times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try the Azzaro Chrome for some time and the great price on Amazon was too tempting. And boy am I glad I did buy.. Its a great unobtrusive perfume which I plan to use on a daily basis</li>
            <li> Great, but very strong only need a little</li>
            <li> A gift for my son who loves this fragrance.</li>
            <li> This smells so Good on my husband!  Don&#x27;t believe what others say about buying perfume from Amazon being fake.  They just don&#x27;t want you to enjoy the cheap but quality products that they are enjoying!!</li>
            <li> NICE FRAGRENCE WITH STAYING POWER DOESNT DISSAPATE AS QUICKLY AS OTHERS. WOMEN LIKE THE FRESH AND LIGHT SCENT AS I DO. WILL KEEP THIS IN MY ARSENAL</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it. Not to mention, it smells amazing! And its a really big bottle for a really good price! Loved it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 36 yr old husband - Loved the scent and will be buying more! He is pretty picky with his colognes, but had nothing bad to say about this one.</li>
            <li> I liked the fragrance in the store but did not want to pay the $60-$100 dollars for the bottle. Found the same thing here and it was a third of the price. Giving to boyfriend for his birthday, and I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This is the one cologne I can wear &amp; people will always comment on how good it smells (very nice and not over-powering). And amazon always has a great price on it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to go for a cologne without smelling it yourself, but I would highly highly recommend this one as a good everyday scent.  I would describe it as being very fresh or crisp, like a cool ocean breeze with a hint of some sort of spice and slightly grassy or herby (Citrus notes maybe? Sorry, I&#x27;m not a professional!).  I have gotten many compliments on it when I first started wearing it to work and would highly recommend it as a great, cheaper scent useable almost anytime!  It will last well through a full 8 hr shift at work using 2 sprays.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is very nice. It does however lacks in longevity and projection.  It is best used during a summer/spring period in my opinion. My biggest preference always goes to a fragrance which is not only good but also lasts at least 6-8hours and this one doesn&#x27;t even come close.  Anyways just my 2 cents</li>
            <li> I have used this Chrome Azzaro in the past and like it. It is good to the last spray. Will order it again,</li>
            <li> Good price. My boyfriend loved it and he smells great ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT THIS SMELL SO DAMN GOOD ON MY MAN ..LADIES YOU MUST BUY THIS FOR YOUR MAN HE WILL LIKE IT</li>
            <li> A MUST HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION, OR GIVE AS A GIFT. THE BOX WAS SEALED AND NEW JUST LIKE A SAW IT IN THE STORE, I PUT IT ON MY SHIRT AND I STILL CAN SMELL IT ON MY UNDER SHIRT.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this cologne several times from other places (mall, online stores) in the past few years and I know that it usually lasts a long time, almost an entire day.&lt;br /&gt;This one barely lasts a few hours. I spray a little on my wrist, just as a test and the scent is completely gone in two-three hours.&lt;br /&gt;To be sure, I sprayed some from a small sample vial the next day and sure thing it lasted until late evening. I went to the gym at 9PM and I could still smell the cologne on me.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I do not count on this to be as reliable and will probably have to carry a bulky bottle it it with me to actually keep the scent on me for longer that few hours.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this cologne and decided to buy it. The smell is really easy and not too strong like others. It lasts me the whole day and keeps me smelling fresh. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is thinking about buying, Delivery took about a week because i used standard shipping but everything came in great condition.</li>
            <li> My lesbian sister loves to wear this.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves the scent!</li>
            <li> Bought this fragrance from Amazon for my husband without even trying it out based on online descriptions and reviews. I am very happy with my purchase. The smell is fantastic. It is very fresh and clean and very distinctive. Also, the smell is extremely lasting. My husband puts it on early in the morning and I can still smell it quite strongly when he comes back home from work. He already finished up half a bottle. And the price on Amazon is unbeatable. It was even considerably cheaper than the prices on duty free store. I know, cause I did compare. You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this if you need a fragrance to wear at work.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent for summer months--light and fresh.  However not long lasting and often accompanied by that after scent (this is not a technical term) which reveals a high percentage of alcohol.  Overall, refreshing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my boyfriends b-day. The product came in its original box just like the ones you would buy at the mall. he absolutely loved it!!!</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely amazing. This is by far my favorite men&#x27;s cologne. When my boyfriend isn&#x27;t around I&#x27;ll spray it on my pillows to still feel like he&#x27;s there. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing</li>
            <li> I have worn this for years. I always got compliments for the way it wore on me. I keep it and wear it  along with with a couple of other scents to change off with.</li>
            <li> I received many compliments form my peers after wearing this. My only complaint is that it didn&#x27;t last very long on me.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! Smells amazing!! It goes great with just about anybody and its really worth the price you pay for!</li>
            <li> This cologne is one of my favorites. I receive compliments on it, and enjoy the scent very much. Definitely worth a try to anyone on the fence.</li>
            <li> This smells so good and is perfect for a night out.  It is so much cheaper on here that it is other places.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to buy a cologne without smelling it first.  I saw the great reviews and decided to take a chance since it is so cheap vs. department stores.  Now, I&#x27;m becoming more and more addicted to the fragrance. Great compliments whenever I go to social gatherings is a+++++</li>
            <li> usually try something different every time, but i think i&#x27;ll keep a bottle of this on hand no matter what.&lt;br /&gt;lot&#x27;s of compliments. amazon has great price compared to the dept stores.</li>
            <li> Item ordered in a timely manner and it perfect condition. My boyfriend and I love this fragrance!  Thanks</li>
            <li> I think one of the biggest attractions on the man is his cologne. The first time I smelled the scent was on one of my 80-year-old patients which I must admit it was a bit awkward because I couldn&#x27;t stop taking a whiff. The second time I smelled it, I thought my patient had return, but I was mistaken when I realized my 20-year-old coworker was wearing it. Since then, I have bought my two teenage boys this cologne and they cannot stop raving about how the girls at their schools say they will forever be known as the two guys with a heavenly scent.</li>
            <li> simply this is one of my best perfumes have pains in his elaboration there any kind of complaints about that I hope to see more brand offerings ARE THE BEST</li>
            <li> This is all I wear, has been for 15+ years, I get lots of compliments on how I smell good.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, already knowing that it was one of his favorites. He was not disappointed. It smells great on him and it&#x27;s not too strong or overpowering. I would reccomend it for sure!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend had been asking for this cologne for over a year, but in stores it was so expensive. Here, I got it at half the price and he&#x27;s so thankful.</li>
            <li> My fiancÃ©e loves the scent. Doesnt matter what anyone thinks but her (though the general consensus seems to be that females like it)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my father, and he raved about the scent. So I decided to purchase one for my husband as well. He also adored it and spoke about its long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and it smells so good. Very masculine. As soon as I run out I plan on getting more or at least more from this company a very good brand of cologne</li>
            <li> Excellent + fast delivery.  Thank You&lt;br /&gt;B Arndt</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THE CLEAN AND MASCULINE SMELL OF THIS COLOGNE FOR MEN. IT IS GOOD FOR ANY TIME OF THE DAY OR OCCASION.</li>
            <li> Smells a bit funky. Not sure if legit.</li>
            <li> Got it for my teen son. He loves it and uses it frequently, and I love how it smells on him  :)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware of this cologne, until someone suggested it to me. Good value. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne and has been using it for over 2 years now.  It does not irritate his skin like some others. Lasting, soft scent makes me love it too.</li>
            <li> Love the smell- it&#x27;s very sexy. The product arrived fully wrapped as if I had bought it right from the store. I received the product before the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> Something about this EDT just sticks to my skin like glue. I&#x27;m a boilermaker from Australia, I put this stuff on at 6am to go to work, welding with fumes everywhere all day, sweating in 40 degree Celcius heat. Come home at 5pm and still smell good, that is really worth something. Its not overbearing, just crisp and sharp. Excellent value for money.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has used this cologne for years. He has always paid store price. Here, it was easy to find, affordable and exactly what I needed for a last minute birthday present.</li>
            <li> My husband has worn the same cologne for years and makes sure to buy it himself. I can understand that but this year I went out on a limb and bought this based on others reviews. It is better than Cool Water and Nautica. I love it. The bottle is even sexy. He was very surprised to get this and that he genuinely likes wearing it everyday to work. I will be buying more!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now.  Girlfriend loves it, and a bottle this size lasts me over a year, using 1-2 sprays a day.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.. a classic.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Excelente 100% recomendable&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, I get compliments on it a lot.</li>
            <li> good price and smells great on my husband - purchased as a present for him, for me!</li>
            <li> The ladies love this smell on me :).</li>
            <li> This is a cologne that I have wanted to try for a long time but is a little pricey in stores.  Then I thought let me check on Amazon and boy am I glad I did.  Best price I have ever seen Chrome selling for was right under my nose.  The reviews on here are accurate in regards to this scent&#x27;s quality and it does last a fair amount of the day.  Honestly there are colognes that last longer, but few get the Wow reaction that Chrome provides.  Everybody wants to know what it is, women love it and even guys ask what the name of that cologne is, so they can add it to their arsenal of colognes.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have used it a couple of times and the smell lasts for hours and hours. Unlike other fragrances I&#x27;ve used, I can actually smell this one on myself. The smell is not too strong and not too light. I fully recommend it.</li>
            <li> one of the best colognes! I recommend it! definitely will draw the ladies attention! and be smelling good all day n night!!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed Chrome Cologne for a very long time. It is a really good sent that stays with you at the same time it does not overpower you with too strong a smell.I will continue to purchase and wear Chrome probably for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used chrome azzaro for many years. its scent and effect goes on from morning to night, on same level</li>
            <li> Azzaro CHROME is one and only one! I like it very much, and IÂ¨ll by more! Everyone should try it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this scent on a man.</li>
            <li> Gift for son for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;If you have priced this fragrance you know how expensive it can be... this was a GREAT deal.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Smells Fresh and clean. Great year round scent. I would highly recommend Chrome!</li>
            <li> MMMM i loved the clean scent on my husband.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews about the possibility of getting a fake product I was really concerned. The price ($36) was almost half the price of department store prices. So I decided to take a chance especially since it was shipped directly by Amazon. I am glad I did, as the product came in sealed original box, made in Paris, and the original scent. It was the real thing, at a real bargain price. I am happy. I cannot say anything about other suppliers that Amazon works with, but Amazon ships the real thing.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s favorite fragrance and I happen to think it&#x27;s a great one too.  It was a gift and he was happy to receive it. Service was quick and product was received as I expected - new and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son for Christmas as this is one of his favorite colognes.  It has a very fresh and clean smell.</li>
            <li> Have gotten compliments on this scent,  its great and not too expensive. Came in nice packaging and looks good on my dresser.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, amazing price, fast shipping and very well protected so it won&#x27;t break on the way. I use it almost every day and it has lasted for a long time.</li>
            <li> My son has this cologne and even when he only uses one or two squirts of the stuff it&#x27;s way too strong and the scent lingers in the air for over 30 minutes overpowering everything else. I&#x27;ve taken to hiding the stuff because it gives me migraine headaches - massive pain, nausea, bad taste in my mouth...nasty.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to overpower your date&#x27;s perfume (or if you want to make everyone around you tell you, \\&quot;Man, you put on too much cologne.\\&quot;)and give her a headache and stomach ache (because you despise her) then use this cologne. If not...please, for the love of all that is holy...do not buy or use this stuff!!!! It&#x27;s AWFUL.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for my nephew!  Refreshing fragrance!</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant but does not last very long - withing a few hours it will be mostly gone.</li>
            <li> i love this cologne and i was able to get this size for an affordable price.  it came very quickly and i love it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li> I have bought this at local department stores so when I found it on Amazon at half the price I was thrilled. Its got a great smell but tends to wear off by the end of the day though still slightly noticable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to review things like fragrances, because everybody has different tastes and different body chemistry to start with.  However, if you&#x27;re reading this and not using the stuff with the little ship on the bottle, I&#x27;ll assume that you care what you smell like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chrome is a subtle and clean scent that lasts all day, but isn&#x27;t over-powering... as long as you don&#x27;t use too much, right?  We all know that guy.  It&#x27;s what I use most days and have for a few years now.  I like the clean fragrance, my wife loves it, and I&#x27;m occasionally asked what I wear.  I&#x27;ll avoid the paranoia and assume that this means most people like Chrome... on me anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried it and are looking for a new fragrance, give it a try if it interests you.  The price here is about as good as I&#x27;ve found, but it&#x27;s widely available, and can probably be sampled at most fragrance counters in stores if you want to see how it works on you.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift for one of my sons. He said he like it and thats all that matters - pleasent smell.</li>
            <li> I literally have to carry a stick around me to fight off all the ladies pouncing on me! this is ridiculous! I went from being a zero to a hero in a matter of sprays!</li>
            <li> Product arrived even before it was suppose to. Packaging was put together well. Havent used it yet but I know when I do my team of Woman will go up another 10!</li>
            <li> Have many to help look at. Keep the home fires burning fo time and time again. I saw a chipmonk in the valley.</li>
            <li> amazing scent, men love it and women love it on men, a most have...believe me!</li>
            <li> had this perfume already and love it so had to get a next one so i will always love this product ok thanks much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean fresh scent and not overpowering when used in moderation. I really like it a lot. I get compliments all the time when I wear it.</li>
            <li> este  perfunme es muy  bueno y el olor suave y dura mucho para ser una colonia. megusto es  mi humilde</li>
            <li> There are dozens, perhaps hundreds of men&#x27;s toilette spays and splashes on the market. For the money, and after years of personal experiences with many products, I have found Chrome to be the best of the best. Or at least I am told by those who get close enough to me to make a ranking of their own. Not one was a negative.</li>
            <li> Really big and good smell</li>
            <li> I smelled a sample of this cologne in a sports magazine..and thought it a must have for my husband! He wears it and Im smiling</li>
            <li> Great smell, long lasting, however... not strong enough. I find myself having to use 5 sprays before it is noticeable. Respond to this if anyone has any recommendations!&lt;br /&gt;Areas sprayed: Front and back of neck, on the top of head (hair), and both forearms.&lt;br /&gt;Any tips on where I should spray and how much?</li>
            <li> Has a really nice crisp smell that is not too overpowering and yet lasts a surprisingly long time. Very happy with this purchase and the price.</li>
            <li> arrived in a timely fashion, bottle was bigger then I expected which only means it will last that much longer..</li>
            <li> Women just love it...</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing. This was the cheapest place that I found it for sale. You obviously do not want to buy it before smelling it, so go to your local cologne retailer and take it for a spin. If you like it, jump on amazon and ring it up.</li>
            <li> I have trouble keeping track of how many complements I get wearing this out to bars and parties. Girls love this. One spray on the neck and you are good to go all night long. This scent is sweet and crisp. I recommend this to anyone looking for some good cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not an everyday cologne. If you are looking for that pick up Kenneth Cole Reaction.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!!arrived on time with no issues!Thx!</li>
            <li> Smells great--fresh and clean. This is definitely a daily wear cologne. Sniff! Sniff!</li>
            <li> Wouldnt say it smells bad but def the least favorite in my collection but thats just me. I ordered it just on its popularity without even smelling it beforehand.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this stuff and so do I.  Arrived on time and packaged well.  It smells just as good as if you bought it at the store but I saved about $30 bucks.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and if you shop patiently, you can find great buys on the product.  This is always a gift as I prefer a slightly muskier scent.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne! He needs more actually! Great quality, I was extremely satisfied! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my son. My husband wanted one too after he tried it. So went and ordered another bottle a week later</li>
            <li> Got this based on other reviews and was quite pleased.  The scent is nice, husband loves it.. it&#x27;s masculine, not woodsy.. he wears a suit to work and this will compliment his attire there or casual wear.. the scent is strong and lasting, so a little goes a long way.  it&#x27;s not over-powering if not applied too heavily.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a really nice smell. I use 3 \\&quot;sprays\\&quot; every morning and lasts me an entire 8 hour day if not more. Not overwhelming at all. I get compliments in the elevators all the time!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this for my son.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Great price, this retails for $75 at Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Not the real chrome, less strong. Smells like its watered down. Package was ripped and the sealed plastic was glued shut not original packaging.</li>
            <li> Well, I have been once more taken by another unscrupulous internet seller. This item smells like NOTHING. Not even close to the original stuff. If it ever smelled like anything, it must have been in the 19th century maybe. I am absolutely disgusted with this fake item since I have used the real thing for a while now. I guess you get what you pay for. I WILL NOT BUY ANY MORE COLOGNES FROM AMAZON.COM DUE TO THIS HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE....OUTRAGEOUS!!!!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I chose this because i like this product and because it was a great price! I would recommend this to anyone interested in this product!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long while now, and used to buy from department stores. I had always found it to be great and would recommend it to all my friends. I decided to purchase it from Amazon because it was cheaper. Well i got what i paid for....cheap and very poor quality! Usually the scent would last ALL day, the one i got from here lasts like 30 mins (&amp; i think i&#x27;m being a bit generous).&lt;br /&gt;I was just now looking into purchasing Kouros, another fav of mine, then i decided to check the reviews on it. Of course when checking reviews i usually look at the lowest rated ones. It seems Kouros &amp; other fragrances sold on Amazon are of similar poor quality; with reviewers saying things like either the products are old or were watered down.&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s back to the depmt stores for me!</li>
            <li> Everybody compliments my man when he wears this! I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes that I own and I own about 10-12 different ones.&lt;br /&gt;It certainly has crisp citrus hints that go with any casual outing or even a semi formal one for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is gentle and not overpowering.  It stays one the whole night so you don&#x27;t have to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great summer/spring/fall smell. This is a good addition to any collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE NOTE: make sure you test it out when you get it. Some retailers sell fake cologne while others sell old bottles that might have leaked or dried out. Do a test for few days make sure the smell is strong and doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> its smells really good and it lasts pretty long. I just should have gotten the bigger bottle instead because its not that big.</li>
            <li> o perfume foi uma otima escolha a fragancia Ã© muito boa e permanece no seu corpo por um bom tempo mesmo depois de vc lavar a roupa kkkkkkkkk</li>
            <li> Good and authentic product at great price. Will back for more. Recommended for your own and as a gift in any occasions.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I thought it would be. Lasts for maybe 2 hours and then I can&#x27;t smell anything. Won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> The ladies love this cologne. I need a broom to get all deez honeys off of me. But seriously its good cologne and i recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always being asked by other women why my husband always smells so good.  This cologne is really the best smelling on the market as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> Great cologne..love the smell of it!</li>
            <li> Was a bit skeptical at first because of the price but this product is what it say&#x27;s it is and I loved it. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> i order this a while back i always buy chrome in the 1.5 oz toilette spray for about the same price as i did the 3.4 oz let me tell you it not the same the 1.5 0z spray that i buy at a store smell great it last all day the smell the 3.4 oz that i bought on here smell last about 20 minutes tops before it wares off i will never buy it again so don&#x27;t waste your money like i did</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the price! I buy  this for my husband every year and I&#x27;m used paying allot more for less... I will order this again next year hopefully the price won&#x27;t go up ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> Gift recipient loved this.</li>
            <li> I read so many comments about the cologne being knockoffs from Amazon. But, that is not true. If you order anything online especially cologne make sure it says, &amp;#34;Ships and Sold from Amazon&amp;#34;. Amazon will not ship knockoff or counterfeit merchandise. Their are a lot of companies though that also ship premium merchandise. Your best bet for cologne or perfume will be direct from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give Chrome by Azzaro 5 Stars for the scent. This cologne is very strong yet not over powering. It has a nice clean scent that is very refreshing when wearing. My top 3 favorite colognes for my body chemistry, because lets face it, it does mix with your own pheromones, is Chrome by Azzaro, Aqua Di Gio, and Gucci Guilty. I have received so many compliments from woman that I don&#x27;t even know with those 3 colognes.</li>
            <li> I hear a lot of people say its too much of a metallic smell.... hence the name Chrome. I receive more compliments over this scent than I do my Armani or Gucci colognes. This stuff has the edge because it lasts so long.</li>
            <li> Writing a review for cologne is silly since its definitely a matter of opinion in smell.. :) but I definitely love the smell and so did my husband. He has used this cologne for quite a while and this purchase was just cuz he had ran out and needed more.</li>
            <li> My wife is very picky and vocal about what scents I wear and she actually liked Chrome. I myself love it! It&#x27;s a refreshing scent, energizes me in the am.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been wanting to try this cologne for some time and finally ended up forking out the dough to get it and it&#x27;s pretty darn good. I really like it.</li>
            <li> This cologne is amazing... i kinda wasnt sure about this until i smelled this particular version...goes great for the summer.. cant wait</li>
            <li> very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;It is very strong perfume but it is an old fashion , even that It is my first azzaro perfume , like it but still the same problem which is fade away quickly .&lt;br /&gt;I spend a lot of money on original perfumes but most of them are fade away quickly but it must not for original one , isn&#x27;t it ??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if anybody know where or which perfume fixed with you all the day , please let me know ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;many thanks</li>
            <li> I bought this for my nephew for Christmas because it is one of the best smelling colognes out there for men. First heard about it from a gospel group. The guys were all great smelling and this is what they wore.</li>
            <li> Very good cologne for the price here on amazon.</li>
            <li> Prompt  service awesome product love it. Arrived just in time for his birthday.</li>
            <li> I kept the old bottle from 2008 around so I wouldnt forget the name of the cologne. I bumped in to it recently cleaning out some old boxes and VIOLA! Amazon had it on sale $30-40 less than JC penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A no brainer. Smells great! My GF loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it takes me back to High School!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People say time machines dont exist! I beg to differ! Colognes do just that for me.</li>
            <li> Considering one of these bottles are 80$ in most stores, I am extremely happy with the price. Smells amazing, and lasts fairly long as well.</li>
            <li> i was fooled by earlier reviews on this product.I was not sure if i wanted to buy perfume on amazon, but some how got carried away by reviews and price on this item.&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked to see the Mfg date of this product when i received it :01/12/07, this product was made 5years before. I used it and its just like sprinkling water no smell. Now i understand how they can sell these items at this price.Get them from any bigger store</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my boyfriend for Christmas.  He really loved it and it smells great.  I love the scent on him.</li>
            <li> My husband first loved this cologne and alternated between it and Chanel Bleu. He has since switched to the Sport version and my son has taken over wearing this original version. They both smell great when they wear them, but there are subtle differences between the two and I think it&#x27;s just a personal preference.</li>
            <li> This is my sons favorite cologne.  So we bought him the big bottle for Christmas.  He was thrilled.  I am glad&lt;br /&gt;I found it at such a good price</li>
            <li> I bought a few colognes after making sure all of them were SHIPPED and SOLD by AMAZON after reading reviews of that being the way not to get a FAKE... I questioned Versace Dreamer so much that i called Amazon to make sure they got they&#x27;re colognes direct.. They assured me they did.. I felt better and the colognes i bought after that case definitely seem legit.. Then came Curve by Liz Claiborne..  It came in the box with the tin lid already off, and the tin didn&#x27;t look like the one in the picture... It was a greenish color, the word Curve was at an angle, and it didn&#x27;t say Claiborne underneath curve... You can find a picture of it on Amazon from another store (who must be selling fakes too)... I called Amazon customer service, and they were great about refunding me my money with no hassle... They also told me to keep the cologne due to the shipping rules.. This was nice because the cologne is fairly close to real curve and smells good.. I just want the real deal seeing as that&#x27;s what i paid for.. I&#x27;m not sure if i should chance another cologne or not, but i am  thinking as long as i can spot a fake i might be ok..  Hope this helps someone... btw Chrome was real</li>
            <li> Diluted with water- No fragrance!</li>
