    <ol>
            <li>great finishing piece!</li>
            <li>Perfect</li>
            <li>Very good tool.</li>
            <li>Great service, excellent product.</li>
            <li>Great addition to the superliner clipper.  </li>
            <li>think its a good tool for a Barber to have in his bag of tricks even if it&#x27;s just a backup.</li>
            <li>awesome and nice clean up finish to give a sharp look just what I was looking for and a great morning shave!</li>
            <li>Not the best quality for professional use.</li>
            <li>nice accessory but dedicated razors work better</li>
            <li>amazing product and super close, great for clean up...</li>
            <li>It appears that I will continue using disposables for the most part.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can have a shaver and a trimmer in one unit.</li>
            <li>The Andis products are great but the shaver attachment feels about as good as the classic remington shaver from the early 90s.</li>
            <li>I use a razor after on the nape of the neck afterwards and my head is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s,,,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhino&lt;br /&gt;Seattle, WA</li>
            <li>Powerful and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>and then some its the first shaver I&#x27;ve used thats so smooth.</li>
            <li>Too get the maximum benefit from this first use the detachable Andis Outliner blade on the BRGC or MVP then follow up with the shaver.</li>
            <li>Admittingly, I did not use any shaving powder (if that makes a difference) and it eventually cut somewhat after many passes over the same place but to that end, I look like someone who is shaving for the first time (lil brown hairs everywhere).  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it was made do</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to grab whiskers.gets hot fast.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this</li>
            <li>This shaver works very well.</li>
            <li>So I figured that since I invested in these expensive clippers that I love (the Oster classic and the Andis TLiner) that I would get the same great results with the Shaver Attachment.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mainly for finishing out a bald fade and cleaning up the lower nape and neck line area...</li>
            <li>Well I shouldn&#x27;t have set my expectations so high.  </li>
            <li>I love the convenience of it, its gets real close, but not as close as a NORELCO with the same attacher, but nobody has the same type of facial hair, so it may be even closer on others.</li>
            <li>If anyone can recommend an electric razor that really really works then please let me know as I am willing to make the long term investment.  </li>
            <li>I use this shaver twice a week on my head and this shaver gets my head completely bald!</li>
            <li>With this shaver I could shave up everyday and get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I have been searching high and low for an electric razor</li>
            <li>I am a mid 20&#x27;s African-American male, and I was looking for something that could shave as close as the trimmers that I normally use.</li>

            <li> After multiple passes over the same area, my facial hair was unaffected.</li>
            <li> I tried with both a short and long length of facial hair</li>
            <li> so I would guess that my hair is not as thick as it use to be and still this attachment didn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li> Tried on dry skin.</li>
            <li> and I pressed down at different pressures while doing so.</li>
            <li> The lack of powder may have caused this but still this is not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Extremely close shave without the irritation</li>
            <li> In other words - yucky.</li>
            <li> I shave everyday now with zero bumps.</li>
            <li> With a razor I could only shave down because its painful to shave up.</li>
            <li> Not only could these not do that, but they failed to cut any hair whatsoever!</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m not sure what I am doing wrong.</li>
            <li> Very hard to beat for the money.</li>
            <li> I am TIRED of paying for the replaceable Fusion blades which costs a fortune.  </li>
            <li> Your trying to use this for the wrong purpose!!!!!!!!!  </li>

            <li> I could not get a closer shave on my mustache with a razor. With a razor I could only shave down because its painful to shave up. With this shaver I could shave up everyday and get a smooth shave. I would absolutely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback is when it comes to shaving my cheeks you have to make a couple of passes because it does not shave as close as the mustache and chin area.</li>
            <li> Very good tool. You won&#x27;t have to worry about charging a shaver ever again. Powerful and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Great addition to the superliner clipper.  Close shave but not under the skin shave so no bumps.</li>
            <li> Great service, excellent product. Extremely close shave without the irritation</li>
            <li> I use this shaver twice a week on my head and this shaver gets my head completely bald! I use a razor after on the nape of the neck afterwards and my head is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s,,,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhino&lt;br /&gt;Seattle, WA</li>
            <li> amazing product and super close, great for clean up... great finishing piece! i dont know what else to say but that!</li>
            <li> To the low star people...  Your trying to use this for the wrong purpose!!!!!!!!!  It&#x27;s mainly for finishing out a bald fade and cleaning up the lower nape and neck line area...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it is.. an attachment, not a stand-a-lone unit, it works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;I think its a good tool for a Barber to have in his bag of tricks even if it&#x27;s just a backup.</li>
            <li> I am a mid 20&#x27;s African-American male, and I was looking for something that could shave as close as the trimmers that I normally use. Not only could these not do that, but they failed to cut any hair whatsoever! After multiple passes over the same area, my facial hair was unaffected. I tried with both a short and long length of facial hair and I pressed down at different pressures while doing so. No method worked and this attachment just simply did not work for my hair type.</li>
            <li> Too get the maximum benefit from this first use the detachable Andis Outliner blade on the BRGC or MVP then follow up with the shaver.</li>
            <li> Not the best quality for professional use.</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for an electric razor simply bc I am TIRED of paying for the replaceable Fusion blades which costs a fortune.  So I figured that since I invested in these expensive clippers that I love (the Oster classic and the Andis TLiner) that I would get the same great results with the Shaver Attachment.  Well I shouldn&#x27;t have set my expectations so high.  I am waving at 40 at this point so I would guess that my hair is not as thick as it use to be and still this attachment didn&#x27;t do much.  Admittingly, I did not use any shaving powder (if that makes a difference) and it eventually cut somewhat after many passes over the same place but to that end, I look like someone who is shaving for the first time (lil brown hairs everywhere).  Also, my face stings as if I got into a fight with the razor. The lack of powder may have caused this but still this is not what I expected.  It appears that I will continue using disposables for the most part.  I am going to buy shaving powder and see if that makes a difference but if you do not see a follow up to this review then assume the same lackluster results.  If anyone can recommend an electric razor that really really works then please let me know as I am willing to make the long term investment.  The Andis products are great but the shaver attachment feels about as good as the classic remington shaver from the early 90s. In other words - yucky.</li>
            <li> I have had the superliner for years. Ordered this and now I&#x27;m not sure what I am doing wrong. Tried on dry skin. Doesn&#x27;t seem to grab whiskers.gets hot fast. Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> nice accessory but dedicated razors work better</li>
            <li> awesome and nice clean up finish to give a sharp look just what I was looking for and a great morning shave!</li>

            <li> Does exactly what it was made do and then some its the first shaver I&#x27;ve used thats so smooth. Perfect</li>
            <li> This shaver works very well. I shave everyday now with zero bumps. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot of pressure with them and they still shave close. Very hard to beat for the money. I love that I can have a shaver and a trimmer in one unit. Buy these!!</li>
