            <li>and the scent is nice!</li>
            <li>Speed Stick Gear is a good product with great protection, although not quite 48 hours.</li>
            <li>Has a good smell to it, but It doesn&#x27;t help prevent me from sweating.</li>
            <li>It will hold up for a good 48 hours</li>
            <li>, we have found all speed stick products to work fairly well.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind the wetness and/or prefer not to &amp;#34;clog&amp;#34; your pores by using an anti-perspirant, etc, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>It smells good, and it lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I figured I would give this a try because I was hearing really good reviews about it.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s good for situations and days when sweating isn&#x27;t going to be a problem.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for someone who doesn&#x27;t like overwhelming scents and an irritative deodorant.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the futhure to keep me satisfied!!</li>
            <li>Really love this deodorant!</li>
            <li>Did exactly what it said and still i was impressed with it.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and price!</li>
            <li>I am really impressed with speed stick and this product; so much so that i&#x27;m making a switch to it!</li>
            <li>This deodorant has a great order, that is strong but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Speed stick gear goes on smooth, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN AND NOT INFLUENCED IN ANY WAY.</li>
            <li>b) is the smell nice.  </li>
            <li>ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN AND NOT INFLUENCED IN ANY WAY.</li>
            <li>and I liked the outdoorsy types of scents that it came in, as opposed to the women&#x27;s that smelled like flowers or fruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells like a very strong, trendy men&#x27;s cologne or soap, and as a woman I just don&#x27;t want that scent on me.</li>
            <li>I took them on vacation with me, going from Upstate New York to Humid Florida, a perfect time to investigate this claim.</li>
            <li>This is BY FAR the best deodorant that I have EVER used..</li>
            <li>The Speed Stick Gear Deodorant is by far the best anti-perspirant I have ever tried, hence the 5-star rating.</li>
            <li>Happily it kept me fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>It smells great, kept me dry and smelling good for 48 hours, even after going to the gym!</li>
            <li>First, it smells great.  </li>
            <li>really love it</li>
            <li>but I think they could work on the strength of the odor more.</li>
            <li>It also holds up really well when I go to the gym and has a great scent that isn&#x27;t too overbearing.</li>
            <li>I love the way it rolls on, I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;d looking for a good deodorant, this is worth trying.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the scent, but it is not the most appealing to me.  </li>
            <li>The smell was ok but because it is not antiperspirant the body odor will go through.</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue wearing it .....</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t consider the aroma to be overwhelming, as some reviewers felt.  </li>
            <li>I understand many people prefer a deodorant over an antiperspirant/deodorant  and that may work well if they don&#x27;t sweat alot.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the smell and am going to use this from now on!~</li>
            <li>it is a great scent to use for the under arms after taking a shower and it is highly recommended!</li>
            <li>There are many reasons why I gave this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I got this to product by Influencer, and I just absolutly love it.</li>
            <li>I travel 3 to 4 days a week for my job and didn&#x27;t feel confident it would have lasted 48 hours</li>
            <li>The smell was more like grass to me than anything else.</li>
            <li>Two aspects that I love are that.. 1.</li>
            <li>Id advise something with better deodorizing features.</li>
            <li>It was a bit overwhelming, but I got used to it as the day went on.</li>
            <li>Speed Stick Gear Deodorant in the Fresh Force scent is a good deodorant that protects you from odor but not from wetness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more for men but</li>
            <li>I tend to stay away from strongly-scented deodorants, so Speed Stick isn&#x27;t my top choice.  </li>
            <li>Inside, the deodorant is a cyan-blue semi-seethrough solid-gel type of a thing (for lack of a better description).</li>
            <li>There are two gray grippy areas at the two sides for a better hold on the container.</li>
            <li>The Fresh Force smell is good, but not as good as the Fresh Force version of the smell found in the body spray</li>
            <li>Regardless, I got my deoderant back and couldn&#x27;t be more happy!</li>
            <li>I am happy that I found a new fave!</li>
            <li>I recently tried the new Speed Stick Gear and was immediately happy and VERY impressed with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that Speed Stick has consistently provided me with optimum odor coverage.</li>
            <li>First ..smell, good without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>I loved this deodorant, coming from an avid spray can user.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Looks good smells good and only lasts all</li>
            <li>He has always liked Speed Stick as a brand, but this Gear Fresh Force is his favorite because the scent is restrained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t do the most important thing that it&#x27;s supposed to: de-odor me.</li>
            <li>Speed Stick&#x27;s Gear has a light, refreshing scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different deodorant for men and this is one of the best and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Speed Stick Gear smells great, lasted long, and most importantly didn&#x27;t ball up in my hair!</li>
            <li>What really impressed me were the lasting fresh scent and the antiperspirant capabilities.</li>
            <li>; deodorant applies and dries quickly, and has a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li>Easy to grip tube and easy to raise the deodorant to your desired level.  </li>
            <li>I am very loyal to my brand and until now I would never switch.</li>
            <li>If I had one gripe it would be how strong smelling it was.  </li>
            <li>The scent is strong when applying but lessens over time.</li>
            <li>This product smells great and gives 48 hour lasting protection to keep you dry when you need it most!!!</li>
            <li>But it is an effective deodorant that will keep you smelling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It washed/rinsed off fine then.</li>
            <li>The scent itself isn&#x27;t the most extraordinary</li>
            <li>Has a great smell and last throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Received this product for free from Influenster so that I could test it out.</li>
            <li>was overall happy with</li>
            <li>the product.&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for free to product test through influenster.</li>
            <li>I used to use the cheap arm and hammer stuff.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy that the scent is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>The bluish product glides on smoothly and does not stain or mark clothes.</li>
            <li>I received this product free from Influenster about a month ago.</li>
            <li>Not only is the variety of scents great</li>
            <li>I got to try it free from Influenster.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the Fresh Force scent.</li>
            <li>I love this Speed Stick deodorant and the Fresh Force scent.</li>
            <li>It keeps me foul-odor free but lets my sweat glands do their thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a fairly light day of yard work</li>
            <li>My son has been using this and so far it has done a good job keeping the odor at bay.</li>
            <li>After working out, most antiperspirant-type sticks are not the right thing.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is very powerful and has a robust but not overpowering scent that lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I did not experience any irritation even though it is very powerful.</li>
            <li>Overall very nice does its job well.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, works well for him, and have a light, clean scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm.  </li>
            <li>Best product that I highly recommend to anyone looking for something that actually works.</li>
            <li>Amazing product I highly recommend,&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>This is really rare!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deodorant for someone on the go because it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>Have also used the Clean Peak.</li>
            <li>Both are clean scents, and they don&#x27;t overpower.</li>
            <li>As I said the scents are clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall for those wearing suits this is a great product as it will keep you dry at all times and your cologne will be your fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It just smells emphatically clean in the morning.</li>
            <li>does a great job of keeping you dry.</li>
            <li>And everyone was right!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bartender and the Speed Stick Gear is a great product that keeps me smelling fresh for long nights at the bar.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but it really worked well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Actually, deodorants are better for you since you really don&#x27;t need to clog up your sweat glands by not sweating at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking for odor control only, this is a good choice.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a really good product.</li>
            <li>The scent is fair, sort of cheap soap with a hint of pine tree air freshener (yes, the kind you hang in your car) but seriously, skip this one</li>
            <li>It is remarkable as to how dry this keeps me.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It works verry well with all day protection, THe smell of it is great too unlike some other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I received two complementary Speed Stick Gear antiperspirant/deodorant sticks in Clean Peak and Fresh Force from Influenster.com</li>
            <li>By the end of the 48 hour period I&#x27;m happy to say that I it was still actively working.  </li>
            <li>I got the Fresh Force scent and the Clean Peak scent.</li>
            <li>use it everyday in the morning one time a day, and I smell good all day even when I get sweaty from the gym, and even when I go for a run I don&#x27;t stink like BO any more</li>
            <li>Seriously, I never feel the need to have to use it more than once a day.</li>
            <li>A little too strong for our family, while the scent was manly and attractive (kind of like the soap irish spring)</li>
            <li>This deodorant provides a fresh clean smell that starts out a bit too strong but then becomes normal clean scent as it blends with your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most comfortable choice, but I gave it five stars because I believe this is a heavy duty deodorant which does what it says it does, and if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, there aren&#x27;t a whole lot of good choices out there.</li>
            <li>One of my new favorite deodorants.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I will never buy another brand of deodorant…as long as Speed Stick Gear is available.</li>
            <li>Super Dry Speed Stick (Sport Talc) has a refreshing clean scent and glides on easily.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a mess on my shirts, which is great.</li>
            <li>Glad this can keep up with me and my busy routine!</li>
            <li>This has a strong, fresh scent that, personally, I really like.</li>
            <li>I received this as a free sample from influenster, and have been using it about 2 weeks now, and it&#x27;s held up through intense workouts, and stressful days at work, and it has definitely held its own.</li>
            <li>It is fresh- yet not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It keeps me fresh throughout the day</li>
            <li>I got this complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li>It smells like fresh laundry</li>
            <li>I revived my Speed Stick Gear complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li>I was genuinely surprised to learn that I love this Speed Stick Gear Deodorant, Fresh Force.  </li>
            <li>and I can smell the Fresh Force scent.  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend, Tammy, also likes the scent of Fresh Force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fresh scent that prevents underarm odor for hours and hours.  </li>
            <li>I received this product complimentary of Influenster.</li>
            <li>I received this complimentary of Influenster.</li>
            <li>I actually find the scent to be nicely unisex.</li>
            <li>I was rather horrified to find that I had noticeable underarm odor after using the Speed Stick Fresh Force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Speed Stick Gear Body Spray, Fresh Force,</li>
            <li>I received this to try in a vox box from influenster and at first thought it was great because it really does keep you dry for 48 hours.</li>
            <li>The lid is easily removed and the dial at the bottom of the container is easy to turn in order to raise the blue gel deodorant.  </li>
            <li>suggest trying Right Guard Sport instead,</li>
            <li>B00FFI5PAW Right Guard Sport</li>
            <li>I usually use degree for all my freshness needs if you will, I liked that degree was body heat activated and for years I thought nothing could top it.....</li>
            <li>It lasts for a very long time and has a nice fresh smell.</li>
            <li>I have used this deodorant for the past 3 weeks and have had nothing but great performance.  </li>
            <li>The con is that you really do feel it on you...even after a full day.  </li>
            <li>The deodorant&#x27;s plastic container has a masculine appearance and is easy to grip with one hand.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant actually works,  Too many say they keep you smelling fresh, and then they don&#x27;t do the job at all, or quit halfway into your summer afternoon.</li>
            <li>I was not willing to go another day, to see how long it really lasted for me, as I was very happy with the overnight results!</li>
            <li>Influenster let me test this product out, and I was extremely pleased and will be buying speed stick GEAR in the future.</li>
            <li>Through a heavy workout this stuff proved effective and then I put it to the true test</li>
            <li>Wish it was an antiperspirant, I would definitely like it more if it was.</li>
            <li>I work in a welding shop and things tend to get pretty hot in there.</li>
            <li>husband is an avid mountain biker, road cyclist and runner and he sweats.</li>
            <li>For just a deodorant, this worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on clear and smooth</li>
            <li>I have been using it consistently since then and have noticed varying results.</li>
            <li>I received this speed stick gear deodorant via influenster as part of a trial and at first I was leery about using it</li>
            <li>So I tried it for the first time, and I have to say....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an antiperspirant and deodorizer and it does the job very well!</li>
            <li>Trust me, you will get many compliments from the female persuasion after you have put this on!!</li>
            <li>This deodorant actually lasts me all day long, through work &amp; well afterwards--with my old deodorant I didn&#x27;t smell very good by the time I&#x27;d get off of work.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this deodorant to any man who wishes to remain fresh smelling all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He takes showers regularly and trims underarm hair and he doesn&#x27;t have a strong body smell in first place.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since there is no anti-perspirant here (no active ingredient that inhibits sweating), you may want to test it first before heading out for a full workday or a workout or an outdoor adventure.</li>
            <li>Further, you can hold the the deodorant comfortably as it provides a generous grip and it looks manly and very modern.</li>
            <li>am not usually brand loyal, I mainly switch based on value.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this line!</li>
            <li>It says 48 hours, and it really does work for 48 hours.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>Initially I got this for free from Influenster.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really exercise).</li>
            <li>This is a capable deodorant.</li>
            <li>Another plus is that it is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>it REALLY DOES</li>
            <li>He really likes this deodorant.</li>
            <li>the whole</li>
            <li>Which I assume is the intention, but to me it smells very manly.</li>
            <li>It controls odor very well and doesn&#x27;t get that funky smell that some deodorants do after sweating.</li>
            <li>The scent holds for the whole</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need that much of it.</li>
            <li>So i had a really important interview and this stuff totally saved me in a pinch.</li>
            <li>I retain a fresh scent for the near 2 and 1/2 day mark in which i practice Volleyball as well as swim.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend giving this a try!</li>
            <li>Thanks Speed Stick Gear and Influenster.</li>
            <li>This deodorant works really well, even when working out or out and about in town.</li>
            <li>big plus unless you enjoy looking like you have armpit dandruff),</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know tjr legal aspects of products like thus</li>
            <li>My only dislike is that it&#x27;s the chalky kind of deodorant instead of the solid gel type.</li>
            <li>It is effective, and for those who are trying to avoid antiperspirants for health reasons (aluminum), this is just a plain deodorant, not an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good alternative to antiperspirant if you are going to be outside or will be active in sports and do not want to use the chemically-ridden antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not too musky smelling like many other men&#x27;s deoderants.</li>
            <li>My other deodorant works so much better than this one.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get given two free samples of this from Influentser and so far, after nearly a month of use</li>
            <li>The Speed Stick Gear felt dry, kept ME dry, went on smoothly and had a subtle and pleasant scent whereas others had too strong of a scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the deodorant for two weeks and haven&#x27;t experienced any adverse reactions such as dry, cracked, itching, red skin.  </li>
            <li>I am glad though, that I don&#x27;t have skin sensitivities to harsh detergents [;-)&lt;br /&gt;T&#x27;care,&lt;br /&gt;M</li>
            <li>Been looking for a long lasting deodorant that doesn&#x27;t necessarily require daily use for the longest time, and so I am definitely happy I stumbled across Fresh Force.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on smoothly and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It was a tad too sweet for me but the fragrance did last without overpowering.</li>
            <li>I believe it has been lasting the full advertised 48-hours</li>
            <li>What it comes down to for most with deodorant is a)</li>
            <li>even if I shower every other day, I still don&#x27;t have an odor problem when I use the Right Guard, and I really like the Fresh Scent.</li>
            <li>product I will highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would say this is a highly scented product, so keep that in mind.</li>
            <li>If you need a Deodorant only, the Speed Stick Gear Deodorant Fresh Force has a mild scent and comes in a 3oz blue and gray color container.</li>
            <li>my pits need way more than just a little deodorant.</li>
            <li>It keeps my armpits dry all through the day without reapplying so that&#x27;s a huge plus for me since Im usually very busy.  </li>
            <li>I was used to using my &#x27;go to&#x27; Old Spice, but this stuff really out lasted it.</li>
            <li>This product works very well compared to my old deodorant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very dry...meaning you won&#x27;t get that slippery underarm action that can happen when you apply your deodorant.</li>
            <li>In general, I found this to hold up better than I expected, but still, it is not a replacement for an antiperspirant + deodorant.</li>
            <li>, I actually felt fresh..</li>
            <li>In the contrary, I smell fresh like I just left the shower.</li>
            <li>However, I find the Fresh Force version of this solid to not be overpowering at all.  </li>
            <li>, yes, at the current price of about $3, I think it&#x27;s worth giving a try.</li>
            <li>3-D Invisible Solid A/P Deodorant Fresh 2.6 oz.</li>
            <li>It has a masculine, fresh scent that is strong, but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Sweating and natural smells vary based on many factors, so there&#x27;s no clean cut answer.</li>
            <li>Speed Stick Gear has the new Drycore technology</li>
            <li>Always willing to try new things I got the speedstick gear and decded to try when my regular brand ran out.</li>
            <li>While I typically prefer an antiperspirant for daily wear, this has been a great addition to my gym bag and for other times when I know I&#x27;ll be sweating a lot.</li>
            <li>and I have to work outside in the hot Florida sun.</li>
            <li>Some other stick deodorants I have tried have irritated me, left me feeling &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and many tend to be clumpy.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product for the summer when the weather is so hot.</li>
            <li>and it goes on easily with little fuss or mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It prevented bad smells for two days (great for those who shower every other day) and the smell wasn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Keeps armpits dry and fresh.</li>
            <li>Last night I luckily stumbled upon Speed Stick&#x27;s GEAR &amp;#34;Fresh Force&amp;#34; and the fragarence is exactly the same and the performance of the product is the same as well!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wash off easily in the shower the next day which is good and bad.</li>
            <li>my the old deodorant I used before.</li>
            <li>at the end of a busy day, you can notice that it&#x27;s still there, and still working.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried it after a workout and it completely eliminates the odors.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that it keeps me drier for much longer and the scent also last longer.  </li>
            <li>I am an adult male.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I used Ajax Triple Action dishwashing liquid but still didn&#x27;t get it all.</li>
            <li>He is also quite susceptible to rashes and bumps from some products, since he has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff does do its intended job as far as odor protection, but it&#x27;s a deodorant, not an anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li>I use this because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The only thing that really makes it manly is the strength of the scent.</li>
            <li>answer your probable question, why is a 56 year old woman using men&#x27;s deodorant?  </li>
            <li>I like that this is a long lasting scent it does not wear off too quickly.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m a 56 year old grandmother, active, but not extremely so, and this wasn&#x27;t even strong enough for me.</li>
            <li>still pretty dry but complaints about</li>
            <li>I was not a big fan of this particular fragrance.</li>
            <li>The scent definitely lasts longer than 24 hours but still leaves the same old white marks on my clothing and really doesn&#x27;t do much more than other standard deodorants in the same class.</li>
            <li>Even the next morning, I did not wake up sweating, like I normally do.</li>
            <li>Based on using a different scent in the GEAR line, the performance is average, nothing special.</li>
            <li>After putting it on, it definitely didn&#x27;t live up to the expectations put forth by the product makers.</li>
            <li>I recently tried the same scent in their spray-on deodorant, and just the application of it was very overpowering to me.  </li>
            <li>Finally I put the Ajax on full strength with just wet hands and left it sit there while I shaved.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant with crisp tones over a sweeter musky base.</li>
            <li>and I am pretty active.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He has used this on light work days and on days when he&#x27;s out working hard.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used plenty of deodorants for women in a Fresh Scent that smelled exactly the same except they come labeled with Lady Speed Stick and are possibly a little lighter, but not much, fragrance.</li>
            <li>and it really does provide some long lasting protection.  </li>
            <li>Clear and Simple.</li>
            <li>The scent is too strong for me in any case, as I prefer my deodorant scents to be subtle.</li>
            <li>However, just casual day relaxing, this helps me keep cool and fresh.  </li>
            <li>It was almost like I had to let it dry for fifteen minutes before it actually was comfortable to put my arms down.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few weeks and like this better than my previous deodorant.</li>
            <li>so it keeps you fresher, drier much longer than other brands.</li>
            <li>I like the feeling of smelling fresh with a little extra something.  </li>
            <li>have found a new product that I will be repurchasing for as long as it works for me!</li>
            <li>I started back when I was a single parent on a tight budget, I was working outdoors, doing the same work as men, and wanted a strong deodorant.</li>
            <li>I showered again before the 24  hour mark but was fresh and dry all day on an active day so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to other men</li>
    </ol>

            <li> b) is the smell nice.  </li>
            <li> ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN AND NOT INFLUENCED IN ANY WAY.</li>
            <li> and I liked the outdoorsy types of scents that it came in, as opposed to the women&#x27;s that smelled like flowers or fruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells like a very strong, trendy men&#x27;s cologne or soap, and as a woman I just don&#x27;t want that scent on me.</li>
            <li> I took them on vacation with me, going from Upstate New York to Humid Florida, a perfect time to investigate this claim.</li>
            <li> This is BY FAR the best deodorant that I have EVER used..</li>
            <li> The Speed Stick Gear Deodorant is by far the best anti-perspirant I have ever tried, hence the 5-star rating.</li>
            <li> Happily it kept me fresh smelling.</li>
            <li> It smells great, kept me dry and smelling good for 48 hours, even after going to the gym!</li>
            <li> First, it smells great.  </li>
            <li> really love it</li>
            <li> but I think they could work on the strength of the odor more.</li>
            <li> It also holds up really well when I go to the gym and has a great scent that isn&#x27;t too overbearing.</li>
            <li> I love the way it rolls on, I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d looking for a good deodorant, this is worth trying.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the scent, but it is not the most appealing to me.  </li>
            <li> The smell was ok but because it is not antiperspirant the body odor will go through.</li>
            <li> I love it and will continue wearing it .....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t consider the aroma to be overwhelming, as some reviewers felt.  </li>
            <li> I understand many people prefer a deodorant over an antiperspirant/deodorant  and that may work well if they don&#x27;t sweat alot.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy the smell and am going to use this from now on!~</li>
            <li> it is a great scent to use for the under arms after taking a shower and it is highly recommended!</li>
            <li> There are many reasons why I gave this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I got this to product by Influencer, and I just absolutly love it.</li>
            <li> I travel 3 to 4 days a week for my job and didn&#x27;t feel confident it would have lasted 48 hours</li>
            <li> The smell was more like grass to me than anything else.</li>
            <li> Two aspects that I love are that.. 1.</li>
            <li> Id advise something with better deodorizing features.</li>
            <li> It was a bit overwhelming, but I got used to it as the day went on.</li>
            <li> Speed Stick Gear Deodorant in the Fresh Force scent is a good deodorant that protects you from odor but not from wetness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more for men but</li>
            <li> I tend to stay away from strongly-scented deodorants, so Speed Stick isn&#x27;t my top choice.  </li>
            <li> Inside, the deodorant is a cyan-blue semi-seethrough solid-gel type of a thing (for lack of a better description).</li>
            <li> There are two gray grippy areas at the two sides for a better hold on the container.</li>
            <li> The Fresh Force smell is good, but not as good as the Fresh Force version of the smell found in the body spray</li>
            <li> Regardless, I got my deoderant back and couldn&#x27;t be more happy!</li>
            <li> I am happy that I found a new fave!</li>
            <li> I recently tried the new Speed Stick Gear and was immediately happy and VERY impressed with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that Speed Stick has consistently provided me with optimum odor coverage.</li>
            <li> First ..smell, good without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> I loved this deodorant, coming from an avid spray can user.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Looks good smells good and only lasts all</li>
            <li> He has always liked Speed Stick as a brand, but this Gear Fresh Force is his favorite because the scent is restrained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t do the most important thing that it&#x27;s supposed to: de-odor me.</li>
            <li> Speed Stick&#x27;s Gear has a light, refreshing scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different deodorant for men and this is one of the best and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Speed Stick Gear smells great, lasted long, and most importantly didn&#x27;t ball up in my hair!</li>
            <li> What really impressed me were the lasting fresh scent and the antiperspirant capabilities.</li>
            <li> ; deodorant applies and dries quickly, and has a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> Easy to grip tube and easy to raise the deodorant to your desired level.  </li>
            <li> I am very loyal to my brand and until now I would never switch.</li>
            <li> If I had one gripe it would be how strong smelling it was.  </li>
            <li> The scent is strong when applying but lessens over time.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and gives 48 hour lasting protection to keep you dry when you need it most!!!</li>
            <li> But it is an effective deodorant that will keep you smelling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It washed/rinsed off fine then.</li>
            <li> The scent itself isn&#x27;t the most extraordinary</li>
            <li> Has a great smell and last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Received this product for free from Influenster so that I could test it out.</li>
            <li> was overall happy with</li>
            <li> the product.&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for free to product test through influenster.</li>
            <li> I used to use the cheap arm and hammer stuff.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy that the scent is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> The bluish product glides on smoothly and does not stain or mark clothes.</li>
            <li> I received this product free from Influenster about a month ago.</li>
            <li> Not only is the variety of scents great</li>
            <li> I got to try it free from Influenster.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the Fresh Force scent.</li>
            <li> I love this Speed Stick deodorant and the Fresh Force scent.</li>
            <li> It keeps me foul-odor free but lets my sweat glands do their thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a fairly light day of yard work</li>
            <li> My son has been using this and so far it has done a good job keeping the odor at bay.</li>
            <li> After working out, most antiperspirant-type sticks are not the right thing.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is very powerful and has a robust but not overpowering scent that lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I did not experience any irritation even though it is very powerful.</li>
            <li> Overall very nice does its job well.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, works well for him, and have a light, clean scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm.  </li>
            <li> Best product that I highly recommend to anyone looking for something that actually works.</li>
            <li> Amazing product I highly recommend,&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> This is really rare!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deodorant for someone on the go because it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Have also used the Clean Peak.</li>
            <li> Both are clean scents, and they don&#x27;t overpower.</li>
            <li> As I said the scents are clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall for those wearing suits this is a great product as it will keep you dry at all times and your cologne will be your fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It just smells emphatically clean in the morning.</li>
            <li> does a great job of keeping you dry.</li>
            <li> And everyone was right!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bartender and the Speed Stick Gear is a great product that keeps me smelling fresh for long nights at the bar.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but it really worked well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually, deodorants are better for you since you really don&#x27;t need to clog up your sweat glands by not sweating at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are looking for odor control only, this is a good choice.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is a really good product.</li>
            <li> The scent is fair, sort of cheap soap with a hint of pine tree air freshener (yes, the kind you hang in your car) but seriously, skip this one</li>
            <li> It is remarkable as to how dry this keeps me.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> It works verry well with all day protection, THe smell of it is great too unlike some other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I received two complementary Speed Stick Gear antiperspirant/deodorant sticks in Clean Peak and Fresh Force from Influenster.com</li>
            <li> By the end of the 48 hour period I&#x27;m happy to say that I it was still actively working.  </li>
            <li> I got the Fresh Force scent and the Clean Peak scent.</li>
            <li> use it everyday in the morning one time a day, and I smell good all day even when I get sweaty from the gym, and even when I go for a run I don&#x27;t stink like BO any more</li>
            <li> Seriously, I never feel the need to have to use it more than once a day.</li>
            <li> A little too strong for our family, while the scent was manly and attractive (kind of like the soap irish spring)</li>
            <li> This deodorant provides a fresh clean smell that starts out a bit too strong but then becomes normal clean scent as it blends with your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the most comfortable choice, but I gave it five stars because I believe this is a heavy duty deodorant which does what it says it does, and if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, there aren&#x27;t a whole lot of good choices out there.</li>
            <li> One of my new favorite deodorants.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I will never buy another brand of deodorant…as long as Speed Stick Gear is available.</li>
            <li> Super Dry Speed Stick (Sport Talc) has a refreshing clean scent and glides on easily.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a mess on my shirts, which is great.</li>
            <li> Glad this can keep up with me and my busy routine!</li>
            <li> This has a strong, fresh scent that, personally, I really like.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample from influenster, and have been using it about 2 weeks now, and it&#x27;s held up through intense workouts, and stressful days at work, and it has definitely held its own.</li>
            <li> It is fresh- yet not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It keeps me fresh throughout the day</li>
            <li> I got this complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li> It smells like fresh laundry</li>
            <li> I revived my Speed Stick Gear complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li> I was genuinely surprised to learn that I love this Speed Stick Gear Deodorant, Fresh Force.  </li>
            <li> and I can smell the Fresh Force scent.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend, Tammy, also likes the scent of Fresh Force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fresh scent that prevents underarm odor for hours and hours.  </li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary of Influenster.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary of Influenster.</li>
            <li> I actually find the scent to be nicely unisex.</li>
            <li> I was rather horrified to find that I had noticeable underarm odor after using the Speed Stick Fresh Force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Speed Stick Gear Body Spray, Fresh Force,</li>
            <li> I received this to try in a vox box from influenster and at first thought it was great because it really does keep you dry for 48 hours.</li>
            <li> The lid is easily removed and the dial at the bottom of the container is easy to turn in order to raise the blue gel deodorant.  </li>
            <li> suggest trying Right Guard Sport instead,</li>
            <li> B00FFI5PAW Right Guard Sport</li>
            <li> I usually use degree for all my freshness needs if you will, I liked that degree was body heat activated and for years I thought nothing could top it.....</li>
            <li> It lasts for a very long time and has a nice fresh smell.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for the past 3 weeks and have had nothing but great performance.  </li>
            <li> The con is that you really do feel it on you...even after a full day.  </li>
            <li> The deodorant&#x27;s plastic container has a masculine appearance and is easy to grip with one hand.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant actually works,  Too many say they keep you smelling fresh, and then they don&#x27;t do the job at all, or quit halfway into your summer afternoon.</li>
            <li> I was not willing to go another day, to see how long it really lasted for me, as I was very happy with the overnight results!</li>
            <li> Influenster let me test this product out, and I was extremely pleased and will be buying speed stick GEAR in the future.</li>
            <li> Through a heavy workout this stuff proved effective and then I put it to the true test</li>
            <li> Wish it was an antiperspirant, I would definitely like it more if it was.</li>
            <li> I work in a welding shop and things tend to get pretty hot in there.</li>
            <li> husband is an avid mountain biker, road cyclist and runner and he sweats.</li>
            <li> For just a deodorant, this worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on clear and smooth</li>
            <li> I have been using it consistently since then and have noticed varying results.</li>
            <li> I received this speed stick gear deodorant via influenster as part of a trial and at first I was leery about using it</li>
            <li> So I tried it for the first time, and I have to say....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an antiperspirant and deodorizer and it does the job very well!</li>
            <li> Trust me, you will get many compliments from the female persuasion after you have put this on!!</li>
            <li> This deodorant actually lasts me all day long, through work &amp; well afterwards--with my old deodorant I didn&#x27;t smell very good by the time I&#x27;d get off of work.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this deodorant to any man who wishes to remain fresh smelling all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He takes showers regularly and trims underarm hair and he doesn&#x27;t have a strong body smell in first place.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since there is no anti-perspirant here (no active ingredient that inhibits sweating), you may want to test it first before heading out for a full workday or a workout or an outdoor adventure.</li>
            <li> Further, you can hold the the deodorant comfortably as it provides a generous grip and it looks manly and very modern.</li>
            <li> am not usually brand loyal, I mainly switch based on value.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this line!</li>
            <li> It says 48 hours, and it really does work for 48 hours.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> Initially I got this for free from Influenster.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really exercise).</li>
            <li> This is a capable deodorant.</li>
            <li> Another plus is that it is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> it REALLY DOES</li>
            <li> He really likes this deodorant.</li>
            <li> the whole</li>
            <li> Which I assume is the intention, but to me it smells very manly.</li>
            <li> It controls odor very well and doesn&#x27;t get that funky smell that some deodorants do after sweating.</li>
            <li> The scent holds for the whole</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need that much of it.</li>
            <li> So i had a really important interview and this stuff totally saved me in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I retain a fresh scent for the near 2 and 1/2 day mark in which i practice Volleyball as well as swim.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend giving this a try!</li>
            <li> Thanks Speed Stick Gear and Influenster.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works really well, even when working out or out and about in town.</li>
            <li> big plus unless you enjoy looking like you have armpit dandruff),</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know tjr legal aspects of products like thus</li>
            <li> My only dislike is that it&#x27;s the chalky kind of deodorant instead of the solid gel type.</li>
            <li> It is effective, and for those who are trying to avoid antiperspirants for health reasons (aluminum), this is just a plain deodorant, not an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a good alternative to antiperspirant if you are going to be outside or will be active in sports and do not want to use the chemically-ridden antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too musky smelling like many other men&#x27;s deoderants.</li>
            <li> My other deodorant works so much better than this one.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get given two free samples of this from Influentser and so far, after nearly a month of use</li>
            <li> The Speed Stick Gear felt dry, kept ME dry, went on smoothly and had a subtle and pleasant scent whereas others had too strong of a scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the deodorant for two weeks and haven&#x27;t experienced any adverse reactions such as dry, cracked, itching, red skin.  </li>
            <li> I am glad though, that I don&#x27;t have skin sensitivities to harsh detergents [;-)&lt;br /&gt;T&#x27;care,&lt;br /&gt;M</li>
            <li> Been looking for a long lasting deodorant that doesn&#x27;t necessarily require daily use for the longest time, and so I am definitely happy I stumbled across Fresh Force.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on smoothly and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It was a tad too sweet for me but the fragrance did last without overpowering.</li>
            <li> I believe it has been lasting the full advertised 48-hours</li>
            <li> What it comes down to for most with deodorant is a)</li>
            <li> even if I shower every other day, I still don&#x27;t have an odor problem when I use the Right Guard, and I really like the Fresh Scent.</li>
            <li> product I will highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would say this is a highly scented product, so keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> If you need a Deodorant only, the Speed Stick Gear Deodorant Fresh Force has a mild scent and comes in a 3oz blue and gray color container.</li>
            <li> my pits need way more than just a little deodorant.</li>
            <li> It keeps my armpits dry all through the day without reapplying so that&#x27;s a huge plus for me since Im usually very busy.  </li>
            <li> I was used to using my &#x27;go to&#x27; Old Spice, but this stuff really out lasted it.</li>
            <li> This product works very well compared to my old deodorant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dry...meaning you won&#x27;t get that slippery underarm action that can happen when you apply your deodorant.</li>
            <li> In general, I found this to hold up better than I expected, but still, it is not a replacement for an antiperspirant + deodorant.</li>
            <li> , I actually felt fresh..</li>
            <li> In the contrary, I smell fresh like I just left the shower.</li>
            <li> However, I find the Fresh Force version of this solid to not be overpowering at all.  </li>
            <li> , yes, at the current price of about $3, I think it&#x27;s worth giving a try.</li>
            <li> 3-D Invisible Solid A/P Deodorant Fresh 2.6 oz.</li>
            <li> It has a masculine, fresh scent that is strong, but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Sweating and natural smells vary based on many factors, so there&#x27;s no clean cut answer.</li>
            <li> Speed Stick Gear has the new Drycore technology</li>
            <li> Always willing to try new things I got the speedstick gear and decded to try when my regular brand ran out.</li>
            <li> While I typically prefer an antiperspirant for daily wear, this has been a great addition to my gym bag and for other times when I know I&#x27;ll be sweating a lot.</li>
            <li> and I have to work outside in the hot Florida sun.</li>
            <li> Some other stick deodorants I have tried have irritated me, left me feeling &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and many tend to be clumpy.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for the summer when the weather is so hot.</li>
            <li> and it goes on easily with little fuss or mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It prevented bad smells for two days (great for those who shower every other day) and the smell wasn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Keeps armpits dry and fresh.</li>
            <li> Last night I luckily stumbled upon Speed Stick&#x27;s GEAR &amp;#34;Fresh Force&amp;#34; and the fragarence is exactly the same and the performance of the product is the same as well!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wash off easily in the shower the next day which is good and bad.</li>
            <li> my the old deodorant I used before.</li>
            <li> at the end of a busy day, you can notice that it&#x27;s still there, and still working.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried it after a workout and it completely eliminates the odors.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that it keeps me drier for much longer and the scent also last longer.  </li>
            <li> I am an adult male.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I used Ajax Triple Action dishwashing liquid but still didn&#x27;t get it all.</li>
            <li> He is also quite susceptible to rashes and bumps from some products, since he has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff does do its intended job as far as odor protection, but it&#x27;s a deodorant, not an anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> I use this because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The only thing that really makes it manly is the strength of the scent.</li>
            <li> answer your probable question, why is a 56 year old woman using men&#x27;s deodorant?  </li>
            <li> I like that this is a long lasting scent it does not wear off too quickly.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a 56 year old grandmother, active, but not extremely so, and this wasn&#x27;t even strong enough for me.</li>
            <li> still pretty dry but complaints about</li>
            <li> I was not a big fan of this particular fragrance.</li>
            <li> The scent definitely lasts longer than 24 hours but still leaves the same old white marks on my clothing and really doesn&#x27;t do much more than other standard deodorants in the same class.</li>
            <li> Even the next morning, I did not wake up sweating, like I normally do.</li>
            <li> Based on using a different scent in the GEAR line, the performance is average, nothing special.</li>
            <li> After putting it on, it definitely didn&#x27;t live up to the expectations put forth by the product makers.</li>
            <li> I recently tried the same scent in their spray-on deodorant, and just the application of it was very overpowering to me.  </li>
            <li> Finally I put the Ajax on full strength with just wet hands and left it sit there while I shaved.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is pleasant with crisp tones over a sweeter musky base.</li>
            <li> and I am pretty active.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He has used this on light work days and on days when he&#x27;s out working hard.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used plenty of deodorants for women in a Fresh Scent that smelled exactly the same except they come labeled with Lady Speed Stick and are possibly a little lighter, but not much, fragrance.</li>
            <li> and it really does provide some long lasting protection.  </li>
            <li> Clear and Simple.</li>
            <li> The scent is too strong for me in any case, as I prefer my deodorant scents to be subtle.</li>
            <li> However, just casual day relaxing, this helps me keep cool and fresh.  </li>
            <li> It was almost like I had to let it dry for fifteen minutes before it actually was comfortable to put my arms down.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and like this better than my previous deodorant.</li>
            <li> so it keeps you fresher, drier much longer than other brands.</li>
            <li> I like the feeling of smelling fresh with a little extra something.  </li>
            <li> have found a new product that I will be repurchasing for as long as it works for me!</li>
            <li> I started back when I was a single parent on a tight budget, I was working outdoors, doing the same work as men, and wanted a strong deodorant.</li>
            <li> I showered again before the 24  hour mark but was fresh and dry all day on an active day so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to other men</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me about a week to figure out this wasn&#x27;t doing anything positive for me, I kept getting slick slimy pits.</li>
            <li> Not heavy or cakey like other brands</li>
            <li> Once applied, the scent lasts me all day, but it&#x27;s much more subtle and difficult to smell through a shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solid stick is translucent green and glides on smoothly, but the deodorant will turn whitish once applied.  </li>
            <li> I like the scent and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> It is a long lasting deodorant that doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes.  </li>
            <li> It does last all day long, and you wont need to reapply, 2.</li>
            <li> For a few years ive been using women deodorants since they were the only deodorants i could use due to their gentle ingreadients.</li>
            <li> It s very long lasting</li>
            <li> but I noticed that didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, when I wake up in the mornings, I&#x27;m still smelling pleasant rather than rank.  </li>
            <li> They last roughly 48 hours, two work shifts and a gym session.</li>
            <li> The stuff smells good when you put it on (not in an annoying Axe-like way)</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and kept me dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this problem with other Speed Stick products, just this one; I usually don&#x27;t even have to apply that much</li>
            <li> They go on slimy and take a long time to dry, and often mark your clothing.</li>
            <li> Best thing is it&#x27;s not an expensive item, and it gives me confidence that I wont smell badly.</li>
            <li> Even when the rest of me starts to sweat, my underarms still feel dry.</li>
            <li> It is not an antiperspirant and will do nothing to keep you dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like trying to remove an almost dry spray adhesive.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry through out the day.</li>
            <li> I was dry all day.</li>
            <li> I can do sports and be active and this Speed Stick keeps your back.</li>
            <li> So, for me, it&#x27;s just not worth the extra work.</li>
            <li> Less need to reapply, and lasting dryness in all my travels.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You can feel when you apply it how it&#x27;s definitely a lot thicker and heavier than a typical deodorant of this type.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first tried this product, what deodorant actually works for 48 hours?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been partial to Speed Stick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested it the last few weeks</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no dryness protection whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This leaves less white mess when you put your shirt on after and keeps you dry through the day.</li>
            <li> I was completely dry where typically i&#x27;d have been sweating, and this was a confidence booster (just waiting on my acceptance letter now).</li>
            <li> I found one MAJOR negative.</li>
            <li> and I saw that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I received this product courtesy of Influenster to test and review and am extremely thankful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to reapply it like I do other deodorants.</li>
            <li> It has never burned me like other blue gel deodorants have in the past.  </li>
            <li> However, this product made me feel extremely sticky after application.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t like other deodorants.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed it flaking off during the day like some other solids do (</li>
            <li> No amount of deodorant will stop sweat while active in East Coast Summers.  </li>
            <li> But again I&#x27;m active, I&#x27;m in the heat.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I still stink at the end of the day, no matter how much I apply.</li>
            <li> I suppose that such a deodorant lasts at least a month, so efficient it</li>
            <li> It lasted for multiple days of outside labor in cooler weather, cutting wood and racking leaves left from fall.  </li>
            <li> and I hate overwhelming scents.</li>
            <li> This type of plain deodorant is getting harder to find.</li>
            <li> I LOVED the scent and how well it lasted, but after a few days of using it, I broke out in a horrible, itchy rash</li>
            <li> I have a very active lifestyle that includes running</li>
            <li> Packaged in a slightly tapered navy and silver container, it has an easy to turn dial at the base.</li>
            <li> I would also recommend this deodorant to people with a tight budget as you have to apply just once a day</li>
            <li> definitely does it&#x27;s job (which is usually hard for me when it comes to deodorants)!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to change deodorants because I&#x27;ve been using the same one for so long.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t give the product five stars because it feels a little paste-like.</li>
            <li> However, if you are a heavy sweating person, you will probably prefer the antiperspirant/deodorant version by speed</li>
            <li> It will not provide deodorant stains as it is a gel and dried</li>
            <li> Also, when it goes on it does not feel heavy or like you have a paste on.  </li>
            <li> I also have sensitive underarms, which made me wary of trying a combo antiperspirant/deodorant.</li>
            <li> I received 2 sticks of Speed Stick Gear from influenster.com and was very skeptical of using them at first.</li>
            <li> I got stinky within a few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past few days</li>
            <li> Usually they are too harsh and I have to move onto something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both for the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t usually use roll-on, or stick stuff</li>
            <li> In doing so I usually trade off odor protection for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was not impressed by the initial smell of the product.</li>
            <li> all my expensive UA workout clothes was a white layer of crud from the product.  </li>
            <li> not sure what it is.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a deodorant that lasts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One negative about this deodorant is the aluminum zirconium.</li>
            <li> I found the men&#x27;s to be less expensive</li>
            <li> something seriously funky with this stuff</li>
            <li> and he works out a lot, not a good protection.</li>
            <li> I am overall disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong for just a couple of bucks.</li>
            <li> If you need deodorant, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Speed Stick.</li>
            <li> i dont even get that weird armpit deodorant smell that some deodorant causes</li>
            <li> so unfortunately I can no longer use this.</li>
            <li> This scent is just bad, no way around it.</li>
            <li> It helps eliminate bad odor and makes us feel fresher.</li>
            <li> as a woman, I didn&#x27;t find it to be bad at all.</li>
            <li> I became very disappointed when on</li>
            <li> but it stops that awful smell.  </li>
            <li> (And the price ain&#x27;t bad!!)</li>
            <li> smells terrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Just as the name promises, this is a fresh-smelling deodorant. It is effective, and for those who are trying to avoid antiperspirants for health reasons (aluminum), this is just a plain deodorant, not an antiperspirant. This type of plain deodorant is getting harder to find.</li>
            <li> I like the scent and is long lasting. I&#x27;m a fan because it doesn&#x27;t have an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Really love this deodorant! It is fresh- yet not overpowering. It keeps me fresh throughout the day and I have to work outside in the hot Florida sun. It also keeps me drier then my the old deodorant I used before. I can not say if this holds 48 hours as I tend to take a shower in between LOL! Now but now kidding- this is a go- really love it and the scent is nice! I am happy that I found a new fave! I got this complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li> I recently tried the new Speed Stick Gear and was immediately happy and VERY impressed with it.  Some other stick deodorants I have tried have irritated me, left me feeling &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and many tend to be clumpy.  The Speed Stick Gear felt dry, kept ME dry, went on smoothly and had a subtle and pleasant scent whereas others had too strong of a scent.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but it really worked well.  I have been trying to find the perfect deodorant for me and I FOUND IT!  I highly recommend this line!</li>
            <li> This is BY FAR the best deodorant that I have EVER used.. I was used to using my &#x27;go to&#x27; Old Spice, but this stuff really out lasted it. It says 48 hours, and it really does work for 48 hours. You need to try it out!</li>
            <li> I got one of these in my Influenster box.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually use roll-on, or stick stuff but I used this just because I had it - it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even at the end of a busy day, you can notice that it&#x27;s still there, and still working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong for just a couple of bucks.</li>
            <li> Super Dry Speed Stick (Sport Talc) has a refreshing clean scent and glides on easily. I&#x27;ve always been partial to Speed Stick. I&#x27;ve found that Speed Stick has consistently provided me with optimum odor coverage. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to other men</li>
            <li> The review site Influenster let me test this product out, and I was extremely pleased and will be buying speed stick GEAR in the future. What really impressed me were the lasting fresh scent and the antiperspirant capabilities. Through a heavy workout this stuff proved effective and then I put it to the true test: I used it for a medical school interview. I was completely dry where typically i&#x27;d have been sweating, and this was a confidence booster (just waiting on my acceptance letter now).</li>
            <li> This scent is just bad, no way around it. Based on using a different scent in the GEAR line, the performance is average, nothing special. I personally don&#x27;t like white powdery deodorants and the marks it leaves on clothing.</li>
            <li> Always willing to try new things I got the speedstick gear and decded to try when my regular brand ran out. First ..smell, good without being overpowering. Not heavy or cakey like other brands , I actually felt fresh..I showered again before the 24  hour mark but was fresh and dry all day on an active day so 2 thumbs up for me. #SpeedStickGear</li>
            <li> Speed Stick Gear is a good product with great protection, although not quite 48 hours. Smells great. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Has a great smell and last throughout the day. Definitely recommended and will continue to use as my regular deodorant.</li>
            <li> I received this speed stick from #influenster Great deodorant for during and after you workout. I have tried it after a workout and it completely eliminates the odors. I recommend this to any hardcore gym goers. #speedstickgear</li>
            <li> Received this product for free from Influenster so that I could test it out. Has a good smell to it, but It doesn&#x27;t help prevent me from sweating. Wish it was an antiperspirant, I would definitely like it more if it was.</li>
            <li> I loved this deodorant, coming from an avid spray can user.  It wasn&#x27;t sticky and it didn&#x27;t leave residue.  I&#x27;ve tested it the last few weeks and it really does provide some long lasting protection.  If I had one gripe it would be how strong smelling it was.  I had a small headache after applying it for the first time.  I got used to it but I think they could work on the strength of the odor more.</li>
            <li> I had just received this product from Influenster. I has one of best smelling deoderants I have tried. It smells like fresh laundry and it&#x27;s not too musky smelling like many other men&#x27;s deoderants. It lasts a long time and kept me dry.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a long lasting deodorant that doesn&#x27;t necessarily require daily use for the longest time, and so I am definitely happy I stumbled across Fresh Force. The scent itself isn&#x27;t the most extraordinary but it isn&#x27;t overpowering and definitely does it&#x27;s job (which is usually hard for me when it comes to deodorants)!</li>
            <li> I work in a welding shop and things tend to get pretty hot in there. It&#x27;s hard to find a deodorant that lasts. I received this product courtesy of Influenster to test and review and am extremely thankful. Speed stick gear goes on smooth, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Even when the rest of me starts to sweat, my underarms still feel dry. I don&#x27;t have to reapply it like I do other deodorants. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I revived my Speed Stick Gear complimentary from Influenster. Very Awesome Product!! Did exactly what it said and still i was impressed with it.</li>
            <li> Pretty good deodorant.  No stains.  It holds up through my workouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bartender and the Speed Stick Gear is a great product that keeps me smelling fresh for long nights at the bar. Must try this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past few days and I must say this is one of the best deodorants I have ever used.  It keeps my armpits dry all through the day without reapplying so that&#x27;s a huge plus for me since Im usually very busy.  It also holds up really well when I go to the gym and has a great scent that isn&#x27;t too overbearing.</li>
            <li> Looks good smells good and only lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;If you need to go 48 hours without showering you will need to apply it each day in my case.&lt;br /&gt;Every human body is different.&lt;br /&gt;The smell was neutral enough to work with cologne or by itself.&lt;br /&gt;I was overall happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for free to product test through influenster.</li>
            <li> This product works very well compared to my old deodorant.  I have noticed that it keeps me drier for much longer and the scent also last longer.  Still trying to figure out what scent is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WAS NOT COMPENSATED FOR THIS POST, HOWEVER I DID RECEIVE A SAMPLE FOR MY REVIEW.  ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN AND NOT INFLUENCED IN ANY WAY.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and gives 48 hour lasting protection to keep you dry when you need it most!!! Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> This deodorant actually lasts me all day long, through work &amp; well afterwards--with my old deodorant I didn&#x27;t smell very good by the time I&#x27;d get off of work.  Will be using this from now on!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I used to use the cheap arm and hammer stuff. I&#x27;ve been using this ever since I&#x27;ve got it in a vox box from influencer</li>
            <li> Initially I got this for free from Influenster. I have to say that I have been converted. It is remarkable as to how dry this keeps me. I don&#x27;t have to reapply. It will hold up for a good 48 hours and I am pretty active. Both at work and outside of work. Definitely would recommend this. I also enjoy that the scent is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I love the way it rolls on, I love the way it smells. It doesn&#x27;t leave a mess on my shirts, which is great. It would be my go-to deodorant - except - it doesn&#x27;t do the most important thing that it&#x27;s supposed to: de-odor me. Unfortunately, I still stink at the end of the day, no matter how much I apply. I&#x27;ve never had this problem with other Speed Stick products, just this one; I usually don&#x27;t even have to apply that much (I&#x27;m not a stinky fellow and I don&#x27;t really exercise). Soo close, but no cigar.</li>
            <li> This is a capable deodorant. Packaged in a slightly tapered navy and silver container, it has an easy to turn dial at the base. The bluish product glides on smoothly and does not stain or mark clothes. The fragrance is pleasant with crisp tones over a sweeter musky base. It was a tad too sweet for me but the fragrance did last without overpowering. It is not an antiperspirant and will do nothing to keep you dry. But it is an effective deodorant that will keep you smelling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> This has a strong, fresh scent that, personally, I really like. My son has been using this and so far it has done a good job keeping the odor at bay. It is only a deodorant so it will not stop perspiration, just cover or stop the odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, deodorants are better for you since you really don&#x27;t need to clog up your sweat glands by not sweating at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly and lasts a long time. Love the scent and price!</li>
            <li> The scent overpowered everything for over 24 hours. A little too strong for our family, while the scent was manly and attractive (kind of like the soap irish spring) it was too pungent. Fyi the product is strictly a deodorant - no anti-antiperspirant - which was realized at the send of a work day, lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - we are now using it as a air freshener in the bathroom and it is terrific.</li>
            <li> I was genuinely surprised to learn that I love this Speed Stick Gear Deodorant, Fresh Force.  It has a masculine, fresh scent that is strong, but not overwhelming.  Sometimes, when I&#x27;m at work, I&#x27;ll lift up one or both arms and I can smell the Fresh Force scent.  It lasts all day.  In the evening, I don&#x27;t have to reapply it if I&#x27;m going out.  Furthermore, when I wake up in the mornings, I&#x27;m still smelling pleasant rather than rank.  My girlfriend, Tammy, also likes the scent of Fresh Force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The deodorant&#x27;s plastic container has a masculine appearance and is easy to grip with one hand.  The lid is easily removed and the dial at the bottom of the container is easy to turn in order to raise the blue gel deodorant.  I&#x27;ve been using the deodorant for two weeks and haven&#x27;t experienced any adverse reactions such as dry, cracked, itching, red skin.  It has never burned me like other blue gel deodorants have in the past.  I highly recommend this deodorant to any man who wishes to remain fresh smelling all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B. Hoyos</li>
            <li> Speed Stick&#x27;s Gear has a light, refreshing scent and it goes on easily with little fuss or mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;d looking for a good deodorant, this is worth trying.</li>
            <li> In 90+ degree weather while doing yard work, I am still sweating.  No amount of deodorant will stop sweat while active in East Coast Summers.  However, just casual day relaxing, this helps me keep cool and fresh.  It does its job and is not overpowering. I don&#x27;t mind the scent, but it is not the most appealing to me.  If you need deodorant, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Speed Stick.</li>
            <li> I am an adult male.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I don&#x27;t see all the positiveness I am reading here. I found one MAJOR negative. The stuff seems impervious to water; even soap and water. It&#x27;s like trying to remove an almost dry spray adhesive. It sticks to the skin and hair like glue. I Gave up on the bath bar soap; wouldn&#x27;t even suds up. I used Ajax Triple Action dishwashing liquid but still didn&#x27;t get it all. Finally I put the Ajax on full strength with just wet hands and left it sit there while I shaved. It washed/rinsed off fine then. So, for me, it&#x27;s just not worth the extra work. I am glad though, that I don&#x27;t have skin sensitivities to harsh detergents [;-)&lt;br /&gt;T&#x27;care,&lt;br /&gt;M</li>
            <li> The smell was ok but because it is not antiperspirant the body odor will go through. My husband did&#x27;t like that and he works out a lot, not a good protection. He takes showers regularly and trims underarm hair and he doesn&#x27;t have a strong body smell in first place. Just it didn&#x27;t hold freshness during the day.</li>
            <li> Amazing product I highly recommend,&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this product for about a week now and it smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday in the morning one time a day, and I smell good all day even when I get sweaty from the gym, and even when I go for a run I don&#x27;t stink like BO any more woo hoo&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product I will highly recommend</li>
            <li> This deodorant is very powerful and has a robust but not overpowering scent that lasts throughout the day. I can do sports and be active and this Speed Stick keeps your back. I just apply it once a day and I don&#x27;t have to worry about bodily odors. In the contrary, I smell fresh like I just left the shower. Another plus is that it is gentle on the skin. I did not experience any irritation even though it is very powerful. Further, you can hold the the deodorant comfortably as it provides a generous grip and it looks manly and very modern. I would also recommend this deodorant to people with a tight budget as you have to apply just once a day and I saw that a little goes a long way. I suppose that such a deodorant lasts at least a month, so efficient it is.&lt;br /&gt;One negative about this deodorant is the aluminum zirconium. I would like to see that replaced.</li>
            <li> I love it and will continue wearing it .....to my surprise it REALLY DOES WHAT IT SAYS..i dont even get that weird armpit deodorant smell that some deodorant causes</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get given two free samples of this from Influentser and so far, after nearly a month of use I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent isn&#x27;t over powering and there&#x27;s no white power residue on the clothes afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it works a treat as a antiperspirant .</li>
            <li> Speed Stick is a well known, household name for one reason. Their products work. Clear and Simple. This Speed Stick Gear Deodorant does what deodorant is supposed to do.  It stops you from being stinky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband is an avid mountain biker, road cyclist and runner and he sweats. He sweats a lot. He really likes this deodorant. It doesn&#x27;t stop the sweat (it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant) but it stops that awful smell.  He smells clean and fresh. He is also quite susceptible to rashes and bumps from some products, since he has sensitive skin. He has had no problems with this product whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speed Stick is a great product at a very good price!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for odor control only, this is a good choice.  I didn&#x27;t consider the aroma to be overwhelming, as some reviewers felt.  I understand many people prefer a deodorant over an antiperspirant/deodorant  and that may work well if they don&#x27;t sweat alot.  However, if you are a heavy sweating person, you will probably prefer the antiperspirant/deodorant version by speed stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, we have found all speed stick products to work fairly well.</li>
            <li> When I selected this product I didn&#x27;t see any indication of whether it was for men or women, so I figured it was unisex. Which I assume is the intention, but to me it smells very manly. It smells like a very strong, trendy men&#x27;s cologne or soap, and as a woman I just don&#x27;t want that scent on me. The scent is too strong for me in any case, as I prefer my deodorant scents to be subtle. This stuff does do its intended job as far as odor protection, but it&#x27;s a deodorant, not an anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> For just a deodorant, this worked pretty well. If you don&#x27;t mind the wetness and/or prefer not to &amp;#34;clog&amp;#34; your pores by using an anti-perspirant, etc, this is a good choice. It controls odor very well and doesn&#x27;t get that funky smell that some deodorants do after sweating. No irritations and no stickiness</li>
            <li> The Speed Stick Gear &amp;#34;Fresh Force&amp;#34; scented deodorant is the perfect gym bag companion. After working out, most antiperspirant-type sticks are not the right thing. They go on slimy and take a long time to dry, and often mark your clothing. The &amp;#34;Fresh Force&amp;#34; deodorant applies and dries quickly, and has a nice clean scent. It has not left residue on my clothing, and the scent holds up well even if you continue sweating. While I typically prefer an antiperspirant for daily wear, this has been a great addition to my gym bag and for other times when I know I&#x27;ll be sweating a lot.</li>
            <li> This deodorant provides a fresh clean smell that starts out a bit too strong but then becomes normal clean scent as it blends with your skin. The scent holds for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on clear and smooth and you don&#x27;t need that much of it. It will not provide deodorant stains as it is a gel and dried almost instantaneously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not an antiperspirant so it doesn&#x27;t block sweat from coming out, just blocks the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good alternative to antiperspirant if you are going to be outside or will be active in sports and do not want to use the chemically-ridden antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> So i had a really important interview and this stuff totally saved me in a pinch. I didnt sweat, or smell, and I even went out later that night and partied and it still was working. I really enjoy the smell and am going to use this from now on!~</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample from influenster, and have been using it about 2 weeks now, and it&#x27;s held up through intense workouts, and stressful days at work, and it has definitely held its own. It smells good, and it lasts throughout the day. My only dislike is that it&#x27;s the chalky kind of deodorant instead of the solid gel type. Other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Speed Stick has an excellent deodorant in &amp;#34;Fresh Force&amp;#34;.  This deodorant has a great order, that is strong but not overpowering.  Easy to grip tube and easy to raise the deodorant to your desired level.  It is a long lasting deodorant that doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes.  it is a great scent to use for the under arms after taking a shower and it is highly recommended!</li>
            <li> fresh scent that prevents underarm odor for hours and hours.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing. It helps eliminate bad odor and makes us feel fresher. It also helps with sweating. I would definitely recommend this product for the summer when the weather is so hot. Overall, this is a really good product.</li>
            <li> Speed Stick Gear is one of the best deodorants I&#x27;ve ever used. It lasts for a very long time and has a nice fresh smell. I&#x27;ve tried many different deodorant for men and this is one of the best and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> There are many reasons why I gave this product 5 stars. First, it smells great.  I like the feeling of smelling fresh with a little extra something.  Also, when it goes on it does not feel heavy or like you have a paste on.  It is almost as if you jnaturally smell that great.</li>
            <li> I like that this is a long lasting scent it does not wear off too quickly. Glad this can keep up with me and my busy routine! Run two miles daily and work 8+ hours a day. I only need to apply this deodorant once every morning! Also, i do not need to worry about a musty smell in the afternoon or evening. It works verry well with all day protection, THe smell of it is great too unlike some other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I got this to product by Influencer, and I just absolutly love it. I will be buying more in the futhure to keep me satisfied!!</li>
            <li> Speed stick gear is perfect. It does exactly as it advertises if not more. I retain a fresh scent for the near 2 and 1/2 day mark in which i practice Volleyball as well as swim. Keeps armpits dry and fresh.</li>
            <li> Speed Stick&#x27;s Gear deodorant makes my husband happy.  It goes on smoothly, works well for him, and have a light, clean scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm.  He has always liked Speed Stick as a brand, but this Gear Fresh Force is his favorite because the scent is restrained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has used this on light work days and on days when he&#x27;s out working hard.  It works. He will be buying this deodorant again.</li>
            <li> What it comes down to for most with deodorant is a) does it work and b) is the smell nice.  In this case, both are applicable. It prevented bad smells for two days (great for those who shower every other day) and the smell wasn&#x27;t overwhelming. Note that this isn&#x27;t an antipersperant so it doesn&#x27;t prevent wetness.  But we didn&#x27;t mind the scent and it worked as promised.</li>
            <li> This a great deodorant with a great scent. I would say this is a highly scented product, so keep that in mind. It s very long lasting but this version is a deodorant only. If you need help controlling underarm wetness you need a product that is also an antiperspirant. The  Speed Stick Gear line also  has a version  that is a deodorant/antiperspirant product.</li>
            <li> My wife let me back in the house after wearing this.</li>
            <li> I received two complementary Speed Stick Gear antiperspirant/deodorant sticks in Clean Peak and Fresh Force from Influenster.com&lt;br /&gt;The Speed Stick GEAR formula gives me equal parts Odor Protection and Comfort! This is really rare! Both scents complement my body chemistry, without being too overpowering. The claims that it lasts 48 hours is also NOT an exaggeration. I took them on vacation with me, going from Upstate New York to Humid Florida, a perfect time to investigate this claim. Perfection! Less need to reapply, and lasting dryness in all my travels.&lt;br /&gt;I am not usually brand loyal, I mainly switch based on value. I also have sensitive underarms, which made me wary of trying a combo antiperspirant/deodorant. Usually they are too harsh and I have to move onto something else. In doing so I usually trade off odor protection for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;I have found a new product that I will be repurchasing for as long as it works for me!</li>
            <li> I received this product free from Influenster about a month ago. I have been using it consistently since then and have noticed varying results. The scent definitely lasts longer than 24 hours but still leaves the same old white marks on my clothing and really doesn&#x27;t do much more than other standard deodorants in the same class. I travel 3 to 4 days a week for my job and didn&#x27;t feel confident it would have lasted 48 hours so it was still a daily use. If I had to purchase outright, I probably would choose another product.</li>
            <li> I usually use degree for all my freshness needs if you will, I liked that degree was body heat activated and for years I thought nothing could top it.....until now! I received this speed stick gear deodorant via influenster as part of a trial and at first I was leery about using it: when I thought of speed stick, I thought of something that was a bargain brand...the good of the best category. So I tried it for the first time, and I have to say....it is EVERYTHING! It&#x27;s very dry...meaning you won&#x27;t get that slippery underarm action that can happen when you apply your deodorant. It&#x27;s an antiperspirant and deodorizer and it does the job very well! I found it not to stain or &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34;(the shiny effect you see on your shirts) my shirts as well. I am really impressed with speed stick and this product; so much so that i&#x27;m making a switch to it! Hopefully this will help you all with your purchasing decision!</li>
            <li> The Speed Stick Gear Deodorant is by far the best anti-perspirant I have ever tried, hence the 5-star rating. I believe it has been lasting the full advertised 48-hours (although I have been re-applying within that time period because of habit). I can honestly say I will never buy another brand of deodorant…as long as Speed Stick Gear is available.</li>
            <li> I received this as a product test from Influenster. I was not impressed by the initial smell of the product. After putting it on, it definitely didn&#x27;t live up to the expectations put forth by the product makers. There was absolutely no dryness protection whatsoever. My other deodorant works so much better than this one.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for the past 3 weeks and have had nothing but great performance.  It lasted for multiple days of outside labor in cooler weather, cutting wood and racking leaves left from fall.  I have no complaints from using this products.  I received this product in an influenster voxbox for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary of Influenster. I am overall disappointed with the product. I use a different brand on a regular basis. However, this product made me feel extremely sticky after application. It was almost like I had to let it dry for fifteen minutes before it actually was comfortable to put my arms down. The smell was more like grass to me than anything else. I will not be buying this brand, but this might be a preferred brand for others.</li>
            <li> It smells great, kept me dry and smelling good for 48 hours, even after going to the gym! Best of all, it kept my shirts from getting that nasty stain.</li>
            <li> I received 2 sticks of Speed Stick Gear from influenster.com and was very skeptical of using them at first. I am very loyal to my brand and until now I would never switch. Speed Stick Gear smells great, lasted long, and most importantly didn&#x27;t ball up in my hair! I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to change deodorants because I&#x27;ve been using the same one for so long. I figured I would give this a try because I was hearing really good reviews about it. And everyone was right! Not only is the variety of scents great but it is long-lasting and leaves a dry-clean feel all day. Seriously, I never feel the need to have to use it more than once a day. Highly recommend giving this a try! (And the price ain&#x27;t bad!!)</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with deodorants for men. They tend to irritate me and make my skin red,itchy,and peel. I have been using Speed Stick Gear, which i received from Influenster for testing purposes and it has been great. For a few years ive been using women deodorants since they were the only deodorants i could use due to their gentle ingreadients. But now i can go back to male deodorants for once and Speed Stick Gear is the winner. Thanks Speed Stick Gear and Influenster.</li>
            <li> I received this to try in a vox box from influenster and at first thought it was great because it really does keep you dry for 48 hours. I became very disappointed when on all my expensive UA workout clothes was a white layer of crud from the product.  When washing this got all over the clothes and has been a pain to get out.</li>
            <li> I got to try it free from Influenster. It didn&#x27;t last 48 hours like it promised and so I don&#x27;t think a product should make a claim like that.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary of Influenster. This deodorant works really well, even when working out or out and about in town. It kept me from sweating all day no matter what I was doing.</li>
            <li> Speed Stick Gear Deodorant is an excellent product. Keeps me dry through out the day. Best product that I highly recommend to anyone looking for something that actually works. I have tried multiple brands of deodorants and none were up to what I needed. I tried Speed Stick Gear and it was a winner in my books. Finally something that helps for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Speed Stick Gear Deodorant from Influenster to try &amp; give my opinion. My favorite is the Fresh Force scent. Have also used the Clean Peak. Both are clean scents, and they don&#x27;t overpower. As I said the scents are clean. Speed Stick Gear has the new Drycore technology so it keeps you fresher, drier much longer than other brands. Gave it a good test during Judo. Happily it kept me fresh smelling. Two aspects that I love are that.. 1. It does last all day long, and you wont need to reapply, 2. It wont stain your shirts with white gunk.  Best thing is it&#x27;s not an expensive item, and it gives me confidence that I wont smell badly.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to test Speed Stick Gear deodorant through Influenster, and I was definitely impressed.  The big advertisement here is that it lasts 48 hours, so I decided to just bite the bullet and see if it holds up to the promise.  I wore it for two days without deodorizing in between.  You can feel when you apply it how it&#x27;s definitely a lot thicker and heavier than a typical deodorant of this type.  I took a shower after 48 hours and I could still feel it on there after getting out.  By the end of the 48 hour period I&#x27;m happy to say that I it was still actively working.  The con is that you really do feel it on you...even after a full day.  It&#x27;s not the most comfortable choice, but I gave it five stars because I believe this is a heavy duty deodorant which does what it says it does, and if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, there aren&#x27;t a whole lot of good choices out there.</li>
            <li> One of my new favorite deodorants. This is a great product for someone who doesn&#x27;t like overwhelming scents and an irritative deodorant. I use this because I have sensitive skin and I hate overwhelming scents. It&#x27;s a great deodorant for someone on the go because it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> day 1 - driest I have ever been with any product but no compliments or complaints on fragrance/odor&lt;br /&gt;day 2 - still pretty dry but complaints about odor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall for those wearing suits this is a great product as it will keep you dry at all times and your cologne will be your fragrance.  for those people running a 3 day marathon Id advise something with better deodorizing features.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t like other deodorants. It feels really great on my skin and the products does what it is supposed to! I also have the orange scent! Great job Speed Stick!</li>
            <li> Works great but I didn&#x27;t give the product five stars because it feels a little paste-like. Overall very nice does its job well.</li>
            <li> I received two sticks of deodorant to sample from Influenster. I got the Fresh Force scent and the Clean Peak scent. I&#x27;ve used both for the past few weeks. They work great! They last roughly 48 hours, two work shifts and a gym session. It doesn&#x27;t wash off easily in the shower the next day which is good and bad. Overall, I plan on buying this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and like this better than my previous deodorant. This leaves less white mess when you put your shirt on after and keeps you dry through the day.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first tried this product, what deodorant actually works for 48 hours? I was not a big fan of this particular fragrance. It was a bit overwhelming, but I got used to it as the day went on. I sweat a lot! So I figured that I would put this deodorant through its paces. I was dry all day. Even the next morning, I did not wake up sweating, like I normally do. I was impressed with how well it worked. It lasted well over 24 hours for me. I was not willing to go another day, to see how long it really lasted for me, as I was very happy with the overnight results! I have switched my deodorant. I WAS PROVIDED SPEED STICK GEAR TO ME AS A MEMBER OF INFLUENSTER. I WAS NOT COMPENSATED FOR THIS POST, HOWEVER I DID RECEIVE A SAMPLE FOR MY REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN AND NOT INFLUENCED IN ANY WAY.</li>
            <li> Speed Stick Gear Deodorant in the Fresh Force scent is a good deodorant that protects you from odor but not from wetness. It&#x27;s good for situations and days when sweating isn&#x27;t going to be a problem. The scent is strong when applying but lessens over time. It&#x27;s more for men but as a woman, I didn&#x27;t find it to be bad at all. The only thing that really makes it manly is the strength of the scent. I&#x27;ve used plenty of deodorants for women in a Fresh Scent that smelled exactly the same except they come labeled with Lady Speed Stick and are possibly a little lighter, but not much, fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this Speed Stick deodorant and the Fresh Force scent. I actually find the scent to be nicely unisex. It just smells emphatically clean in the morning. And after 12 hours of physical labor in the summer sun, it still smells emphatically clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does a great job of keeping you dry. I was also impressed at how well it minimizes irritation in heat.</li>
            <li> I tend to stay away from strongly-scented deodorants, so Speed Stick isn&#x27;t my top choice.  However, I find the Fresh Force version of this solid to not be overpowering at all.  I recently tried the same scent in their spray-on deodorant, and just the application of it was very overpowering to me.  The smell from the spray just hits you like a brick wall because it fills the air around you when you put it on.  This solid, of course, doesn&#x27;t have that issue.  Once applied, the scent lasts me all day, but it&#x27;s much more subtle and difficult to smell through a shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solid stick is translucent green and glides on smoothly, but the deodorant will turn whitish once applied.  I haven&#x27;t noticed it flaking off during the day like some other solids do (big plus unless you enjoy looking like you have armpit dandruff), and I have yet to notice any stains on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not an antiperspirant, which I actually prefer.  It keeps me foul-odor free but lets my sweat glands do their thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yes, at the current price of about $3, I think it&#x27;s worth giving a try.</li>
            <li> The scent is fair, sort of cheap soap with a hint of pine tree air freshener (yes, the kind you hang in your car) but seriously, skip this one, I&#x27;m a 56 year old grandmother, active, but not extremely so, and this wasn&#x27;t even strong enough for me. After a fairly light day of yard work I was rather horrified to find that I had noticeable underarm odor after using the Speed Stick Fresh Force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest trying Right Guard Sport instead, even if I shower every other day, I still don&#x27;t have an odor problem when I use the Right Guard, and I really like the Fresh Scent. [[ASIN:B00FFI5PAW Right Guard Sport 3-D Invisible Solid A/P Deodorant Fresh 2.6 oz. (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To answer your probable question, why is a 56 year old woman using men&#x27;s deodorant?  I have been using men&#x27;s deodorant for over 15 years. I started back when I was a single parent on a tight budget, I was working outdoors, doing the same work as men, and wanted a strong deodorant. I found the men&#x27;s to be less expensive and I liked the outdoorsy types of scents that it came in, as opposed to the women&#x27;s that smelled like flowers or fruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended</li>
            <li> This deodorant actually works,  Too many say they keep you smelling fresh, and then they don&#x27;t do the job at all, or quit halfway into your summer afternoon. I&#x27;m a girl, and wish it smelled a bit more feminine, but I wanted a deodorant that was exclusively deodorant, I&#x27;m tired of ruining shirts with antiperspirant! But if you want to definitely not stink, this is what you&#x27;re looking for!</li>
            <li> This is ONLY a deodorant---I didn&#x27;t realize this when I requested it otherwise would not have bothered. I have a very active lifestyle that includes running every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me about a week to figure out this wasn&#x27;t doing anything positive for me, I kept getting slick slimy pits. The stuff smells good when you put it on (not in an annoying Axe-like way) but I noticed that didn&#x27;t last very long. I finally read the label and saw that it was only deodorant.  Oh, ho ho ho noooooo my pits need way more than just a little deodorant. Besides, this wasn&#x27;t even that great of a deodorant....I got stinky within a few hours. But again I&#x27;m active, I&#x27;m in the heat. It&#x27;s not a surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> If you need a Deodorant only, the Speed Stick Gear Deodorant Fresh Force has a mild scent and comes in a 3oz blue and gray color container. Inside, the deodorant is a cyan-blue semi-seethrough solid-gel type of a thing (for lack of a better description). A donkey wheel at the bottom pushes the product up. Ben Linus not included. There are two gray grippy areas at the two sides for a better hold on the container. The Fresh Force smell is good, but not as good as the Fresh Force version of the smell found in the body spray [[ASIN:B00I1HAOV4 Speed Stick Gear Body Spray, Fresh Force, 4 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since there is no anti-perspirant here (no active ingredient that inhibits sweating), you may want to test it first before heading out for a full workday or a workout or an outdoor adventure. Sweating and natural smells vary based on many factors, so there&#x27;s no clean cut answer. In general, I found this to hold up better than I expected, but still, it is not a replacement for an antiperspirant + deodorant.</li>
            <li> I actually got this as a trial size sample with an online clothes order, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I LOVED the scent and how well it lasted, but after a few days of using it, I broke out in a horrible, itchy rash so unfortunately I can no longer use this. Which is a shame, because this might be one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I used to use Gillette&#x27;s Arctic Ice deodorant and antiperspirant. They discontinued making the product but continued with the Gel line of their product. It wasn&#x27;t the same so i be been looking for a replacement for about 3 years now! Last night I luckily stumbled upon Speed Stick&#x27;s GEAR &amp;#34;Fresh Force&amp;#34; and the fragarence is exactly the same and the performance of the product is the same as well! I am extremely happy that I have found this product! I don&#x27;t know tjr legal aspects of products like thus but I&#x27;m wondering if Speed Stick bought the formula or if a patent expired and they are allowed to use the formula and can market it now? Regardless, I got my deoderant back and couldn&#x27;t be more happy! I recommend this product to anyone!! Trust me, you will get many compliments from the female persuasion after you have put this on!! A+++++ product!!!</li>
            <li> smells terrible. not sure what it is.  i&#x27;m only writing this review because amazon keeps bugging me to buy it it again and i would never do that.  something seriously funky with this stuff</li>
