            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>It covers great, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and the colors they sent match my look perfectly.</li>
            <li>It also covers great for a mineral makeup.</li>

            <li>This is a great price and great product.</li>
            <li>I love all of the products it comes with!!</li>
            <li>which is amazing!</li>
            <li>The &#x27;fair&#x27; and &#x27;fair 2&#x27; colors both work for my skin.</li>
            <li>Our daughter received this for Christmas and loved it.  </li>
            <li>also meant to mention- this set is fair without being pinky-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is great, awesome coverage, great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Love this makeup and the price is great.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of fairy dust, and is great to use on top of pigmented shadows to leave a sparkling effect.</li>

            <li>, I am very happy with this set-&lt;br /&gt;the bisque cover alone was worth the price-</li>
            <li>The coverage was amazing</li>
            <li>Well, I received this product, followed the step by step instructions and was totally thrilled.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t believe the price I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>Nice starter set.</li>
            <li>Love Love love  this makeup!!</li>
            <li>I also love to apply it over my darker eyeshadows to blend them in better, and it gives the most beautiful hint of sparkle.  </li>
            <li>It is great when you first put it on and will look good for like 4 hours or so but then takes on this yellow/orange look to it</li>
            <li>It also looked pretty chalky even though I&#x27;m very fair skinned as it is.</li>
            <li>This makeup is great and came quickly.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>And I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE the brushes it came with.</li>
            <li>I had no reason to be concerned regarding coverage and smoothness as I did not encounter any flaws after following the directions perfectly.</li>
            <li>Overall, significantly impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>but I see the brushes as more of a bonus with purchase sort of thing.  </li>
            <li>… I don&#x27;t know… All I know is my face looks a lot better now.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and I just love the eyeshadow that comes in the kit.</li>
            <li>No cake.....  :) ....</li>
            <li>But I just couldn&#x27;t help myself... :)</li>
            <li>Since the IQ foundation is already a tad bit heavier, having a mound of it to work with can be challenging.</li>
            <li>To avoid this problem place a cotton ball in the top of the jar when you are not using it</li>
            <li>so the powder doesn&#x27;t seep from the bottom to the top.</li>
            <li>IQ eyeshadow is stunning.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>The IQ eyeshadow is stunning.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>works better to cover blemishes than any I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>The bag is really cute-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn it quite a bit, and the ability to blend the two options to the right shade throughout the year is really nice.</li>
            <li>Overall good makeup...use sparingly!</li>
            <li>This is fine with me,</li>
            <li>I gave this product to my girlfriend and although it seems like a great deal for a kit, there are some extra ingredients.</li>
            <li>read on the comments to order a shade darker as IQ runs light.</li>
            <li>I read on the comments to order a shade darker as IQ runs light.</li>
            <li>The brush set is a fairly cheap one.</li>
            <li>I came across IQ Natural and read some really good reviews about it</li>
            <li>course that lady looks amazing with this stuff on, she just had a professional make up artist applying</li>
            <li>It does a good job at \\&quot;finishing\\&quot; the look, but it just isn&#x27;t the same as bareMinerals</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals for about six years now and used to love it, but recently noticed the coverage wasn&#x27;t as great as it used to be.</li>
            <li>, it came quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>But other than that you get an awesome make up bag and make up that lasts all day and looks natural.</li>
            <li>IQ stays put much longer because it is not as fine as bareMinerals.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I would say that for the price I paid, it was well worth it</li>
            <li>IQ wins this round.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would buy this brand again as it stands right now.</li>
            <li>The neutral color is lightly sparkly and vibrant.</li>
            <li>The neutral color is lightly sparkly and vibrant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve struggled to find a good concealer to hide my dark eye circles.</li>
            <li>It is barely visible but it brightens up your eyes ( great for when you want to look freshly put together [ or just awake :) ] without looking like you tried too hard).</li>
            <li>I usually always use a liquid foundation to create a nice smooth finish.</li>
            <li>Watch a youtube video showing how to apply mineral makeup if it&#x27;s your first time buying.</li>
            <li>I will be a returning customer, every thing was exactly as described .</li>
            <li>When I tally up all of the make up I have tried out from the stores, thinking  I was saving money,… I actually was spending more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall the final look achieved with both are just as stunning.</li>
            <li>Nobody will be able to guess if the final result is bareMinerals or IQ!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i orderex this exact package</li>
            <li>Wow!!!!</li>
            <li>I would say the only negative is that the quality of the larger brushes are not that great at all, but most of us already have plenty of those!</li>
            <li>Seems to work as well as the higher priced mi real makeups.</li>
            <li>Brushes are average at best, super short handles making them harder to find.</li>
            <li>The IQ is hands down the best I&#x27;ve tried of any mineral makeup next to bareMinerals and ranks a very close 2nd.</li>
            <li>The IQ is hands down the best I&#x27;ve tried of any mineral makeup next to bareMinerals and ranks a very close 2nd.</li>
            <li>I know two days isn&#x27;t much to go by</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that I wear that much make up</li>
            <li>, I simply like knowing that I have all of the tools available in my arsenal to create whatever look</li>
            <li>and i would really appreciate if someone out there would go over it step by step with</li>
            <li>very neat.&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
            <li>it all balances very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found these results to leave a natural, healthy overall look.</li>
            <li>Might be better off if it didn&#x27;t have instructions or could increase price and add the other items.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would also be a great buy for anyone who is thinking about trying mineral make up for the first time and wants to wear it a few times before springing for something more expensive.</li>
            <li>I will be the ordering full sized versions of this in the future.</li>
            <li>The bareMinerals foundation jars have smaller holes which filter the powders better; therefore, the IQ foundation tends to pile on top of the jar due to the larger holes in the bottom.</li>
            <li>Powder foundation has limited coverage, feels like how cheap it is.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest getting this product</li>
            <li>I simply could not believe how pretty I looked!</li>
            <li>forgot to mention, my bag is pink, not black- again, not a big deal, but nice to know!&lt;br /&gt;Other than that</li>
            <li>I adore it, and it&#x27;s my new makeup from now on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This one is equal to, or better than, the more expensive lines, with a couple caveats:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>The concealer is a little darker than my skin tone, but it works out well as it&#x27;s kinda a midde-ground between the red patches that are on there, and the foundation I put on on top of it.</li>
            <li>… The only difference is that BareMinerals are so expensive and this is just as great.</li>
            <li>This pleasantly surprised me.</li>
            <li>The coverage is fantastic and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all.  </li>
            <li>Note to IQ Natural :</li>
            <li>so i went on search for natural makeup something not heavy but covers well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is the first time i have purchased and used the iq natural mineral makeup and i am not sure what to apply first</li>
            <li>But believe the instructions when it says to only use a little, I used far too much the first time and looked like a powder puff!</li>
            <li>I feel really stupid,  especially after buying this kit for such a great price, and seeing how much better it actually covers the flaws on my face.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend applying as little facial primer as possible though (which is NOT included in the kit) for the most natural look.</li>
            <li>Synthetic chemicals are not natural get your act together and keep it real with your customers.</li>
            <li>&quot; The other thing that always prevented me from purchasing this item is that I have moderate scarring on my face from acne and just general mild discoloration.</li>
            <li>It is only a tad bit heavier; however, it absolutely leaves no creasing, and is not noticeable at all as long as it is applied correctly.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve barely touched the concealer and the warmth.  </li>
            <li>IQ wins this round.    </li>
            <li>Maybe my skin is more sensitive than most, but this made me break out horribly.</li>
            <li>and it was about the third of the price of bare minerals, so</li>
            <li>It did not blend naturally with my skin tone, and did not completely cover my circles.</li>
            <li>It did not blend naturally with my skin tone, and did not completely cover my circles.</li>
            <li>IQ looked like it would fit the bill as it says it is a natural makeup with only mineral oxides and nothing potentially irritating.</li>
            <li>Feels great on--very similar to the Bare Minerals I&#x27;ve used in the past, although not a perfect match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>SO many times a makeup set comes with a kabuki brush that I just can&#x27;t use due to how sensitive my face is (the brush is too stiff and harsh to rub over my face).</li>

            <li> … The only difference is that BareMinerals are so expensive and this is just as great.</li>
            <li> This pleasantly surprised me.</li>
            <li> The coverage is fantastic and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all.  </li>
            <li> Note to IQ Natural :</li>
            <li> so i went on search for natural makeup something not heavy but covers well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is the first time i have purchased and used the iq natural mineral makeup and i am not sure what to apply first</li>
            <li> But believe the instructions when it says to only use a little, I used far too much the first time and looked like a powder puff!</li>
            <li> I feel really stupid,  especially after buying this kit for such a great price, and seeing how much better it actually covers the flaws on my face.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend applying as little facial primer as possible though (which is NOT included in the kit) for the most natural look.</li>
            <li> Synthetic chemicals are not natural get your act together and keep it real with your customers.</li>
            <li> &quot; The other thing that always prevented me from purchasing this item is that I have moderate scarring on my face from acne and just general mild discoloration.</li>
            <li> It is only a tad bit heavier; however, it absolutely leaves no creasing, and is not noticeable at all as long as it is applied correctly.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve barely touched the concealer and the warmth.  </li>
            <li> IQ wins this round.    </li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is more sensitive than most, but this made me break out horribly.</li>
            <li> and it was about the third of the price of bare minerals, so</li>
            <li> It did not blend naturally with my skin tone, and did not completely cover my circles.</li>
            <li> It did not blend naturally with my skin tone, and did not completely cover my circles.</li>
            <li> IQ looked like it would fit the bill as it says it is a natural makeup with only mineral oxides and nothing potentially irritating.</li>
            <li> Feels great on--very similar to the Bare Minerals I&#x27;ve used in the past, although not a perfect match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SO many times a makeup set comes with a kabuki brush that I just can&#x27;t use due to how sensitive my face is (the brush is too stiff and harsh to rub over my face).</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this particular product was the brushes that came with it, but I would let that mess with my rating.</li>
            <li> It does leave a nice finished look however, so it&#x27;s not a complete disappointment.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s applied, tap the jar gently and apply a small portion to the brush at a time.</li>
            <li> It hides my dark circles, and blends naturally with my face.</li>
            <li> I have been a Bare Escentuals wearer for a long time and have tried some other knock-off mineral powders such as Maybellene, what a joke those turned out to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other mineral lines, all more expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it will do the same for you, but maybe I was allergic to something in all of the other make ups</li>
            <li> I always have a problem because I am pale- but not pink!</li>
            <li> but since I was trying to find a brand of makeup that didn&#x27;t have so many bad things in it, I thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li> The brushes work, but they are littler than I expected.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this for myself, and I&#x27;m not exactly sure</li>
            <li> I have bought bareMinerals before in the past and it worked the same as this IQ makeup</li>
            <li> Like all loose powders, they can make quite a mess being shaken around, then opened.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>

            <li> I had no idea what to expect when I ordered this product but since I was trying to find a brand of makeup that didn&#x27;t have so many bad things in it, I thought I would give this a try. I was skeptical when I got it and thought the makeup would probably only last me a week because there was so little there. Boy was I wrong, I&#x27;m going on a month of use, every day. It covers great, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and the colors they sent match my look perfectly. I absolutely love it. But believe the instructions when it says to only use a little, I used far too much the first time and looked like a powder puff! A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this</li>
            <li> I might not be terribly picky when it comes to face makeup, but my skin sure is. I&#x27;ve been recently battling with a case of perioral dermatitis on one side of my cheek that was caused by a concealer I&#x27;ve been using by a well-known brand. It looked horrible and red. I wanted desperately to cover it, but every time I used the concealer it made it worse! I said &#x27;enough&#x27; with this vicious cycle and aimed to buy a mineral powder makeup that potentially did not have any of the ingredients in it that my body was reacting to. I have had bad experiences with mineral makeup in the past due to bismuth oxychloride (my face was raw and hurting after putting it on!). IQ looked like it would fit the bill as it says it is a natural makeup with only mineral oxides and nothing potentially irritating. I know that an ingredient is always irritating to somebody out there, but I took the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days after using it, I can say that my skin tolerates it well, even when I don&#x27;t wash it off at night. It also covers great for a mineral makeup. The concealer is a little darker than my skin tone, but it works out well as it&#x27;s kinda a midde-ground between the red patches that are on there, and the foundation I put on on top of it. The &#x27;fair&#x27; and &#x27;fair 2&#x27; colors both work for my skin. And I LOVE LOVE LOVE the brushes it came with. SO many times a makeup set comes with a kabuki brush that I just can&#x27;t use due to how sensitive my face is (the brush is too stiff and harsh to rub over my face). The brushes this set came with are petal-soft and there are no issues whatsoever with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would say that for the price I paid, it was well worth it and I am a happy customer. I would buy this brand again as it stands right now. I know two days isn&#x27;t much to go by and I will update the review if I feel differently. But usually I can tell pretty soon how my skin will react to something and it&#x27;s not hating this. That&#x27;s a big deal for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals for about six years now and used to love it, but recently noticed the coverage wasn&#x27;t as great as it used to be. I came across IQ Natural and read some really good reviews about it and it was about the third of the price of bare minerals, so I decided to give it a try. Its great! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this particular product was the brushes that came with it, but I would let that mess with my rating.</li>
            <li> I have to start by admitting I am a bit of a make-up junkie, if you will. It&#x27;s not that I wear that much make up, I simply like knowing that I have all of the tools available in my arsenal to create whatever look I want to. I have always been skeptical about these Bare/Natural make-up powders and fervently doubted their coverage ability and the finished product. I have watched the infomercials and thought to myself, \\&quot;Of course that lady looks amazing with this stuff on, she just had a professional make up artist applying it!\\&quot; The other thing that always prevented me from purchasing this item is that I have moderate scarring on my face from acne and just general mild discoloration. I usually always use a liquid foundation to create a nice smooth finish. Well, I received this product, followed the step by step instructions and was totally thrilled. 1) I simply could not believe how pretty I looked! And, I mean pretty like you couldn&#x27;t tell I had make-up on but glowing! 2) Turns out I had no reason to be concerned regarding coverage and smoothness as I did not encounter any flaws after following the directions perfectly. I would recommend applying as little facial primer as possible though (which is NOT included in the kit) for the most natural look. Overall, significantly impressed with this product. I would say the only negative is that the quality of the larger brushes are not that great at all, but most of us already have plenty of those!</li>
            <li> This pleasantly surprised me. I&#x27;ve worn it quite a bit, and the ability to blend the two options to the right shade throughout the year is really nice. Feels great on--very similar to the Bare Minerals I&#x27;ve used in the past, although not a perfect match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would also be a great buy for anyone who is thinking about trying mineral make up for the first time and wants to wear it a few times before springing for something more expensive.</li>
            <li> This is a great price and great product. The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was the size of the brushes. But other than that you get an awesome make up bag and make up that lasts all day and looks natural. I will continue to buy this stuff!</li>
            <li> Our daughter received this for Christmas and loved it.  Thank you...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this starter kit for a couple of months now and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  The coverage is fantastic and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all.  Even though this kit is trial sized, I still have plenty of product left.  I feel like I&#x27;ve barely touched the concealer and the warmth.  Yes, the brushes do shed a bit but I see the brushes as more of a bonus with purchase sort of thing.  I will be the ordering full sized versions of this in the future.</li>
            <li> Love Love love  this makeup!! Watch a youtube video showing how to apply mineral makeup if it&#x27;s your first time buying. The coverage was amazing</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this for myself, and I&#x27;m not exactly sure if I like it or not. It does cover any flaws you have. However it comes with directions and some of the items it tells you to use are not included in this kit. Might be better off if it didn&#x27;t have instructions or could increase price and add the other items.</li>
            <li> Love this makeup and the price is great. Will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Love the make-up, just did not come with the primer base to use the make-up with.</li>
            <li> This makeup is great and came quickly.  I will be a returning customer, every thing was exactly as described .</li>
            <li> Wow!!!! I have bought bareMinerals before in the past and it worked the same as this IQ makeup… The only difference is that BareMinerals are so expensive and this is just as great. I honestly can&#x27;t believe the price I paid for it.  I feel so stupid for having gone so long without buying mineral makeup...just because of the price. When I tally up all of the make up I have tried out from the stores, thinking  I was saving money,… I actually was spending more.  I feel really stupid,  especially after buying this kit for such a great price, and seeing how much better it actually covers the flaws on my face.  With just  a small amount,  it covers up all the redness I have, and it seems to be evening out my complexion ( call me crazy ).... But I seriously have seen a change in my skin since I have started using it. I&#x27;m not saying it will do the same for you, but maybe I was allergic to something in all of the other make ups… I don&#x27;t know… All I know is my face looks a lot better now.  Oh, and I just love the eyeshadow that comes in the kit. It is barely visible but it brightens up your eyes ( great for when you want to look freshly put together [ or just awake :) ] without looking like you tried too hard). I also love to apply it over my darker eyeshadows to blend them in better, and it gives the most beautiful hint of sparkle.  P.S. It&#x27;s all cover... No cake.....  :) ....corny, I know... But I just couldn&#x27;t help myself... :)</li>
            <li> I gave this product to my girlfriend and although it seems like a great deal for a kit, there are some extra ingredients. Note to IQ Natural :Synthetic chemicals are not natural get your act together and keep it real with your customers. False advertising is no way to get repeat customers.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy IQ and actually had bareMinerals in my cart when I landed on the IQ sample page and read the reviews. I have been a Bare Escentuals wearer for a long time and have tried some other knock-off mineral powders such as Maybellene, what a joke those turned out to be. Today my IQ makeup came and I will break down the differences between bareMinerals and IQ for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the final look achieved with both are just as stunning. IQ stays put much longer because it is not as fine as bareMinerals. It is only a tad bit heavier; however, it absolutely leaves no creasing, and is not noticeable at all as long as it is applied correctly. The bareMinerals foundation jars have smaller holes which filter the powders better; therefore, the IQ foundation tends to pile on top of the jar due to the larger holes in the bottom. Since the IQ foundation is already a tad bit heavier, having a mound of it to work with can be challenging. To avoid this problem place a cotton ball in the top of the jar when you are not using it so the powder doesn&#x27;t seep from the bottom to the top. When it&#x27;s applied, tap the jar gently and apply a small portion to the brush at a time. I&#x27;ve found these results to leave a natural, healthy overall look. Nobody will be able to guess if the final result is bareMinerals or IQ!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only dissapointment to me is the mineral veil. bareMinerals kicks the pants off of IQ&#x27;s veil. When the IQ veil is applied it just stays where you set the brush instead of floating down your face like the bareMinerals veil. It does leave a nice finished look however, so it&#x27;s not a complete disappointment. It does a good job at \\&quot;finishing\\&quot; the look, but it just isn&#x27;t the same as bareMinerals I will miss this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve struggled to find a good concealer to hide my dark eye circles. The IQ concealer is one of the best concealers I have ever used. It hides my dark circles, and blends naturally with my face. I wish I could purchase a larger jar of it! I prefer the IQ concealer to the bareMinerals concealer. I was not impressed with the bareMinerals concealer at all. It did not blend naturally with my skin tone, and did not completely cover my circles. IQ wins this round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The IQ eyeshadow is stunning. It is mucho perfecto! The neutral color is lightly sparkly and vibrant. It does not crease, and lasts all day. It reminds me of fairy dust, and is great to use on top of pigmented shadows to leave a sparkling effect. This is my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; shadow for both casual and formal wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read on the comments to order a shade darker as IQ runs light. I am glad I did. I have light-med skin and ordered the medium. It is perfect, and even came with one a shade darker too, for my summer tan! The IQ is hands down the best I&#x27;ve tried of any mineral makeup next to bareMinerals and ranks a very close 2nd. I will be using this from now on. Goodbye expensive bareMinerals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/19/2014 Hi ladies! I&#x27;m back for my third purchase of IQ, and I&#x27;ve updated my review to reflect some additional pointers and thoughts that I&#x27;ve acquired since my initial purchase. I&#x27;m always on the lookout for high-quality products that meet the standards of others for a lesser cost. I&#x27;m thankful that I&#x27;ve found this in IQ.ncealer to the bareMinerals concealer.

            <li> Nice starter set. Let&#x27;s you see if you like the color. Seems to work as well as the higher priced mi real makeups.</li>
            <li> Overall good makeup...use sparingly!</li>
            <li> Excellent. I&#x27;ve used other mineral lines, all more expensive. This one is equal to, or better than, the more expensive lines, with a couple caveats:&lt;br /&gt;1. The brush set is a fairly cheap one. This is fine with me, though- I wanted the makeup, not the brushes. The cost savings gave me plenty to buy a brush after.&lt;br /&gt;2. I wish the makeup had tops that could close for travel. Like all loose powders, they can make quite a mess being shaken around, then opened.&lt;br /&gt;3. (edit) forgot to mention, my bag is pink, not black- again, not a big deal, but nice to know!&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I am very happy with this set-&lt;br /&gt;the bisque cover alone was worth the price- works better to cover blemishes than any I&#x27;ve ever used. I adore it, and it&#x27;s my new makeup from now on.&lt;br /&gt;I also meant to mention- this set is fair without being pinky- which is amazing! I always have a problem because I am pale- but not pink!</li>
            <li> thank you for reading&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is the first time i have purchased and used the iq natural mineral makeup and i am not sure what to apply first and i would really appreciate if someone out there would go over it step by step with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i can be reached at&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;noelle00100@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> i orderex this exact package and i love it, it came quickly and well packaged. very neat.&lt;br /&gt;now about the make up. im usually a bareminerals girl, but they are a bit pricey. so i went on search for natural makeup something not heavy but covers well. this hit the nail on the head. it all balances very well.</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is more sensitive than most, but this made me break out horribly. It also looked pretty chalky even though I&#x27;m very fair skinned as it is.</li>
            <li> It is great when you first put it on and will look good for like 4 hours or so but then takes on this yellow/orange look to it</li>
            <li> Powder foundation has limited coverage, feels like how cheap it is. Brushes are average at best, super short handles making them harder to find.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is great, awesome coverage, great for sensitive skin! I love all of the products it comes with!! I highly suggest getting this product</li>
            <li> The bag is really cute-which is why I bought it. The brushes work, but they are littler than I expected.</li>
