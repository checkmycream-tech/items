            <li>Amazingly, this product works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple months now and all I can say is it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>but this is truely an amazing product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure that helps with the good results I am having...Will stick with Nail Tek and see what the coming months bring...</li>
            <li>have nice nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the best (and believe me when I say I&#x27;ve tried Everything) for keeping my nails from peeling too much.</li>
            <li>If you use this produce as it says in the instructions you will have nice nails.</li>
            <li>and it was nice getting two for one.</li>
            <li>Ordering from Amazon is a breeze and the product is always packaged nicely and arrives intact.</li>
            <li>I have found that this stuff seems to put a nice coating to the nails whereas the polish doesn&#x27;t seem to chip so that helps a lot.</li>
            <li>even Best formula would not stop splitting Thanks, Naomi</li>
            <li>are so good that one might think they are planted, but believe me, everything is true!</li>
            <li>and I made it to my home so quickly which I was really happy about.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It made my nails very strong which helped me from wanting to nibble at them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the deal of getting two for one, MUCH better than in stores!</li>
            <li>NailTek makes the best natural nail products ever!</li>
            <li>Great nail repair, been using for years and will not try other nail products because this one is the best for me!</li>
            <li>Absolutely wonderful for soft and peeling nails.  </li>
            <li>I turned to my best friend on the internet - Amazon - and was able to purchase a new supply.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my right hand in about two weeks and after a month both hands look great.  </li>
            <li>I would love to review this item, because I&#x27;ve purchased it before (and love it), but Nail Beauty 4U sent me the incorrect item.  </li>
            <li>Rejuvacote works better for me.</li>
            <li>and once I began to use this, I was able to grow nails</li>
            <li>I have had problem nails for most of my life.  </li>
            <li>My nail continues to be healthy looking</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it even though my nails are healthy now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would have performed even better.</li>
            <li>I can now keep my nails the length of most acrilics.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE USED IT FOR MANY YEARS AND HAVE HAD MANY COMPLIMENTS.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I Love Nail Tek..</li>
            <li>you want three more words.</li>
            <li>I tried many products until if found Nail Tek.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy the 2 for 1 because who doesn&#x27;t like getting more for their money?</li>
            <li>I want to be able to wear nail polish all the time without having to give my nails a break.</li>
            <li>I though this product would help, but I still had to stop painting my nails for a week to let the staining get better.</li>
            <li>it could cause more damage instead of hardening my nails as supposedly........</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I always order the two for one deal which lasts longer and gives me more bang for my buck.</li>
            <li>Thank you to the many Amazon reviewers who steered me in the direction of this product.</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Ordinarily, I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I save so many dollars.</li>
            <li>It took me a couple hours to feel better, and realize what had happened.</li>
            <li>LOL.. VERY DISSAPOINTED</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product.  </li>
            <li>have told many friends</li>
            <li>BUT...it&#x27;s been a while now, and my nails aren&#x27;t better.</li>
            <li>love this product</li>
            <li>Also a top coat of this product maintained nail polish without chips for days.</li>
            <li>You have saved my nails and my money : )</li>
            <li>I have many clients asking me for a product to help in the chipping and peeling of their nails.</li>
            <li>I LOVE free shipping!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all Sally Hansen nail strengtheners and many others and also was taking some vitamins</li>
            <li>I have recommended these product to family and friends - who also love them.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t even return the 4 bottles that I bought because the shipping would cost me more than the product itself.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff</li>
            <li>both of my pinky nails are healthy</li>
            <li>I ordered more of this stuff</li>
            <li>I have to say that I&#x27;m quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Since, I&#x27;ve recommended to others with problem nails, and they&#x27;ve mentioned they love it too.</li>
            <li>And by November my nails looked fantastic!</li>
            <li>I was finally able to wear polish and no longer be embarrassed by my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok but formaldehyde and it seems to be drying out my nails.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, priced right, and very effective.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use polish, and I wondered whether the lack of polish made this product peel off more easily.  </li>
            <li>PLUS the brush easily separated from the top</li>
            <li>My nail are strong, natural and beautiful.</li>
            <li>If you have nails that are soft and /or peel, this stuff is great to cover them.  </li>
            <li>Good price for a product my nails really need.</li>
            <li>Good price, and fast shipping</li>
            <li>I will definitely order this one again the price was super and the product is excellent</li>
            <li>The Nail Tek was shipped by this vendor very quickly and in sturdy packaging.  </li>
            <li>Nails grow very quick if used once a day</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t as strong as with Nailtek</li>
            <li>It makes my nails strong and prevent cracking and peeling.  </li>
            <li>So far so good. :)</li>
            <li>and now people can not believe how strong they are.</li>
            <li>But be patient, it takes time to grow strong nails.</li>
            <li>But overall, this is not a bad product, not an incredible one either.</li>
            <li>nail.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a loyal fan of Nail Tek!</li>
            <li>Now, I have long, strong beautiful nails.  </li>
            <li>free</li>
            <li>Nail Tek is a great nail therapy that actually works to strengthen nails.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really smooth</li>
            <li>The great reviews and testimonials left for this product</li>
            <li>Seems cheap.</li>
            <li>and so far so good...</li>
            <li>It was a good deal getting 2 bottles for nearly the price of one bottle in retail stores.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, except for when I wore acrylics, I HAVE LONG, ATTRACTIVE NAILS!</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m 20 and my nails always look long and beautiful.</li>
            <li>So when I found this online for so cheap I was excited.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m looking at some pretty nice looking nails right now.</li>
            <li>After using constantly for 6 months, I was able to use just as a bottom and top coat when I used polish and it kept my nails strong</li>
            <li>Therefore, whenever I find a special on it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this Nail Tek product before and was happy that the price for 2 bottles made the total price including shipping very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>This shiny, fast drying product helps keep my manicure for more than a week.</li>
            <li>This is just what I wanted and I cannot get enough of it at a good price.  </li>
            <li>This order met al expectations, and I&#x27;m about ready to order more.  </li>
            <li>My nails, which used to be thin and peeled easily, are now in the best condition that have ever been in.</li>
            <li>The shipment came quickly and meets my expectations.  </li>
            <li>It started working almost immediately, and a month later I am back to perfect nails.  </li>
            <li>Good quality nail polish lasts long.</li>
            <li>It really does make your nails strong.</li>
            <li>Easy use and reasonable priced.</li>
            <li>I was a nail biter for many years (25+) and WOW this stuff WORKS!</li>
            <li>its worth it</li>
            <li>It was not inconvenient at all adding another coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After too many years of acrylics I wanted to be natural.</li>
            <li>Time will tell as far as ordering more.</li>
            <li>but this always helps to keep them stronger and they look much better with a clear protective  coat on.</li>
            <li>Disappointed...didn&#x27;t do anything more than clear polish would have...would not recommend this to any one else.....</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s certainly worth trying.</li>
            <li>I have to say I&#x27;ve used NailTek intensive in the past when I purchased it at the spa in my country and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>perfect for my thin nails.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product to make your nails grow and not have to use false nails.  </li>
            <li>one day I noticed they were long, strong, healthy nails.  </li>
            <li>Was she ever right.  </li>
            <li>Took longer than expected to get here, but the product works pretty good</li>
            <li>She said this would make my nails much healthier, and she was right, too!  </li>
            <li>It is essential to apply it every day since you have strong nails!</li>
            <li>It really strengthens my nails, and while other products claim to do the same thing, I have found this one to be the best!</li>
            <li>She told me that anyone can have pretty nails if they use the right products.  </li>
            <li>Not only do I have long beautiful nails</li>
            <li>If your nails are soft and easy to split, try this.</li>
            <li>I use the Nail Tek foundation first (they are often pkg&#x27;d together) and that dries lightening fast, then I top with a coat of this stuff, the Nail Tek Intensive Therapy II clear coat.</li>
            <li>I do miss a day or two for sure, even though I keep the bottle right next to my chair in the evenings.</li>
            <li>but I found that the Nailtek by itself dries very fast.  </li>
            <li>AND I RECOMMENDED IT VERY MUCH</li>
            <li>I was surprised how quickly this product dries, too!</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase it in Wichita, but that isn&#x27;t close enough to be a viable option.  </li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I love it especially at the online price.  </li>
            <li>it really weakens my nails!</li>
            <li>I have been using Nail Tek for several years and absolutely love their nail polish.</li>
            <li>First of all, I want to mention that I purchased this from AllureBeauti</li>
            <li>Am overall pleased with this product and will continue to use the two bottles I have already purchased.  </li>
            <li>I also had these white spots on most of my nails.  </li>
            <li>First of let me start</li>
            <li>It was delivered promptly and I will most definately order this again, It is the only product that has helped me grow longer nails</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the first bottle</li>
            <li>you must use consistently to see results.</li>
            <li>At first I thought the added strength was from having the polish on</li>
            <li>I have paid much more in stores for the same product.</li>
            <li>Wish I didn&#x27;t have to come up with more items to reach the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; shipping, but that&#x27;s a personal problem...</li>
            <li>I am 72 and have pretty nails in just 3 months.  </li>
            <li>the first week i used this</li>
            <li>I can grow out my nails for the first time..</li>
            <li>The only things is that if you apply as a top coat, too, makes the drying time much longer</li>
            <li>not good alone, but great with nail armor</li>
            <li>My nails are now long and healthy.</li>
            <li>What a difference because now I have long, lovely looking nails that are stronger than ever.</li>
            <li>It was great and made my nails very durable, helped them grow, and didn&#x27;t take long to dry.</li>
            <li>The Shop price was more for a single bottle than the cost of our order for 2 bottles with shipping.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for few years and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I have seen significant growth in my nails although my nails on my left hand are much more harder and stronger than on my right hand.</li>
            <li>This product is the only thing that has been able to restore my weak peeling nails and made them strong and appealing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try if you have trouble keeping your nails from breaking and peeling, or just helping them grow to a nice natural length!</li>
            <li>My thumb &amp; index fingers, and large toenails (the most used) became soft and constantly peeled.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much time to spend on my nails</li>
            <li>and she really likes it.  </li>
            <li>It costs three times as much in salons...if you can locate one that carries the product.  </li>
            <li>This is also much cheaper than buying at a salon.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>My wife uses this product repeatedly and really likes it.</li>
            <li>The whole damn thing .</li>
            <li>This stuff really works</li>
            <li>it makes my nails worse but this is great.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>really need to try to post a picture</li>
            <li>That was 48 hours ago, and already my nails are much stronger and even a bit longer.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>but use this stuff in a VERY well ventilated area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as if its not the real thing.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a real pain to use it.</li>
            <li>but they were very brittle and and would always break</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t really notice it.</li>
            <li>My nails get really brittle some times and begin to splinter and peel.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions from Nail Tek, and it did make my nails much stronger.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Nail Tek and thanks to my friend.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on this product which have been very helpful.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Works very Well on brittle nails....</li>
            <li>Really works like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried before</li>
            <li>It makes them super strong so they break less and grow longer.</li>
            <li>Everyone wants to know what I have done to get them so long and strong.  </li>
            <li>I am sold on NailTek and will continue using this to keep my nails strong and long.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been years since my nails were this long and strong.</li>
            <li>For the record, I did not put any polish or any other treatment on top.  </li>
            <li>Every time I&#x27;ve used this I&#x27;ve achieved strong long nails!</li>
            <li>cause it drys so fast (unless it&#x27;s an older bottle, which can get sticky).</li>
            <li>I thought that the only way I could have nice, long nails was if I got acrylic or gel nails.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to improve their nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this in the past and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>My nails are longer and look pretty naturally.</li>
            <li>Not nasty, down to the bed, bite.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many products over the years to strengthen my nails and this is the only one that has actually worked.</li>
            <li>Then I moved to South Africa and ordered this particular item off Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY different nail strengthening treatments and have yet to find one that really does help, long term.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to everyone.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone?  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super glossy, but has a semi-gloss appearance, great on male or female nails.</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>It would be so easy for them to resolve it, as I see they have done with one other customer in their feedback section.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews for products</li>
            <li>regimen now: Religiously wearing gloves whenever using my hands under water (for instance, doing dishes or washing my hair,) and applying a fresh coat of this every two days.</li>
            <li>I found that my own natural nails were now soft and uneven.</li>
            <li>and I assure you I am very careful with my nails, using good topcoats and wearing rubber gloves for every task with water other than bathing.  </li>
            <li>I now have very long strong nails that at times I have to cut back because they are growing so fast.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind investing a little time daily to keep my nails nice</li>
            <li>I completely remove the product every ten days or so and apply a fresh new coat.</li>
            <li>While this is a good price for this product, and is advertised as a major treatment for weak nails, it didnt live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>I have been using Nail Tek Therapy II for several months and I now have long, strong nails.</li>
            <li>The first order came back and it worked just like she was used to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Given the nature of online retail I have no idea now if the &amp;#34;good stuff&amp;#34; is the old formula or the new formula.</li>
            <li>I luv the product but certainly was surprised at how tiny these bottles are</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a month and it has significantly reduced the peeling and splitting that has been having nice nails almost impossible.  </li>
            <li>The bottles have a purple  tent to them now instead of clear?</li>
            <li>Having had acrylic nails for years and decided that I really wanted to go &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34;  I purchased this product after reading several reviews on Amazon, as I knew that I would need something to strengthen and build up my natural nails again.  </li>
            <li>I started using this clear polish to protect my nails from splitting and chipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li>Item works very well, and I have bought it several times.</li>
            <li>It really works, but you have to use it daily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considered \\&quot;thrifty\\&quot; and only use products that really work.</li>
            <li>I wear my natural nails and have been since I started using NailTek II.</li>
            <li>not so much with length but an overall appearances.</li>
            <li>Within 24 hrs the polish had completely worn off.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is a seller issue or if the product has changed completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had soft nails that bent and cracked.</li>
            <li>Daughter has long nails for the first time.</li>
            <li>Since using this there is a complete change in my nails.</li>
            <li>I have natural nails.</li>
            <li>It takes up to a month to completely seal your nails</li>
            <li>This Nail Tek formula really helps bring them back to life and reinforce my nails.</li>
            <li>but still too early to judge.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my 92 year old mother who has been using this product for years to strengthen her nails and swears by it.  </li>
            <li>I bought Nail Tek Intensive Therapy 11 for soft, peeling nails.  </li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>so then to dive completly in the world of natural nails</li>
            <li>i didnt notice much plus the polish seemed to peel off but kept with it the second week my nails seemed to thrived now</li>
            <li>Not a little.</li>
            <li>so I started using it every other day on my nails, over clear polish or colorful polish.  </li>
            <li>Very disappointed as I bought so many because of the good price.</li>
            <li>I usually just wear them clear with the NailTek, or a very light cream or pink color.  </li>
            <li>Nail Tek ll that I&#x27;ve used in the past dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li>My daugter in law suggested I uses this product after I was told by my manicurist that I must not put any more polish on my nails for six months as they are so weak and flakey.  </li>
            <li>I had consistent broken nails and now they are strong and long</li>
            <li>The only downfall is if you do not put on at least one coat per day it does peel off, so you do need to spend 5 or 10 minutes a day on yourself, (Nail Tek dries in just minutes) but it is well worth it!!</li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t get it to stay on my bare nails.</li>
            <li>It hardens and grows short, soft, and brittle nails.</li>
            <li>Was surprised that they weren&#x27;t in individual boxes.</li>
            <li>but they are stronger even bare.  </li>
            <li>Apparently I missed the part where it said it contained formaldahyde.  </li>
            <li>now have a natural French manicure because  of this stuff!  </li>
            <li>not sure if I got the full strength product...</li>
            <li>It really helps my thin nails grow strong and long, which never had before.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really does work like magic, especially if you are growing your nails out after having artificial nails or wash your hands too frequently.</li>
            <li>Usually, I can maintain a full set of natural nails, but for some reason a month or so ago, several of them broke off on the same day.</li>
            <li>I have tried it in the past without success but thought I would try it again.</li>
            <li>Am hoping that in time my nails will be a little stronger and much healthier looking.  </li>
            <li>I have huge issues with my nails; they are thin and always peeling like an onion.</li>

            <li> They grow stronger and faster also they look healthy!  </li>
            <li> Amazingly, this product works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple months now and all I can say is it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> but this is truely an amazing product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure that helps with the good results I am having...Will stick with Nail Tek and see what the coming months bring...</li>
            <li> have nice nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the best (and believe me when I say I&#x27;ve tried Everything) for keeping my nails from peeling too much.</li>
            <li> If you use this produce as it says in the instructions you will have nice nails.</li>
            <li> and it was nice getting two for one.</li>
            <li> Ordering from Amazon is a breeze and the product is always packaged nicely and arrives intact.</li>
            <li> I have found that this stuff seems to put a nice coating to the nails whereas the polish doesn&#x27;t seem to chip so that helps a lot.</li>
            <li> even Best formula would not stop splitting Thanks, Naomi</li>
            <li> are so good that one might think they are planted, but believe me, everything is true!</li>
            <li> and I made it to my home so quickly which I was really happy about.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It made my nails very strong which helped me from wanting to nibble at them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the deal of getting two for one, MUCH better than in stores!</li>
            <li> NailTek makes the best natural nail products ever!</li>
            <li> Great nail repair, been using for years and will not try other nail products because this one is the best for me!</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful for soft and peeling nails.  </li>
            <li> I turned to my best friend on the internet - Amazon - and was able to purchase a new supply.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my right hand in about two weeks and after a month both hands look great.  </li>
            <li> I would love to review this item, because I&#x27;ve purchased it before (and love it), but Nail Beauty 4U sent me the incorrect item.  </li>
            <li> Rejuvacote works better for me.</li>
            <li> and once I began to use this, I was able to grow nails</li>
            <li> I have had problem nails for most of my life.  </li>
            <li> My nail continues to be healthy looking</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it even though my nails are healthy now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would have performed even better.</li>
            <li> I can now keep my nails the length of most acrilics.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE USED IT FOR MANY YEARS AND HAVE HAD MANY COMPLIMENTS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I Love Nail Tek..</li>
            <li> you want three more words.</li>
            <li> I tried many products until if found Nail Tek.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy the 2 for 1 because who doesn&#x27;t like getting more for their money?</li>
            <li> I want to be able to wear nail polish all the time without having to give my nails a break.</li>
            <li> I though this product would help, but I still had to stop painting my nails for a week to let the staining get better.</li>
            <li> it could cause more damage instead of hardening my nails as supposedly........</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I always order the two for one deal which lasts longer and gives me more bang for my buck.</li>
            <li> Thank you to the many Amazon reviewers who steered me in the direction of this product.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Ordinarily, I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I save so many dollars.</li>
            <li> It took me a couple hours to feel better, and realize what had happened.</li>
            <li> LOL.. VERY DISSAPOINTED</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product.  </li>
            <li> have told many friends</li>
            <li> BUT...it&#x27;s been a while now, and my nails aren&#x27;t better.</li>
            <li> love this product</li>
            <li> Also a top coat of this product maintained nail polish without chips for days.</li>
            <li> You have saved my nails and my money : )</li>
            <li> I have many clients asking me for a product to help in the chipping and peeling of their nails.</li>
            <li> I LOVE free shipping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all Sally Hansen nail strengtheners and many others and also was taking some vitamins</li>
            <li> I have recommended these product to family and friends - who also love them.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t even return the 4 bottles that I bought because the shipping would cost me more than the product itself.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff</li>
            <li> both of my pinky nails are healthy</li>
            <li> I ordered more of this stuff</li>
            <li> I have to say that I&#x27;m quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Since, I&#x27;ve recommended to others with problem nails, and they&#x27;ve mentioned they love it too.</li>
            <li> And by November my nails looked fantastic!</li>
            <li> I was finally able to wear polish and no longer be embarrassed by my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok but formaldehyde and it seems to be drying out my nails.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, priced right, and very effective.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use polish, and I wondered whether the lack of polish made this product peel off more easily.  </li>
            <li> PLUS the brush easily separated from the top</li>
            <li> My nail are strong, natural and beautiful.</li>
            <li> If you have nails that are soft and /or peel, this stuff is great to cover them.  </li>
            <li> Good price for a product my nails really need.</li>
            <li> Good price, and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I will definitely order this one again the price was super and the product is excellent</li>
            <li> The Nail Tek was shipped by this vendor very quickly and in sturdy packaging.  </li>
            <li> Nails grow very quick if used once a day</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t as strong as with Nailtek</li>
            <li> It makes my nails strong and prevent cracking and peeling.  </li>
            <li> So far so good. :)</li>
            <li> and now people can not believe how strong they are.</li>
            <li> But be patient, it takes time to grow strong nails.</li>
            <li> But overall, this is not a bad product, not an incredible one either.</li>
            <li> nail.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a loyal fan of Nail Tek!</li>
            <li> Now, I have long, strong beautiful nails.  </li>
            <li> free</li>
            <li> Nail Tek is a great nail therapy that actually works to strengthen nails.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really smooth</li>
            <li> The great reviews and testimonials left for this product</li>
            <li> Seems cheap.</li>
            <li> and so far so good...</li>
            <li> It was a good deal getting 2 bottles for nearly the price of one bottle in retail stores.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, except for when I wore acrylics, I HAVE LONG, ATTRACTIVE NAILS!</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m 20 and my nails always look long and beautiful.</li>
            <li> So when I found this online for so cheap I was excited.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m looking at some pretty nice looking nails right now.</li>
            <li> After using constantly for 6 months, I was able to use just as a bottom and top coat when I used polish and it kept my nails strong</li>
            <li> Therefore, whenever I find a special on it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Nail Tek product before and was happy that the price for 2 bottles made the total price including shipping very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> This shiny, fast drying product helps keep my manicure for more than a week.</li>
            <li> This is just what I wanted and I cannot get enough of it at a good price.  </li>
            <li> This order met al expectations, and I&#x27;m about ready to order more.  </li>
            <li> My nails, which used to be thin and peeled easily, are now in the best condition that have ever been in.</li>
            <li> The shipment came quickly and meets my expectations.  </li>
            <li> It started working almost immediately, and a month later I am back to perfect nails.  </li>
            <li> Good quality nail polish lasts long.</li>
            <li> It really does make your nails strong.</li>
            <li> Easy use and reasonable priced.</li>
            <li> I was a nail biter for many years (25+) and WOW this stuff WORKS!</li>
            <li> its worth it</li>
            <li> It was not inconvenient at all adding another coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After too many years of acrylics I wanted to be natural.</li>
            <li> Time will tell as far as ordering more.</li>
            <li> but this always helps to keep them stronger and they look much better with a clear protective  coat on.</li>
            <li> Disappointed...didn&#x27;t do anything more than clear polish would have...would not recommend this to any one else.....</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s certainly worth trying.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;ve used NailTek intensive in the past when I purchased it at the spa in my country and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> perfect for my thin nails.  </li>
            <li> This is the best product to make your nails grow and not have to use false nails.  </li>
            <li> one day I noticed they were long, strong, healthy nails.  </li>
            <li> Was she ever right.  </li>
            <li> Took longer than expected to get here, but the product works pretty good</li>
            <li> She said this would make my nails much healthier, and she was right, too!  </li>
            <li> It is essential to apply it every day since you have strong nails!</li>
            <li> It really strengthens my nails, and while other products claim to do the same thing, I have found this one to be the best!</li>
            <li> She told me that anyone can have pretty nails if they use the right products.  </li>
            <li> Not only do I have long beautiful nails</li>
            <li> If your nails are soft and easy to split, try this.</li>
            <li> I use the Nail Tek foundation first (they are often pkg&#x27;d together) and that dries lightening fast, then I top with a coat of this stuff, the Nail Tek Intensive Therapy II clear coat.</li>
            <li> I do miss a day or two for sure, even though I keep the bottle right next to my chair in the evenings.</li>
            <li> but I found that the Nailtek by itself dries very fast.  </li>
            <li> AND I RECOMMENDED IT VERY MUCH</li>
            <li> I was surprised how quickly this product dries, too!</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase it in Wichita, but that isn&#x27;t close enough to be a viable option.  </li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I love it especially at the online price.  </li>
            <li> it really weakens my nails!</li>
            <li> I have been using Nail Tek for several years and absolutely love their nail polish.</li>
            <li> First of all, I want to mention that I purchased this from AllureBeauti</li>
            <li> Am overall pleased with this product and will continue to use the two bottles I have already purchased.  </li>
            <li> I also had these white spots on most of my nails.  </li>
            <li> First of let me start</li>
            <li> It was delivered promptly and I will most definately order this again, It is the only product that has helped me grow longer nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the first bottle</li>
            <li> you must use consistently to see results.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the added strength was from having the polish on</li>
            <li> I have paid much more in stores for the same product.</li>
            <li> Wish I didn&#x27;t have to come up with more items to reach the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; shipping, but that&#x27;s a personal problem...</li>
            <li> I am 72 and have pretty nails in just 3 months.  </li>
            <li> the first week i used this</li>
            <li> I can grow out my nails for the first time..</li>
            <li> The only things is that if you apply as a top coat, too, makes the drying time much longer</li>
            <li> not good alone, but great with nail armor</li>
            <li> My nails are now long and healthy.</li>
            <li> What a difference because now I have long, lovely looking nails that are stronger than ever.</li>
            <li> It was great and made my nails very durable, helped them grow, and didn&#x27;t take long to dry.</li>
            <li> The Shop price was more for a single bottle than the cost of our order for 2 bottles with shipping.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for few years and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I have seen significant growth in my nails although my nails on my left hand are much more harder and stronger than on my right hand.</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing that has been able to restore my weak peeling nails and made them strong and appealing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try if you have trouble keeping your nails from breaking and peeling, or just helping them grow to a nice natural length!</li>
            <li> My thumb &amp; index fingers, and large toenails (the most used) became soft and constantly peeled.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much time to spend on my nails</li>
            <li> and she really likes it.  </li>
            <li> It costs three times as much in salons...if you can locate one that carries the product.  </li>
            <li> This is also much cheaper than buying at a salon.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product repeatedly and really likes it.</li>
            <li> The whole damn thing .</li>
            <li> This stuff really works</li>
            <li> it makes my nails worse but this is great.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> really need to try to post a picture</li>
            <li> That was 48 hours ago, and already my nails are much stronger and even a bit longer.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> but use this stuff in a VERY well ventilated area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if its not the real thing.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a real pain to use it.</li>
            <li> but they were very brittle and and would always break</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t really notice it.</li>
            <li> My nails get really brittle some times and begin to splinter and peel.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions from Nail Tek, and it did make my nails much stronger.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Nail Tek and thanks to my friend.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product which have been very helpful.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Works very Well on brittle nails....</li>
            <li> Really works like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried before</li>
            <li> It makes them super strong so they break less and grow longer.</li>
            <li> Everyone wants to know what I have done to get them so long and strong.  </li>
            <li> I am sold on NailTek and will continue using this to keep my nails strong and long.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been years since my nails were this long and strong.</li>
            <li> For the record, I did not put any polish or any other treatment on top.  </li>
            <li> Every time I&#x27;ve used this I&#x27;ve achieved strong long nails!</li>
            <li> cause it drys so fast (unless it&#x27;s an older bottle, which can get sticky).</li>
            <li> I thought that the only way I could have nice, long nails was if I got acrylic or gel nails.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to improve their nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> My nails are longer and look pretty naturally.</li>
            <li> Not nasty, down to the bed, bite.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many products over the years to strengthen my nails and this is the only one that has actually worked.</li>
            <li> Then I moved to South Africa and ordered this particular item off Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY different nail strengthening treatments and have yet to find one that really does help, long term.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to everyone.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to everyone?  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super glossy, but has a semi-gloss appearance, great on male or female nails.</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> It would be so easy for them to resolve it, as I see they have done with one other customer in their feedback section.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews for products</li>
            <li> regimen now: Religiously wearing gloves whenever using my hands under water (for instance, doing dishes or washing my hair,) and applying a fresh coat of this every two days.</li>
            <li> I found that my own natural nails were now soft and uneven.</li>
            <li> and I assure you I am very careful with my nails, using good topcoats and wearing rubber gloves for every task with water other than bathing.  </li>
            <li> I now have very long strong nails that at times I have to cut back because they are growing so fast.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind investing a little time daily to keep my nails nice</li>
            <li> I completely remove the product every ten days or so and apply a fresh new coat.</li>
            <li> While this is a good price for this product, and is advertised as a major treatment for weak nails, it didnt live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nail Tek Therapy II for several months and I now have long, strong nails.</li>
            <li> The first order came back and it worked just like she was used to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Given the nature of online retail I have no idea now if the &amp;#34;good stuff&amp;#34; is the old formula or the new formula.</li>
            <li> I luv the product but certainly was surprised at how tiny these bottles are</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month and it has significantly reduced the peeling and splitting that has been having nice nails almost impossible.  </li>
            <li> The bottles have a purple  tent to them now instead of clear?</li>
            <li> Having had acrylic nails for years and decided that I really wanted to go &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34;  I purchased this product after reading several reviews on Amazon, as I knew that I would need something to strengthen and build up my natural nails again.  </li>
            <li> I started using this clear polish to protect my nails from splitting and chipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li> Item works very well, and I have bought it several times.</li>
            <li> It really works, but you have to use it daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considered \\&quot;thrifty\\&quot; and only use products that really work.</li>
            <li> I wear my natural nails and have been since I started using NailTek II.</li>
            <li> not so much with length but an overall appearances.</li>
            <li> Within 24 hrs the polish had completely worn off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a seller issue or if the product has changed completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had soft nails that bent and cracked.</li>
            <li> Daughter has long nails for the first time.</li>
            <li> Since using this there is a complete change in my nails.</li>
            <li> I have natural nails.</li>
            <li> It takes up to a month to completely seal your nails</li>
            <li> This Nail Tek formula really helps bring them back to life and reinforce my nails.</li>
            <li> but still too early to judge.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 92 year old mother who has been using this product for years to strengthen her nails and swears by it.  </li>
            <li> I bought Nail Tek Intensive Therapy 11 for soft, peeling nails.  </li>
            <li> Wow...</li>
            <li> so then to dive completly in the world of natural nails</li>
            <li> i didnt notice much plus the polish seemed to peel off but kept with it the second week my nails seemed to thrived now</li>
            <li> Not a little.</li>
            <li> so I started using it every other day on my nails, over clear polish or colorful polish.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed as I bought so many because of the good price.</li>
            <li> I usually just wear them clear with the NailTek, or a very light cream or pink color.  </li>
            <li> Nail Tek ll that I&#x27;ve used in the past dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li> My daugter in law suggested I uses this product after I was told by my manicurist that I must not put any more polish on my nails for six months as they are so weak and flakey.  </li>
            <li> I had consistent broken nails and now they are strong and long</li>
            <li> The only downfall is if you do not put on at least one coat per day it does peel off, so you do need to spend 5 or 10 minutes a day on yourself, (Nail Tek dries in just minutes) but it is well worth it!!</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get it to stay on my bare nails.</li>
            <li> It hardens and grows short, soft, and brittle nails.</li>
            <li> Was surprised that they weren&#x27;t in individual boxes.</li>
            <li> but they are stronger even bare.  </li>
            <li> Apparently I missed the part where it said it contained formaldahyde.  </li>
            <li> now have a natural French manicure because  of this stuff!  </li>
            <li> not sure if I got the full strength product...</li>
            <li> It really helps my thin nails grow strong and long, which never had before.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really does work like magic, especially if you are growing your nails out after having artificial nails or wash your hands too frequently.</li>
            <li> Usually, I can maintain a full set of natural nails, but for some reason a month or so ago, several of them broke off on the same day.</li>
            <li> I have tried it in the past without success but thought I would try it again.</li>
            <li> Am hoping that in time my nails will be a little stronger and much healthier looking.  </li>
            <li> I have huge issues with my nails; they are thin and always peeling like an onion.</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 months before writing this review and found it performed no better then a much cheaper product .</li>
            <li> My whole life I have dealt with weak, soft nails that tear and peel.  </li>
            <li> One thing that helps is to also coat the underside of the nail, once they get long enough.</li>
            <li> My nails were nice, but weak so as soon as they grew out a little, I would bite them off, then file them down.  </li>
            <li> I was a hardcore nail biter for as long as i can remember (bloody fingers, red skin, hangnails and all that good stuff)</li>
            <li> My nails used to peel and I could not have them long as I would like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been chewing my nails for as long as I could remember.  </li>
            <li> As long as the product stays on my nails, it protects them.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the box I realized both bottles had a strange purple tint to it, as seen below.</li>
            <li> I have always had long growing nails</li>
            <li> Quite strange.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with nails tearing for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time since removing acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> It takes so long to dry, even if I do my nails 6 hours before bed, they get messed up overnight.</li>
            <li> but they do not seem to be the same as other Nail Tec I have bought elsewhere...</li>
            <li> But short, and never pretty.  </li>
            <li> recommended this product to my other sister, who now uses it, and I mentioned it to my mom recently so she may be a user soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product a very long while.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about reapplying every day because of the time waiting for the stuff to dry</li>
            <li> my cuticles didnt dry like some people said</li>
            <li> I like to use it as a base coat and top coat, and it wears nicely as a clear polish in between colors.</li>
            <li> I started using it immediately, and have not had a single break or tear in any of my nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even found that if I&#x27;m lazy after I&#x27;ve removed the product, I can go a couple of days product-free because my natural nails are now stronger even when they&#x27;re \\&quot;naked!\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once putting it on my nails the product seemed super thin and different then usual.</li>
            <li> There was something strange about the formula, it never dried hard and was &#x27;gloppy&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Now my nails are so long that I have to regularly cut them down!</li>
            <li> My nails were in pretty bad shape and using the Nail Tek Intensive Therapy II really strengthened them and kept them from peeling and cracking.  </li>
            <li> I have weak nails and Nail Tek has really helped to improve their condition.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this and it has not seemed to help my nails even a little bit.</li>
            <li> But I have a hard time putting a clear coat of polish on each day.</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely does what it says, but I had trouble with it peeling off within 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> I used it a few years ago and my nails not only grew longer, but they were healther and stronger.</li>
            <li> My problem was once a nail started to tear or get rough, I&#x27;d have to chew it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few hours  I begin the entire process again.  </li>
            <li> I have been having trouble with my nails splitting for the last couple of years.  </li>
            <li> and I was too rough on them.  </li>
            <li> It makes my nails brittle and flaky such that the edges get damaged from everyday tasks like peeling off stickers and opening microcentrifuge tubes (I&#x27;m a biologist).  </li>
            <li> The actual nail growth is slow, but the daily application of the polish does stay in place, and does not wear out or peel off which I like.  </li>
            <li> But, after using this product for a very few months, the free edge of all my nails is at least 1/4\\&quot; long -- extending past my fingertips -- and I even have to file them down to keep them from getting too long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The polish peeled within hours of application and needed to be completely re-done at least every other day as opposed to every 5 days as they suggest per the label.</li>
            <li> I have tons LESS issues as long as I keep the product on my nails, protecting them.</li>
            <li> They are weak, thin and break so easily.</li>
            <li> Apparently I&#x27;m not good enough to receive such a response, even though I think I&#x27;ve purchased from them 3 separate times</li>
            <li> than if you use any other nail product.  </li>
            <li> When I used this product for the first time, I became drowsy, groggy, and was stumbling like I was drunk.</li>
            <li> I had a few breaks in the beginning, but that was probably because I wasn&#x27;t used to having long nails</li>
            <li> After a couple of months, my nails are noticably harder and the splitting problem is gone!  </li>
            <li> I agree with the other raters that you need 5 minutes each day to either re-apply or add a coat, a small price to pay to get my nails back.</li>
            <li> Mine are so soft that they usually rip before growing past the skin on my finger.</li>
            <li> The bottle is shaped different than the store bought ones, maybe it&#x27;s just clear polish in fake bottles.</li>
            <li> She also had soft, weak nails and</li>
            <li> Tried it again a couple of months ago and finally nails r getting hard and growing.</li>
            <li> not worth the time it took to even order it</li>
            <li> I use the Stickey base coat after wiping my nails with an alcohol wipe, OPI polish, and this product on top.</li>
            <li> She told me I needed to \\&quot;feed\\&quot; my nails and used this polish on my nails as a base coat and a top coat.  </li>
            <li> This base coat did seem to thicken my nails a bit, but I&#x27;m not so sure about protecting against staining my nails.</li>
            <li> I apply it as both a base and top coat</li>
            <li> Had cut my nails completely down but can see the growth in the six days I&#x27;ve been using the nail tek.</li>
            <li> It did not let me down.  </li>
            <li> My nails were always hard until the last few years</li>
            <li> Usually when I use Nailtek it starts working within a few days and after a month I have 10 long</li>
            <li> I put a coat on every day, which is less hassle than it sounds</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d not recommend this as a cure or hope for improving weak nails, only as a typical basecoat and honestly not worth the price.</li>
            <li> talk about a mess.</li>
            <li> As long as I use it I have nails that extend a little bit at least, don&#x27;t peel and break as often.</li>
            <li> When I stopped using it my nails went back to being weak.</li>
            <li> The only disappointment I had was that this double pack did not come as pictured.  </li>
            <li> You use it everyday and nails grow</li>
            <li> They have completely ignored all 3 of my emails, and they fail to provide a phone number on the packing slip AND on the web site I found for them.  </li>
            <li> When the acrylic was gone my nail had grown out and was not split but still very fragile and thin.  </li>
            <li> My nails were on the thin side before using this (which is why I bought it), but afterwards they started splitting and actually flaking off, which has never happened to me before.  </li>
            <li> A 50 MILE ROUND TRIP TO A SHOP THAT SELLS THIS.  </li>
            <li> This does harden the nails but it chips after a few days of applying...</li>
            <li> your nails will be renforced in few days, after application.</li>
            <li> My nails were damaged, thin and constantly split once I stopped wearing acrylics.</li>
            <li> It is thin and the brush is smaller.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years.  </li>
            <li> I use Nail Tek everyday and it has done the job.</li>
            <li> I have had some chipping still but will update again in a few months.</li>
            <li> It takes some time but the results are visible already in a few days.</li>
            <li> I had Chemo treatments in 2009 and my nails fell out and were so unhealthy afterwards; nail tek got them back to where they were before treatments!!!</li>
            <li> I remember I quit biting in July and applied Nail Tek everyday.  </li>
            <li> few years ago I went to a salon and had an acrylic nail put on just the one nail since it was impossible to keep it from splitting further and further.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this time, it was not Nail Tek II in the bottles, but ordinary, clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> All my life my nails have been very weak and peeling -- and consequently, short.</li>
            <li> and if I weren&#x27;t as lazy as I am</li>
            <li> I usually did four because I like changing my color.  </li>
            <li> but I went on my usual routine.</li>
            <li> Have tried others and wasted money will not do that anymore!</li>
            <li> No more acrylics for me.</li>
            <li> No more peeling.  </li>
            <li> I promptly returned it when I read the small print - had to use my reading glasses and a magnifying glass to see the warning:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to see if the spa where I usually purchase it has some in stock and buy a bottle there.</li>
            <li> but my nails ended up chipping and cracking as usual.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I did not appreciate people who sell poor quality products for less $$......</li>
            <li> It is hard to find Nail Tek in my area.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hard on my hands too.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed because I use a lot of Nail Tek products, but I&#x27;m considering staying far away from this one, unless I buy elsewhere and try it once to see if I have the same problem.</li>
            <li> My nails are now hard and no longer peel or crack.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it consistently for a month and my nails are still weak and breaking from the base.</li>
            <li> I am not happy I have ordered in the past with no problems.</li>
            <li> One can only assume that the formulation changed at some point, or there&#x27;s some incredibly bad batch quality control issue.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to have acrylic nails - they are expensive and really destroy your nails underneath.  </li>
            <li> NOT A GOOD DEAL  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nail Tek Intensive Therapy II for years on my thumb nail that has a split down the center of my nail about halfway to the base.  </li>
            <li> Both of us have weak and peeling nails, and she says it is helping her nails be stronger.  </li>
            <li> It works wonders on weak nails</li>
            <li> My nails were dry and ridged--really getting ugly.  </li>
            <li> If the product I buy there works as expected then I probably got a bad batch or something.</li>
            <li> Eventually, the artificial nails began to feel irritating and heavy, so i removed those.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a week, and my nails just got worse.  </li>
            <li> The only inconvenience is that Nailtek peels off in just a couple of days and doesn&#x27;t hold well any nail polish when used as a base coat.</li>
            <li> I left a bit doubtful that this would work but decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> My nails were razor thin and would peel and break...</li>
            <li> I can now wear nail polish without worrying that my nails will split leaving me with ugly half painted nails.</li>
            <li> they are hard as rocks!!</li>
            <li> I found myself a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have 30 minutes to sit still for a thin coat!</li>
            <li> They crack and peel if you look at them wrong.</li>
            <li> That was weird</li>
            <li> I buy it for a lady who is unable to get out to buy for herself.  </li>
            <li> The nail treatment itself was very thin and didn&#x27;t seem like the product I&#x27;d used before.  </li>
            <li> I had very thin peeling nails</li>
            <li> I have very thin, flaky nails</li>
            <li> I had accidentally over buffed my nails making them very thin.  </li>
            <li> What a dramatic difference just two coats of this made for my nails!</li>
            <li> I got my acrylic nails taken off and was appalled by how weak my nails were.</li>
            <li> I was desperate.  </li>
            <li> i compensated by using artificial nails for a week.</li>
            <li> Tiresome!</li>
            <li> if Nail Tek changed their formula, I got a bad batch, or if this was something else altogether.  </li>
            <li> I have bad vision, so I tend to get up close to my nails when I polish them.</li>
            <li> If your nails are as bad as mine were, what have you got to lose?</li>
            <li> My nails were NEVER as hard as they are now that I use nail tek!!!!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.     C. Dixon</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The instructions say to paint your base coat with Nailtek, use the color</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> A nail salon technician intoduced me to Nail Tek when I said that I have awful nails</li>
            <li> It has been awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nail Tek ll that I&#x27;ve used in the past dries pretty fast. This is still tacky 30 minutes later. I don&#x27;t have 30 minutes to sit still for a thin coat!</li>
            <li> My nails used to split and break.  This product is wonderful.  You use it everyday and nails grow and I don&#x27;t have to have to go to the beauty shop for good nails.</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely does what it says, but I had trouble with it peeling off within 24 hours.  I don&#x27;t have much time to spend on my nails and I don&#x27;t use polish, and I wondered whether the lack of polish made this product peel off more easily.  I gave it to my daughter who uses polish all the time and she really likes it.  Both of us have weak and peeling nails, and she says it is helping her nails be stronger.  So, I recommend it for people who spend time on their nails and use polish.  I just couldn&#x27;t get it to stay on my bare nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product a very long while.  It costs three times as much in salons...if you can locate one that carries the product.  It does the job and then some!  Have passed this proven product on to friends and they say the same...FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> This stuff is ROCKIN!!! It really does make your nails strong. Mine are so soft that they usually rip before growing past the skin on my finger.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I used it a few years ago and my nails not only grew longer, but they were healther and stronger. I would recommend this product for all to try.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.     C. Dixon</li>
            <li> A co-worker turned me on to Nail Tek products. I was a nail biter for many years (25+) and WOW this stuff WORKS! Not only do I have long beautiful nails they are hard as rocks!! You will not be disappointed. 2 for the price of 1, good luck finding that price in a salon/store. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. The only downfall is if you do not put on at least one coat per day it does peel off, so you do need to spend 5 or 10 minutes a day on yourself, (Nail Tek dries in just minutes) but it is well worth it!!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for about one month now and so far so good...Nails are not chipping and they seem to be stronger. I do apply it daily and I&#x27;m sure that helps with the good results I am having...Will stick with Nail Tek and see what the coming months bring...A happy buyer!</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this product. It works! Don&#x27;t stop using it, however, or your nails will return to their former state.</li>
            <li> I would love to review this item, because I&#x27;ve purchased it before (and love it), but Nail Beauty 4U sent me the incorrect item.  They have completely ignored all 3 of my emails, and they fail to provide a phone number on the packing slip AND on the web site I found for them.  Obviously, they do not want to be contacted by their paying customers.  I am filing a dispute with Amazon.  It&#x27;s a shame, because it&#x27;s a simple exchange, which is the SIMPLEST of incorrect order situations.  It would be so easy for them to resolve it, as I see they have done with one other customer in their feedback section.  Apparently I&#x27;m not good enough to receive such a response, even though I think I&#x27;ve purchased from them 3 separate times (I would have to check the orders, but I&#x27;ve ordered the nailtek II product twice before).  Way to treat a customer like garbage, Nail Beauty 4U.&lt;br /&gt;Get this product from a different seller, whatever you do. I am posting this so that others can save themselves the hassle, and because no company who treats customers this way should go off the hook. I will put this information everywhere I possibly can.</li>
            <li> I have yet to make it through the entire 7 day regime because the product peels off the third or fourth day.  I don&#x27;t mind investing a little time daily to keep my nails nice but I don&#x27;t want to start over from scratch mid-week.  Rejuvacote works better for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks, and my nails are actually growing and not splitting anymore.</li>
            <li> Great stuff superb[[ASIN:B0019XZ57U Nail Tek Intensive Therapy II Buy 1 Get 1 free \\&quot;.5x2 oz\\&quot;]] product and deal from Amazon</li>
            <li> not good alone, but great with nail armor</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST nail therapy I&#x27;ve ever used.  Recommended to me by a manicurist, I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  It works wonders on weak nails and once I began to use this, I was able to grow nails I was proud of.  I didn&#x27;t want to have acrylic nails - they are expensive and really destroy your nails underneath.  So THIS was my answer!  My manicurist recommended to add a coat each day for several days.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Item works very well, and I have bought it several times. It really strengthens my nails, and while other products claim to do the same thing, I have found this one to be the best!</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful for soft and peeling nails.  This is also much cheaper than buying at a salon.  Use this as directed and your nails will be stronger and longer than if you use any other nail product.  I am sold on NailTek and will continue using this to keep my nails strong and long.</li>
            <li> I have had problem nails for most of my life.  I have been using this product for a month and it has significantly reduced the peeling and splitting that has been having nice nails almost impossible.  It is hard to find Nail Tek in my area.  I was able to purchase it in Wichita, but that isn&#x27;t close enough to be a viable option.  I turned to my best friend on the internet - Amazon - and was able to purchase a new supply.  The shipment came quickly and meets my expectations.  If you have problem nails, give it a try.</li>
            <li> This product is good always helps strengthen my nails!</li>
            <li> Amazingly, this product works. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> A very good product that delivers a good value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nail Tek Intensive Therapy II for years on my thumb nail that has a split down the center of my nail about halfway to the base.  I brush a coat or two on every day and it protects and strengthens my nail to help prevent it splitting further.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wear nail polish because it tends to make my nails break off but Nail Tek Intensive Therapy II doesn&#x27;t affect my nails like regular polish does.&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago I went to a salon and had an acrylic nail put on just the one nail since it was impossible to keep it from splitting further and further. I kept the acrylic thing going for about a year and decided that was enough.  When the acrylic was gone my nail had grown out and was not split but still very fragile and thin.  I started back with daily application of the Nail Tek Intensive Therapy II and have continued to use it faithfully.  My nail continues to be healthy looking and I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed of a split nail.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a loyal fan of Nail Tek!</li>
            <li> I love the deal of getting two for one, MUCH better than in stores! I dont think that the product did anything to specifically help my nails, but I still use it as a basecoat in the rotation from time to time to prevent staining.</li>
            <li> I  LOVE this product! I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and it does make a lot of difference! My nails used to peel and I could not have them long as I would like. My nails are now long and healthy. NailTek makes the best natural nail products ever! Plus the top coat that comes along in the pack will make your color last so much longer, I like polishing my nails every week, but now I do it just because I want to vary the colors, not because the color is all chipping and ugly. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! It really works!</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing that has been able to restore my weak peeling nails and made them strong and appealing.  It really works, but you have to use it daily.</li>
            <li> My beautician daughter turned me on to this.&lt;br /&gt;I have use it for several years now. recently ordered more.&lt;br /&gt;makes MY nails grow quicker than if i dont use it. sometimes&lt;br /&gt;i get aggravated because i have to file so often. its worth it&lt;br /&gt;to have nice nails.&lt;br /&gt;now i need to work on my cuticles. talk about a mess.</li>
            <li> Great buy! Only time will tell if it actually works.</li>
            <li> I have had peeling and breaking nails for the last couple of years.  I have tried all kinds of products purchased at the store with no luck.  For some reason I ran across this nail product when purchasing something else from Amazon.  I thought why not, I&#x27;ve alredy tried everything else and nothing worked to fix my nail problem.  I must say it was a couple of weeks and I began to notice a difference in my nails.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple months now and all I can say is it is amazing.  I now have very long strong nails that at times I have to cut back because they are growing so fast.  I don&#x27;t normally write reviews for products but this is truely an amazing product. It will fix your peeling/breaking nails if you follow the directions.  I will continue to use it even though my nails are healthy now.  I would highly recommend this product to everyone.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. :)</li>
            <li> I had heard rave reviews from several persons in regards to this product. I found myself a little disappointed. The polish peeled within hours of application and needed to be completely re-done at least every other day as opposed to every 5 days as they suggest per the label.</li>
            <li> If you have nails that are soft and /or peel, this stuff is great to cover them.  It adds strength and if you use it as per directions, your nails will no longer catch on things or tear.  I love it especially at the online price.  At a store is is 3 x the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Nail Tek product before and was happy that the price for 2 bottles made the total price including shipping very reasonable.  The Nail Tek was shipped by this vendor very quickly and in sturdy packaging.  I would purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> I work in a bar so I am constantly washing glasses/cleaning- it really weakens my nails! This product is a god send. It makes them super strong so they break less and grow longer. I was surprised how quickly this product dries, too! Within a matter of seconds you are good to go. I recommend this to all of my girlfriends!</li>
            <li> This shiny, fast drying product helps keep my manicure for more than a week. I use the Stickey base coat after wiping my nails with an alcohol wipe, OPI polish, and this product on top.</li>
            <li> Good price for a product my nails really need.</li>
            <li> Excellent product,does what it says on the packet! I had consistent broken nails and now they are strong and long</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on well. It&#x27;s not super glossy, but has a semi-gloss appearance, great on male or female nails. I use this product because I was a lifetime nail biter and this curbs the impulse.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nail Tek for several years and absolutely love their nail polish. I have weak nails and Nail Tek has really helped to improve their condition. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Results as advertised.</li>
            <li> This has been working fairly well.  My nails are still having problems with splitting, but they are growing faster.</li>
            <li> I have huge issues with my nails; they are thin and always peeling like an onion. Tiresome! I like this stuff the best (and believe me when I say I&#x27;ve tried Everything) for keeping my nails from peeling too much. I use the Nail Tek foundation first (they are often pkg&#x27;d together) and that dries lightening fast, then I top with a coat of this stuff, the Nail Tek Intensive Therapy II clear coat. I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now and if I weren&#x27;t as lazy as I am I&#x27;m sure it would have performed even better. But I have a hard time putting a clear coat of polish on each day. I SHOULD, god knows, as my nails need all the defense they can get.They recommend a coat a day for maintenance and I can see how that would work brilliantly. I do miss a day or two for sure, even though I keep the bottle right next to my chair in the evenings. But this stuff DOES WORK and it works well. I have tons LESS issues as long as I keep the product on my nails, protecting them. I&#x27;m here to purchase more now! Recommended!</li>
            <li> Nail tek is the best nail therapy I have EVER used. It hardens and grows short, soft, and brittle nails. My nails were NEVER as hard as they are now that I use nail tek!!!! Great product.</li>
            <li> Great value.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Nail Tek is a great nail therapy that actually works to strengthen nails.  My nails wouldn&#x27;t grow for the longest time and a friend told me about Nail Tek so I started using it every other day on my nails, over clear polish or colorful polish.  What a difference because now I have long, lovely looking nails that are stronger than ever.</li>
            <li> This is just what I wanted and I cannot get enough of it at a good price.  Therefore, whenever I find a special on it I try and purchase it.  Delivered in a timely manner and product was just as described.</li>
            <li> I was desperate.  I&#x27;d been chewing my nails for as long as I could remember.  My problem was once a nail started to tear or get rough, I&#x27;d have to chew it.  I got this product and used it as instructed with a coat of color and after a few weeks use I noticed that my nails were longer because they had not broken and I hadn&#x27;t bitten them.  I can now keep my nails the length of most acrilics.  I&#x27;m hard on my hands too.  I recently switched to an OPI product and suddenly my nails were gone!  They weren&#x27;t as strong as with Nailtek so I switched back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to paint your base coat with Nailtek, use the color you like, and then apply Nailtek as the topcoat.  THEN you have to reapply every day for seven days and start over.  I usually did four because I like changing my color.  I was worried about reapplying every day because of the time waiting for the stuff to dry but I found that the Nailtek by itself dries very fast.  It was not inconvenient at all adding another coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been recommending this product to coworkers and friends.  (I also heard about it through recommendation myself.)  They have all experienced great results as well.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.It makes my nails strong and prevent cracking and peeling.  Without this product I would have very short brittle nails.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for few years and absolutely love it! I&#x27;m considered \\&quot;thrifty\\&quot; and only use products that really work. I wear my natural nails and have been since I started using NailTek II.</li>
            <li> I am not happy I have ordered in the past with no problems. But the last couple of orders are not drying on my nails don&#x27;t know if they changed something in product or not. The bottles have a purple  tent to them now instead of clear?</li>
            <li> This is the best product to make your nails grow and not have to use false nails.  Nails grow very quick if used once a day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used NailTek for several years after my hairdresser recommended. As long as I use it I have nails that extend a little bit at least, don&#x27;t peel and break as often.</li>
            <li> First of all, I want to mention that I purchased this from AllureBeauti so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the product or the seller in this case.  I&#x27;ve used this in the past and really liked it.  The bottles I received were not boxed, and their was a sticky substance on the caps.  The nail treatment itself was very thin and didn&#x27;t seem like the product I&#x27;d used before.  I don&#x27;t know if Nail Tek changed their formula, I got a bad batch, or if this was something else altogether.  I used this product for a week, and my nails just got worse.  For the record, I did not put any polish or any other treatment on top.  My nails were on the thin side before using this (which is why I bought it), but afterwards they started splitting and actually flaking off, which has never happened to me before.  I was very disappointed because I use a lot of Nail Tek products, but I&#x27;m considering staying far away from this one, unless I buy elsewhere and try it once to see if I have the same problem.</li>
            <li> GREAT VALUE AND SAVED ME A 50 MILE ROUND TRIP TO A SHOP THAT SELLS THIS.  I HAVE USED IT FOR MANY YEARS AND HAVE HAD MANY COMPLIMENTS.</li>
            <li> After too many years of acrylics I wanted to be natural. Years ago I tried nail trek but it didn&#x27;t work. Tried it again a couple of months ago and finally nails r getting hard and growing. I luv the product but certainly was surprised at how tiny these bottles are</li>
            <li> Nail tek delivered on time ( day earlier). Only applied to finger nails six days ago but apply a coat over colored nail polish each day. Had cut my nails completely down but can see the growth in the six days I&#x27;ve been using the nail tek. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Does wonders for your nails. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Order this twice for my wife. The first order came back and it worked just like she was used to. Strengthened her nails, they grew beautifully. Second order not so. There was something strange about the formula, it never dried hard and was &#x27;gloppy&#x27;. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time, and when I found this great bargain I could not pass it up.  Great buy</li>
            <li> Having had acrylic nails for years and decided that I really wanted to go &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34;  I purchased this product after reading several reviews on Amazon, as I knew that I would need something to strengthen and build up my natural nails again.  After almost 3 weeks of using it, I must say I DO like this product.  The actual nail growth is slow, but the daily application of the polish does stay in place, and does not wear out or peel off which I like.  Am hoping that in time my nails will be a little stronger and much healthier looking.  Am overall pleased with this product and will continue to use the two bottles I have already purchased.  Time will tell as far as ordering more. So far so good. :)</li>
            <li> I Love Nail Tek..It&#x27;s great for a top coat.</li>
            <li> If you use this produce as it says in the instructions you will have nice nails. I had very thin peeling nails and now people can not believe how strong they are.</li>
            <li> I coat my nails each night for 6 days, then remove it all on the 7th day.  I then moisturize copiously with Moon Valley Lotion Bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few hours  I begin the entire process again.  I&#x27;m 70 years and it&#x27;s been years since my nails were this long and strong.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this product. I will order it again when she uses this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK you want three more words.</li>
            <li> Nail Tek is a great product...got these at a wonderful price...but they do not seem to be the same as other Nail Tec I have bought elsewhere...not sure if I got the full strength product...</li>
            <li> This does harden the nails but it chips after a few days of applying... I use it as an over coat over a colored polish and by itself - same results...</li>
            <li> I have been having trouble with my nails splitting for the last couple of years.  This product has helped my nails grow longer and are now looking great and are really healthy.  Great stuff.  I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I have had problem nails for years! They crack and peel if you look at them wrong. I have tried MANY different nail strengthening treatments and have yet to find one that really does help, long term. I have friends who swear by this stuff! I have tried it in the past without success but thought I would try it again. As long as the product stays on my nails, it protects them. Problem is, my hands are in and out of water all day, so the product tends to peel part way through the day ... On the days I am not at work, my nails do feel stronger. I am currently alternating this product with another (Duri Rejuvacote Nail Growth System) to see if the combo helps ...</li>
            <li> Its greats for the price and I made it to my home so quickly which I was really happy about. I use it for some time to give a good review. I will say I do see big difference with my nails not so much with length but an overall appearances. They&#x27;re really smooth</li>
            <li> A manicurist introduced me to this product several months ago.  My nails were dry and ridged--really getting ugly.  I also had these white spots on most of my nails.  She told me I needed to \\&quot;feed\\&quot; my nails and used this polish on my nails as a base coat and a top coat.  She said to put on a coat every day and then remove the polish after ten days and start over again.  She said this would make my nails much healthier, and she was right, too!  I only have ridges on one nail now, and it&#x27;s continuing to get healthier.  I will continue to use this product so my nails won&#x27;t get in that condition again.</li>
            <li> Horrible! Causes peeling. Contains chemicals</li>
            <li> Nails showed immediate improvement.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product repeatedly and really likes it.</li>
            <li> While this is a good price for this product, and is advertised as a major treatment for weak nails, it didnt live up to the hype. I used it for 2 months before writing this review and found it performed no better then a much cheaper product . My maincures didnt last a week before chipping and I assure you I am very careful with my nails, using good topcoats and wearing rubber gloves for every task with water other than bathing.  I&#x27;d not recommend this as a cure or hope for improving weak nails, only as a typical basecoat and honestly not worth the price.</li>
            <li> your nails will be renforced in few days, after application. It is essential to apply it every day since you have strong nails!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a staple in my closet.</li>
            <li> My nails were always hard until the last few years and then they started to peel and crack.  I tried many products until if found Nail Tek.  My nails are now hard and no longer peel or crack. My techntician can&#x27;t believe how great they look every time I go for a manicure.</li>
            <li> First of let me start but saying I&#x27;ve been purchasing this product for years and I love it. I decided to buy the 2 for 1 because who doesn&#x27;t like getting more for their money? Upon opening the box I realized both bottles had a strange purple tint to it, as seen below. That was weird but I went on my usual routine. Once putting it on my nails the product seemed super thin and different then usual. Within 24 hrs the polish had completely worn off. Not a little. The whole damn thing . I don&#x27;t know if this is a seller issue or if the product has changed completely. Definitely won&#x27;t be buying again!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had soft nails that bent and cracked. Not now. I keep the bottle on the breakfast table and every three days apply another coat. I have great nails. Took only about three weeks to see the difference. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Took longer than expected to get here, but the product works pretty good and it was nice getting two for one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nail Tek II before and I&#x27;m still a fan.  It helps stop nail peeling.  You use it once a day for a week, remove it, start over.  It takes a while for the peeling to stop but it works.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This base coat did seem to thicken my nails a bit, but I&#x27;m not so sure about protecting against staining my nails. I want to be able to wear nail polish all the time without having to give my nails a break. I though this product would help, but I still had to stop painting my nails for a week to let the staining get better. But overall, this is not a bad product, not an incredible one either.</li>
            <li> Been a Nail tech fan for years.  Daughter has long nails for the first time.</li>
            <li> Cant find this product in stores here.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a last resort for my nails. They are weak, thin and break so easily. Since using this there is a complete change in my nails. they are growing faster, they are stronger and look great. I can not use regular nail polish it makes my nails worse but this is great.</li>
            <li> One layer applied to nails peels off I did not appreciate people who sell poor quality products for less $$......I just have them I don&#x27;t apply them to my nails it could cause more damage instead of hardening my nails as supposedly........</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work like magic, especially if you are growing your nails out after having artificial nails or wash your hands too frequently.</li>
            <li> Have always loved this product. Good buy!</li>
            <li> The best stuff for your nails in the world.</li>
            <li> See my review of XTRA Nail Tek treatment. That&#x27;s what you want.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nail Tek Therapy II for several months and I now have long, strong nails. You can&#x27;t beat this site for great service and a great price.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My polish will last over 5 -7 days with this stuff. I have natural nails.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that helps my problem nails.  It is easy to use, priced right, and very effective.</li>
            <li> Great nail repair, been using for years and will not try other nail products because this one is the best for me! Have tried others and wasted money will not do that anymore!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife as she had gotten Nail Tek at her Beauty shop and found it did a good job of protecting her nails from damage. She feels her nails are stronger and healthier. The Shop price was more for a single bottle than the cost of our order for 2 bottles with shipping.  She was very happy and I feel we got a good deal.</li>
            <li> This product really works. It was delivered promptly and I will most definately order this again, It is the only product that has helped me grow longer nails</li>
            <li> Used this product years ago, it does help my nails grow. It was a good deal getting 2 bottles for nearly the price of one bottle in retail stores. Was surprised that they weren&#x27;t in individual boxes.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I started using this product several years ago when I stopped getting acrylic nails.  My nails were in pretty bad shape and using the Nail Tek Intensive Therapy II really strengthened them and kept them from peeling and cracking.  It really is a wonderful product. I always order the two for one deal which lasts longer and gives me more bang for my buck. Ordering from Amazon is a breeze and the product is always packaged nicely and arrives intact.</li>
            <li> The great reviews and testimonials left for this product are so good that one might think they are planted, but believe me, everything is true! For the first time in my life, except for when I wore acrylics, I HAVE LONG, ATTRACTIVE NAILS! All my life my nails have been very weak and peeling -- and consequently, short. But, after using this product for a very few months, the free edge of all my nails is at least 1/4\\&quot; long -- extending past my fingertips -- and I even have to file them down to keep them from getting too long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My regimen now: Religiously wearing gloves whenever using my hands under water (for instance, doing dishes or washing my hair,) and applying a fresh coat of this every two days. I completely remove the product every ten days or so and apply a fresh new coat. I&#x27;ve even found that if I&#x27;m lazy after I&#x27;ve removed the product, I can go a couple of days product-free because my natural nails are now stronger even when they&#x27;re \\&quot;naked!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really need to try to post a picture -- I&#x27;m so proud of my nails!</li>
            <li> I wore acrylic nails for over 20 years. My nails were damaged, thin and constantly split once I stopped wearing acrylics. I us this product as instructed. My nails are longer and look pretty naturally. I&#x27;m extremely happy with the outcome. No more acrylics for me.</li>
            <li> Thank you to the many Amazon reviewers who steered me in the direction of this product. Wow!! What a dramatic difference just two coats of this made for my nails! Usually, I can maintain a full set of natural nails, but for some reason a month or so ago, several of them broke off on the same day. i compensated by using artificial nails for a week. Eventually, the artificial nails began to feel irritating and heavy, so i removed those. I found that my own natural nails were now soft and uneven. As they grew back, they kept ripping. I tried several of the products I already had in the house, in order to strengthen them, to no avail. And then my order of Nail Tek Therapy II arrived. That was 48 hours ago, and already my nails are much stronger and even a bit longer. I am so grateful!!</li>
            <li> I love the product.  Have been using it for over two years.  It really helps my thin nails grow strong and long, which never had before.  Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  I have very thin, flaky nails but this always helps to keep them stronger and they look much better with a clear protective  coat on.</li>
            <li> This stuff dorks great!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Does wonders for those of us with the flimsey nail syndrome.</li>
            <li> Disappointed...didn&#x27;t do anything more than clear polish would have...would not recommend this to any one else.....not worth the time it took to even order it</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products over the years to strengthen my nails and this is the only one that has actually worked. My nails, which used to be thin and peeled easily, are now in the best condition that have ever been in. I apply it as both a base and top coat and then for two days after a manicure I apply it again - this not only strengthens my nails but extends the life of the manicure - I am hooked!</li>
            <li> It is truly great.  My fingernails look really great.  I highly recommend it to everyone?  Buy it and test it it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Ordinarily, I love this product. Unfortunately, this time, it was not Nail Tek II in the bottles, but ordinary, clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> Have been buying them online for over a year now and I save so many dollars. I got two for the price of one! Good quality nail polish lasts long.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m writing this review to address some side effects. I have bad vision, so I tend to get up close to my nails when I polish them. When I used this product for the first time, I became drowsy, groggy, and was stumbling like I was drunk. It took me a couple hours to feel better, and realize what had happened. These are the side effects listed under the MSDS (Material Data Safety Sheet) I found online for Nail Tek. This may be obvious advice for those who regularly paint their nails...but use this stuff in a VERY well ventilated area.</li>
            <li> I have been using nail teak for a year and it is a wonderful product. I bought this product on amazon and it was wrapped in bubble wrap. No boxes. Color looked too purple. It is thin and the brush is smaller. Obviously not the same product. Does not have the same glossy shine. I suspect fraud. Very disappointed as I bought so many because of the good price.</li>
            <li> Purchased item as a gift for my sister,  she uses this product daily.. Product did not come in individual boxes as pictured,  came wrapped in plastic and one of the lids was lose so product spilled out during shipping.. NOT A GOOD DEAL  IF I CAN&#x27;T GIVE IT AS THE GIFT IT WAS INTENDED TO BE.. LOL.. VERY DISSAPOINTED</li>
            <li> I cannot give a opinion on this product..</li>
            <li> I was a habitual nail biter all my life.  My nails were nice, but weak so as soon as they grew out a little, I would bite them off, then file them down.  Not nasty, down to the bed, bite.  But short, and never pretty.  My sister recommended this product.  She also had soft, weak nails and one day I noticed they were long, strong, healthy nails.  I had a few breaks in the beginning, but that was probably because I wasn&#x27;t used to having long nails and I was too rough on them.  Now, I have long, strong beautiful nails.  I usually just wear them clear with the NailTek, or a very light cream or pink color.  I have been using this product for about 4 months and I don&#x27;t plan on stopping anytime soon.  I&#x27;m still on the first bottle and I use it religiously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this product to my other sister, who now uses it, and I mentioned it to my mom recently so she may be a user soon.</li>
            <li> I had accidentally over buffed my nails making them very thin.  One was splitting vertically on a regular basis.  I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product.  After a couple of months, my nails are noticably harder and the splitting problem is gone!  Even after not using the product regularly, the impact is lasting.</li>
            <li> I started using this clear polish to protect my nails from splitting and chipping. I reapply it regularly to protect my polish..</li>
            <li> have been using this product for 5 years, and have beautiful strong nails....have told many friends and they also approve of this product</li>
            <li> this product is great &amp; it strengthens your nails. you must use consistently to see results. i will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased and used this item from local salons for years. Every time I&#x27;ve used this I&#x27;ve achieved strong long nails! It&#x27;s just pricey. So when I found this online for so cheap I was excited. BUT...it&#x27;s been a while now, and my nails aren&#x27;t better. Nothing&#x27;s happening like it should. It&#x27;s as if its not the real thing. PLUS the brush easily separated from the top so it&#x27;s a real pain to use it. Seems cheap. The bottle is shaped different than the store bought ones, maybe it&#x27;s just clear polish in fake bottles. Just a guess.</li>
            <li> Nail Tek is the best therapy treatment for your nails.  Your nails will grow,  just keep on appling it for protection.  I&#x27;ve been using this product about 8 years now. My nails never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years.  It does help.  I did notice though, it&#x27;s not as great in the winter and my nail split.</li>
            <li> Product performed as described.  Cannot believe the difference in my nails.  No more peeling.  Also a top coat of this product maintained nail polish without chips for days.</li>
            <li> This product has been a miracle worker for me.  My whole life I have dealt with weak, soft nails that tear and peel.  I thought that the only way I could have nice, long nails was if I got acrylic or gel nails.  Nail Tek Intensive Therapy II has changed that and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  For three days I will put two coats on.  Then I remove it all and start over.  My nails are noticeably stronger and longer.  At first I thought the added strength was from having the polish on but they are stronger even bare.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to improve their nails.  Just try it.  If your nails are as bad as mine were, what have you got to lose?</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! My nails are stronger than ever, and growing longer. This is a great price, too. Almost a buy one get one deal when compared to big box retail stores. If your nails are soft and easy to split, try this.</li>
            <li> I have always had long growing nails but they were very brittle and and would always break so i had to get acrylic, gel or slik wraps on them to keep them from breaking, well not anymore. My nail are strong, natural and beautiful. I use Nail Tek everyday and it has done the job. Now i dont have to go to the nail salon anymore. Thank you Nail Tek. You have saved my nails and my money : )</li>
            <li> Apparently I missed the part where it said it contained formaldahyde.  I promptly returned it when I read the small print - had to use my reading glasses and a magnifying glass to see the warning:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to strengthen my nails not shorten my life.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for something to help my nails grow stronger.  I am on my second bottle of this and it has not seemed to help my nails even a little bit.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my daughter, and I like it.  I just can&#x27;t remember to put it on every day.</li>
            <li> I sell this product in my salon. I have many clients asking me for a product to help in the chipping and peeling of their nails. I&#x27;ve found this product works best for their needs. Easy use and reasonable priced.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now. I have seen significant growth in my nails although my nails on my left hand are much more harder and stronger than on my right hand. I have had some chipping still but will update again in a few months.</li>
            <li> This product really works. I got my acrylic nails taken off and was appalled by how weak my nails were. I bought this stuff. It works...but you have to keep putting it on. When I stopped using it my nails went back to being weak. It&#x27;s clear so you don&#x27;t really notice it. Would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> The best product I have ever used for strengthening nails. I use it almost every day.  I have paid much more in stores for the same product. Save your money and buy from this on-line store.</li>
            <li> Good product at a good price, what&#x27;s not to like? Wish I didn&#x27;t have to come up with more items to reach the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; shipping, but that&#x27;s a personal problem...I LOVE free shipping!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that I&#x27;ve used for years. It&#x27;s a staple for my nails that I use regularly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all Sally Hansen nail strengtheners and many others and also was taking some vitamins but nothing got even close to Nailtek by its efficacy. If your nails are peeling layers off like mine this product is for you! It takes some time but the results are visible already in a few days. The only inconvenience is that Nailtek peels off in just a couple of days and doesn&#x27;t hold well any nail polish when used as a base coat. But it looks very good as it is, just gives your nails a nice shine. I would recommend to apply  two coats and when it starts peeling off, remove it with regular nail polish remover and reapply another two coats. It takes up to a month to completely seal your nails but it&#x27;s certainly worth trying. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this item.  I buy it for a lady who is unable to get out to buy for herself.  You can not beat the price!  Great Value!</li>
            <li> I will definitely order this one again the price was super and the product is excellent It arrived on time and I am very happy with it</li>
            <li> My nails get really brittle some times and begin to splinter and peel. This Nail Tek formula really helps bring them back to life and reinforce my nails. I like to use it as a base coat and top coat, and it wears nicely as a clear polish in between colors. A friend of mine who worked in a salon recommended this product over 10 years ago, and I have been using it off and on ever since. It&#x27;s well worth the money and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This product is great for troublesome nails</li>
            <li> I have used Nail Tek products for years and find them to be so helpful.  This order met al expectations, and I&#x27;m about ready to order more.  I have recommended these product to family and friends - who also love them.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  A friend recommended it and promised I would see a difference in my nails after one month.  Boy! Was she ever right.  It did not let me down.  I followed the directions from Nail Tek, and it did make my nails much stronger.  I noticed a difference in my right hand in about two weeks and after a month both hands look great.  Everyone wants to know what I have done to get them so long and strong.  I tell them, &amp;#34;Nail Tek.&amp;#34;  It has been 2 months now and I have yet to break a nail.  Thanks Nail Tek and thanks to my friend.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;ve used NailTek intensive in the past when I purchased it at the spa in my country and it works beautifully. I&#x27;ve also bought it at Ulta&#x27;s and at a spa on a cruise ship. But for some reason the product that I bought here does not work at all. I&#x27;ve used it consistently for a month and my nails are still weak and breaking from the base. Usually when I use Nailtek it starts working within a few days and after a month I have 10 long nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even return the 4 bottles that I bought because the shipping would cost me more than the product itself. I&#x27;m going to see if the spa where I usually purchase it has some in stock and buy a bottle there. If the product I buy there works as expected then I probably got a bad batch or something.</li>
            <li> i have a feeling it has made my nails stronger but still too early to judge. The only things is that if you apply as a top coat, too, makes the drying time much longer</li>
            <li> My daugter in law suggested I uses this product after I was told by my manicurist that I must not put any more polish on my nails for six months as they are so weak and flakey.  I read the reviews on this product which have been very helpful.  I rodered the double pack and have used it as suggested.  I am very happy with how my nails are now growing, not flaking and appear to be stronger.  The only disappointment I had was that this double pack did not come as pictured.  The two glass bottles were well wrapped in bubble wrap but no boxes or directions. Quite strange. This is why I am giving only four stars.</li>
            <li> I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS STUFF, REACH BEFORE I WAS EXPECTING, GOOD PRICE AND I RECOMMENDED IT VERY MUCH</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 92 year old mother who has been using this product for years to strengthen her nails and swears by it.  That&#x27;s all I can say about it.</li>
            <li> A nail salon technician intoduced me to Nail Tek when I said that I have awful nails and I am ashamed to let anyones see my hands.  She told me that anyone can have pretty nails if they use the right products.  I bought Nail Tek Intensive Therapy 11 for soft, peeling nails.  I left a bit doubtful that this would work but decided to give it a try. I had been wearing acrylic nails for almost 2 years and my nails were like lissue paper.  I used as directed and within 2 weeks I started to see an improvement.  I was encouraged enough to go to Amazon&#x27;s Website and now I think I have bought almost every product they sell.  I am 72 and have pretty nails in just 3 months.  Thank you, Nail Tek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leigh Martin</li>
            <li> I started using nail tek in 2001 and it has done wonders for my nails!  They grow stronger and faster also they look healthy!  Always get compliments on my nails!  I had Chemo treatments in 2009 and my nails fell out and were so unhealthy afterwards; nail tek got them back to where they were before treatments!!! love love love!!!</li>
            <li> The key is daily use for a longer period of time. It is great because you can use it with any colored nail polish for your nails. I see a big difference in my nails since I have started using it. But be patient, it takes time to grow strong nails.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with nails tearing for as long as I can remember. At work, I am constantly having to use hand sanitizer, and wear nitrile gloves,which makes for brittle and peeling nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product 3 weeks ago, hoping, but not expecting, to see an improvement. I started using it immediately, and have not had a single break or tear in any of my nails. I can now wear nail polish without worrying that my nails will split leaving me with ugly half painted nails. Wow... LOVE this stuff</li>
            <li> i use to be series nail bitter.about 20+ years of nail bitting then with will power alone i stoped. so then to dive completly in the world of natural nails i grew my nails out both of my pinky nails are healthy no issues. but my thumbs and pointer fingers split peel and break. my middle fingers just peel. the first week i used this i didnt notice much plus the polish seemed to peel off but kept with it the second week my nails seemed to thrived now my cuticles didnt dry like some people said but i use vitamin oil, nail butter, and aveoplex oil to go. i started using it on my slpit damaged toe nail and order fondation to go with so will come back with an update.</li>
            <li> great buy. Fast shipping. Very pleased</li>
            <li> This works great. My nails have never looked this good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time since removing acrylic nails. My nails were razor thin and would peel and break... After using constantly for 6 months, I was able to use just as a bottom and top coat when I used polish and it kept my nails strong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying nightly and my nails have not looked this good in ages. I decided to just try applying regular gloss nightly to see if it&#x27;s just the idea of doing that every day but my nails ended up chipping and cracking as usual. I ordered more of this stuff and I&#x27;m looking at some pretty nice looking nails right now. I have found that this stuff seems to put a nice coating to the nails whereas the polish doesn&#x27;t seem to chip so that helps a lot. I have to say that I&#x27;m quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Good price, and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Great product!!!! Works very Well on brittle nails.... Delivered quickly!!!</li>
            <li> I never had nail problems until I started swimming.  My thumb &amp; index fingers, and large toenails (the most used) became soft and constantly peeled.  I had tried vitamin E oil (somewhat helpful for my toenails), when someone told me about Nail Tek.  It started working almost immediately, and a month later I am back to perfect nails.  I agree with the other raters that you need 5 minutes each day to either re-apply or add a coat, a small price to pay to get my nails back.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money! Wishe I could get  money back even Best formula would not stop splitting Thanks, Naomi</li>
            <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried - nails look great. Tried it after a recommendation from a manicurist. And it works. Since, I&#x27;ve recommended to others with problem nails, and they&#x27;ve mentioned they love it too. It&#x27;s worth a try if you have trouble keeping your nails from breaking and peeling, or just helping them grow to a nice natural length!</li>
            <li> I was a hardcore nail biter for as long as i can remember (bloody fingers, red skin, hangnails and all that good stuff) Then one day when I was 17 my sister bought me this as a gift. AMAZING! I remember I quit biting in July and applied Nail Tek everyday.  And by November my nails looked fantastic! I was finally able to wear polish and no longer be embarrassed by my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made my nails very strong which helped me from wanting to nibble at them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have a natural French manicure because  of this stuff!  Now I&#x27;m 20 and my nails always look long and beautiful. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Ok but formaldehyde and it seems to be drying out my nails.</li>
            <li> I used to buy something with this name from Sally Beauty supply while living in the USA. It was great and made my nails very durable, helped them grow, and didn&#x27;t take long to dry. Then I moved to South Africa and ordered this particular item off Amazon. It has been awful. It takes so long to dry, even if I do my nails 6 hours before bed, they get messed up overnight. It makes my nails brittle and flaky such that the edges get damaged from everyday tasks like peeling off stickers and opening microcentrifuge tubes (I&#x27;m a biologist).  One can only assume that the formulation changed at some point, or there&#x27;s some incredibly bad batch quality control issue. Given the nature of online retail I have no idea now if the &amp;#34;good stuff&amp;#34; is the old formula or the new formula.</li>
            <li> perfect for my thin nails.  I can grow out my nails for the first time..</li>
            <li> Really works like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried before and I have tried a lot of products&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best I&#x27;ve found after many years of experimentation. I put a coat on every day, which is less hassle than it sounds cause it drys so fast (unless it&#x27;s an older bottle, which can get sticky). Now my nails are so long that I have to regularly cut them down! One thing that helps is to also coat the underside of the nail, once they get long enough. I won&#x27;t go without this on my nails!</li>
