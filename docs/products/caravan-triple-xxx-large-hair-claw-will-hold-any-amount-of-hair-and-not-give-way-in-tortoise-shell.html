            <li>California weather -- this claw does the trick perfectly.</li>
            <li>Love it !!!!</li>
            <li>She says it&#x27;s the best hair clip she&#x27;s ever used.</li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m a believer :-D</li>
            <li>She says it is the best bun holder she has ever used.</li>
            <li>perfect to hold all of my hair while in the shower</li>
            <li>Will order more when I get the money !!!</li>
            <li>THE GREAT WORK</li>
            <li>Great hold.</li>
            <li>Shoulder length curly hair needs to be up and away in this very warm and humid</li>
            <li>The quality is also good and it doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy at all.</li>
            <li>This large claw is the perfect size for my dreadlocks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be putting this on my wish list in hopes of having spares to keep in the car and my purse, and for when the one I own breaks.  </li>
            <li>And very strong</li>
            <li>Paid 3 xs more than they were to purchase in store also.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this if You have a lot of hair:-)</li>
            <li>Even better than the bear claw.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair--lots of it.</li>
            <li>Please feel free to reply to this comment, if you have any questions.</li>
            <li>Most things just slide right out and the turtle clips,</li>
            <li>Also it is made of really good material and doesnt have the cheap spring that just flies out like so many other clips.</li>
            <li>It had potential to be good product</li>
            <li>Better for straight hair.</li>
            <li>Besides, this one is much cooler and stylish than the ones I was getting at the mall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>2 years ago I found a claw clip large enough to hold it if I was sure to put my hair in a neat ponytail, then twist and fold it just right, and hope that if I kept fairly still it would hold for the day.  </li>
            <li>This clip is too large to be comfortable.</li>
            <li>liked that this clutch is bigger and can hold lot of hair.</li>
            <li>Driving is not even fun.</li>
            <li>and yes it was totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Nice and big but broke 3 rd time arounf</li>
            <li>as  you can see  from the  photo, the  top  parts stick up pretty far, and the edges are not rounded.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll overlook that and give it five stars because it is the only clip I&#x27;ve ever found that will hold more hair than I</li>
            <li>The actual size appears to be quite similar to my favorite clip (the gold one in the photos) but the XXL clip just holds SO MUCH MORE hair.</li>
            <li>I was really on the fence about this clip because it was a teency bit pricy for one clip but it seemed worth it if it worked.</li>
            <li>There is much better and smaller clip that is also by Caravan.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been in your place--trying to buy a clip pretty much \\&quot;sight unseen\\&quot; over the internet--I tried to upload a bunch of photos so you can get an idea of what this clip is like before you buy it.</li>
            <li>It is the x-tra large claw clip.</li>
            <li>this clip is really too large for my hair...</li>
            <li>This is huge and the teeth are big and sharp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy, and the pins aren&#x27;t stressed from the amount of hair I have like the others were.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE September 24, 2015: I still have this clip and it has not broken.</li>
            <li>It can hold all my hair but it is very bulky and I noticed that with about a month of use (because of its bulk I do not use it very often)</li>
            <li>They should show a picture of it from the side so you could see what it really is.</li>
            <li>I have super thick wavy hair that most normal \\&quot;large\\&quot; clips just laugh at.</li>
            <li>I have my favorite clips I used to only find at Claire&#x27;s (!)</li>
            <li>I think the phrase &amp;#34;any amount of hair&amp;#34; is slightly exaggerated but its infinitely better than most.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of very fine hair long enough to sit on.  </li>
            <li>Normal size clips don&#x27;t hold my hair, so I thought I had a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li>It is so bulky that I only use it during cooking pretty much</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really is only suitable for people with super thick, super long hair.  </li>
            <li>They did not add gripping pins inside, its all plain plastic.</li>
            <li>This item is pictured to look like a bear claw type of clip, but it is a regular butterfly clip that happens to be very large.  </li>
            <li>When it comes time to order mom new clips I will be odering the triple x caravan claw again, in bulk.</li>
            <li>Just looking at it I actually thought it might be too big for my hair--and I&#x27;ll be damned--it pretty much is!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large enough that I can just bunch my hair up and clip it.  </li>
            <li>Dinged a star because this should be made clear to buyers.</li>
            <li>It sits far out from my head.</li>
            <li>it is very thick there is more than enough hair for this very large clip</li>
            <li>Normal clutch clips are usually not enough to hold all my hair.</li>
            <li>I wanted something bigger than normal clutch to hold them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;And ho-leeee cow they aren&#x27;t lying when they say this thing is XXX Large!</li>
            <li>But they made a major design mistake.</li>
            <li>It holds a lot of hair, but has a very high profile and minimal contact with the surface of the head to keep the clip from flopping from side to side.  </li>
            <li>However, it not only couldn&#x27;t reach around the twist, it slid right down.  </li>
            <li>She had used the Scunci extra large Bear claws for years as they were the only claws big enough to hold all her hair up in a bun.</li>
            <li>Made for people with super thick hair - otherwise the claw will dig into your skull</li>
            <li>It is rather large and sticks off the back of my head a few inches, but it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Holds securely but difficult to drive in as it sticks out quite far from the back of my head.</li>

            <li> Holds securely but difficult to drive in as it sticks out quite far from the back of my head.</li>
            <li> It is very big, and if you have hair that is not too thick it will fall right off.  </li>
            <li> so unless you have really long and super thick hair, this clip may not work for you.</li>
            <li> so I was excited when I read the review that said it could hold up very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really hold long and heavy hair, despite being big.</li>
            <li> The spring is small and does not seem to have so much tension on it that she is afraid to break it by opening it, as happens with so many claw clips.</li>
            <li> It holds loosely and flops over and loosens by the time I left for work .</li>
            <li> However they were discontinued and she was down to her last one.</li>
            <li> It holds my very long hair with ease!</li>
            <li> its HUGE and awkward.. sticks out three inches from your head..</li>
            <li> And by that, I mean there is NO way on earth they will hold all of my hair (even just pulling up the sides and clasping in the back) and if they do manage it, they likely break soon thereafter.</li>
            <li> I bought several of these for my daughter, who has very long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wobble or threaten to lose it&#x27;s grip like all of the other clips I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> She received them the other day and loves them.</li>
            <li> It should be said, however, that this is for people with THICK hair, not long hair.  </li>
            <li> Anyone else will find this extremely uncomfortable; there&#x27;s absolutely now way to keep it from just DIGGING into your scalp.  </li>
            <li> the description says it will hold any amount of hair, which isn&#x27;t technically the case since my thick hair wasn&#x27;t quite thick enough...</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> that will hold the hair up without pulling tightly on my hair .</li>
            <li> Initially it could hold my very thick hair up on my head it now falls down.</li>
            <li> Two others I ordered at the same time are both broken, but not this one.</li>
            <li> Maybe I can find someone with thin or regular hair that can use it.</li>
            <li> She says they produce ess pressure on her scalp and you can hardly see them when they are in.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s medium thick.  </li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> Hair claws that are plastic and stay on my thin hair are hard to find,this one fits great,just wish they were sturdier and lasted longer</li>
            <li> Was not good in any way.</li>
            <li> It appears to be made from very thick plastic, and should hold up well over time, avoiding common issues like broken teeth.  </li>
            <li> ]I try very hard to test all features before giving my unbiased opinion to users.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay in my very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> (Hair is VERY thick.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, needless to say, this isn&#x27;t quite the clip for me...</li>
            <li> it has proved potentially dangerous  to those who come too  close.  </li>
            <li> - My hair is difficult to clip but this &#x27;claw&#x27; is just gi-normous!  </li>
            <li> I hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have really thick hair. Normal clutch clips are usually not enough to hold all my hair. I wanted something bigger than normal clutch to hold them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked that this clutch is bigger and can hold lot of hair. The quality is also good and it doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy at all. But they made a major design mistake. They did not add gripping pins inside, its all plain plastic. Keeping in mind that it was designed to hold larger mass of hair, without any grip on insides, the clutch keeps falling off the hair!! It had potential to be good product otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**[...]I try very hard to test all features before giving my unbiased opinion to users. Please feel free to reply to this comment, if you have any questions.</li>
            <li> Was not good in any way. Does not hold my hair. It holds loosely and flops over and loosens by the time I left for work . Would not recommend to anyone who has any length or thickness of hair . Paid 3 xs more than they were to purchase in store also. Total of $16 with shipping.way overpriced under quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told I have enough hair for 3 people and this still manages to hold it all. Works as promised.</li>
            <li> This clip holds my curly hair up in a twist.  It is rather large and sticks off the back of my head a few inches, but it gets the job done.  I like it and use it a lot.</li>
            <li> kinda hurts. holds a ton of hair though</li>
            <li> NOW THIS HAIR  CLIP IS AMAZING! !!!&lt;br /&gt;THE BEST YET !!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine hair--lots of it. Most things just slide right out and the turtle clips, while staying put, have the same problem this one has and only last about 5 months. The problem? It sits far out from my head. Yes, all my hair fits in it and it seems to stay put, but I can&#x27;t rest my head back on anything with this in. Driving is not even fun. However, I have taken to use it while working on anything that requires my hair stay put. I&#x27;m still looking for the ultimate hair clip. Waiting for two others to arrive.</li>
            <li> This large claw is the perfect size for my dreadlocks.  And very strong so they stay put whenever I use the claw.  Its has become my every day go to</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay in my very thick hair. It sticks up on my scalp and then falls out.  I was looking for something to hold my hair, not fall out as soon as I put it in.</li>
            <li> Shoulder length curly hair needs to be up and away in this very warm and humid So. California weather -- this claw does the trick perfectly.</li>
            <li> WAY TOO BIG - My hair is difficult to clip but this &#x27;claw&#x27; is just gi-normous!  Be prepared</li>
            <li> I have a lot of very fine hair long enough to sit on.  2 years ago I found a claw clip large enough to hold it if I was sure to put my hair in a neat ponytail, then twist and fold it just right, and hope that if I kept fairly still it would hold for the day.  When that clip broke I decided to try this one out, even though the price seemed a bit high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh. My. Word!  I don&#x27;t need elastics, pins, or anything else with this clip!  It&#x27;s large enough that I can just bunch my hair up and clip it.  It doesn&#x27;t wobble or threaten to lose it&#x27;s grip like all of the other clips I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ll be putting this on my wish list in hopes of having spares to keep in the car and my purse, and for when the one I own breaks.  Although I don&#x27;t see that happening anytime soon.  It&#x27;s very sturdy, and the pins aren&#x27;t stressed from the amount of hair I have like the others were.</li>
            <li> When they said claw, they should have said CLAWWWWW!  This is huge and the teeth are big and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is only suitable for people with super thick, super long hair.  Anyone else will find this extremely uncomfortable; there&#x27;s absolutely now way to keep it from just DIGGING into your scalp.  I hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get a chance I&#x27;ll edit this and provide a side view picture.</li>
            <li> Better for straight hair. Gets a bit tangled in my curly hair. Holds securely but difficult to drive in as it sticks out quite far from the back of my head.</li>
            <li> Love it !!!! Will order more when I get the money !!!</li>
            <li> it will not stay put it falls out my hair goes to my backside and it is very thick there is more than enough hair for this very large clip but it will not hold i do not recommend buying this clip</li>
            <li> we have a family member with a LOT of  hair, and  this  definitely does the job.  HOWEVER.  it has proved potentially dangerous  to those who come too  close.  as  you can see  from the  photo, the  top  parts stick up pretty far, and the edges are not rounded.  so it works, but beware!</li>
            <li> Only hair claw I have used that will hold the hair up without pulling tightly on my hair . The claw stays in place also , that&#x27;s an A+ for m</li>
            <li> I have super thick wavy hair that most normal \\&quot;large\\&quot; clips just laugh at. And by that, I mean there is NO way on earth they will hold all of my hair (even just pulling up the sides and clasping in the back) and if they do manage it, they likely break soon thereafter. Octopus clips? No. Basic jaw clips? Never. I have my favorite clips I used to only find at Claire&#x27;s (!) but I can&#x27;t even find them there anymore, so when I saw this one, I had to try it. Besides, this one is much cooler and stylish than the ones I was getting at the mall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And ho-leeee cow they aren&#x27;t lying when they say this thing is XXX Large! Just looking at it I actually thought it might be too big for my hair--and I&#x27;ll be damned--it pretty much is! Just pulling up the sides like I mentioned before? The clip is WAY too big! If I use it to grab my entire ponytail in a twist it kinda fits--but is still almost too big!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, needless to say, this isn&#x27;t quite the clip for me...the description says it will hold any amount of hair, which isn&#x27;t technically the case since my thick hair wasn&#x27;t quite thick enough...but I&#x27;ll overlook that and give it five stars because it is the only clip I&#x27;ve ever found that will hold more hair than I have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been in your place--trying to buy a clip pretty much \\&quot;sight unseen\\&quot; over the internet--I tried to upload a bunch of photos so you can get an idea of what this clip is like before you buy it. The actual size appears to be quite similar to my favorite clip (the gold one in the photos) but the XXL clip just holds SO MUCH MORE hair.</li>
            <li> I bought several of these for my daughter, who has very long, thick hair. She says it&#x27;s the best hair clip she&#x27;s ever used.</li>
            <li> Hi have hair almost to my waist that&#x27;s medium thick.  Normal size clips don&#x27;t hold my hair, so I thought I had a lot of hair.  This clip is another story....this clip is really too large for my hair...so unless you have really long and super thick hair, this clip may not work for you.</li>
            <li> This is Big!!!! It holds my very long hair with ease! I would recommend this if You have a lot of hair:-)</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.  Thank you for prompt service.</li>
            <li> Made for people with super thick hair - otherwise the claw will dig into your skull</li>
            <li> I was really on the fence about this clip because it was a teency bit pricy for one clip but it seemed worth it if it worked. Got it today and yes it was totally worth it. I have long thick hair and it keeps it contained without falling. Also it is made of really good material and doesnt have the cheap spring that just flies out like so many other clips. I was on the fence but now I&#x27;m a believer :-D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE September 24, 2015: I still have this clip and it has not broken. Two others I ordered at the same time are both broken, but not this one. I still use it often.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my mother. She had used the Scunci extra large Bear claws for years as they were the only claws big enough to hold all her hair up in a bun. However they were discontinued and she was down to her last one. So this was the closest/largest claw I could find. She received them the other day and loves them. Even better than the bear claw. She says they produce ess pressure on her scalp and you can hardly see them when they are in. She is a fan! She says it is the best bun holder she has ever used. The spring is small and does not seem to have so much tension on it that she is afraid to break it by opening it, as happens with so many claw clips. When it comes time to order mom new clips I will be odering the triple x caravan claw again, in bulk.</li>
            <li> Hair claws that are plastic and stay on my thin hair are hard to find,this one fits great,just wish they were sturdier and lasted longer</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this does hold it, but its HUGE and awkward.. sticks out three inches from your head.. i never use it. Guess I&#x27;ll just stick with the clips not claws.</li>
            <li> I only rated this a two star because it is too bulky and the spring loosened with use. This clip is too large to be comfortable. It can hold all my hair but it is very bulky and I noticed that with about a month of use (because of its bulk I do not use it very often) the spring in the clip has loosened. Initially it could hold my very thick hair up on my head it now falls down. It is so bulky that I only use it during cooking pretty much just so I can get use out of it. There is much better and smaller clip that is also by Caravan. It is the x-tra large claw clip. It is terrific, holds lots of hair.</li>
            <li> This item is pictured to look like a bear claw type of clip, but it is a regular butterfly clip that happens to be very large.  They should show a picture of it from the side so you could see what it really is.</li>
            <li> Great hold. I always buy two in case one breaks. (Hair is VERY thick. I use it to hold my dredlocs back)</li>
            <li> The product arrived well packaged and on time.  It appears to be made from very thick plastic, and should hold up well over time, avoiding common issues like broken teeth.  It should be said, however, that this is for people with THICK hair, not long hair.  It is very big, and if you have hair that is not too thick it will fall right off.  Dinged a star because this should be made clear to buyers.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair so I was excited when I read the review that said it could hold up very thick hair.  However, it not only couldn&#x27;t reach around the twist, it slid right down.  Maybe I can find someone with thin or regular hair that can use it.</li>
            <li> Seriously? This thing looks like a rack of lamb sticking off the back of the head.  It holds a lot of hair, but has a very high profile and minimal contact with the surface of the head to keep the clip from flopping from side to side.  I&#x27;ll go back to the octopus clip I&#x27;ve been using for several months.</li>
            <li> I think the phrase &amp;#34;any amount of hair&amp;#34; is slightly exaggerated but its infinitely better than most.</li>
            <li> Nice and big but broke 3 rd time arounf</li>
            <li> perfect to hold all of my hair while in the shower</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really hold long and heavy hair, despite being big.</li>
