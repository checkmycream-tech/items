            <li> small enough to toss in my purse...love the smell.....one bottle leaks a bit but 2nd one i purchased is fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always concerned for buying perfume online. I checked it out to see if it had been tampered with or diluted. I was happy to see it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love the travel size mist. This fits perfect in my purse and the spray mist works without any problems.</li>
            <li> Smells just like the actual one from VS.  I bought a few, just in case i never find them again.</li>
            <li> We could no longer find this in the stores so when we found it on here we were excited! Great perfume by VS! This is my teens favorite! It is a light pleasant smell, not too strong. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a very sexy perfume!! It smells absolutely wonderful. It smells fresh, and sexy. I would definately buy more! I don&#x27;t regret buying this perfume. Victoria Secret makes some delish perfume, but this one is definately a good one!</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find &amp;#34;Gorgeous&amp;#34; on Amazon, since Victoria&#x27;s Secret has discontinued this fragrance. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Smells new.</li>
            <li> No, it was not the correct scent. It was falsely advertised.</li>
            <li> The perfume does not smell fresh. Smells off, like it has been sitting around for a while. Wish they still sold it in their store.</li>
            <li> Perfect condition, perfect travel size.</li>
            <li> Because my daughter brought the package in and I could smell some cheap, fake vanilla smell coming from the bag. I thought the contents had been spilled and thought &amp;#34;Please tell me that horrible scent is not what I paid for!&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;However, when I opened the package to investigate, everything was intact and the fragrance inside the bottle is very lovely.  Did someone play a little holiday prank on me? XD</li>
            <li> Has a nice sense of fragence and its small enough to carry any where. Its not to strong niether for me</li>
            <li> This product is &amp;#34;just okay.&amp;#34;  Next time, will plan to try fragrance at store prior to purchase.  Great pricing, however, makes it okay!</li>
            <li> Of course, Victoria Secrets products are always a superior item to purchase. Just mention the manufacturer&#x27;s name and that tells it all. I&#x27;ve always had great reviews of how good the perfume smells and excellent size to carry with you wherever you go. Thank goodness for Victoria Secrets</li>
            <li> This fragrance is very sexy men buy this for your women! You will forget about the night out and end up in the bedroom instead!</li>
            <li> Bought this from a friends recommendation and I love it. It has an awesome scent that is not too strong. thank you.</li>
