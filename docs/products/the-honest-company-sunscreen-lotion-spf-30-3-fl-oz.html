    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very impressed and will use it again!</li>
            <li>Protects great, and does not irritate skin!</li>
            <li>Its a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>It worked great!</li>
            <li>The spray that they sell is great as well!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the best sunscreen I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>The Honest Company deserves to be sued!!!</li>
            <li>I purchased this from Target in 2014 and the product was 20% zinc oxide and worked wonderfully!</li>
            <li>LOL!)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wonderful, but it seems risky.</li>
            <li>This stuff is actually amazing!!</li>
            <li>I was very good about reapplying on my kids every 2 hours in the sun</li>
            <li>I am a redhead with very fair skin.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen is incredibly oily.  </li>
            <li>When I needed sunscreen this summer, I was happy to see some on their site</li>
            <li>I just bought two containers of the Honest Brand sunscreen in July 2015 and it worked great for us!!  </li>
            <li>and I would hope pull it off the shelves till they greatly improve on it.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I had the impression that this is, rather them sunscreen, frying oil, at best.</li>
            <li>Everyone one else used Nutrogena and had great results.  </li>
            <li>I bought this brand at Coscto and thought it would be a great brand considering the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Great product, great sun protection.  </li>
            <li>When I saw it at Costco in a 2-pack, I happily bought it for the summer of 2015.</li>
            <li>On top of that, I got a sunburn!!</li>
            <li>it keeps me happy knowing it is from the Honest Company!</li>
            <li>I will never buy Honest Company products ever again!</li>
            <li>Also make sure to follow the directions on the sunscreen to reapply after a couple of hours to ensure best protection from burns.</li>
            <li>Shame on you Honest for not owning up!</li>
            <li>Honest needs to develop a safer sunscreen!</li>
            <li>I heard so many wonderful things about the &amp;#34;honest company&amp;#34; which is ran by Jessica Biel the girl from the Sin City</li>
            <li>I decided to buy the Honest company and wanted to protect my beautiful body from the sun...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a happy Honest customer for over a year.</li>
            <li>- Honest company stuff has great branding.  </li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t think it does a good job.</li>
            <li>Superior product with superior safety.</li>
            <li>And I think it is a good sunscreen on some levels.  </li>
            <li>I also have fair skin.</li>
            <li>he&#x27;s good to go.</li>
            <li>and blister?&lt;br /&gt;The honest sunscreen is great at protecting.</li>
            <li>what good is it if it doesn&#x27;t protect us?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s about as good as baby oil for preventing sunburn.  </li>
            <li>Everyone in my family has a fair complexion and we used this sunscreen at the pool with no issues.</li>
            <li>I am very  fair skinned and burn easily.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this  product and will buy again.</li>
            <li>love it!  </li>
            <li>Love the honest line!</li>
            <li>This is one u need to be able to put zero stars!  </li>
            <li>We love this sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Put more on and they came home with a sunburn!</li>
            <li>and I felt like going to check out the cute life guards (LOL IM GAY!)</li>
            <li>Sunny Babies is amazing.</li>
            <li>Everyone used honest sunscreen and continued to reapply the sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I am a research nut and find that this sunscreen does meet industry standards for an effective sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I so wanted to like this sunscreen and the Honest Company.  </li>
            <li>There is no way Jessica alba uses her own products on her kids or she would find this out</li>
            <li>( mind you, the spring in nyc kind of sun, we weren&#x27;t at the tropics or anything like that)</li>
            <li>I am bummed as I have heard so many good things about this company, too.  </li>
            <li>As always, the honest company does not disappoint.</li>
            <li>My kids also ended up burned after using Honest Co sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I have been an Honest Company customer for years.  </li>
            <li>I have NEVER had an issue with the Honest Company&#x27;s sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>The one who used Honest co. sunscreen is a LOBSTER, head to toe.  </li>
            <li>Honest company, you need to STOP selling this product.</li>
            <li>Shame on the honest company.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen by the Honest Company does not give me any reaction.  </li>
            <li>It was between honest company and badger sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I found the honest company in the store</li>
            <li>If you want a nice SUNBURN this is the product for you, purchase at costco and used 3x what was suggested and still burned my children......</li>
            <li>Thank you Honest Co.</li>
            <li>I honestly wondered iif it was a tanning lotion after that day.  </li>
            <li>Makes me never want to buy an honest brand item again.</li>
            <li>The spray we use by honest company is not greasy (but it&#x27;s even whiter).</li>
            <li>Honest Company</li>
            <li>I liked the Honest Company diapers, so I thought I could trust this brand.  </li>
            <li>I have been thrilled with all of them until today when I tried the sunscreen out on my family.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if you get a good batch</li>
            <li>Was happier with the honest sunscreen stick.</li>
            <li>Will probably not buy this honest cream sunscreen again.</li>
            <li>so the sun is very, very strong</li>
            <li>I love the Honest company</li>
            <li>When used as designed, this is an excellent natural product, in this mom&#x27;s opinion.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive and fair skin and this sunscreen works for me!!!</li>
            <li>I bought a two-pack at Costco on sale and was excited to use it on my toddler, since it is non-toxic and boasts an array of good stuff.  </li>
            <li>My family has experienced no allergies or other skin reactions, it doesn&#x27;t sting their eyes, and after three years of using Honest brand on my three children, we have experienced ZERO sunburns.</li>
            <li>apply the sunscreen as directed but more often then suggested because our children have very light skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He is 16 months and has very fair sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>One of my sons is very fair and the last sunscreen I used on him didn&#x27;t prevent him from burning, so today I put the Honest co. sunscreen on him and on myself again.  </li>
            <li>It is so greasy feeling, I should have known better.</li>
            <li>I end up needing to use more than I should.  </li>
            <li>She was at the beach in the sun for 4hrs, playing in the water for most of it with her dad, and had no issues.</li>
            <li>Plus, the south gets more sunshine throughout the year which helps maintain vitamin D levels.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ascetically appealing.</li>
            <li>and i seemed to get more burnt</li>
            <li>Bought a package from Costco, and I fell in love with it immediately.</li>
            <li>I researched this sunscreen based on EWG guidelines and it&#x27;s top suggestions.  </li>
            <li>When applied, it leaves a layer of sticky, greasy oil sitting on top of your skin.</li>
            <li>Will never buy this product again, and going back to Nutragena, who makes the best sunscreen out there in my opinion!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Love the brand and everything they stand for.</li>
            <li>It acts more like a suntan oil.</li>
            <li>I also like that it&#x27;s safe to use.</li>
            <li>Reapplied more than suggested.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I will be looking for another safe sunscreen and returning this one.  </li>
            <li>; then yes, this is an HONEST and accurate description of the product.  </li>
            <li>but we wore shirts and purchased a much better brand product and had no issues .  </li>
            <li>My husband now has blisters from the most severe sunburn he has ever had in his life</li>
            <li>Yes, not terribly but yes.</li>
            <li>How is anyone rating this more than one star???  </li>
            <li>Zinc oxide can clump together, so you have to make sure it&#x27;s on the skin evenly.</li>
            <li>Unlike most  sunscreens that say to reapply after 80 minutes, this needs to be reapplied after 45, which is why people may be getting burned.</li>
            <li>It applies easier and covers more skin.</li>
            <li>I was pleased when I saw the 2 pack at Costco and that it didn&#x27;t contain all the chemicals that I&#x27;m trying to avoid.</li>
            <li>However, I have been using it since the beginning of June and have been completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>We also made sure to reapply according to the directions.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work OK as the kids didn&#x27;t get burnt in the sun</li>
            <li>but I felt that I needed to apply it more often.</li>
            <li>She is outdoors most of the day during the summer, swimming in our backyard.</li>
            <li>I admire Honest Co for being so clean in their ingredients</li>
            <li>My 7 year old and baby has very fair Skinand would burn eAsily</li>
            <li>I have been using the Honest brand sunscreen for almost two years and it has worked excellent &amp; when I say that, I mean excellent for any sunscreen not just natural sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>My husband a kids all have fair skin and burn pretty easily.</li>
            <li>I use a variety of products from Honest, most of which including the sunscreen I purchase direct from Honest.</li>
            <li>I bought this sunscreen happy that it was &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, well it doesn&#x27;t feel natural when you put it on</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t burn easily, but can burn, so I bought this from Costco before going on vacation.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t burn so easily that lack of reapplying after 80 minutes would have resulted in the burn I had.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While this was easy to spread, it seems that the changes they made to the formula mucked something up.  </li>
            <li>It feels somewhat oily going on but seems to absorb very quickly and no longer looks or feels greasy soon after applying.  </li>
            <li>and they find it easy to rub in all by themselves.</li>
            <li>We are olive skinned and don&#x27;t easily burn.</li>
            <li>- More affordable than some of the other organic, non-toxic brands  Cons: - this stuff is INCREDIBLY greasy.  </li>
            <li>and she used used Honest Co. for the first time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a beautiful summer day here by the beach</li>
            <li>so my face was fine but my chest, shoulders, and neck are burned.  </li>
            <li>and it has worked fine.</li>
            <li>He was fine.</li>
            <li>After normal, generous application and triplicate re-application, I am currently bright red and will be extraordinarily happy if I don&#x27;t get blisters.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t white and soaked in great, so that I had to use a ton to cover our skin.</li>
            <li>I have to chose between being exposed to carcinogenic chemicals in sunscreen or using &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; free alternatives from now on</li>
            <li>Last, and most importantly, the sun protection from this product is about as good as no sunscreen.</li>
            <li>With the exception of our face, the Honest face stick does its job very well</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s coming right off, or they aren&#x27;t reapplying every 40 minutes (30 to be safe) as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This makes me question the whole company!!!</li>
            <li>I bought the twin pack at Costoco, excited to see a sunblock without the chemicals.  </li>
            <li>was excited to see this at Costco.  </li>
            <li>This company is known for its eco friendly, baby friendly products.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this sunscreen</li>
            <li>It goes for all honest company sunscreens including the ones now saying new and improved.</li>
            <li>Like many others, I use The Honest Company products, but folks, this one doesn&#x27;t work and I am currently sporting a burn to prove it.  </li>
            <li>While I love Honest&#x27;s Company&#x27;s diapers, until the zinc oxide is brought back up to the 20-25% range we won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li>We used the Honest Company sunscreen for 10 days in the Florida sun and my 18 month old didn&#x27;t get burn at all!</li>
            <li>I too was excited when Costco offered a natural alternative in this Honest Company sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also bought this at Costco as a double pack and was very excited to see a more natural brand sunscreen with a good spf count.</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii, I get burnt easy and have used many sunblocks</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used it in the pool, for summer camps, soccer, etc., and we&#x27;ve experienced no sunburn with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li>I recently bought this sunscreen because of the known quality of the brand - felt good about my purchase.  </li>
            <li>but since I have fair skin I wanted to put some extra coverage.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to use a sunscreen full of chemicals on him.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love Jessica Albas product</li>
            <li>We got ours directly from Honest and it was like not even putting anything on.  </li>
            <li>Lucky</li>
            <li>Luckily this sunscreen works well for preventing sunburns.</li>
            <li>and I have that lucky olive skin tone that rarely burns even with prolonged and direct exposure to the strongest of rays on a warm August day, but this s</li>
            <li>she was the only one, and she applied more than any of the rest of us (also, she is more olive toned than any of the rest of us).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and burn really easily, so I reapplied at least once an hour, sometimes more often and STILL got burned.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t do much once you&#x27;ve been set ablaze by your own desire to be environmentally conscious and free of parabens.</li>
            <li>The texture seems similar to the organic healing balm -which is wonderful and works wonders because it is nice and thick-</li>
            <li>This burn felt like I was out for two hours on a 100 degree day without protection - which makes me believe some of the more natural ingredients and oils in this sunscreen may actually be attracting the sun to the skin and not doing a good job protecting it.</li>
            <li>find it greatly discouraging you have responded to justifiable criticisms about your sunscreen suggesting your product is effective and worth standing behind.</li>
            <li>The first time I put it on my son, his hair turned three shades darker and stuck to his head!</li>
            <li>We decided to sit under the tent the next day and, even with the sunscreen lathered on, burned even more!</li>
            <li>The new formula is not as good as the old one.</li>
            <li>I used the Honest Company sunscreen on a several hour hike in the mountains in Utah.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen isn&#x27;t even worth one star.  </li>
            <li>Trash didnt work worth a damn.</li>
            <li>but figured I would just shower it off after the hike and it was worth the protection.</li>
            <li>Love using the natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>, I think I&#x27;ll take my chances with chemically induced cancer over spontaneous human combustion.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that just adds to it&#x27;s natural claims.  </li>
            <li>; but have never had a sunburn since switching and I feel much better putting something natural on my kids.</li>
            <li>I thought I would love this sunscreen based its the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Here is my open letter to the owners and management of &amp;#34;The Honest Company&amp;#34;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear</li>
            <li>whoa, the only truth about this product is that it HONESTly doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>However today every one of us is a nice shade of red.</li>
            <li>While I did not purchase mine from Amazon (or Costco, where it seems several people purchased from), I purchased from The Honest Company website, and had no issues.</li>
            <li>This ranks very good on EWG&#x27;s sunscreen list and I really appreciate what the company is trying to do, but as other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s VERY greasy.</li>
            <li>I was excited to see an environmentally-friendly sunscreen at Costco, but after a short day at the beach, it seems to have acted more like a tanning oil than a sun protectant.  </li>
            <li>Please do the right thing.</li>
            <li>My son has light brown hair and he tans normally.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Honest Company products which I like, and wanted a safe sunscreen for my 5 year old.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this stuff because I do like the honest company but both my kids used it and we were only out for an hour and</li>
            <li>Super greasy and my whole family got burnt after using this today.</li>
            <li>As someone that has made my own very effective natural sunscreen for years I can say that my experience with this product was satisfactory prior to the reformulation with less zinc oxide.</li>
            <li>The original tube is blue (like the picture on this product listing) but the ones from Costco are light blue/white with sunbeams on the front.</li>
            <li>I am sure some of the problem derives from the sunscreen formulation, and I also noted that the sunscreen has a thick consistency--more along the lines of a paste than a lotion--which makes it hard to spread for good coverage without a really meticulous application, after which you will have used up a good bit of your $14 tube of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my 4-year-old looked a bit pink, but assumed it was because she was warm.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used the sunscreen since that first day</li>
            <li>has not studied higher levels and there is always the chance for skin absorption.  </li>
            <li>After living in both the north and south, I think this is because the summers are more tolerable in the north and you will be tempted to stay outside longer.  </li>
            <li>This was my daughters first sunburn.  </li>
            <li>First use, i applied the product</li>
            <li>and it worked very well!</li>
            <li>I used 30 SPF all day at the beach on the first day of summer and didn&#x27;t burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It troubles me to see that many of the reviewers here have bought their sunscreen at costco and are having such a problem.  </li>
            <li>Even after her first bath it wasnt all off.</li>
            <li>All the ingredients is exactly what you need to look for in UVA/UVB protection.</li>
            <li>We have tried several non-chemical sunscreens and this one is a favorite.</li>
            <li>It does feel a bit greasy when it goes on--this is most noticeable on the face--but I am just so thankful it does not go on white.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, it does not actually protect as a 30 SPF, more like a 15 SPF.  </li>
            <li>did more harm to my skin using this product than I would have using regular sunscreen.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try that one first.</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen (actually, we prefer the aerosol version and the face sticks, but in a pinch use this squeeze bottle).</li>
            <li>If you want to burn then get this product , if not get something better at your local CVS.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been swimming outdoors and playing outside all summer at the appropriate hours.</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve learned my lesson the first time and thrown this stuff in the garbage.</li>
            <li>I applied exactly as directions said- before entering sun as well as every 45 minutes to an hour and on two separate occasions my kids were burnt.  </li>
            <li>The texture is pretty gross--heavy and greasy and it separated after two weeks</li>
            <li>/&gt;Third, my personal review, this stuff is BETTER than Badger.</li>
            <li>First, the product applies like a layer of grease -- imagine putting melted butter on your skin.</li>
            <li>and I think she should really reconsider her career choices!</li>
            <li>My daughter put some on for a track meet and, after just an hour, was burnt to a crisp.  </li>
            <li>Not wanting to take any chances I made sure all of us reapplied multiple times according to the the directions on the product.</li>
            <li>We used the first day and we all ended up with a sunburn.</li>
            <li>I have used both the old formula &amp; recently have been using the new formula purchased at Costco with the same excellent results.  </li>
            <li>I received this in a gift basket and was excited to try an all natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I like that the Honest Company uses natural products that are safe for small infants.</li>
            <li>I live in the southern most point of Texas near the beach and the sun is extremely strong here.</li>
            <li>I also thought it didn&#x27;t provide sun protection because she was bright red after using it and playing outside for an hour</li>
            <li>I love the idea behind The Honest Company.  </li>
            <li>I bought this sunscreen because I thought it was a regular physical sunscreen that was good for kids.  </li>
            <li>As many reviewers have noted, the sunscreen simply does not protect very well against the sun.</li>
            <li>I have exclusively used Honest sunscreen on her since she was old enough for sunscreen (after 6 months), and she has never once had a sunburn.</li>
            <li>My wife applied (and re-applied) quite a bit of the sunscreen on our first beach day and ended the day with large blotchy sunburns.</li>
            <li>but most of the other chemical free eco friendly mineral based blocks I have used have alway left a while film on my skin.</li>
            <li>It burned my nine month olds super soft baby skin!</li>
            <li>the latest in a long line of products that promise sun protection without harmful chemicals -- and it does the job.  </li>
            <li>was hoping for a safe, everyday under make up clean sunscreen</li>
            <li>Interesting enough, in the same sun without &#x27;honest protection&#x27;, she did not turn red.</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii and am out in the sun a lot and rarely do I burn.</li>
            <li>Certainly my kids haven&#x27;t noticed a difference</li>
            <li>you end up smelling like fried food, i didnt tan as much but only because i used it around 5pm, when the sun its not as strong, but it smells like you are literally putting vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>When the sun is really strong, you should really limit your time outside.</li>
            <li>Also, in my opinion, if you have to reapply sunscreen more than once on your kids, you have them out in the sun for too long!!  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to most sunscreens, getting itchy red bumps with repeated use.  </li>
            <li>Love their other products, but this is unfortunately not recommended.  </li>
            <li>but ever since switching to the honest products, and drinking lots of water, I haven&#x27;t had an exacerbation In a little over a year.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in so much pain</li>
            <li>We did use almost both whole containers just on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have read up a bit on Jessica Alba&#x27;s mission when she founded the brand and really like the ideas she talks about.  </li>
            <li>Very upsetting.</li>
            <li>My whole family got sunburned.</li>
            <li>Very greasy too.  </li>
            <li>very cautious.</li>
            <li>As I said, I am VERY prone to burning, and this product prevented that, even without the re-application requirement being met.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten burned yet, and really like this product.  </li>
            <li>it feels like straight grease</li>
            <li>Does not have much of a scent.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>Some of the ones we have tried smell very weird--this has a neutral odor.</li>
            <li>Please do not buy this sunscreen!!&lt;br /&gt;Was getting ready for my vacation</li>
            <li>I was very burned at the end of my hike.</li>
            <li>My face looks like I am the offspring of a well cooked lobster and the itching is intense.  </li>
            <li>I bought it on the board walk in Venice beach and got absolutely friend.</li>
            <li>Its really greesy</li>
            <li>Absolutely hammered by the sun.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very greasy</li>
            <li>My family of 5 used this sunscreen yesterday and all 5 of us are very burnt.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always so very greasy, it&#x27;s a nightmare of slippery baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the greasy texture, but it worked very well in protecting us from the sun.</li>
            <li>Wish I would have read reviews of this sunscreen before using it on my whole family.</li>
            <li>Once my daughter turned one, I switched to another formula that was much easier to apply and lasted much longer.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li>recommendation is that sunscreen should be your LAST line of defense, not your first!!</li>
            <li>Some research has also shown that people who live in the north have higher rates of skin cancer.  </li>
            <li>I slathered this on my arms, neck, and face and like many of the other reviews said-</li>
            <li>I bought it because it has the one ingredient that really protect you from the sun, it has a high percentage of  zinc Oxide, but with all those oils, i really dont trust it.</li>
            <li>Having watched parents not properly apply sunscreen over &amp; over again, it is my guess that that there is a very good chance that it was “user error” , not applying enough or not applying it soon enough (30 min before sun exposure) are the two most common errors I have witnessed.  </li>
            <li>I switched to the Honest Co. when I read reports that several top name products were unhealthy for females.</li>
            <li>Saturday I went for about 6 hours in direct sunlight with no ill effects.</li>
            <li>After I washed it off, every spot that I put this on him was red and bumpy, full of hives.  </li>
            <li>This morning I forgot my usual face sunscreen and applied the Honest sunscreen to my legs, arms, face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I will be tossing this in the garbage and finding a new product to try!</li>
            <li>We live in the south and I used this sunscreen on my son for 2 weeks straight during his swim lessons (1 hour lesson in the morning @</li>
            <li>I bought it because it was a good price, compared to similar products, but now I see it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li>maybe have the older version.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the most gross sunscreen I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It rated high, so I bought it.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this company.</li>
            <li>That bothers me more than a little greasy texture.</li>
            <li>The FDA recommends that sunscreen has at least 25% zinc oxide , well this &#x27;HONEST&#x27; company not only didn&#x27;t comply and used 20%, but lowered it even more to only include 9% oxide at one point just to satisfy the other complaints that it wasn&#x27;t applying &#x27; smoothly&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t put it on my 13 month old or 3 year old first.</li>
            <li>I have never complained about a sunscreen before.</li>
            <li>Or better yet, use butter because it would work the same as this expensive slop the Honest Company likes to call sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really disappointed as I have loved all other Honest co. products that I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>*** right here... let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s three days later</li>
            <li>We used this on our children&#x27;s faces, and they ended up becoming very pink (nearly burned) after being out in the sun for about an hour.  </li>
            <li>Needs new formula.</li>
            <li>I live in Phoenix, AZ</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii</li>
            <li>I live at 9000 ft</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t purchased the sunscreen in the new design of packaging (maybe a new formulation?)</li>
            <li>The new &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; formula just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li>live Jessica Alva.</li>
            <li>I only wish it was available in larger sizes.</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado at high altitude where sun protection is vital.</li>
            <li>Upon arrival, I decided to test it out myself first the next time we were going to the park and thank goodness</li>
            <li>First and last time I will use this product.  </li>
            <li>Wish they have bigger bottle and higher SPF for beach vacations.</li>
            <li>The only downside to this sunscreen is that it feels greasy when I first put it on, but after about 10-15 minutes that feel goes away.</li>
            <li>Being a natural redhead, I apply sunscreen by the handful OFTEN!  </li>
            <li>I usually never write reviews</li>
            <li>I hope a class action lawsuit puts you in your place, Miss Alba!</li>
            <li>like many other reviewers, I purchased the double pack of this sunscreen at Costco.  </li>
            <li>but we definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing this sunscreen again unless they change it back to the original formula.</li>
            <li>This product was complete junk!</li>
            <li>I live in South Florida and the sun is strong year round.</li>
            <li>I like how easy it is to apply on my squirmy little guy and</li>
            <li>My face felt extremely greasy through out the day and after an hour I just wanted to wash myself clean.  </li>
            <li>: my review is on the old formulation with 20% zinc oxide, not the new formulation with 9%</li>
            <li>but it turned out to be much greasier than expected, not to mention that it didn&#x27;t protect my kids as much from the sun!  </li>
            <li>It smells better than most of the mainstream sunblocks and my pale, pale irish skin has yet to burn using it.</li>
            <li>If this product can protect a 45 year old bald surfer with pale skin, then it should be fine for everyone, just remember to read the directions when applying.</li>
            <li>I agree with the majority of the posters here: steer clear of this product.  </li>
            <li>steer clear</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen on my 6 year old twins all summer</li>
            <li>I applied as directed and had no issues after 3 hours in direct Florida sun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all for natural and organic ingredients... if they still protect you from UV exposure.</li>
            <li>Used it today on myself and my 3 year old.  </li>
            <li>She is not prone to allergies, nor has she a particulary sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I used this on my 7, 5 and 5 month old daughter in Florida sun</li>
            <li>My boys have sensitive skin and not one rash or allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 2 year old daughter because I was looking for a mineral sunscreen with no chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>I do not find it white or any off color when applying; seems to blend in to my skin very well.  </li>
            <li>and I wanted to go the natural route so</li>
            <li>I stay away from chemical sunscreens because my son has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>His skin also became inflamed around his eyes, on his eyelids, even though I didn&#x27;t even put it directly there.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all, still got burnt.</li>
            <li>Like any natural sunscreen, you have to reapply it often.</li>
            <li>Buy another natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t say it offered zero protection, I would not recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and it does not protect my skin as the old formula used to.</li>
            <li>I went back to Neutrogena and found it much easier to apply, remove, and I didn&#x27;t have to reapply every 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>After the reformulation it&#x27;s essentially ineffective for any reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>my 3 year old had near blistering sunburn on his neck.  </li>
            <li>My wife survived it at an early age.</li>
            <li>and they were completely ineffective.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used tubes that I ordered directly from Honest.com, and I have never purchased it from a retail store or Costco.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile enjoying using the Simply Zinc on my face everyday.</li>
            <li>I am so surprised to see so many negative reviews of this product.</li>
            <li>It kind of just stays on in a thin greasy layer until you shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s greasy yes, but that is better than being so thick that it can&#x27;t be rubbed in.  </li>
            <li>It was too oily and thick to use under make up and caused anything I put on top of it to slide off immediately.</li>
            <li>While eco friendly, this sunscreen is not economically friendly because after about 10-15 uses, you need to buy another.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t eat in public because my skin scales might fall into other patrons dinner plates as I shed my skin walking through a light brisk draft from the air conditioning.</li>
            <li>Even though we have one and a half full tubes these will be going in the trash.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed seeing as though not only did I use this on my own fair skin, I used it on my 6 year old, 3 year old and 9 month old.</li>
            <li>Second time around, the exact same thing happened.</li>
            <li>I put this on myself, a 3 and 5 year old and we all got major sunburn.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest purchasing a different brand unless you want a sunburn!!</li>
            <li>From everything I have read, you need as a high a concentration of zinc oxide as possible.  </li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t remember the last time I had a burn that bad, light blisters and all.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it on my 1 year old and you can barely tell she&#x27;s been in the sun.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen has an interesting neutral odor, which I found pleasing, but otherwise there is not much good</li>
            <li>I used my normal facial sunscreen</li>
            <li>My kids spend a majority of their time outside because we live on a farm and we have a swimming pool.</li>
            <li>We live in palm springs where it often gets above 100 degrees</li>
            <li>Looking for one that has the ingredients of the Canadian one I use and the aesthetics but in a big enough bottle for kids and whole family.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because I am pregnant and didn&#x27;t want to put anything with harsh chemicals on my body.</li>
            <li>Seems to be good only been using it for a few days,im in the sun at least 8hrs every day and no sun burn so far!</li>
            <li>In place of chemicals, my entire family got completely burnt!  </li>
            <li>The last thing you want on a hot day is feeling oily and more uncomfortable than you already are from the heat.</li>
            <li>First use, we applied as we would any other sunblock - just before getting into the pool.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the active ingredient is zinc oxide, which is the ORIGINAL SUNSCREEN before more toxic chemicals began sneaking into sunscreen in the past few decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews but had to inform other potential buyers that this product does NOT work.  </li>
            <li>I was sorely disappointed as this Honest sunscreen is NOT the same formula as the original tube I bought.</li>
            <li>I am shocked by all the reviews saying that people have experienced sunburns after using this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>and I did appreciate that it was unscented as scented products tend to irritate my skin in general and can cause migraines.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been back from my trip for nearly two days.</li>
            <li>Also, aim for a sunscreen with zinc oxide of 18% at the bare minimum and 25% as your maximum.  </li>
            <li>My two year old has sensitive skin and has eczema and this has been the only sunscreen that hasn&#x27;t caused him to break out or make his eyes red and swollen.</li>
            <li>I have used it on my 1 year old every time we have gone outside by the pool this summer!</li>
            <li>I use it on my 6 month old as well but would be $$ to do it on a bigger kid.  </li>
            <li>I only get my products from the company directly.</li>
            <li>I bought this sunscreen back in May, at Target, for my one year old son.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried a few all natural sunscreens, and this seems to be the least effective of them all.</li>
            <li>Please fix your product and own up to the fact your product has FAILED its consumers.</li>
            <li>I live in Texas and always have a problem with even short periods of exposure that leave me red and peeling for days.</li>
            <li>&amp; so I need a product that works &amp; has much safer ingredients than then other chemical based sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>Using a product with no chemicals is worth a little extra time rubbing it in and cleaning off hands.  </li>
            <li>I generally apply about 10 minutes prior to water exposure</li>
            <li>The consistency is very thick and greasy but it covers the skin well and does not wash or wipe off easily in the water.</li>
            <li>I was in the sun for less than an hour and my whole family was burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, sorry so many people had a terrible experience, but our experience was great and we will continue to use this brand and many of its products, as we have for the past three years.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Very impressed and will use it again!</li>
            <li> Protects great, and does not irritate skin!</li>
            <li> Its a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> It worked great!</li>
            <li> The spray that they sell is great as well!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the best sunscreen I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> The Honest Company deserves to be sued!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Target in 2014 and the product was 20% zinc oxide and worked wonderfully!</li>
            <li> LOL!)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wonderful, but it seems risky.</li>
            <li> This stuff is actually amazing!!</li>
            <li> I was very good about reapplying on my kids every 2 hours in the sun</li>
            <li> I am a redhead with very fair skin.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen is incredibly oily.  </li>
            <li> When I needed sunscreen this summer, I was happy to see some on their site</li>
            <li> I just bought two containers of the Honest Brand sunscreen in July 2015 and it worked great for us!!  </li>
            <li> and I would hope pull it off the shelves till they greatly improve on it.  </li>
            <li> Honestly I had the impression that this is, rather them sunscreen, frying oil, at best.</li>
            <li> Everyone one else used Nutrogena and had great results.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brand at Coscto and thought it would be a great brand considering the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Great product, great sun protection.  </li>
            <li> When I saw it at Costco in a 2-pack, I happily bought it for the summer of 2015.</li>
            <li> On top of that, I got a sunburn!!</li>
            <li> it keeps me happy knowing it is from the Honest Company!</li>
            <li> I will never buy Honest Company products ever again!</li>
            <li> Also make sure to follow the directions on the sunscreen to reapply after a couple of hours to ensure best protection from burns.</li>
            <li> Shame on you Honest for not owning up!</li>
            <li> Honest needs to develop a safer sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I heard so many wonderful things about the &amp;#34;honest company&amp;#34; which is ran by Jessica Biel the girl from the Sin City</li>
            <li> I decided to buy the Honest company and wanted to protect my beautiful body from the sun...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a happy Honest customer for over a year.</li>
            <li> - Honest company stuff has great branding.  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t think it does a good job.</li>
            <li> Superior product with superior safety.</li>
            <li> And I think it is a good sunscreen on some levels.  </li>
            <li> I also have fair skin.</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s good to go.</li>
            <li> and blister?&lt;br /&gt;The honest sunscreen is great at protecting.</li>
            <li> what good is it if it doesn&#x27;t protect us?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s about as good as baby oil for preventing sunburn.  </li>
            <li> Everyone in my family has a fair complexion and we used this sunscreen at the pool with no issues.</li>
            <li> I am very  fair skinned and burn easily.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this  product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> love it!  </li>
            <li> Love the honest line!</li>
            <li> This is one u need to be able to put zero stars!  </li>
            <li> We love this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Put more on and they came home with a sunburn!</li>
            <li> and I felt like going to check out the cute life guards (LOL IM GAY!)</li>
            <li> Sunny Babies is amazing.</li>
            <li> Everyone used honest sunscreen and continued to reapply the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I am a research nut and find that this sunscreen does meet industry standards for an effective sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I so wanted to like this sunscreen and the Honest Company.  </li>
            <li> There is no way Jessica alba uses her own products on her kids or she would find this out</li>
            <li> ( mind you, the spring in nyc kind of sun, we weren&#x27;t at the tropics or anything like that)</li>
            <li> I am bummed as I have heard so many good things about this company, too.  </li>
            <li> As always, the honest company does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> My kids also ended up burned after using Honest Co sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have been an Honest Company customer for years.  </li>
            <li> I have NEVER had an issue with the Honest Company&#x27;s sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> The one who used Honest co. sunscreen is a LOBSTER, head to toe.  </li>
            <li> Honest company, you need to STOP selling this product.</li>
            <li> Shame on the honest company.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen by the Honest Company does not give me any reaction.  </li>
            <li> It was between honest company and badger sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I found the honest company in the store</li>
            <li> If you want a nice SUNBURN this is the product for you, purchase at costco and used 3x what was suggested and still burned my children......</li>
            <li> Thank you Honest Co.</li>
            <li> I honestly wondered iif it was a tanning lotion after that day.  </li>
            <li> Makes me never want to buy an honest brand item again.</li>
            <li> The spray we use by honest company is not greasy (but it&#x27;s even whiter).</li>
            <li> Honest Company</li>
            <li> I liked the Honest Company diapers, so I thought I could trust this brand.  </li>
            <li> I have been thrilled with all of them until today when I tried the sunscreen out on my family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if you get a good batch</li>
            <li> Was happier with the honest sunscreen stick.</li>
            <li> Will probably not buy this honest cream sunscreen again.</li>
            <li> so the sun is very, very strong</li>
            <li> I love the Honest company</li>
            <li> When used as designed, this is an excellent natural product, in this mom&#x27;s opinion.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive and fair skin and this sunscreen works for me!!!</li>
            <li> I bought a two-pack at Costco on sale and was excited to use it on my toddler, since it is non-toxic and boasts an array of good stuff.  </li>
            <li> My family has experienced no allergies or other skin reactions, it doesn&#x27;t sting their eyes, and after three years of using Honest brand on my three children, we have experienced ZERO sunburns.</li>
            <li> apply the sunscreen as directed but more often then suggested because our children have very light skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He is 16 months and has very fair sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> One of my sons is very fair and the last sunscreen I used on him didn&#x27;t prevent him from burning, so today I put the Honest co. sunscreen on him and on myself again.  </li>
            <li> It is so greasy feeling, I should have known better.</li>
            <li> I end up needing to use more than I should.  </li>
            <li> She was at the beach in the sun for 4hrs, playing in the water for most of it with her dad, and had no issues.</li>
            <li> Plus, the south gets more sunshine throughout the year which helps maintain vitamin D levels.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ascetically appealing.</li>
            <li> and i seemed to get more burnt</li>
            <li> Bought a package from Costco, and I fell in love with it immediately.</li>
            <li> I researched this sunscreen based on EWG guidelines and it&#x27;s top suggestions.  </li>
            <li> When applied, it leaves a layer of sticky, greasy oil sitting on top of your skin.</li>
            <li> Will never buy this product again, and going back to Nutragena, who makes the best sunscreen out there in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Love the brand and everything they stand for.</li>
            <li> It acts more like a suntan oil.</li>
            <li> I also like that it&#x27;s safe to use.</li>
            <li> Reapplied more than suggested.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I will be looking for another safe sunscreen and returning this one.  </li>
            <li> ; then yes, this is an HONEST and accurate description of the product.  </li>
            <li> but we wore shirts and purchased a much better brand product and had no issues .  </li>
            <li> My husband now has blisters from the most severe sunburn he has ever had in his life</li>
            <li> Yes, not terribly but yes.</li>
            <li> How is anyone rating this more than one star???  </li>
            <li> Zinc oxide can clump together, so you have to make sure it&#x27;s on the skin evenly.</li>
            <li> Unlike most  sunscreens that say to reapply after 80 minutes, this needs to be reapplied after 45, which is why people may be getting burned.</li>
            <li> It applies easier and covers more skin.</li>
            <li> I was pleased when I saw the 2 pack at Costco and that it didn&#x27;t contain all the chemicals that I&#x27;m trying to avoid.</li>
            <li> However, I have been using it since the beginning of June and have been completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> We also made sure to reapply according to the directions.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work OK as the kids didn&#x27;t get burnt in the sun</li>
            <li> but I felt that I needed to apply it more often.</li>
            <li> She is outdoors most of the day during the summer, swimming in our backyard.</li>
            <li> I admire Honest Co for being so clean in their ingredients</li>
            <li> My 7 year old and baby has very fair Skinand would burn eAsily</li>
            <li> I have been using the Honest brand sunscreen for almost two years and it has worked excellent &amp; when I say that, I mean excellent for any sunscreen not just natural sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> My husband a kids all have fair skin and burn pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I use a variety of products from Honest, most of which including the sunscreen I purchase direct from Honest.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen happy that it was &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, well it doesn&#x27;t feel natural when you put it on</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t burn easily, but can burn, so I bought this from Costco before going on vacation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t burn so easily that lack of reapplying after 80 minutes would have resulted in the burn I had.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While this was easy to spread, it seems that the changes they made to the formula mucked something up.  </li>
            <li> It feels somewhat oily going on but seems to absorb very quickly and no longer looks or feels greasy soon after applying.  </li>
            <li> and they find it easy to rub in all by themselves.</li>
            <li> We are olive skinned and don&#x27;t easily burn.</li>
            <li> - More affordable than some of the other organic, non-toxic brands  Cons: - this stuff is INCREDIBLY greasy.  </li>
            <li> and she used used Honest Co. for the first time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a beautiful summer day here by the beach</li>
            <li> so my face was fine but my chest, shoulders, and neck are burned.  </li>
            <li> and it has worked fine.</li>
            <li> He was fine.</li>
            <li> After normal, generous application and triplicate re-application, I am currently bright red and will be extraordinarily happy if I don&#x27;t get blisters.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t white and soaked in great, so that I had to use a ton to cover our skin.</li>
            <li> I have to chose between being exposed to carcinogenic chemicals in sunscreen or using &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; free alternatives from now on</li>
            <li> Last, and most importantly, the sun protection from this product is about as good as no sunscreen.</li>
            <li> With the exception of our face, the Honest face stick does its job very well</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s coming right off, or they aren&#x27;t reapplying every 40 minutes (30 to be safe) as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This makes me question the whole company!!!</li>
            <li> I bought the twin pack at Costoco, excited to see a sunblock without the chemicals.  </li>
            <li> was excited to see this at Costco.  </li>
            <li> This company is known for its eco friendly, baby friendly products.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this sunscreen</li>
            <li> It goes for all honest company sunscreens including the ones now saying new and improved.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I use The Honest Company products, but folks, this one doesn&#x27;t work and I am currently sporting a burn to prove it.  </li>
            <li> While I love Honest&#x27;s Company&#x27;s diapers, until the zinc oxide is brought back up to the 20-25% range we won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> We used the Honest Company sunscreen for 10 days in the Florida sun and my 18 month old didn&#x27;t get burn at all!</li>
            <li> I too was excited when Costco offered a natural alternative in this Honest Company sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also bought this at Costco as a double pack and was very excited to see a more natural brand sunscreen with a good spf count.</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii, I get burnt easy and have used many sunblocks</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used it in the pool, for summer camps, soccer, etc., and we&#x27;ve experienced no sunburn with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought this sunscreen because of the known quality of the brand - felt good about my purchase.  </li>
            <li> but since I have fair skin I wanted to put some extra coverage.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to use a sunscreen full of chemicals on him.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love Jessica Albas product</li>
            <li> We got ours directly from Honest and it was like not even putting anything on.  </li>
            <li> Lucky</li>
            <li> Luckily this sunscreen works well for preventing sunburns.</li>
            <li> and I have that lucky olive skin tone that rarely burns even with prolonged and direct exposure to the strongest of rays on a warm August day, but this s</li>
            <li> she was the only one, and she applied more than any of the rest of us (also, she is more olive toned than any of the rest of us).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned and burn really easily, so I reapplied at least once an hour, sometimes more often and STILL got burned.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t do much once you&#x27;ve been set ablaze by your own desire to be environmentally conscious and free of parabens.</li>
            <li> The texture seems similar to the organic healing balm -which is wonderful and works wonders because it is nice and thick-</li>
            <li> This burn felt like I was out for two hours on a 100 degree day without protection - which makes me believe some of the more natural ingredients and oils in this sunscreen may actually be attracting the sun to the skin and not doing a good job protecting it.</li>
            <li> find it greatly discouraging you have responded to justifiable criticisms about your sunscreen suggesting your product is effective and worth standing behind.</li>
            <li> The first time I put it on my son, his hair turned three shades darker and stuck to his head!</li>
            <li> We decided to sit under the tent the next day and, even with the sunscreen lathered on, burned even more!</li>
            <li> The new formula is not as good as the old one.</li>
            <li> I used the Honest Company sunscreen on a several hour hike in the mountains in Utah.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen isn&#x27;t even worth one star.  </li>
            <li> Trash didnt work worth a damn.</li>
            <li> but figured I would just shower it off after the hike and it was worth the protection.</li>
            <li> Love using the natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> , I think I&#x27;ll take my chances with chemically induced cancer over spontaneous human combustion.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure that just adds to it&#x27;s natural claims.  </li>
            <li> ; but have never had a sunburn since switching and I feel much better putting something natural on my kids.</li>
            <li> I thought I would love this sunscreen based its the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Here is my open letter to the owners and management of &amp;#34;The Honest Company&amp;#34;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear</li>
            <li> whoa, the only truth about this product is that it HONESTly doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> However today every one of us is a nice shade of red.</li>
            <li> While I did not purchase mine from Amazon (or Costco, where it seems several people purchased from), I purchased from The Honest Company website, and had no issues.</li>
            <li> This ranks very good on EWG&#x27;s sunscreen list and I really appreciate what the company is trying to do, but as other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s VERY greasy.</li>
            <li> I was excited to see an environmentally-friendly sunscreen at Costco, but after a short day at the beach, it seems to have acted more like a tanning oil than a sun protectant.  </li>
            <li> Please do the right thing.</li>
            <li> My son has light brown hair and he tans normally.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Honest Company products which I like, and wanted a safe sunscreen for my 5 year old.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this stuff because I do like the honest company but both my kids used it and we were only out for an hour and</li>
            <li> Super greasy and my whole family got burnt after using this today.</li>
            <li> As someone that has made my own very effective natural sunscreen for years I can say that my experience with this product was satisfactory prior to the reformulation with less zinc oxide.</li>
            <li> The original tube is blue (like the picture on this product listing) but the ones from Costco are light blue/white with sunbeams on the front.</li>
            <li> I am sure some of the problem derives from the sunscreen formulation, and I also noted that the sunscreen has a thick consistency--more along the lines of a paste than a lotion--which makes it hard to spread for good coverage without a really meticulous application, after which you will have used up a good bit of your $14 tube of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my 4-year-old looked a bit pink, but assumed it was because she was warm.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used the sunscreen since that first day</li>
            <li> has not studied higher levels and there is always the chance for skin absorption.  </li>
            <li> After living in both the north and south, I think this is because the summers are more tolerable in the north and you will be tempted to stay outside longer.  </li>
            <li> This was my daughters first sunburn.  </li>
            <li> First use, i applied the product</li>
            <li> and it worked very well!</li>
            <li> I used 30 SPF all day at the beach on the first day of summer and didn&#x27;t burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It troubles me to see that many of the reviewers here have bought their sunscreen at costco and are having such a problem.  </li>
            <li> Even after her first bath it wasnt all off.</li>
            <li> All the ingredients is exactly what you need to look for in UVA/UVB protection.</li>
            <li> We have tried several non-chemical sunscreens and this one is a favorite.</li>
            <li> It does feel a bit greasy when it goes on--this is most noticeable on the face--but I am just so thankful it does not go on white.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, it does not actually protect as a 30 SPF, more like a 15 SPF.  </li>
            <li> did more harm to my skin using this product than I would have using regular sunscreen.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try that one first.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen (actually, we prefer the aerosol version and the face sticks, but in a pinch use this squeeze bottle).</li>
            <li> If you want to burn then get this product , if not get something better at your local CVS.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been swimming outdoors and playing outside all summer at the appropriate hours.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve learned my lesson the first time and thrown this stuff in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I applied exactly as directions said- before entering sun as well as every 45 minutes to an hour and on two separate occasions my kids were burnt.  </li>
            <li> The texture is pretty gross--heavy and greasy and it separated after two weeks</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, my personal review, this stuff is BETTER than Badger.</li>
            <li> First, the product applies like a layer of grease -- imagine putting melted butter on your skin.</li>
            <li> and I think she should really reconsider her career choices!</li>
            <li> My daughter put some on for a track meet and, after just an hour, was burnt to a crisp.  </li>
            <li> Not wanting to take any chances I made sure all of us reapplied multiple times according to the the directions on the product.</li>
            <li> We used the first day and we all ended up with a sunburn.</li>
            <li> I have used both the old formula &amp; recently have been using the new formula purchased at Costco with the same excellent results.  </li>
            <li> I received this in a gift basket and was excited to try an all natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I like that the Honest Company uses natural products that are safe for small infants.</li>
            <li> I live in the southern most point of Texas near the beach and the sun is extremely strong here.</li>
            <li> I also thought it didn&#x27;t provide sun protection because she was bright red after using it and playing outside for an hour</li>
            <li> I love the idea behind The Honest Company.  </li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen because I thought it was a regular physical sunscreen that was good for kids.  </li>
            <li> As many reviewers have noted, the sunscreen simply does not protect very well against the sun.</li>
            <li> I have exclusively used Honest sunscreen on her since she was old enough for sunscreen (after 6 months), and she has never once had a sunburn.</li>
            <li> My wife applied (and re-applied) quite a bit of the sunscreen on our first beach day and ended the day with large blotchy sunburns.</li>
            <li> but most of the other chemical free eco friendly mineral based blocks I have used have alway left a while film on my skin.</li>
            <li> It burned my nine month olds super soft baby skin!</li>
            <li> the latest in a long line of products that promise sun protection without harmful chemicals -- and it does the job.  </li>
            <li> was hoping for a safe, everyday under make up clean sunscreen</li>
            <li> Interesting enough, in the same sun without &#x27;honest protection&#x27;, she did not turn red.</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii and am out in the sun a lot and rarely do I burn.</li>
            <li> Certainly my kids haven&#x27;t noticed a difference</li>
            <li> you end up smelling like fried food, i didnt tan as much but only because i used it around 5pm, when the sun its not as strong, but it smells like you are literally putting vegetable oil.</li>
            <li> When the sun is really strong, you should really limit your time outside.</li>
            <li> Also, in my opinion, if you have to reapply sunscreen more than once on your kids, you have them out in the sun for too long!!  </li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to most sunscreens, getting itchy red bumps with repeated use.  </li>
            <li> Love their other products, but this is unfortunately not recommended.  </li>
            <li> but ever since switching to the honest products, and drinking lots of water, I haven&#x27;t had an exacerbation In a little over a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in so much pain</li>
            <li> We did use almost both whole containers just on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have read up a bit on Jessica Alba&#x27;s mission when she founded the brand and really like the ideas she talks about.  </li>
            <li> Very upsetting.</li>
            <li> My whole family got sunburned.</li>
            <li> Very greasy too.  </li>
            <li> very cautious.</li>
            <li> As I said, I am VERY prone to burning, and this product prevented that, even without the re-application requirement being met.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten burned yet, and really like this product.  </li>
            <li> it feels like straight grease</li>
            <li> Does not have much of a scent.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> Some of the ones we have tried smell very weird--this has a neutral odor.</li>
            <li> Please do not buy this sunscreen!!&lt;br /&gt;Was getting ready for my vacation</li>
            <li> I was very burned at the end of my hike.</li>
            <li> My face looks like I am the offspring of a well cooked lobster and the itching is intense.  </li>
            <li> I bought it on the board walk in Venice beach and got absolutely friend.</li>
            <li> Its really greesy</li>
            <li> Absolutely hammered by the sun.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very greasy</li>
            <li> My family of 5 used this sunscreen yesterday and all 5 of us are very burnt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always so very greasy, it&#x27;s a nightmare of slippery baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the greasy texture, but it worked very well in protecting us from the sun.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have read reviews of this sunscreen before using it on my whole family.</li>
            <li> Once my daughter turned one, I switched to another formula that was much easier to apply and lasted much longer.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> recommendation is that sunscreen should be your LAST line of defense, not your first!!</li>
            <li> Some research has also shown that people who live in the north have higher rates of skin cancer.  </li>
            <li> I slathered this on my arms, neck, and face and like many of the other reviews said-</li>
            <li> I bought it because it has the one ingredient that really protect you from the sun, it has a high percentage of  zinc Oxide, but with all those oils, i really dont trust it.</li>
            <li> Having watched parents not properly apply sunscreen over &amp; over again, it is my guess that that there is a very good chance that it was “user error” , not applying enough or not applying it soon enough (30 min before sun exposure) are the two most common errors I have witnessed.  </li>
            <li> I switched to the Honest Co. when I read reports that several top name products were unhealthy for females.</li>
            <li> Saturday I went for about 6 hours in direct sunlight with no ill effects.</li>
            <li> After I washed it off, every spot that I put this on him was red and bumpy, full of hives.  </li>
            <li> This morning I forgot my usual face sunscreen and applied the Honest sunscreen to my legs, arms, face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I will be tossing this in the garbage and finding a new product to try!</li>
            <li> We live in the south and I used this sunscreen on my son for 2 weeks straight during his swim lessons (1 hour lesson in the morning @</li>
            <li> I bought it because it was a good price, compared to similar products, but now I see it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> maybe have the older version.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the most gross sunscreen I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It rated high, so I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this company.</li>
            <li> That bothers me more than a little greasy texture.</li>
            <li> The FDA recommends that sunscreen has at least 25% zinc oxide , well this &#x27;HONEST&#x27; company not only didn&#x27;t comply and used 20%, but lowered it even more to only include 9% oxide at one point just to satisfy the other complaints that it wasn&#x27;t applying &#x27; smoothly&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t put it on my 13 month old or 3 year old first.</li>
            <li> I have never complained about a sunscreen before.</li>
            <li> Or better yet, use butter because it would work the same as this expensive slop the Honest Company likes to call sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed as I have loved all other Honest co. products that I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> *** right here... let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s three days later</li>
            <li> We used this on our children&#x27;s faces, and they ended up becoming very pink (nearly burned) after being out in the sun for about an hour.  </li>
            <li> Needs new formula.</li>
            <li> I live in Phoenix, AZ</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii</li>
            <li> I live at 9000 ft</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t purchased the sunscreen in the new design of packaging (maybe a new formulation?)</li>
            <li> The new &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; formula just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> live Jessica Alva.</li>
            <li> I only wish it was available in larger sizes.</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado at high altitude where sun protection is vital.</li>
            <li> Upon arrival, I decided to test it out myself first the next time we were going to the park and thank goodness</li>
            <li> First and last time I will use this product.  </li>
            <li> Wish they have bigger bottle and higher SPF for beach vacations.</li>
            <li> The only downside to this sunscreen is that it feels greasy when I first put it on, but after about 10-15 minutes that feel goes away.</li>
            <li> Being a natural redhead, I apply sunscreen by the handful OFTEN!  </li>
            <li> I usually never write reviews</li>
            <li> I hope a class action lawsuit puts you in your place, Miss Alba!</li>
            <li> like many other reviewers, I purchased the double pack of this sunscreen at Costco.  </li>
            <li> but we definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing this sunscreen again unless they change it back to the original formula.</li>
            <li> This product was complete junk!</li>
            <li> I live in South Florida and the sun is strong year round.</li>
            <li> I like how easy it is to apply on my squirmy little guy and</li>
            <li> My face felt extremely greasy through out the day and after an hour I just wanted to wash myself clean.  </li>
            <li> : my review is on the old formulation with 20% zinc oxide, not the new formulation with 9%</li>
            <li> but it turned out to be much greasier than expected, not to mention that it didn&#x27;t protect my kids as much from the sun!  </li>
            <li> It smells better than most of the mainstream sunblocks and my pale, pale irish skin has yet to burn using it.</li>
            <li> If this product can protect a 45 year old bald surfer with pale skin, then it should be fine for everyone, just remember to read the directions when applying.</li>
            <li> I agree with the majority of the posters here: steer clear of this product.  </li>
            <li> steer clear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen on my 6 year old twins all summer</li>
            <li> I applied as directed and had no issues after 3 hours in direct Florida sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all for natural and organic ingredients... if they still protect you from UV exposure.</li>
            <li> Used it today on myself and my 3 year old.  </li>
            <li> She is not prone to allergies, nor has she a particulary sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I used this on my 7, 5 and 5 month old daughter in Florida sun</li>
            <li> My boys have sensitive skin and not one rash or allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 2 year old daughter because I was looking for a mineral sunscreen with no chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> I do not find it white or any off color when applying; seems to blend in to my skin very well.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted to go the natural route so</li>
            <li> I stay away from chemical sunscreens because my son has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> His skin also became inflamed around his eyes, on his eyelids, even though I didn&#x27;t even put it directly there.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all, still got burnt.</li>
            <li> Like any natural sunscreen, you have to reapply it often.</li>
            <li> Buy another natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t say it offered zero protection, I would not recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> and it does not protect my skin as the old formula used to.</li>
            <li> I went back to Neutrogena and found it much easier to apply, remove, and I didn&#x27;t have to reapply every 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> After the reformulation it&#x27;s essentially ineffective for any reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> my 3 year old had near blistering sunburn on his neck.  </li>
            <li> My wife survived it at an early age.</li>
            <li> and they were completely ineffective.  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tubes that I ordered directly from Honest.com, and I have never purchased it from a retail store or Costco.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile enjoying using the Simply Zinc on my face everyday.</li>
            <li> I am so surprised to see so many negative reviews of this product.</li>
            <li> It kind of just stays on in a thin greasy layer until you shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s greasy yes, but that is better than being so thick that it can&#x27;t be rubbed in.  </li>
            <li> It was too oily and thick to use under make up and caused anything I put on top of it to slide off immediately.</li>
            <li> While eco friendly, this sunscreen is not economically friendly because after about 10-15 uses, you need to buy another.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t eat in public because my skin scales might fall into other patrons dinner plates as I shed my skin walking through a light brisk draft from the air conditioning.</li>
            <li> Even though we have one and a half full tubes these will be going in the trash.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed seeing as though not only did I use this on my own fair skin, I used it on my 6 year old, 3 year old and 9 month old.</li>
            <li> Second time around, the exact same thing happened.</li>
            <li> I put this on myself, a 3 and 5 year old and we all got major sunburn.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest purchasing a different brand unless you want a sunburn!!</li>
            <li> From everything I have read, you need as a high a concentration of zinc oxide as possible.  </li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t remember the last time I had a burn that bad, light blisters and all.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it on my 1 year old and you can barely tell she&#x27;s been in the sun.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen has an interesting neutral odor, which I found pleasing, but otherwise there is not much good</li>
            <li> I used my normal facial sunscreen</li>
            <li> My kids spend a majority of their time outside because we live on a farm and we have a swimming pool.</li>
            <li> We live in palm springs where it often gets above 100 degrees</li>
            <li> Looking for one that has the ingredients of the Canadian one I use and the aesthetics but in a big enough bottle for kids and whole family.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because I am pregnant and didn&#x27;t want to put anything with harsh chemicals on my body.</li>
            <li> Seems to be good only been using it for a few days,im in the sun at least 8hrs every day and no sun burn so far!</li>
            <li> In place of chemicals, my entire family got completely burnt!  </li>
            <li> The last thing you want on a hot day is feeling oily and more uncomfortable than you already are from the heat.</li>
            <li> First use, we applied as we would any other sunblock - just before getting into the pool.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the active ingredient is zinc oxide, which is the ORIGINAL SUNSCREEN before more toxic chemicals began sneaking into sunscreen in the past few decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but had to inform other potential buyers that this product does NOT work.  </li>
            <li> I was sorely disappointed as this Honest sunscreen is NOT the same formula as the original tube I bought.</li>
            <li> I am shocked by all the reviews saying that people have experienced sunburns after using this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> and I did appreciate that it was unscented as scented products tend to irritate my skin in general and can cause migraines.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been back from my trip for nearly two days.</li>
            <li> Also, aim for a sunscreen with zinc oxide of 18% at the bare minimum and 25% as your maximum.  </li>
            <li> My two year old has sensitive skin and has eczema and this has been the only sunscreen that hasn&#x27;t caused him to break out or make his eyes red and swollen.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my 1 year old every time we have gone outside by the pool this summer!</li>
            <li> I use it on my 6 month old as well but would be $$ to do it on a bigger kid.  </li>
            <li> I only get my products from the company directly.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen back in May, at Target, for my one year old son.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried a few all natural sunscreens, and this seems to be the least effective of them all.</li>
            <li> Please fix your product and own up to the fact your product has FAILED its consumers.</li>
            <li> I live in Texas and always have a problem with even short periods of exposure that leave me red and peeling for days.</li>
            <li> &amp; so I need a product that works &amp; has much safer ingredients than then other chemical based sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> Using a product with no chemicals is worth a little extra time rubbing it in and cleaning off hands.  </li>
            <li> I generally apply about 10 minutes prior to water exposure</li>
            <li> The consistency is very thick and greasy but it covers the skin well and does not wash or wipe off easily in the water.</li>
            <li> I was in the sun for less than an hour and my whole family was burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, sorry so many people had a terrible experience, but our experience was great and we will continue to use this brand and many of its products, as we have for the past three years.</li>
            <li> This past weekend I applied the new formula to my 3yr old son &amp; he was in &amp; out of the water for 2-3 hours without any redness.  </li>
            <li> There are other natural sunscreens that actually work.</li>
            <li> I just hope they dont start changing the formulas on other products for worse as they grow just to be more profitable.</li>
            <li> At least skin cancer has the possibility of a decent survival rate if caught early.  </li>
            <li> and I find that this sunscreen works as well as any other natural sunscreen on the market but with fewer ingredients and no chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I like that this new product has 80 minutes of water resistance vs the previous 40.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure why there are so many negative reviews here.  </li>
            <li> This is very unfortunate since I thought I found a more &#x27;natural&#x27; sunscreen.</li>
            <li> At first I refused to believe it could be the sunscreen, but after a few tries I had to pitch them.  </li>
            <li> ( it&#x27;s pretty sticky and hard to spread out) on her face, after 15 minutes or so in the sun</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, other brands like Badger WITH THE SAME ACTIVE INGREDIENT, ZINC OXIDE, are highly rated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also has a strange odor similar to that of olive oil.</li>
            <li> It also needs to be on pretty thick.</li>
            <li> It is a little greasy but it seems they have made a change to it because the new ones I&#x27;ve been getting aren&#x27;t as oily feeling.</li>
            <li> Intense sun, and no one burned or even got a little pink.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was just me, but apparently not!</li>
            <li> I apply 15-20 min before sun exposure, reapplied several times on dry skin etc.</li>
            <li> We are in the pool for at least 1-2 hours a day since there isn&#x27;t much else to do outside besides swim in the summer.  </li>
            <li> The only explanation is that parents aren&#x27;t waiting 15 minutes for the stuff to dry before going in the sun and sweating</li>
            <li> Personally, I would not go above 25% zinc oxide as research in the EU (that I studied carefully)</li>
            <li> I really want to love this product, but I hate it and would not buy it again.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are different (only 9.3% zinc oxide) and it is extremely greasy and DOES NOT WORK.</li>
            <li> My 13 month old does get a little tan with this product but she is in the sun for hours and does not burn.  </li>
            <li> While some reviewers have complained that the sunscreen left their child burnt, I think the problem with the product is that you need to lather on 10 times as much to get the same effect as other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: After writing this review it appears Honest has had some bad press regarding their sunscreen for the reasons I was describing.</li>
            <li> And still completely no protection.</li>
            <li> I went on an hour hike this morning and it was only about 70 degrees with partial clouds</li>
            <li> I was having hormonal issues for a long time.</li>
            <li> I noticed after a short time they were pink.</li>
            <li> My family spent an entire week at the beach in FL with a UV index over 11 every day, and none of us got burnt.</li>
            <li> I do have to admit that we do not keep him out in the sun for long periods of time, so that may affect the results.  </li>
            <li> I mean really oily.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to this terrible sunscreen my 3 year old and 5 year old got their first sun burns!</li>
            <li> My other three kids used a different sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Other family members had the same problem.</li>
            <li> Her cousins applied the same sunscreen (age 2 and 3) and they got a little red but not Sunburnt, so maybe it depends on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;People saying they have used this product for years</li>
            <li> I kept making excuses for the product and gave it a few extra chances but it is time to throw it away and go back to Trukids.</li>
            <li> I wore the sunscreen every single day and would reapply.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both used your sunscreen (purchased from Costco) on a single day</li>
            <li> It leaves a white film on your greasy skin that rubs off on dark clothes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to see there are so many people who had such a negative experience with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness for my cap, long trousers and closed</li>
            <li> Again, a trade off to loose the chemical laden products that I used to use.</li>
            <li> but this one is a pretty big fail.</li>
            <li> My toddler&#x27;s skin has been accumulating damage at his daycare playtime this season when previous seasons he hadn&#x27;t using the same brand.</li>
            <li> Maybe people aren&#x27;t applying enough because the texture leads them to believe they need less.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s after only an hour and a half in the sun.</li>
            <li> Used it today on my 4 little ones while they were outside playing on the water slide etc.</li>
            <li> Luckily, my little guy was in his shaded stroller and didn&#x27;t burn, but after several attempts on myself, I realize that it just doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does.</li>
            <li> My son started looking a little red</li>
            <li> Some natural sunscreens seem to just sit on the surface of the skin and won&#x27;t rub in no matter how hard you try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Zinc based sun blocks before and do reapply about every hour to hour and a half, and this is no different.</li>
            <li> It applies nicely not like some of the other more natural sunscreens that go on like glue and are impossible to rub in.  </li>
            <li> In the south, the summers are too miserable to stay out for a great length of time.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised at all the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> I reapplied every hour and was partially covered with a shirt and still got fried.</li>
            <li> both kids are pink.</li>
            <li> Our day at the beach ended with smiles and not a touch of pink skin.  </li>
            <li> How about keeping an eye on your children and covering them up when they start getting pink instead of waiting for them to fry</li>
            <li> well spent knowing my kids aren&#x27;t being exposed to harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> careful</li>
            <li> Another failure could be product separation which can be fixed by kneading the tube to mix it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few i&#x27;ve discovered that has Zinc as an active ingredient and NO Titanium Dioxide which is a potential carcinogen.</li>
            <li> We allowed product to dry a minimum of 15 minutes as directed before, and applied after 40 minutes of continous water play and/after toweling down</li>
            <li> But after using it for a summer, my poor 1-year old&#x27;s skin is as sun-burnt and dark as ever since he enjoys playing outside.</li>
            <li> Granted this is only SPF 30, but I instantly feel my face beginning to burn, and I&#x27;m not fair skinned, I&#x27;m a medium skin</li>
            <li> Especially my little 2 year old!</li>
            <li> The 2 weeks in July that I used this our UV index was 11 (extreme).</li>
            <li> The sunscreen is extremely greasy and makes you feel like a sardine can.</li>
            <li> This did not perform to the level of other SPF 30+ sunscreens, so I can not recommend it.</li>
            <li> course we take other precautions as well as suggested by the CDC and the AAP:</li>
            <li> Only my face was spared because I&#x27;d put on my usual face cream with 15 SPF.</li>
            <li> We both got extremely burned despite reapplying your product every 45-60 minutes.</li>
            <li> My arms and legs are extremely moisturized and do not seem burned after my day at camp.  </li>
            <li> I agree with all the other one stars.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s an shelf life problem (not expired according to the date on the product), quality control issue, or the company is just trying to save money but not putting enough protective ingredients, but stay away from this brand.</li>
            <li> We recently purchased some Honest Company SPF 30 sunscreen for our beach trip and were very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very minimal sun blockage.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as harder to rub in than any other product, the smell is neutral and the texture is as expected -- a little thicker than conventional sunscreens, but not noticeably so.  </li>
            <li> Yesterday was the second time I have used this on my very pale 16mo daughter.</li>
            <li> And, he is very pale, blond, blue eyes.</li>
            <li> downside to this sunscreen: it does smell like play dough and it will stain (it did dye my son&#x27;s white swim shirt a very pale beige).</li>
            <li> Long story short, her poor earlobe was so sunburnt, it blistered and her thighs were pink, too.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing since I love all the cleaning products.</li>
            <li> and I burned a little bit, even though I spent 90% of the time under an umbrella.  </li>
            <li> This formula is too greasy and not worth the money.</li>
            <li> We were all extremely burned!</li>
            <li> I have a 19-month-old blue-eyed, blond-haired, extremely fair-skinned little girl.</li>
            <li> Your &amp;#34;SPF30&amp;#34; sunscreen product is the single WORST health and beauty product I have ever purchased, honestly.</li>
            <li> You should be embarrassed to stand behind a product that is so clearly ineffective and leaving people dangerously exposed to sunburns as a result...seems like a giant class action lawsuit waiting to happen.</li>
            <li> The tube is quite small; however, a little dot goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Only downfall is that it&#x27;s a little thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> There are a few other options on the EWG list that I prefer - babyganics being one of them.</li>
            <li> Both of us were in the sun for less than an hour and got burnt.  </li>
            <li> I went to a pool party after being in the sun for an hour previously at my sisters house in Phoenix (about 100 degrees out)...</li>
            <li> I was out of 3 and a half hours and applied it twice</li>
            <li> Kids&#x27; arms and wife&#x27;s shoulders were burned after less than an hour in the sun.  </li>
            <li> A greasy mess -</li>
            <li> Too bad, I had such high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> Just as I thought ---many bad reviews!  </li>
            <li> 4 stars because it&#x27;s a little too greasy.</li>
            <li> My daughter breaks out in little bumps from &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; sunscreen, so</li>
            <li> Today my son and I were in the sun for an 1.5 - 2 hours (which included at least half of that time spent in the shade) and we both got burnt using this</li>
            <li> My children have gotten pink cheeks only when I have failed to reapply after an hour and a half</li>
            <li> Well, I thought maybe I didn&#x27;t put enough of this stuff on, but now after reading the reviews I also have to say that I was surprised with how bad of a sunburn I ended up with on my shoulders after playing with my kid in the pool for a bit.  </li>
            <li> The greasiness lasted all through the hike which was just uncomfortable but the WORST part was that after the shower, my neck and face were bright red and itchy-</li>
            <li> We sat at the pool for a few hours.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Oily and heavy--</li>
            <li> At this point, I wanted to know if I&#x27;m the only one not happy with this sunscreen</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this brand.</li>
            <li> Using Honest sunscreen resulted in the worst sunburn I have ever had!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second use, I followed the instructions - applied, had the kids eat a snack for 20 minutes while it dried, reapplied after 45 minutes of swimming.</li>
            <li> After putting this sunscreen on him, he started crying and screaming that his skin was burning.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I made the terrible mistake of thinking that sunscreen is a commodity, and pulled the Honest Company one in haste from the Target shelf.</li>
            <li> and I have to put sunscreen on her everyday before school.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not too thick and spreads a little easier than other comparable sunscreen, but it&#x27;s a sunscreen and</li>
            <li> I have also used it on myself without any problems, and like my daughter, I have very, very pale skin (sometimes even the lightest shade of makeup is too dark for me).</li>
            <li> I used this product on my little one this past weekend.</li>
            <li> this past May. All we did was sit in some bleachersfor a few hours - no pools, no activity.</li>
            <li> Both of us unfortunately received a sunburn and were only out for an hour.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Like oil slick-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually quite vigilant about my sun protection</li>
            <li> She came home with the most horrible sunburn ever!  </li>
            <li> We have used this for over a month now on all our outings and water trips in 80+ degree weather and the only time I got burned is when I failed to rub this on my legs.</li>
            <li> Total fail.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> felt so awful that I let my toddler get burnt, because at first I thought I must have just forgotten to put on his arms, but his arms were greasy with white sunscreen in the crease of his arm</li>
            <li> Do not purchase and waste your money on this product!  </li>
            <li> and I am usually very pale.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why everyone&#x27;s saying they got burned, Maybe not reapplying, wearing hats, protective clothing (common sense).</li>
            <li> Very upset and disappointed.</li>
            <li> That being said, like previous comments mentioned, it&#x27;s not great at soaking into your skin.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen left me and my 3 year old daughter with horrible burns, and I don&#x27;t usually burn.</li>
            <li> We hardly got a tan.  </li>
            <li> sunscreen is getting some negative reviews lately, but it DOES work if used correctly.  </li>
            <li> and it took at least 15 minutes to get to the pool.  </li>
            <li> Agree with all the negative comments.  </li>
            <li> When we are in the water, I&#x27;m reapplying it at least every hour.</li>
            <li> I have read all the negative reviews and was hesitant to use this for my grandson.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m astonished by all the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> least understand how to use a product before trying to damage a company&#x27;s reputation.</li>
            <li> The HC has been standing behind their product, but needs to do the right thing to retain their customer base and offer refunds to those who had an experience like mine.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and your skin!!</li>
            <li> If by &amp;#34;broad spectrum protection&amp;#34; you mean &amp;#34;blistering,</li>
            <li> I am now extremely wary of using any other products from this company.  </li>
            <li> This weekend, I used a very small amount on the parts of my arms and legs that would be exposed while I was fishing.</li>
            <li> It was as bad as Blue Lizard.  </li>
            <li> so people will not be scared away from using this product by recent bad reviews on the Today Show.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I can think of is that maybe there is a bad batch out there.</li>
            <li> I used it once and got a terribly painful  blemish that has left a scar on my chest!</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Extremely greasy, hard to rub in, and impossible to wash off.  </li>
            <li> Greasy, hard to rub in, and does not protect from getting sunburnt!</li>
            <li> First, it was rancid the odor was horrible.  </li>
            <li> I liberally applied and re-applied and not only does it have a disgusting greasy texture that doesn&#x27;t even come off well in the shower, but I am extremely sun burnt.</li>
            <li> Not only is it extremely greasy, but it streaks and runs once you are in the sun for any length of time resulting in terrible sunburns.</li>
            <li> Very hard to rub in compared to &amp;#34;typical store brands,&amp;#34</li>
            <li> And yes, this stuff is greasy as heck and tough to put on in hairy areas like my chest and legs...</li>
            <li> It feels terrible on your skin, gets greasy marks on absolutely everything you come into contact with when it&#x27;s on you.  </li>
            <li> This sunsreen does a poor job of protecting from the sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really confused about this sunscreen and how I feel about it.</li>
            <li> It was basically worthless even after following directions.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure why this has gotten such horrible ratings.</li>
            <li> Not good!</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst sunscreen I have tried and I tried a lot of them.</li>
            <li> Bought this at CostCo thinking, &amp;#34;Great, a natural sunscreen with zinc oxide as its base.&amp;#34;  It is the WORST.  </li>
            <li> This is a dangerous product that could lead to serious injury.</li>
            <li> However, I found this excessively sticky and difficult to remove, and if playing in sand, the sand became impossible to get off.</li>
            <li> Sadly they are fried.</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t apply it to his hair - it&#x27;s just so greasy and so difficult to rub in, it ended up everywhere.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so sticky and difficult to rub in...</li>
            <li> Wondered if I did something wrong or misapplied it, etc...  </li>
            <li> Second, I used it for an hour stroll, in Michigan, on a sunny day and was terribly burned upon my return.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, the only problems came from this horrible sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found it rather unusable.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Without a demonstrated commitment regain your customer&#x27;s trust, your company is rightfully doomed to fail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of different sunscreens and words can&#x27;t come close to describing how terrible this product compares even to the cheapest stuff you find at discount stores.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> I learned this sadly after trying this junk.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product was the wrong choice</li>
            <li> After applying several times, despite the nasty, greasy, heavy layer it leaves behind, I still got an awful sunburn.</li>
            <li> Very poor protection.</li>
            <li> Hands down the worst sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the worst sunscreen ever.</li>
            <li> her hair looks like a greasy disgusting mess.</li>
            <li> daughter complained, too, that she hated the texture of the cream as it was to greasy for her.  </li>
            <li> It is so sad!</li>
            <li> Sorry, Jess!  </li>
            <li> Sorry Jessica!</li>
            <li> My daughter burned so bad she eventually blistered on her cheeks.</li>
            <li> Our grown daughter used this &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; yesterday and had a bad sunburn within an hour, despite reapplying according to directions.</li>
            <li> my burn was so bad I almost thought I was having an allergic reaction to something in the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> but it was actually a bad rash.</li>
            <li> Smells so bad....</li>
            <li> I got badly burned using this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I felt so bad for her.</li>
            <li> so I almost didn&#x27;t feel bad tossing it.</li>
            <li> I am a guy, applied and re-applied it liberally and still ended up getting bad sunburns on my neck and arms</li>
            <li> My kids had a painful sunburn after 2 hours at the pool.</li>
            <li> or I would have fried like chicken!</li>
            <li> Yuck:(</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my boyfriend and I burned horribly using this stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t read these reviews before I bought this.... :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;After, spending the summer at the beach using Walmart sunscreen without any sunburns, my daughter had built up quite a base tan.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely worthless.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll sooner get melanoma than any protection from the sun with this bona fide CRAP they are selling you.</li>
            <li> I Hate the texture.</li>
            <li> and they still got burnt and badly!  </li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s why a lot of people get burnt so bad!</li>
            <li> I hope there wasn&#x27;t a re formulation of the product that&#x27;s causing all these bad reviews!  </li>
            <li> This is painful!</li>
            <li> pictures of burned kids are horrifying.</li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this sunscreen.</li>

            <li> This is the worst skin care product I have ever purchased and will be returning both tubes.  </li>
            <li> As others have noted, the texture is disgusting.  </li>
            <li> It makes my toddler itch and now she has a terrible rash on her legs and arms.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is crap! Got burned sitting in the sun for an hour after applying this s***. Lucky I wasn&#x27;t at the beach or I would have fried like chicken! Don&#x27;t buy it and if you did return it before you die of skin cancer!</li>
            <li> Do not buy. So upset. My daughter burned so bad she eventually blistered on her cheeks.</li>
            <li> I was excited to see an environmentally-friendly sunscreen at Costco, but after a short day at the beach, it seems to have acted more like a tanning oil than a sun protectant.  After normal, generous application and triplicate re-application, I am currently bright red and will be extraordinarily happy if I don&#x27;t get blisters.  The only part that didn&#x27;t burn was my face - where I used a different sun-screen.  The product is dangerous and misleading - do not buy!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this sunscreen. Used it today on my 4 little ones while they were outside playing on the water slide etc. I apply 15-20 min before sun exposure, reapplied several times on dry skin etc. Sadly they are fried. I will be returning the unused portions for a refund.</li>
            <li> My kids, husband and myself all used this while at the pool/beach for a 3 day weekend. Intense sun, and no one burned or even got a little pink. My husband a kids all have fair skin and burn pretty easily. Very impressed and will use it again!</li>
            <li> love it!  Protects great, and does not irritate skin!</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!! It is so greasy feeling, I should have known better. I used it once and got a terribly painful  blemish that has left a scar on my chest! I HATE THIS PRODUCT!!! I will never buy Honest Company products ever again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t burn easily, but can burn, so I bought this from Costco before going on vacation. It didn&#x27;t work at all. I&#x27;ve never been so burnt in my life! I wore the sunscreen every single day and would reapply. I think it was attracting the sun instead of blocking it! I will never use it again. I&#x27;m in so much pain and I&#x27;ve been back from my trip for nearly two days.</li>
            <li> I threw mine in the trash! After applying throughout my day in the sun I am burnt! So disappointed! I&#x27;m sticking with Alba sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Well, I thought maybe I didn&#x27;t put enough of this stuff on, but now after reading the reviews I also have to say that I was surprised with how bad of a sunburn I ended up with on my shoulders after playing with my kid in the pool for a bit.  I honestly don&#x27;t remember the last time I had a burn that bad, light blisters and all.  And yes, this stuff is greasy as heck and tough to put on in hairy areas like my chest and legs...I end up needing to use more than I should.  I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> Hands down the worst sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. I got the worst sunburn I think I&#x27;ve ever had and I reapplied twice the two hours I was in the sun. Add that to the fact that this sunscreen felt like rubbing butter into your skin and you will get an idea of how incredibly AWFUL this stuff is. Thank goodness I got it at Costco - I will be returning this</li>
            <li> I bought the twin pack at Costoco, excited to see a sunblock without the chemicals.  In place of chemicals, my entire family got completely burnt!  Stay away!</li>
            <li> Horrible product! We went to Hawaii with our kids. We sat at the pool for a few hours. Everyone used honest sunscreen and continued to reapply the sunscreen. It was like we used baby oil! We were all extremely burned! Especially my little 2 year old! She had blisters on her shoulder! It is so sad! Worst product ever!</li>
            <li> I highly suggest purchasing a different brand unless you want a sunburn!! My daughter turns red within a hour of application when we&#x27;re only out at the park. At the beach I had to apply the sunscreen 6 times within the 2 hours we were there and she was still red!</li>
            <li> Bought this at Target for my kids to use on vacation at the Maryland shore. I applied it to them 30 minutes prior to going to the beach and diligently reapplied while we were out. I noticed that my 4-year-old looked a bit pink, but assumed it was because she was warm. Long story short, her poor earlobe was so sunburnt, it blistered and her thighs were pink, too. Thank goodness she had on a rash guard and my toddler was under an umbrella. I chucked it and went back to Coppertone.</li>
            <li> If I could give zero stars I would. Everyone burned using this product. It&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> I had to reaply it every hour, becouse my kids were getting burned by the sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a happy Honest customer for over a year. When I needed sunscreen this summer, I was happy to see some on their site and I added it to one of my monthly bundles. Upon arrival, I decided to test it out myself first the next time we were going to the park and thank goodness I did. We were outside for two hours and I was burnt almost as though I hadn&#x27;t put any sunscreen on. I don&#x27;t burn so easily that lack of reapplying after 80 minutes would have resulted in the burn I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the sunscreen since that first day and I&#x27;m just thankful I didn&#x27;t put it on my 13 month old or 3 year old first.</li>
            <li> I love the Honest company and I swear by all their products with the exception of their sunscreens. I used it a couple times and still burned. Doesn&#x27;t work. Needs new formula.</li>
            <li> Yesterday was the second time I have used this on my very pale 16mo daughter. She was at the beach in the sun for 4hrs, playing in the water for most of it with her dad, and had no issues.</li>
            <li> I just bought two containers of the Honest Brand sunscreen in July 2015 and it worked great for us!!  We live in the south and I used this sunscreen on my son for 2 weeks straight during his swim lessons (1 hour lesson in the morning @ 8:50am, plus time prior/after). The 2 weeks in July that I used this our UV index was 11 (extreme). My son NEVER burned or turned red. And, he is very pale, blond, blue eyes. We did use almost both whole containers just on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is getting some negative reviews lately, but it DOES work if used correctly.  I am a research nut and find that this sunscreen does meet industry standards for an effective sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is that sunscreen should be your LAST line of defense, not your first!! Don&#x27;t go out in the sun b/w 10am-2pm and wear protective clothing (hats, swim shirts, sunglasses, etc)! Also, apply before you go to the beach, not while out there! Apply a think layer!  Remember that zinc oxide provides a physical barrier instead of a chemical barrier.  Also, aim for a sunscreen with zinc oxide of 18% at the bare minimum and 25% as your maximum.  Personally, I would not go above 25% zinc oxide as research in the EU (that I studied carefully) has not studied higher levels and there is always the chance for skin absorption.  Also, in my opinion, if you have to reapply sunscreen more than once on your kids, you have them out in the sun for too long!!  Some research has also shown that people who live in the north have higher rates of skin cancer.  After living in both the north and south, I think this is because the summers are more tolerable in the north and you will be tempted to stay outside longer.  In the south, the summers are too miserable to stay out for a great length of time.  Plus, the south gets more sunshine throughout the year which helps maintain vitamin D levels.  Just some things to consider...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside to this sunscreen: it does smell like play dough and it will stain (it did dye my son&#x27;s white swim shirt a very pale beige). And, yes it will make you white....it has zinc oxide, hello!!</li>
            <li> I live in the southern most point of Texas near the beach and the sun is extremely strong here. I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen on my 6 year old twins all summer and they haven&#x27;t burned once. My kids spend a majority of their time outside because we live on a farm and we have a swimming pool. Even when we go to the beach for the day it hasn&#x27;t been an issue. I have and will continue to recommend this sunscreen. It is a little greasy but it seems they have made a change to it because the new ones I&#x27;ve been getting aren&#x27;t as oily feeling.</li>
            <li> I think this is the worst sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. I reapplied every hour and was partially covered with a shirt and still got fried. The lotion separates too, so there is a puddle of grease in my Palm if I don&#x27;t shake it up.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I use The Honest Company products, but folks, this one doesn&#x27;t work and I am currently sporting a burn to prove it.  The HC has been standing behind their product, but needs to do the right thing to retain their customer base and offer refunds to those who had an experience like mine.  Until they do so, this gets the lowest rating possible from me.  Sorry, Jess!  Please do the right thing.</li>
            <li> It smells better than most of the mainstream sunblocks and my pale, pale irish skin has yet to burn using it. That being said, like previous comments mentioned, it&#x27;s not great at soaking into your skin. It kind of just stays on in a thin greasy layer until you shower. I&#x27;ve avoided using it on my face for this reason.</li>
            <li> My wife bought at Costco last week and I tried while working in the yard this weekend. I am very  fair skinned and burn easily. I applied as directed and had no issues after 3 hours in direct Florida sun. Only critique would be its a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> deserves 0 stars. This is by far the worst sunscreen I have tried and I tried a lot of them. The sunscreen is extremely greasy and makes you feel like a sardine can. It burns your eyes and makes you break out. The last thing you want on a hot day is feeling oily and more uncomfortable than you already are from the heat. The worst is, you still burn. Skip this one.</li>
            <li> I so wanted to like this sunscreen and the Honest Company.  I have read up a bit on Jessica Alba&#x27;s mission when she founded the brand and really like the ideas she talks about.  I bought a two-pack at Costco on sale and was excited to use it on my toddler, since it is non-toxic and boasts an array of good stuff.  Pros: - Honest company stuff has great branding.  It&#x27;s ascetically appealing. - More affordable than some of the other organic, non-toxic brands  Cons: - this stuff is INCREDIBLY greasy.  The first time I put it on my son, his hair turned three shades darker and stuck to his head! (I didn&#x27;t apply it to his hair - it&#x27;s just so greasy and so difficult to rub in, it ended up everywhere.) - It just doesn&#x27;t work.  I used it, as did my husband, who is bald.  His head burnt, and my face and shoulders burnt. Luckily, my little guy was in his shaded stroller and didn&#x27;t burn, but after several attempts on myself, I realize that it just doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Love the honest line! I believe that they are coming as close as can be to Organic!!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen left me and my 3 year old daughter with horrible burns, and I don&#x27;t usually burn. It&#x27;s like it magnified the sun on out skin. It wasn&#x27;t white and soaked in great, so that I had to use a ton to cover our skin. And still completely no protection. Don&#x27;t waste your money and your skin!!</li>
            <li> This is one u need to be able to put zero stars!  Extremely greasy, hard to rub in, and impossible to wash off.  I was very good about reapplying on my kids every 2 hours in the sun and they still got burnt and badly!  My daughters back looked like a tomato and even blistered in one spot!  I started talking to friends about it and turns out they had the same problem.  It goes for all honest company sunscreens including the ones now saying new and improved. There is no way Jessica alba uses her own products on her kids or she would find this out and I would hope pull it off the shelves till they greatly improve on it.  Worst sunscreen ever!!!</li>
            <li> This is the worst skin care product I have ever purchased and will be returning both tubes.  As others have noted, the texture is disgusting.  It makes my toddler itch and now she has a terrible rash on her legs and arms.  I bought it because it was a good price, compared to similar products, but now I see it was a waste of money.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> WORST EVER!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in the sun all the time. I have medium tone skin and DO NOT burn easily.&lt;br /&gt;I used this sunscreen generously and received the worst sunburn I&#x27;ve had in years. I&#x27;m all for natural and organic ingredients... if they still protect you from UV exposure. don&#x27;t waste your money. i&#x27;m going back to using Headhunter and paying the extra money.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but had to inform other potential buyers that this product does NOT work.  Used it today on myself and my 3 year old.  Both of us unfortunately received a sunburn and were only out for an hour.  I do believe it gave us Zero protection.  First and last time I will use this product.  This was my daughters first sunburn.  Very upsetting.</li>
            <li> Did not work.  Put sunscreen on my back today.  Left for pool and it took at least 15 minutes to get to the pool.  Was at the pool for a couple hours and directions say 80 minutes.  Regardless, when I came home and looked at my back I was sunburnt.  I&#x27;m scared to feel the pain tomorrow.</li>
            <li> This has never happen before when using sunscreen.  My whole family got sunburned. Do not buy this terrible product as it provides no sun protection.</li>
            <li> Seems to be good only been using it for a few days,im in the sun at least 8hrs every day and no sun burn so far!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4 yo daughter. First use, i applied the product ( it&#x27;s pretty sticky and hard to spread out) on her face, after 15 minutes or so in the sun ( mind you, the spring in nyc kind of sun, we weren&#x27;t at the tropics or anything like that) she turned completely red.  Second time around, the exact same thing happened. Interesting enough, in the same sun without &#x27;honest protection&#x27;, she did not turn red. She is not prone to allergies, nor has she a particulary sensitive skin. Honestly I had the impression that this is, rather them sunscreen, frying oil, at best. It&#x27;s going to the trash, i&#x27;m affraid.</li>
            <li> Ehhh.. I admire Honest Co for being so clean in their ingredients but this one is a pretty big fail. It&#x27;s so sticky and difficult to rub in... And I don&#x27;t think it does a good job. I live in South Florida and the sun is strong year round. Granted this is only SPF 30, but I instantly feel my face beginning to burn, and I&#x27;m not fair skinned, I&#x27;m a medium skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for a safe, everyday under make up clean sunscreen and this can NOT be used under makeup. Your makeup will never blend in as it&#x27;ll get literally stuck on your face from this sticky sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After writing this review it appears Honest has had some bad press regarding their sunscreen for the reasons I was describing. I thought maybe it was just me, but apparently not! The reason I felt like I was burning still is because, well, I was still burning with this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I bought this at costco.  Put on 1/2 hour before being in sun and i got BURNED!  I used my normal facial sunscreen so my face was fine but my chest, shoulders, and neck are burned.  I might as well have put nothing on.  Very greasy too.  Yuck:(</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give you sun protection.  I have the worst burn I&#x27;ve had in years.  It had a gross oily feeling that doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> Totally greasy and i seemed to get more burnt then if i appled no sunsreen at all.</li>
            <li> Read this article: http://finance.yahoo.com/news/furious-parents-alleging-jessica-albas-184126312.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be very cautious. This is a dangerous product that could lead to serious injury. There should be a recall on this product line.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this sunscreen. I&#x27;ve used other Honest Company products which I like, and wanted a safe sunscreen for my 5 year old. This came on so goopy and sticky and would not blend in at all. It also has a strange odor similar to that of olive oil. I couldn&#x27;t get it off my hands after rinsing two times. This formula is too greasy and not worth the money.</li>
            <li> We used the Honest Company sunscreen for 10 days in the Florida sun and my 18 month old didn&#x27;t get burn at all! Its a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I live in Texas and always have a problem with even short periods of exposure that leave me red and peeling for days. This weekend, I used a very small amount on the parts of my arms and legs that would be exposed while I was fishing. Saturday I went for about 6 hours in direct sunlight with no ill effects. Sunday for about 2 hours with the same results. Only part that got burnt was my knee, where I had not rubbed any. Maybe it is different skin types? As I said, I am VERY prone to burning, and this product prevented that, even without the re-application requirement being met.</li>
            <li> I used the Honest Company sunscreen on a several hour hike in the mountains in Utah. It was 90 degrees, and there wasn&#x27;t a cloud in the sky. It worked great! I have recommended this sunscreen to others.</li>
            <li> Me and my family have been using this sunscreen for 2 years now. No sunburns with plenty of sun exposure. I can&#x27;t understand why anyone would give this one star judged solely on protection. People who get burned with stuff would get burned with anything.</li>
            <li> Bought a package from Costco, and I fell in love with it immediately. It&#x27;s great to my super sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t have the shine (goes away after 5 minutes), or changes the skin tone. I use it daily before makeup. Wish they have bigger bottle and higher SPF for beach vacations.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this sunscreen because of the known quality of the brand - felt good about my purchase.  WhenI used it and got sun-burned on my arms, chest and upper thighs.  Wondered if I did something wrong or misapplied it, etc...  Then I checked all the reviews here.  Guess it was the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter complained, too, that she hated the texture of the cream as it was to greasy for her.  I didn&#x27;t seem to mind that and I did appreciate that it was unscented as scented products tend to irritate my skin in general and can cause migraines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on returning this product and sticking to the brands we have tried before.  I am bummed as I have heard so many good things about this company, too.  I hope they are seeing these reviews!</li>
            <li> We love this sunscreen! My two year old has sensitive skin and has eczema and this has been the only sunscreen that hasn&#x27;t caused him to break out or make his eyes red and swollen. I like how easy it is to apply on my squirmy little guy and it didn&#x27;t seem like I needed to spend a lot of time rubbing everything in like some brands I&#x27;ve tried. He hasn&#x27;t gotten a sunburn yet! The only downside to this sunscreen is that it feels greasy when I first put it on, but after about 10-15 minutes that feel goes away. Also make sure to follow the directions on the sunscreen to reapply after a couple of hours to ensure best protection from burns.</li>
            <li> As always, the honest company does not disappoint. Superior product with superior safety.</li>
            <li> I used this on my 7, 5 and 5 month old daughter in Florida sun and it worked very well! My 7 year old and baby has very fair Skinand would burn eAsily and we didn&#x27;t have a problem with this product! They say to stay out of the sun from&lt;br /&gt;10-2 because the sun is the worst I think that&#x27;s why a lot of people get burnt so bad!</li>
            <li> I love the idea behind The Honest Company.  I researched this sunscreen based on EWG guidelines and it&#x27;s top suggestions.  It rated high, so I bought it.  And I think it is a good sunscreen on some levels.  But it is greasy and oily.  I mean really oily.  Yuck!  It feels terrible on your skin, gets greasy marks on absolutely everything you come into contact with when it&#x27;s on you.  I really want to love this product, but I hate it and would not buy it again.  Sorry Jessica!</li>
            <li> Agree with all the negative comments.  This sunscreen is awful and doesn&#x27;t protect my children at all. They get sunburned EVERY time. I kept making excuses for the product and gave it a few extra chances but it is time to throw it away and go back to Trukids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this all summer and I am usually very pale.  I haven&#x27;t gotten burned yet, and really like this product.  I&#x27;ve used other Zinc based sun blocks before and do reapply about every hour to hour and a half, and this is no different.</li>
            <li> I used this product as directed and ended up with a terrible sunburn. I told all my friends NOT to use this stuff.</li>
            <li> Terrible texture!  Oily and heavy-- before the cream came out, about a Tbsp of oil shot out and went all over the floor!  When applied, it leaves a layer of sticky, greasy oil sitting on top of your skin. Ugh!  At this point, I wanted to know if I&#x27;m the only one not happy with this sunscreen so I looked up reviews on Amazon.  Just as I thought ---many bad reviews!  Even that it doesn&#x27;t protect properly. But thank goodness I didn&#x27;t leave home with it on but washed it all off because I couldn&#x27;t stand the greasy feel of it!  Will never buy this product again, and going back to Nutragena, who makes the best sunscreen out there in my opinion!</li>
            <li> My toddler&#x27;s skin has been accumulating damage at his daycare playtime this season when previous seasons he hadn&#x27;t using the same brand. Now, I see I the news that they&#x27;ve cheapened the formula this year. Definitely changing brands.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this brand. For an organic product, use the California Baby line. I used 30 SPF all day at the beach on the first day of summer and didn&#x27;t burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Testing shows variations of an essential ingredient, zinc oxide.</li>
            <li> My kids also ended up burned after using Honest Co sunscreen. Even though we have one and a half full tubes these will be going in the trash.</li>
            <li> I kept telling my son he wasn&#x27;t applying enough sunscreen because he kept getting burned. Now I see it&#x27;s the product, not him!!</li>
            <li> I am a redhead with very fair skin.  My son has light brown hair and he tans normally.  Both of us were in the sun for less than an hour and got burnt.  Being a natural redhead, I apply sunscreen by the handful OFTEN!  So it was not an application issue.  Please do not buy.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I have used it on my 1 year old every time we have gone outside by the pool this summer! No burns and it keeps me happy knowing it is from the Honest Company! Love the brand and everything they stand for.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen isn&#x27;t even worth one star.  First, it was rancid the odor was horrible.  Second, I used it for an hour stroll, in Michigan, on a sunny day and was terribly burned upon my return.  If you care about your skin, skin cancer and aging of the skin, do not use this over-rated sunscreen.  The 5 stars have to be from people related to the company otherwise, no one, would give it 5 stars.  This makes me question the whole company!!!</li>
            <li> The two star review is a bit disingenuous on my part because once I found out that they reformulated from 20%+ zinc oxide to just over 9%, I knew that this wasn&#x27;t going to offer the same protection.  How could it?  From everything I have read, you need as a high a concentration of zinc oxide as possible.  I&#x27;ve personally been using this Canadian one- Simply Zinc SPF 30 from www.thesunscreencompany.com.  I use it on my 6 month old as well but would be $$ to do it on a bigger kid.  Looking for one that has the ingredients of the Canadian one I use and the aesthetics but in a big enough bottle for kids and whole family.  Meanwhile enjoying using the Simply Zinc on my face everyday.</li>
            <li> I have been an Honest Company customer for years.  I live in Phoenix, AZ and I have 4 kids.  We are in the pool for at least 1-2 hours a day since there isn&#x27;t much else to do outside besides swim in the summer.  I have NEVER had an issue with the Honest Company&#x27;s sunscreen.  Ever.  My boys have sensitive skin and not one rash or allergic reaction.  It troubles me to see that many of the reviewers here have bought their sunscreen at costco and are having such a problem.  I only get my products from the company directly.</li>
            <li> Trash didnt work worth a damn.</li>
            <li> Our grown daughter used this &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; yesterday and had a bad sunburn within an hour, despite reapplying according to directions. It acts more like a suntan oil. Everyone one else used Nutrogena and had great results.  Taking the remainder back to Costco.</li>
            <li> I also bought this at Costco as a double pack and was very excited to see a more natural brand sunscreen with a good spf count. I went on an hour hike this morning and it was only about 70 degrees with partial clouds but since I have fair skin I wanted to put some extra coverage. I slathered this on my arms, neck, and face and like many of the other reviews said- it feels like straight grease and I wanted to take it off immediately but figured I would just shower it off after the hike and it was worth the protection. The greasiness lasted all through the hike which was just uncomfortable but the WORST part was that after the shower, my neck and face were bright red and itchy- my burn was so bad I almost thought I was having an allergic reaction to something in the sunscreen. This burn felt like I was out for two hours on a 100 degree day without protection - which makes me believe some of the more natural ingredients and oils in this sunscreen may actually be attracting the sun to the skin and not doing a good job protecting it. I usually never write reviews and I hate to write such a lengthy one, but I think it&#x27;s important to write for something as important as sunscreen so this doesn&#x27;t happen to others.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because it&#x27;s a little too greasy. I live in Hawaii and I&#x27;m always out hiking, swimming, and paddling. I also have fair skin. Luckily this sunscreen works well for preventing sunburns. I also like that it&#x27;s safe to use. I switched to the Honest Co. when I read reports that several top name products were unhealthy for females. I was having hormonal issues for a long time. Ever since I switched products, I haven&#x27;t had any issues. Was it the sunscreen? Who knows.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my little one this past weekend. Reapplied more than suggested. She still burnt. I will be tossing this in the garbage and finding a new product to try! Can&#x27;t risk it. I feel so terrible.</li>
            <li> I also bought the Costco two pack.  I only used in on myself several weeks ago at the beach and I burned a little bit, even though I spent 90% of the time under an umbrella.  I thought it was maybe a fluke.  One of my sons is very fair and the last sunscreen I used on him didn&#x27;t prevent him from burning, so today I put the Honest co. sunscreen on him and on myself again.  My other three kids used a different sunscreen.  Those three didn&#x27;t burn at all, and I only put it on them once.  The one who used Honest co. sunscreen is a LOBSTER, head to toe.  And in spite of once again spending the entire day under the umbrella, I am burned as well (except for my back, which I use a spray sunscreen on).  I will never use this stuff again and am returning what I have left to Costco.  I&#x27;m really disappointed as I have loved all other Honest co. products that I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> The tube is quite small; however, a little dot goes a long way. The consistency is very thick and greasy but it covers the skin well and does not wash or wipe off easily in the water. Does not have much of a scent. Overall, I am very happy with this product. I can tell it is protecting my son&#x27;s skin I only wish it was available in larger sizes.</li>
            <li> bought this from costco on a whim and it will be going back.  I liberally applied and re-applied and not only does it have a disgusting greasy texture that doesn&#x27;t even come off well in the shower, but I am extremely sun burnt. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this stuff because I do like the honest company but both my kids used it and we were only out for an hour and both kids are pink. I&#x27;m very disappointed. What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 2 year old daughter because I was looking for a mineral sunscreen with no chemicals in it. It is so greasy that I had to give her a bath after using it everytime or her hair looks like a greasy disgusting mess. And you have to scrub vigorously to get it off in the bath. Even after her first bath it wasnt all off. I&#x27;m disappointed with this sunscreen and will NEVER buy it again and definately wouldnt reccomend it to ANYONE!! I will be looking for another safe sunscreen and returning this one.  I also thought it didn&#x27;t provide sun protection because she was bright red after using it and playing outside for an hour but it was actually a bad rash. She still has the rash and it&#x27;s been 4 days since I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen that I will use on both myself and my children.  My youngest had severe eczema and he never reacted to this lotion at all.  It applies nicely not like some of the other more natural sunscreens that go on like glue and are impossible to rub in.  The spray that they sell is great as well!</li>
            <li> I bought this brand at Coscto and thought it would be a great brand considering the ingredients. After putting it on my kids before a beach day- I noticed after a short time they were pink. Put more on and they came home with a sunburn! I&#x27;ve told everyone I know not to buy this product. Other family members had the same problem. Not good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worst product I&#x27;ve ever bought. It is sooo greasy. Like oil slick- just gross. And you have to scrub to get it off. Plus it doesn&#x27;t work. Awful. Used once and my husband insisted we toss it.</li>
            <li> A greasy mess - I tried to shake it but it still came out as oil - and even stained my shirt! On top of that, I got a sunburn!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is actually amazing!! It&#x27;s one of the few i&#x27;ve discovered that has Zinc as an active ingredient and NO Titanium Dioxide which is a potential carcinogen. All the ingredients is exactly what you need to look for in UVA/UVB protection. Not sure why everyone&#x27;s saying they got burned, Maybe not reapplying, wearing hats, protective clothing (common sense). I haven&#x27;t had ANY issues and I&#x27;m Irish/French. I&#x27;m whiter than paper and do not tan. I burn.</li>
            <li> I got the worst sunburn of my life using this sunscreen, my sister had bought it from Costco.  She returned it when we got home from the beach.  After a trip to my dermatologist, he recommended Blue Lizard Sunscreen, so I ordered some online and it&#x27;s the best sunscreen I have ever used.  I haven&#x27;t had any sunburns since. Buyer beware on this product!!!</li>
            <li> I would never use this product again. Using Honest sunscreen resulted in the worst sunburn I have ever had!</li>
            <li> I Have been using both the tube and the spray on myself and my child when we are outside in the park, playing at splash pads, swimming, hanging out  at the beach etc and it has worked fine. We allowed product to dry a minimum of 15 minutes as directed before, and applied after 40 minutes of continous water play and/after toweling down and/or  every 1.5 to 2 hours of playing outside. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is the white it leaves on my skin but most of the other chemical free eco friendly mineral based blocks I have used have alway left a while film on my skin. I do have eczema but ever since switching to the honest products, and drinking lots of water, I haven&#x27;t had an exacerbation In a little over a year.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sunscreen for my toddler.  I will agree that the sunscreen is sticky and not the easiest to apply but it works! I generally apply about 10 minutes prior to water exposure but we&#x27;ve played for hours without reapplication (yes, I&#x27;m horrible) and she hasn&#x27;t been burned for two summers.  I&#x27;ve never used the sunscreen on myself but my daughter has never expressed irritation with itching or shown signs of skin irritation by way of rash, etc.</li>
            <li> This sunsreen does a poor job of protecting from the sun. Not only is it extremely greasy, but it streaks and runs once you are in the sun for any length of time resulting in terrible sunburns.</li>
            <li> Love using the natural sunscreen. I apply often and my kids have yet to get burned using it.</li>
            <li> If by &amp;#34;broad spectrum protection&amp;#34; you mean &amp;#34;blistering, scorching sunburn, the likes of which you&#x27;ve never seen before...&amp;#34; then yes, this is an HONEST and accurate description of the product.  I&#x27;m usually quite vigilant about my sun protection and I have that lucky olive skin tone that rarely burns even with prolonged and direct exposure to the strongest of rays on a warm August day, but this s*** right here... let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s three days later and I&#x27;m still the color of an over-boiled lobster with added red dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I have to chose between being exposed to carcinogenic chemicals in sunscreen or using &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; free alternatives from now on, I think I&#x27;ll take my chances with chemically induced cancer over spontaneous human combustion.  At least skin cancer has the possibility of a decent survival rate if caught early.  You can&#x27;t do much once you&#x27;ve been set ablaze by your own desire to be environmentally conscious and free of parabens.</li>
            <li> I agree with the majority of the posters here: steer clear of this product.  My daughter breaks out in little bumps from &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; sunscreen, so I too was excited when Costco offered a natural alternative in this Honest Company sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After, spending the summer at the beach using Walmart sunscreen without any sunburns, my daughter had built up quite a base tan.  Yesterday, we went to the beach and she used used Honest Co. for the first time.  She came home with the most horrible sunburn ever!  The rest of the family used Walmart brand sunscreen, and none of us burned - she was the only one, and she applied more than any of the rest of us (also, she is more olive toned than any of the rest of us).  Therefore, the only problems came from this horrible sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be returning to Costco for a refund.  Protect your skin, and buy a different product.</li>
            <li> While this was easy to spread, it seems that the changes they made to the formula mucked something up.  We used this on our children&#x27;s faces, and they ended up becoming very pink (nearly burned) after being out in the sun for about an hour.  This did not perform to the level of other SPF 30+ sunscreens, so I can not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worthless. I may as well have used Crisco oil on my skin. After applying several times, despite the nasty, greasy, heavy layer it leaves behind, I still got an awful sunburn. Really? Honest company, you need to STOP selling this product. Everyone who has this product for sale, or who has purchased this product, THROW IT AWAY!!!! You&#x27;ll sooner get melanoma than any protection from the sun with this bona fide CRAP they are selling you. Shame on the honest company. I hope a class action lawsuit puts you in your place, Miss Alba!</li>
            <li> I am not sure why this has gotten such horrible ratings. We have tried several non-chemical sunscreens and this one is a favorite. Some of the ones we have tried smell very weird--this has a neutral odor. It does feel a bit greasy when it goes on--this is most noticeable on the face--but I am just so thankful it does not go on white. Some natural sunscreens seem to just sit on the surface of the skin and won&#x27;t rub in no matter how hard you try. That bothers me more than a little greasy texture. We have used this for over a month now on all our outings and water trips in 80+ degree weather and the only time I got burned is when I failed to rub this on my legs. My children have gotten pink cheeks only when I have failed to reapply after an hour and a half--user error. When used as designed, this is an excellent natural product, in this mom&#x27;s opinion. I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Smells so bad.... you end up smelling like fried food, i didnt tan as much but only because i used it around 5pm, when the sun its not as strong, but it smells like you are literally putting vegetable oil. I bought it because it has the one ingredient that really protect you from the sun, it has a high percentage of  zinc Oxide, but with all those oils, i really dont trust it. im returning it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible. I put this on myself, a 3 and 5 year old and we all got major sunburn. We applied it at home prior to leaving the house for the beach.</li>
            <li> First use, we applied as we would any other sunblock - just before getting into the pool. We all got burned.&lt;br /&gt;Second use, I followed the instructions - applied, had the kids eat a snack for 20 minutes while it dried, reapplied after 45 minutes of swimming. We still all got burned.&lt;br /&gt;This is hands-down the worst sunblock we have ever used. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why there are so many negative reviews here.  I live at 9000 ft so the sun is very, very strong and I find that this sunscreen works as well as any other natural sunscreen on the market but with fewer ingredients and no chemicals.  It&#x27;s greasy yes, but that is better than being so thick that it can&#x27;t be rubbed in.  My 13 month old does get a little tan with this product but she is in the sun for hours and does not burn.  I like that this new product has 80 minutes of water resistance vs the previous 40.  My daughter does not mind it and it doesn&#x27;t burn her eyes.  I will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this! I&#x27;ll take the synthetic chemicals over skin cancer from severe sun burn!</li>
            <li> This ranks very good on EWG&#x27;s sunscreen list and I really appreciate what the company is trying to do, but as other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s VERY greasy. I&#x27;m going back to Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li> I received this in a gift basket and was excited to try an all natural sunscreen. Unfortunately, I found it rather unusable.  It was too oily and thick to use under make up and caused anything I put on top of it to slide off immediately. My face felt extremely greasy through out the day and after an hour I just wanted to wash myself clean.  The texture seems similar to the organic healing balm -which is wonderful and works wonders because it is nice and thick- so don&#x27;t judge the brand by this one product.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at all the negative reviews.  I am very sensitive to most sunscreens, getting itchy red bumps with repeated use.  This sunscreen by the Honest Company does not give me any reaction.  It feels somewhat oily going on but seems to absorb very quickly and no longer looks or feels greasy soon after applying.  I do not find it white or any off color when applying; seems to blend in to my skin very well.  It doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;tropical&amp;#34; scent but I&#x27;m sure that just adds to it&#x27;s natural claims.  I am very pleased with this  product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is incredibly oily.  Furthermore, it does not actually protect as a 30 SPF, more like a 15 SPF.  Very minimal sun blockage.  The plastic wrap on the outside of the tube is falling off after a couple of uses and you end up covered in plastic and oily residue after application. Do not buy this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I would give this zero stars if I could. Please do not buy this sunscreen!!&lt;br /&gt;Was getting ready for my vacation and I wanted to go the natural route so was excited to see this at Costco.  Unfortunately my boyfriend and I burned horribly using this stuff. Almost as if there is no spf in this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I did more harm to my skin using this product than I would have using regular sunscreen. Save your skin and money!</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen because I thought it was a regular physical sunscreen that was good for kids.  I stay away from chemical sunscreens because my son has sensitive skin.  After putting this sunscreen on him, he started crying and screaming that his skin was burning.  After I washed it off, every spot that I put this on him was red and bumpy, full of hives.  It was only on him for a few minutes and very sparingly too.  His skin also became inflamed around his eyes, on his eyelids, even though I didn&#x27;t even put it directly there.  HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> This did not work for us. We&#x27;ve tried a few all natural sunscreens, and this seems to be the least effective of them all.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen back in May, at Target, for my one year old son. I did a lot of research before purchasing. I didn&#x27;t want to use a sunscreen full of chemicals on him. It was between honest company and badger sunscreen. I found the honest company in the store so I decided to try that one first. Even though it is a pain to rub in, my son spends hours outside in and out of the pool all hours of the day. He has not burned at all. Even without reapplying. I let it set in for about 15 mins and by the time he&#x27;s outside playing he&#x27;s good to go.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen (actually, we prefer the aerosol version and the face sticks, but in a pinch use this squeeze bottle). Very hard to rub in compared to &amp;#34;typical store brands,&amp;#34; but have never had a sunburn since switching and I feel much better putting something natural on my kids.</li>
            <li> If you want to burn then get this product , if not get something better at your local CVS.</li>
            <li> If you want a nice SUNBURN this is the product for you, purchase at costco and used 3x what was suggested and still burned my children......</li>
            <li> Great product, great sun protection.  Have used this product all summer on a toddler who enjoys the outdoors.  Our day at the beach ended with smiles and not a touch of pink skin.  Using a product with no chemicals is worth a little extra time rubbing it in and cleaning off hands.  Thank you Honest Co.</li>
            <li> I got badly burned using this sunscreen.  I am now extremely wary of using any other products from this company.  I returned the sunscreen, which is something I have never had to do before.  Very upset and disappointed.</li>
            <li> IF people are getting burned, it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re not using this product properly. I have been using it on my 1 year old and you can barely tell she&#x27;s been in the sun. We&#x27;ve been swimming outdoors and playing outside all summer at the appropriate hours. When the sun is really strong, you should really limit your time outside. How about keeping an eye on your children and covering them up when they start getting pink instead of waiting for them to fry and blister?&lt;br /&gt;The honest sunscreen is great at protecting. Only downfall is that it&#x27;s a little thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.  My family got fried after not even two hours in the sun and not going iin the water.  I am peeling from head to toe.  I honestly wondered iif it was a tanning lotion after that day.  We still had to be out on the sun the next day but we wore shirts and purchased a much better brand product and had no issues .  steer clear</li>
            <li> It burned my nine month olds super soft baby skin! We went to the beach and applied it to both my children (9 month and 3 yrs) 20 minutes prior to going to the beach. My son started looking a little red and I thought maybe it had washed off in the water, so I reapplied a different sunscreen. He was fine. However my nine-month-old got fried! I felt so bad for her. Her cousins applied the same sunscreen (age 2 and 3) and they got a little red but not Sunburnt, so maybe it depends on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;People saying they have used this product for years maybe have the older version. I read they reformulated it this year and that&#x27;s when all the problems and d reviews started.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest not taking the chance on your children and buy something different until they fix the issue.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I got burned on the beach, even after reapplying every hour! We decided to sit under the tent the next day and, even with the sunscreen lathered on, burned even more! It&#x27;s ineffective as a sunscreen!</li>
            <li> We recently purchased some Honest Company SPF 30 sunscreen for our beach trip and were very disappointed. The sunscreen has an interesting neutral odor, which I found pleasing, but otherwise there is not much good I can report. As many reviewers have noted, the sunscreen simply does not protect very well against the sun. My wife applied (and re-applied) quite a bit of the sunscreen on our first beach day and ended the day with large blotchy sunburns. I am sure some of the problem derives from the sunscreen formulation, and I also noted that the sunscreen has a thick consistency--more along the lines of a paste than a lotion--which makes it hard to spread for good coverage without a really meticulous application, after which you will have used up a good bit of your $14 tube of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Twice now I have been sunburned. Shame on me. I should&#x27;ve learned my lesson the first time and thrown this stuff in the garbage. My husband now has blisters from the most severe sunburn he has ever had in his life and he didn&#x27;t even go swimming! Reapplying does nothing.</li>
            <li> Does not work! All 3 of my children aged 8-12 and myself all burned in spite of reapplying frequently. Do not buy! Do not use! Too bad, I had such high hopes for this product. Will go back to Badger Balm that actually uses the correct amount of Zinc oxide. Shame on you Honest for not owning up!</li>
            <li> Worst greasy oil like substance, horrible. Also doesn&#x27;t protect you from anything but people wanting to touch you!</li>
            <li> We have been using this sunscreen for our two children without any issues for about a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply the sunscreen as directed but more often then suggested because our children have very light skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course we take other precautions as well as suggested by the CDC and the AAP: UV rash guards, hats, and limiting our sun exposure between 10 and 4.</li>
            <li> I applied exactly as directions said- before entering sun as well as every 45 minutes to an hour and on two separate occasions my kids were burnt.  The worst. Makes me never want to buy an honest brand item again.</li>
            <li> I am so surprised to see so many negative reviews of this product. While I haven&#x27;t purchased the sunscreen in the new design of packaging (maybe a new formulation?) we have used their sunscreen (the blue tube, blue bottle spray and white stick) for years on our children with no complaints. Does it stay white on your skin? Yes! I would rather my kid look like a ghost than be slathered in chemicals. Is it greasy? Yes, not terribly but yes. Again, a trade off to loose the chemical laden products that I used to use. The spray we use by honest company is not greasy (but it&#x27;s even whiter). But I can say with certaintity that my children have never been sunburned while using this product. I hope there wasn&#x27;t a re formulation of the product that&#x27;s causing all these bad reviews!  Edit to add: my review is on the old formulation with 20% zinc oxide, not the new formulation with 9%</li>
            <li> I bought this in desperation one day before spending a day walking in the sun with friends. I&#x27;m fair skinned and burn really easily, so I reapplied at least once an hour, sometimes more often and STILL got burned. The texture is pretty gross--heavy and greasy and it separated after two weeks so I almost didn&#x27;t feel bad tossing it. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I thought I would love this sunscreen based its the natural ingredients. Boy was I wrong. It goes on totally greasy and doesn&#x27;t soak in. It leaves a white film on your greasy skin that rubs off on dark clothes. Total fail.</li>
            <li> Stays a bit greasy and doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb.  Gets on my clothes if I&#x27;m sweating.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive and fair skin and this sunscreen works for me!!!</li>
            <li> I have to agree this is a terrible sunscreen. I live in Hawaii and am out in the sun a lot and rarely do I burn.I went for an hours hike and applied this sunscreen liberally. I was very burned at the end of my hike.It&#x27;s like I&#x27;d never applied any sunscreen. Only my face was spared because I&#x27;d put on my usual face cream with 15 SPF.</li>
            <li> The new &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; formula just doesn&#x27;t cut it. I am a guy, applied and re-applied it liberally and still ended up getting bad sunburns on my neck and arms (I was wearing sleeveless shirt). Thank goodness for my cap, long trousers and closed shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all, still got burnt. attached a photo as well.</li>
            <li> How is anyone rating this more than one star???  Here is my open letter to the owners and management of &amp;#34;The Honest Company&amp;#34;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Honest Company Management,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it greatly discouraging you have responded to justifiable criticisms about your sunscreen suggesting your product is effective and worth standing behind. My wife and I both used your sunscreen (purchased from Costco) on a single day this past May. All we did was sit in some bleachersfor a few hours - no pools, no activity. We both got extremely burned despite reapplying your product every 45-60 minutes. Your &amp;#34;SPF30&amp;#34; sunscreen product is the single WORST health and beauty product I have ever purchased, honestly. You should be embarrassed to stand behind a product that is so clearly ineffective and leaving people dangerously exposed to sunburns as a result...seems like a giant class action lawsuit waiting to happen. Please fix your product and own up to the fact your product has FAILED its consumers. Without a demonstrated commitment regain your customer&#x27;s trust, your company is rightfully doomed to fail.</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado at high altitude where sun protection is vital. Like any natural sunscreen, you have to reapply it often. Zinc oxide can clump together, so you have to make sure it&#x27;s on the skin evenly. It also needs to be on pretty thick. When we are in the water, I&#x27;m reapplying it at least every hour. Yes, we go through a lot of it. But to me, it&#x27;s money well spent knowing my kids aren&#x27;t being exposed to harmful chemicals. My family has experienced no allergies or other skin reactions, it doesn&#x27;t sting their eyes, and after three years of using Honest brand on my three children, we have experienced ZERO sunburns. It&#x27;s the only sunscreen we use.</li>
            <li> Super greasy and my whole family got burnt after using this today. I even reapplied a couple of times within a two hour period because we were swimming. Horrible. Buy another natural sunscreen. Sunny Babies is amazing.</li>
            <li> like many other reviewers, I purchased the double pack of this sunscreen at Costco.  While I can&#x27;t say it offered zero protection, I would not recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.  This morning I forgot my usual face sunscreen and applied the Honest sunscreen to my legs, arms, face and neck.  My arms and legs are extremely moisturized and do not seem burned after my day at camp.  My face and neck, however, did not fare so well.  My face looks like I am the offspring of a well cooked lobster and the itching is intense.  My neck feels burnt and is itching like I have been stung by mosquitos.  This is painful!</li>
            <li> I have never complained about a sunscreen before. But both my daughter and I burned while wearing this, even with reapplication. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This product does not work, Received a terrible sunburn after one hour at the beach&lt;br /&gt;The product was purchased at costco&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful</li>
            <li> I agree with all the other one stars. This sunscreen does not work. After repeated applications on my three kids and myself, we are all lobsters. This is very unfortunate since I thought I found a more &#x27;natural&#x27; sunscreen. Guess I&#x27;ll be buying some hats and swim shirts.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible. I bought it on the board walk in Venice beach and got absolutely friend. I thought it was my fault but today I went whale watching and put it on twice in a span of 2 hours and I am fried</li>
            <li> I made the terrible mistake of thinking that sunscreen is a commodity, and pulled the Honest Company one in haste from the Target shelf. I liked the Honest Company diapers, so I thought I could trust this brand.  But after using it for a summer, my poor 1-year old&#x27;s skin is as sun-burnt and dark as ever since he enjoys playing outside. My son is a Chinese/Caucasian hybrid, and his current skin tone is literally African, especially his legs. I&#x27;m so, so ashamed of myself for not checking reviews before relying on this sunscreen to protect the apple of my eye. The Honest Company deserves to be sued!!!</li>
            <li> The new formula is not as good as the old one. I had been using this product for quite some time but the las time I bought it didnt do the job. Its really greesy and it does not protect my skin as the old formula used to. Had to stop using it and by another organic brand. Very disappointing since I love all the cleaning products. I just hope they dont start changing the formulas on other products for worse as they grow just to be more profitable. I had high hopes for this company.</li>
            <li> Unlike most  sunscreens that say to reapply after 80 minutes, this needs to be reapplied after 45, which is why people may be getting burned. Reapplying every two hours is not sufficient. I reapplied every 45 minutes and neither myself nor my daughter got burned in Hawaii. However, I found this excessively sticky and difficult to remove, and if playing in sand, the sand became impossible to get off. It was as bad as Blue Lizard.  I went back to Neutrogena and found it much easier to apply, remove, and I didn&#x27;t have to reapply every 45 minutes. I wouldn&#x27;t get this again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Target in 2014 and the product was 20% zinc oxide and worked wonderfully! When I saw it at Costco in a 2-pack, I happily bought it for the summer of 2015. I was sorely disappointed as this Honest sunscreen is NOT the same formula as the original tube I bought. The ingredients are different (only 9.3% zinc oxide) and it is extremely greasy and DOES NOT WORK. The original tube is blue (like the picture on this product listing) but the ones from Costco are light blue/white with sunbeams on the front. I will be returning these tubes to Costco and hopefully they will refund my money. Very disappointed seeing as though not only did I use this on my own fair skin, I used it on my 6 year old, 3 year old and 9 month old. Thank goodness I discovered that it didn&#x27;t work before we went to the water park all day tomorrow!!</li>
            <li> As someone that has made my own very effective natural sunscreen for years I can say that my experience with this product was satisfactory prior to the reformulation with less zinc oxide. After the reformulation it&#x27;s essentially ineffective for any reasonable amount of time. While I love Honest&#x27;s Company&#x27;s diapers, until the zinc oxide is brought back up to the 20-25% range we won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> Purchased this at Costco and after only an hour in the sun my 3 year old had near blistering sunburn on his neck.  Not enough Zinc Oxide in this product to be an SPF 30 as advertises.  I really wanted to love Jessica Albas product but we definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing this sunscreen again unless they change it back to the original formula.</li>
            <li> Honest needs to develop a safer sunscreen! This company is known for its eco friendly, baby friendly products. They should be ashamed by the number of people who have gotten burned by this product. I will not be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I have no idea what is going on in the media against this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the active ingredient is zinc oxide, which is the ORIGINAL SUNSCREEN before more toxic chemicals began sneaking into sunscreen in the past few decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, other brands like Badger WITH THE SAME ACTIVE INGREDIENT, ZINC OXIDE, are highly rated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, my personal review, this stuff is BETTER than Badger. It applies easier and covers more skin. It works for the labeled 40 minutes. My family spent an entire week at the beach in FL with a UV index over 11 every day, and none of us got burnt. At all. Including my toddler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These pictures of burned kids are horrifying. I don&#x27;t understand it. The only explanation is that parents aren&#x27;t waiting 15 minutes for the stuff to dry before going in the sun and sweating so it&#x27;s coming right off, or they aren&#x27;t reapplying every 40 minutes (30 to be safe) as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Italian family has a history of melanoma deaths on both sides. My wife survived it at an early age. And this is the ONLY sunscreen I will ever use on my family ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long live Jessica Alva.</li>
            <li> This is THE worst scam ever! The FDA recommends that sunscreen has at least 25% zinc oxide , well this &#x27;HONEST&#x27; company not only didn&#x27;t comply and used 20%, but lowered it even more to only include 9% oxide at one point just to satisfy the other complaints that it wasn&#x27;t applying &#x27; smoothly&#x27;. Back to the coppertone, never got burned with the cheaper brands!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really confused about this sunscreen and how I feel about it. I was pleased when I saw the 2 pack at Costco and that it didn&#x27;t contain all the chemicals that I&#x27;m trying to avoid. Today my son and I were in the sun for an 1.5 - 2 hours (which included at least half of that time spent in the shade) and we both got burnt using this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too thick and spreads a little easier than other comparable sunscreen, but it&#x27;s a sunscreen and what good is it if it doesn&#x27;t protect us?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt so awful that I let my toddler get burnt, because at first I thought I must have just forgotten to put on his arms, but his arms were greasy with white sunscreen in the crease of his arm, so I&#x27;m wondering if this sunscreen is actually effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, I&#x27;m going back to Badger sunscreens which Amazon always has in stock!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the worst sunscreen ever. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of different sunscreens and words can&#x27;t come close to describing how terrible this product compares even to the cheapest stuff you find at discount stores. First, the product applies like a layer of grease -- imagine putting melted butter on your skin. Next, the grease doesn&#x27;t wash off, even with vigorous scrubbing and multiple hand washes. Last, and most importantly, the sun protection from this product is about as good as no sunscreen. I was in the sun for less than an hour and my whole family was burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you Jessica Alba.</li>
            <li> Hey hey hey fellow Amazonians (or is it Amazoners? LOL!) It&#x27;s such a beautiful summer day here by the beach and I felt like going to check out the cute life guards (LOL IM GAY!) anywho... I decided to buy the Honest company and wanted to protect my beautiful body from the sun...I heard so many wonderful things about the &amp;#34;honest company&amp;#34; which is ran by Jessica Biel the girl from the Sin City and I think she should really reconsider her career choices! This product was complete junk! I put some under my t-shirt and swim trunks and ended up being roasted in the sun! Not to mention, why isn&#x27;t there a trans-gendered edition?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to take away 4 stars because this bottle did not include a graphic of Caitlyn Jenner.</li>
            <li> I would give this product 0 stars but it&#x27;s not an option. My kids had a painful sunburn after 2 hours at the pool. I reapplied every 30 minutes. Horrible product.</li>
            <li> I have read all the negative reviews and was hesitant to use this for my grandson.  However, I have been using it since the beginning of June and have been completely satisfied.  My daughter in law uses this on our grandson as well, with the same results.  I do have to admit that we do not keep him out in the sun for long periods of time, so that may affect the results.  He is 16 months and has very fair sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the most gross sunscreen I have ever used. Rubbing it into my daughter&#x27;s skin felt like rubbing Vaseline but thicker. It doesn&#x27;t even soak in it just gets everywhere and feels miserable. We live in palm springs where it often gets above 100 degrees and I have to put sunscreen on her everyday before school. Not only did this get all over my car and our clothes but my daughter still got burned! I bought it at target and I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> Bought this at CostCo thinking, &amp;#34;Great, a natural sunscreen with zinc oxide as its base.&amp;#34;  It is the WORST.  Imaging slathering on vegetable oil.  That is how the texture feels.  My daughter put some on for a track meet and, after just an hour, was burnt to a crisp.  I think it&#x27;s about as good as baby oil for preventing sunburn.  Not good.</li>
            <li> Worst sunscreen ever. Feels like bacon grease on your skin and does not let your skin breathe at all. Awful, awful, awful.</li>
            <li> whoa, the only truth about this product is that it HONESTly doesn&#x27;t work. I put this stuff on 20 minutes before I went out in the sun and got destroyed. Absolutely hammered by the sun. I went to a pool party after being in the sun for an hour previously at my sisters house in Phoenix (about 100 degrees out)... I had to explain to everyone, thats not a burn, thats just how organic sunscreen works.... Later I found out that I was in fact burned and now I am pealing all over.... I can&#x27;t eat in public because my skin scales might fall into other patrons dinner plates as I shed my skin walking through a light brisk draft from the air conditioning. Im Mr. Snowman..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, i would stick to something that works.. Or buy a sun shirt. Or better yet, use butter because it would work the same as this expensive slop the Honest Company likes to call sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is the worst sunscreen I have ever used. I was out of 3 and a half hours and applied it twice and I have literally never been so sunburned in my life. I am throwing the rest away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m astonished by all the negative reviews.  I started using this for my kids this summer -- the latest in a long line of products that promise sun protection without harmful chemicals -- and it does the job.  We&#x27;ve used it in the pool, for summer camps, soccer, etc., and we&#x27;ve experienced no sunburn with minimal effort.  I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as harder to rub in than any other product, the smell is neutral and the texture is as expected -- a little thicker than conventional sunscreens, but not noticeably so.  Certainly my kids haven&#x27;t noticed a difference and they find it easy to rub in all by themselves.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen happy that it was &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, well it doesn&#x27;t feel natural when you put it on and it&#x27;s very greasy so you feel sticky and sweaty even before you go out into the sun.  I also felt itchy after I applied, it went away but made me suspicious about this product.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed. I used this sunscreen (applied several times) and got a sunburn while spending the afternoon at the lake. I&#x27;ve never written a review, but I wanted to share this in hopes of keeping others from getting burned!</li>
            <li> I use a variety of products from Honest, most of which including the sunscreen I purchase direct from Honest. I have been thrilled with all of them until today when I tried the sunscreen out on my family. Not wanting to take any chances I made sure all of us reapplied multiple times according to the the directions on the product. We are olive skinned and don&#x27;t easily burn. However today every one of us is a nice shade of red. With the exception of our face, the Honest face stick does its job very well but the sunscreen has made its way to the garbage. Please don&#x27;t take a chance with this one.</li>
            <li> Love their other products, but this is unfortunately not recommended.  I purchased two tubes from Costco in April/May 2015 and they were completely ineffective.  Burnt children and adults all around.  At first I refused to believe it could be the sunscreen, but after a few tries I had to pitch them.  I&#x27;m sure if you get a good batch it&#x27;s wonderful, but it seems risky.</li>
            <li> My family of 5 used this sunscreen yesterday and all 5 of us are very burnt. You might as well slather yourself in baby oil because that is how well it works!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any burning problems, but then again I take apply liberally to heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use this sunscreen on my toddler. I Hate the texture. It&#x27;s always so very greasy, it&#x27;s a nightmare of slippery baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I haven&#x27;t had any problems with her getting burnt, or even tan. Maybe people aren&#x27;t applying enough because the texture leads them to believe they need less.</li>
            <li> We used this while hiking through the desert for 2 days in 103 degree heat.  We hardly got a tan.  I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the greasy texture, but it worked very well in protecting us from the sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to see there are so many people who had such a negative experience with this sunscreen. While I did not purchase mine from Amazon (or Costco, where it seems several people purchased from), I purchased from The Honest Company website, and had no issues. Everyone in my family has a fair complexion and we used this sunscreen at the pool with no issues. We also made sure to reapply according to the directions. Again, sorry so many people had a terrible experience, but our experience was great and we will continue to use this brand and many of its products, as we have for the past three years.</li>
            <li> Protecting from UVA and UVB require specific components that require testing and confirmation. I learned this sadly after trying this junk.  Doesn&#x27;t stay on and doesn&#x27;t protect.  If a &amp;#34;movie star&amp;#34; wasn&#x27;t selling this it wouldn&#x27;t be on Amazon.  I would just as soon have brain surgery performed by Ms Alba as purchase this junk</li>
            <li> This is the worst sunscreen I have ever purchased.  It was basically worthless even after following directions.  DO NOT purchase if you care about your skin at all.</li>
            <li> Wow. Wish I would have read reviews of this sunscreen before using it on my whole family. Thanks to this terrible sunscreen my 3 year old and 5 year old got their first sun burns! That&#x27;s after only an hour and a half in the sun. Terrible product. Don&#x27;t buy and don&#x27;t trust your skin with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Very poor protection. Reapplied every two hours during a day in the sun with no swimming or staying and was burned.</li>
            <li> I like that the Honest Company uses natural products that are safe for small infants. While some reviewers have complained that the sunscreen left their child burnt, I think the problem with the product is that you need to lather on 10 times as much to get the same effect as other sunscreens. While eco friendly, this sunscreen is not economically friendly because after about 10-15 uses, you need to buy another. Once my daughter turned one, I switched to another formula that was much easier to apply and lasted much longer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t read these reviews before I bought this.... :( I used it today and definitely got burnt! I bought it because I am pregnant and didn&#x27;t want to put anything with harsh chemicals on my body. Unfortunately this product was the wrong choice and I got burnt (I applied it liberally and before I even got to the beach).  It needs to be taken off the market.  Amazon STOP selling this!</li>
            <li> To all the parents with burnt children this is your fault, nothing to do with Honest.&lt;br /&gt;This is SPF30, that means a sun protection factor of 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;NOT one hour or two hours but thirty minutes. You need to reapply every 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;At least understand how to use a product before trying to damage a company&#x27;s reputation.</li>
            <li> I ordered this sunscreen because it was on the EWG&#x27;S list of recommended sunscreens. I do not like the consistency of it. It seemed to work OK as the kids didn&#x27;t get burnt in the sun but I felt that I needed to apply it more often. There are a few other options on the EWG list that I prefer - babyganics being one of them.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Honest brand sunscreen for almost two years and it has worked excellent &amp; when I say that, I mean excellent for any sunscreen not just natural sunscreens.  I have had skin cancer &amp; so I need a product that works &amp; has much safer ingredients than then other chemical based sunscreens.  I have used both the old formula &amp; recently have been using the new formula purchased at Costco with the same excellent results.  This past weekend I applied the new formula to my 3yr old son &amp; he was in &amp; out of the water for 2-3 hours without any redness.  I applied to myself &amp; I was out in the sun for 3-4 hours with no redness.  I wanted to give my review so people will not be scared away from using this product by recent bad reviews on the Today Show.  Having watched parents not properly apply sunscreen over &amp; over again, it is my guess that that there is a very good chance that it was “user error” , not applying enough or not applying it soon enough (30 min before sun exposure) are the two most common errors I have witnessed.  Another failure could be product separation which can be fixed by kneading the tube to mix it.  If this product can protect a 45 year old bald surfer with pale skin, then it should be fine for everyone, just remember to read the directions when applying.</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii, I get burnt easy and have used many sunblocks so I know what I&#x27;m talking about! They had this sunscreen at Costco so I bought it. Me and my kids covered ourselves with it and all of us were feeling burned and itchy within an hour. We went home and all of us had sunburns!</li>
            <li> This is the worst sunscreen. I bought a double pack from Costco before our beach trip this summer. We used the first day and we all ended up with a sunburn. I threw both tubes out that evening. Will never use again. Do not purchase and waste your money on this product!  It is horrible. There are other natural sunscreens that actually work.</li>
            <li> Same issue that everyone else is having.  We got ours directly from Honest and it was like not even putting anything on.  Kids&#x27; arms and wife&#x27;s shoulders were burned after less than an hour in the sun.  Not sure if it&#x27;s an shelf life problem (not expired according to the date on the product), quality control issue, or the company is just trying to save money but not putting enough protective ingredients, but stay away from this brand.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this sunscreen but it turned out to be much greasier than expected, not to mention that it didn&#x27;t protect my kids as much from the sun!  Was happier with the honest sunscreen stick. Will probably not buy this honest cream sunscreen again.</li>
            <li> Greasy, hard to rub in, and does not protect from getting sunburnt! Got burned while wearing this all over out in the sun for only an hour!! This needs to be reformulated. This can&#x27;t be SPF 30......</li>
            <li> I have a 19-month-old blue-eyed, blond-haired, extremely fair-skinned little girl. I have exclusively used Honest sunscreen on her since she was old enough for sunscreen (after 6 months), and she has never once had a sunburn. She is outdoors most of the day during the summer, swimming in our backyard. We have gone through several tubes of this sunscreen and besides the fact that it does have a greasy texture, I have zero complaints. I have also used it on myself without any problems, and like my daughter, I have very, very pale skin (sometimes even the lightest shade of makeup is too dark for me). I am shocked by all the reviews saying that people have experienced sunburns after using this sunscreen. The only thing I can think of is that maybe there is a bad batch out there. I&#x27;ve used tubes that I ordered directly from Honest.com, and I have never purchased it from a retail store or Costco.</li>
