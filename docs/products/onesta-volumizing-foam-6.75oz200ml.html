            <li>I imagine the products are wonderful).  </li>
            <li>Excellent product...keeps the hold without any stiffness!</li>
            <li>and I find it particularly wonderful for fine,light hair.  </li>
            <li>This is great to use if your going to tease your hair and finish with a spray.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m soooo happy I found him one.</li>
            <li>This product is a good value.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use (just spread the foam on the scalp/ root before blow-drying), and it smells great.</li>
            <li>This hair mouse is amazing.</li>
            <li>I also have allergies and the very light scent does not bother me.</li>
            <li>Love ONESTA products and this one did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li>Ok but not quality of the Gefden product</li>
            <li>I wish Onesta would release their list of ingredients so we could be better informed consumers as they advertise their products as being \\&quot;natural.\\&quot;  Too many man-made chemicals for me...</li>
            <li>I love most of Onestas product line.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Onesta Volumizing Foam.  </li>
            <li>Most of all, it gives the hair</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with how much lift this gives to my super fine hair, and I love this brand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good to my scalp, and makes my hair feel pretty natural with some added volume and shine.</li>
            <li>and I imagine they are all true.  </li>
            <li>Most are very moisturizing, but not the volumizing foam...</li>
            <li>My beautician recommended this product - great hold for thinning hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>Still really good, but unfortunately not the same.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I have never been a fan of styling foams, but I fell in love with this one like no other.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and many styling products weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>I did the first time I used it</li>
            <li>Now, next project is to find a shampoo he would like :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product non-stop, for almost 2 years, since my hair stylist first used it on me while styling my hair.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Onesta products based on the positive reviews I read</li>
            <li>One of the best volumizers I&#x27;ve used-doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard/sticky and only need a very small amount.</li>
            <li>(that is why I believe the other reviews are true and accurate--</li>
            <li>I really like that it&#x27;s organic, and doesn&#x27;t have all the additives that the others do.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t make the mistake of using too much...</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to attract bugs (we live in a very buggy area, so</li>
            <li>It is one I have been tested for and am highly allergic to.  </li>
            <li>When I do, it is strong enough to hold my hair back</li>
            <li>The problem I have is that I am extremely allergic to many chemicals in personal care products.  </li>
            <li>Helps hold natural curls in place.</li>
            <li>Light hold without stiff feeling.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, so it&#x27;s difficult to have full volume.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty hard to find, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>(I only use it right above my ears to keep my hair slightly pushed back from my face) but light enough not to make my hair oily looking.</li>
            <li>I like the new label and logo but the product seems different.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li>Apparently the bottle was damaged and the contents leaked out.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It is light, has a more natural base and doesn&#x27;t leave any stickiness or stiffness to the hair.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but the right product for my hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t review this particular item as the bottle arrived empty.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair and does give it some gentle body so it will hold a style throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair that could use volume.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love ONESTA products and this one did not disappoint.  Light hold without stiff feeling.  Helps hold natural curls in place.</li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of styling foams, but I fell in love with this one like no other.  It is light, has a more natural base and doesn&#x27;t leave any stickiness or stiffness to the hair. It does give my hair some volume and helps with the styling process.  It also protects the hair from the sun rays.  I will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I like the new label and logo but the product seems different. Still really good, but unfortunately not the same.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, so it&#x27;s difficult to have full volume. This is great to use if your going to tease your hair and finish with a spray.</li>

            <li> I used to have thick, dark hair which has now turned white and thinned out considerably. This was recommended to me by a friend and is the Holy Grail of volumizers. All of the others I have tried left my hair &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; feeling and weighted down. This is perfect! Be careful not to use too much. I did the first time I used it and it made my hair feel stiff and dry. No more than 3 pumps!</li>
            <li> Ok but not quality of the Gefden product</li>
            <li> This product is pretty hard to find, but well worth it. It makes my hair stay in place (if I use it on wet hair), while I let it air dry. It&#x27;s very good to my scalp, and makes my hair feel pretty natural with some added volume and shine. Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to attract bugs (we live in a very buggy area, so I try to stay with products that don&#x27;t have a scent). I really like that it&#x27;s organic, and doesn&#x27;t have all the additives that the others do. Don&#x27;t make the mistake of using too much...one pump it plenty. [[ASIN:B003PIYC44 Onesta Volumizing Foam 6.76oz]]</li>
            <li> I have fine hair (each hair is thin) and not much of it. I only use a small amount.  When I do, it is strong enough to hold my hair back (I only use it right above my ears to keep my hair slightly pushed back from my face) but light enough not to make my hair oily looking.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Onesta products based on the positive reviews I read and I imagine they are all true.  The problem I have is that I am extremely allergic to many chemicals in personal care products.  I scoured the internet yet could not find a list of ingredients on the Onesta products.  I decided to take a chance and order anyway.  Unfortunately everything I ordered is going back without being tried (that is why I believe the other reviews are true and accurate--I imagine the products are wonderful).  This product, the Volumizing Foam, has Diazolidinyl Urea which is a formaldehyde releasing agent.  It is one I have been tested for and am highly allergic to.  It also has PEG and PPG in it, which if I am not mistaken, are glycols.  I wish Onesta would release their list of ingredients so we could be better informed consumers as they advertise their products as being \\&quot;natural.\\&quot;  Too many man-made chemicals for me...</li>
            <li> I love most of Onestas product line. Most are very moisturizing, but not the volumizing foam...it dried my hair out with just one use and only got worse as I continued to use it a few more times.</li>
            <li> This hair mouse is amazing. I&#x27;ve been trying to get my husband to give up his store brand hair product and choose a healthier option, without all the harsh chemicals a normal hair product comes with ...but everything I tried he didn&#x27;t like it. I spent a lot of money buying some of the most expensive brands out there and he will always go back to his regular one....until I ordered him the onesta...and he loves it!!!!!! He says it works just like his brand, so it&#x27;s a keeper.  I&#x27;m soooo happy I found him one. Now, next project is to find a shampoo he would like :)</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and many styling products weigh it down.  I LOVE the Onesta Volumizing Foam.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; .  I also have allergies and the very light scent does not bother me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product...keeps the hold without any stiffness!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product non-stop, for almost 2 years, since my hair stylist first used it on me while styling my hair. I have fine thin hair that could use volume. This product definitely delivers. It&#x27;s very easy to use (just spread the foam on the scalp/ root before blow-drying), and it smells great. I&#x27;ve tried other volumizing products that smell harsh and chemical-ly. This smells divine. Most of all, it gives the hair body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bottle lasts me about 2-3 months (I wash my hair daily, and use it daily), since all you need is a couple of pumps per use. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> One of the best volumizers I&#x27;ve used-doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard/sticky and only need a very small amount. This product is a good value.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t review this particular item as the bottle arrived empty.  Apparently the bottle was damaged and the contents leaked out.&lt;br /&gt; I use this product, bought from another source and I find it particularly wonderful for fine,light hair.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair and does give it some gentle body so it will hold a style throughout the day.</li>
            <li> My beautician recommended this product - great hold for thinning hair without weighing it down.  Love it. A little pricey, but the right product for my hair.</li>
