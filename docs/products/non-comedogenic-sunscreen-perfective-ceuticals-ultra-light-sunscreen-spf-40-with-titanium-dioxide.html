            <li>I use tons of Bull-Frog and Coppertone and Neutrogena on exposed body parts, but I&#x27;ve never been happy using them on my face.  </li>
            <li>GREAT benefits!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though it provides great protection (SPF 40)</li>

            <li>Living in Florida, I need a good sun block for my face.  </li>
            <li>It contain titanium oxide, the best sun blocker available.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this sunscreen is really nice and it works as a great moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li>I never knew that there was a sunscreen on the market that would &#x27;feel&#x27; so good on my face.</li>
            <li>If you attempt to smell this after using, it is a very pleasant and gentle fragrance, but you need to take a good sniff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I was sent a bottle of this product in exchange for my usage and honest review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I was sent a bottle of this product in exchange for my usage and honest review.</li>
            <li>I received this product as a courtesy from Perfective Ceuticals in exchange for an honest review and put it to the test immediately.</li>
            <li>This lotion provides a nice protective layer under my makeup</li>
            <li>was provided a sample for an unbiased, honest review.</li>
            <li>I love that this sunscreen feels light and has good coverage!</li>
            <li>It goes on light, does not feel oily or greasy, and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I was a bit nervous about trying this since I have never been able to apply sunscreen to my face without it resulting in a breakout of some kind.</li>
            <li>This sun screen is the kind that you can wear every day even to the office where you might want to put a bit of make up on top of the sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It is worth it!!! :)</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s budget-friendly (especially important right now after the holiday shopping</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a good sunscreen with amazing protection!  </li>
            <li>It has nice consistency that is easy to work with&lt;br</li>
            <li>I much prefer a lightweight lotion that absorbs quickly and is still has excellent UV protection over one that I can feel (and see) rubbing off on my hands.</li>
            <li>While it protects my skin great, it is also super light and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>It is a smooth, light formula that has a pleasant smell (reminds me of the beach).  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more once this runs out :--)</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more once this runs out :--)</li>
            <li>The Perfective Ceuticals Ultra-Light Sunscreen SPF 40 is perfect for daily use with or with out makeup!</li>
            <li>A must have daily moisturizer &amp; the perfect makeup primer.</li>
            <li>though I could feel that I had something on, it didn&#x27;t feel sticky and \\&quot;masky\\&quot; as most sunscreens do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before discovering Vichy sun care in France, Shiseido was the favorite line for sunscreen.</li>
            <li>In fact, it seemed moisturized and felt more resilient to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I am better protected from sun damage when using this product</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen as I love everything this company makes.</li>
            <li>Living in California it is so important to wear sunscreen to protect my skin from the harmful rays!</li>
            <li>It goes on light and I wear under my makeup!</li>
            <li>I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love the attractive bottle and high quality pump, and I look forward to using this product for years.</li>
            <li>especially love this sunscreen by Perfective Ceuticals because you can easily wear it under your regular makeup.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and never set foot outside without sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>On one hand, having the chance to try a high-end sunscreen sounded good, but I didn&#x27;t really WANT to try it, just because I avoid needing sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very light and clean.</li>
            <li>The attractive, plastic bottle is very light-weight, and the pump is perfect for small applications.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quite easily and you donâ€™t need to rub your face for ever.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>a lucky coincidence I received an offer to test Perfective Ceuticals sunscreen a week before laser surgery to remove my sun spots, and now I am so pleased to have discovered it.  </li>
            <li>This ultra light sunscreen is so easy to use &amp; is a great habit to get into wearing daily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is also a great daily moisturizer, so you get two important benefits.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer provided me with a free product for review</li>
            <li>So when I had an opportunity to try a free sample of their SPF 40 sunscreen I was excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sunscreen is PERFECT if you need to wear sunscreen everyday.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a blogger and one of the benefits is receiving products for free to test and review, including this product.</li>
            <li>(I enjoy the Jane Iredale line of products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the dispensing bottle giving just the right amount to apply.  </li>
            <li>Normally I use a brush but the tacky surface grabbed at the brush and left a streaky application, but a damp BeautyBlender sponge made my liquid foundation stay on wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and love this product!</li>
            <li>It makes my face look dewy and fresh almost all day!</li>
            <li>I have a family history of melanoma, and my dermatologist told me this summer that I needed to be sure to be wearing sunscreen with a higher SPF.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique; I&#x27;ve never used a sunscreen like this one.  </li>
            <li>Good make up application does not look like you have make it just makes you look better, but other sunscreen I have used tend to attract make up like blush</li>
            <li>/&gt;Feels like a special and luxurious product and the packaging doesn&#x27;t hurt</li>
            <li>Light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for a fragrance free, super light but extremely effective facial sunscreen, I suggest you consider</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and is very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a very mild scent which worried me at first.</li>
            <li>I was expecting the  oily feel that I have experienced with other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>She has a few skin problems also, and finds this product the best she has ever used as it is extremely gentle.</li>
            <li>When I saw the white streaks from the sunscreen in this product, I wasn&#x27;t very happy, and I could actually feel this on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Normally I just make do with Roche-Posay products from my dermatologist&#x27;s office, because most drugstore products just make me break out or itch.</li>
            <li>I like this better than the products I normally purchase from my dermatologist and</li>
            <li>I like this better than the products I normally purchase from my dermatologist and</li>
            <li>And I sweated a LOT because it was very hot.  </li>
            <li>After wearing for several weeks I am very pleased with results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend it because my skin is very sensitive and prone to brown patches and this protects against sun damage better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum and Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy for several months, with amazing results.  </li>
            <li>It takes one pump to do my neck and one for my face, so it&#x27;s economical in usage.</li>
            <li>I love the ease of applying, the light weight feel on my skin &amp; overall the skin protection from the sun.</li>
            <li>The Perfective Ceuticals sunscreen rubs into my skin and is absorbed almost immediately.</li>
            <li>With our intense sun, sunscreen is not only a good idea</li>
            <li>And considering the lovely natural ingredients involved, that propylparaben means that your sunscreen will not be rancid in 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;After researching the ingredients, and then talking them over with chemist, I&#x27;m using and recommending this product.</li>
            <li>It spreads on well and absorbed quickly&lt;br</li>
            <li>was sent this product in order to write an honest and biased review; I will order another one to carry in my purse for occasional touch-ups.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed in putting on this Perfective Ceuticals sunscreen was that it is very creamy and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very pleased that the product never made my skin sting, as most face creams (especially those with sunscreen) tend to do, especially when I get sweaty.  </li>
            <li>It dispenses just the right amount of product with no spitting or leaking, and it isn&#x27;t flimsy.</li>
            <li>It dispenses just the right amount of product with no spitting or leaking, and it isn&#x27;t flimsy.</li>
            <li>The lotion comes in a nice, pale blue tube with a great pump system: this is one of the best packagings Iâ€™ve ever tried for a cream/moisturizer, because it is very sensitive and you get the exact amount of product that you need, without being left with extra on your hand.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have been using it everyday for over a week, and the results are remarkable.</li>
            <li>I gave it the ultimate test when I had to be in the direct sun for a weekend tournament recently, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident that this will last right to the end of the bottle without breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident that this will last right to the end of the bottle without breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I made sure Not to use on my left hand and arm in order to compare the difference.</li>
            <li>I was sent the Ultra-light sunscreen to try and I have to say it is the first sunscreen I have used that doesn&#x27;t make me break out and itch.</li>
            <li>Another winning product by Perfective Ceuticals that will be in my daily regimen for years to come!</li>
            <li>Perfective Ceuticals sunscreen is exactly what I&#x27;ve been needing for my face.  </li>
            <li>I have just recently started using this sunscreen, and I am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>I feel safer already with the higher SPF in this product than in what I&#x27;d been using.  </li>
            <li>It really feels more like a facial</li>
            <li>This is pretty much perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided</li>
            <li>used to wear sunscreen only in the summer, but after a recent &amp;#34;milestone birthday&amp;#34; I realized that I needed to take better care of my skin!</li>
            <li>As it warms to your skin it becomes much easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the price is very comparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the price is very comparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to rub in as it vanishes, while absorbing into the skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Since its important to wear sunscreen to protect your skin every time you go outside.</li>
            <li>I really like that it can be worn over your moisturizer or depending on my schedule, as my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By the time I&#x27;m ready to put on eyes and lips, the product has become part of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was gentle on my skin and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After rubbing Perfective Ceuticals&#x27; sunscreen into my skin, I was surprised that it was quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>; this sunscreen is very moisturizing; I really don&#x27;t need to use  moisturizer with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With a similar price point, Perfective Ceuticals can hold it&#x27;s own in terms of protection, and actually tops them in terms of your skin looking</li>
            <li>My right hand and arm feel soft, like silky skin.</li>
            <li>Like most other Perfective Ceutical products, it is non-comedogenic* and fragrance</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this line as I try some of the other anti-aging products as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It being the hottest week in July, we spent most of the week camping and swimming at the lake, so this sunscreen got a real workout, tested on the 16 year old, my 30-something daughter and my age-not-to-be-mentioned skin.  </li>
            <li>In addition to more religiously applying moisturizer and actually remembering to remove makeup before bed, I&#x27;ve started wearing sunscreen year round.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Isopropyl Isostearate is highly comedogenic</li>
            <li>I high recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need a sunscreen with a high SPF and this does the job.</li>
            <li>I know it will protect my skin since my makeup does not have high SPF in it.</li>
            <li>I normally cannot use chemical</li>
            <li>So many sunscreens clog your pours and feel heavy on the face.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear other make-up, but for me, it&#x27;s important to wear a sunscreen for protection from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Recently I received a new product to try and I have to say that I like it a lot.</li>
            <li>live in North Carolina,</li>
            <li>This stuff not only blends evenly and smoothly, but my skin is starting to feel a heck of a lot softer too.</li>
            <li>face does not look shiny and my skin feels very soft.</li>
            <li>In New Orleans it can get pretty sweaty and the sunscreen stays put, doesn&#x27;t drip into my eyes or go away in the humid outside.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far and above a much better feel than any other sunscreen I&#x27;ve used, particularly for my face.  </li>
            <li>I did notice a sort of greasiness when I wore it alone, without any powder on top, but that is what usually happens to me when I use any type of cream</li>
            <li>I usually use a makeup with an SPF rating, but the older I get, the less makeup I use, so finding a product that won&#x27;t clog my pores, looks natural, and actually makes my skin better seems like winning the skincare lottery.  </li>
            <li>I have &#x27;mature&#x27; skin, and use acid peels regularly, along with Retin-A so my skin is pretty primed for irritation anyway.</li>
            <li>As it was, it&#x27;s SO heavily pigmented that it actually did a great job of toning down the redness from my rosacea.  </li>
            <li>Also it reflects white in photos thanks to the titanium dioxide, so you might need to use something else if you will be around flash photography or indoor photography.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen just about feels like a primer as well, which really surprised me.</li>
            <li>This Ultra-light Sunscreen also acts as a skin-care product, that leaves your skin smooth, while protecting it from the harsh rays of the sun.</li>
            <li>At 54 years old and living under the harsh Florida sun I have to say this is my favorite facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that icky clogged pore feeling you get when wearing most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>when you apply it, it&#x27;s not too thick nor is it runny and slimy like many sunscreen products.</li>
            <li>best part about this lotion is that it is not greasy nor oily: I use it as a make-up base and apply foundation and finishing powder over it and</li>
            <li>Since this is so thick and rich, you might find that you need to gently pat on the product instead of trying to swipe it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing only this product under my foundation for two weeks now and don&#x27;t even miss my normal primer/moisturizer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing only this product under my foundation for two weeks now and don&#x27;t even miss my normal primer/moisturizer</li>
            <li>Without jumping on my trusty soapbox, that single word can hide a whole bunch of ingredients that you do NOT want on your skin.</li>
            <li>in my mid-40s, I have combination skin with moderate rosacea, occasional breakouts, and a high degree of sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I will indeed be purchasing this product for both of us in the near future.</li>
            <li>B008AI211A Perfective Ceuticals Ultra-light Sunscreen SPF 40 with Titanium Dioxide]] arrived on my doorstep at just about the same time as my 16 year old granddaughter, here on her summer visit \\&quot;home\\&quot; from the UK.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft, &amp; moisturized without being oily..and protects it from the sun too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply liberally and uniformly 30 minutes prior to UV exposure.</li>
            <li>Other people who were with me and also under the umbrella (but not wearing any sunscreen because they don&#x27;t typically burn easily) DID burn, so I know it was this product that kept me from burning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used an umbrella to shade me for much of the day, but we were surrounded by concrete, and it&#x27;s the reflected rays that usually end up getting me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As it protects from the sun, it also repairs damaged, dry skin and leaves it feeling soft and silky, with no irritations after using it.</li>
            <li>Titanium dioxide, which is a naturally occurring mineral, blocks ultraviolet light from the sun and is less irritating for people with sensitive skin than the ingredients in some sunscreens.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We applied very little at a time, prior to going out in AZ temps of 97 degrees and higher in the sun.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> It is the best Sunscreen, skin-care product we ever used.</li>
            <li> My skin looked great!  </li>
            <li> I reapply it every couple of hours, and my face is perfectly protected.  </li>
            <li> Perfective Ceuticals 40 spf sun block is just perfect.  </li>
            <li> The sunscreen perfective Ceuticals is wonderful for using every day.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re both awesome for repairing signs of aging and Sun damage, but if you&#x27;re going to try one product, let it be this one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - the very best sunscreen that I&#x27;ve found for my face.  </li>
            <li> excellent product.</li>

            <li> This product is amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is wonderful!!</li>
            <li> The difference is incredible for both me, and my daughter.</li>
            <li> Sun is the enemy of skin and this works beautifully.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s beautiful).  </li>
            <li> I use tons of Bull-Frog and Coppertone and Neutrogena on exposed body parts, but I&#x27;ve never been happy using them on my face.  </li>
            <li> GREAT benefits!&lt;br</li>

            <li> I was a bit nervous about trying this since I have never been able to apply sunscreen to my face without it resulting in a breakout of some kind.</li>
            <li> This sun screen is the kind that you can wear every day even to the office where you might want to put a bit of make up on top of the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It is worth it!!! :)</li>

            <li> The Perfective Ceuticals Ultra-Light Sunscreen SPF 40 is perfect for daily use with or with out makeup!</li>
            <li> A must have daily moisturizer &amp; the perfect makeup primer.</li>
            <li> though I could feel that I had something on, it didn&#x27;t feel sticky and \\&quot;masky\\&quot; as most sunscreens do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before discovering Vichy sun care in France, Shiseido was the favorite line for sunscreen.</li>
            <li> In fact, it seemed moisturized and felt more resilient to the touch.  </li>
            <li> I am better protected from sun damage when using this product</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen as I love everything this company makes.</li>
            <li> Living in California it is so important to wear sunscreen to protect my skin from the harmful rays!</li>
            <li> It goes on light and I wear under my makeup!</li>
            <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love the attractive bottle and high quality pump, and I look forward to using this product for years.</li>
            <li> especially love this sunscreen by Perfective Ceuticals because you can easily wear it under your regular makeup.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and never set foot outside without sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> On one hand, having the chance to try a high-end sunscreen sounded good, but I didn&#x27;t really WANT to try it, just because I avoid needing sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very light and clean.</li>
            <li> The attractive, plastic bottle is very light-weight, and the pump is perfect for small applications.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quite easily and you donâ€™t need to rub your face for ever.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> a lucky coincidence I received an offer to test Perfective Ceuticals sunscreen a week before laser surgery to remove my sun spots, and now I am so pleased to have discovered it.  </li>
            <li> This ultra light sunscreen is so easy to use &amp; is a great habit to get into wearing daily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is also a great daily moisturizer, so you get two important benefits.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer provided me with a free product for review</li>
            <li> So when I had an opportunity to try a free sample of their SPF 40 sunscreen I was excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sunscreen is PERFECT if you need to wear sunscreen everyday.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a blogger and one of the benefits is receiving products for free to test and review, including this product.</li>
            <li> (I enjoy the Jane Iredale line of products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the dispensing bottle giving just the right amount to apply.  </li>
            <li> Normally I use a brush but the tacky surface grabbed at the brush and left a streaky application, but a damp BeautyBlender sponge made my liquid foundation stay on wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and love this product!</li>
            <li> It makes my face look dewy and fresh almost all day!</li>
            <li> I have a family history of melanoma, and my dermatologist told me this summer that I needed to be sure to be wearing sunscreen with a higher SPF.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unique; I&#x27;ve never used a sunscreen like this one.  </li>
            <li> Good make up application does not look like you have make it just makes you look better, but other sunscreen I have used tend to attract make up like blush</li>
            <li> /&gt;Feels like a special and luxurious product and the packaging doesn&#x27;t hurt</li>
            <li> Light and fresh.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for a fragrance free, super light but extremely effective facial sunscreen, I suggest you consider</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and is very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a very mild scent which worried me at first.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the  oily feel that I have experienced with other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> She has a few skin problems also, and finds this product the best she has ever used as it is extremely gentle.</li>
            <li> When I saw the white streaks from the sunscreen in this product, I wasn&#x27;t very happy, and I could actually feel this on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Normally I just make do with Roche-Posay products from my dermatologist&#x27;s office, because most drugstore products just make me break out or itch.</li>
            <li> I like this better than the products I normally purchase from my dermatologist and</li>
            <li> I like this better than the products I normally purchase from my dermatologist and</li>
            <li> And I sweated a LOT because it was very hot.  </li>
            <li> After wearing for several weeks I am very pleased with results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend it because my skin is very sensitive and prone to brown patches and this protects against sun damage better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum and Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy for several months, with amazing results.  </li>
            <li> It takes one pump to do my neck and one for my face, so it&#x27;s economical in usage.</li>
            <li> I love the ease of applying, the light weight feel on my skin &amp; overall the skin protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> The Perfective Ceuticals sunscreen rubs into my skin and is absorbed almost immediately.</li>
            <li> With our intense sun, sunscreen is not only a good idea</li>
            <li> And considering the lovely natural ingredients involved, that propylparaben means that your sunscreen will not be rancid in 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;After researching the ingredients, and then talking them over with chemist, I&#x27;m using and recommending this product.</li>
            <li> It spreads on well and absorbed quickly&lt;br</li>
            <li> was sent this product in order to write an honest and biased review; I will order another one to carry in my purse for occasional touch-ups.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed in putting on this Perfective Ceuticals sunscreen was that it is very creamy and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very pleased that the product never made my skin sting, as most face creams (especially those with sunscreen) tend to do, especially when I get sweaty.  </li>
            <li> It dispenses just the right amount of product with no spitting or leaking, and it isn&#x27;t flimsy.</li>
            <li> It dispenses just the right amount of product with no spitting or leaking, and it isn&#x27;t flimsy.</li>
            <li> The lotion comes in a nice, pale blue tube with a great pump system: this is one of the best packagings Iâ€™ve ever tried for a cream/moisturizer, because it is very sensitive and you get the exact amount of product that you need, without being left with extra on your hand.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using it everyday for over a week, and the results are remarkable.</li>
            <li> I gave it the ultimate test when I had to be in the direct sun for a weekend tournament recently, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident that this will last right to the end of the bottle without breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident that this will last right to the end of the bottle without breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I made sure Not to use on my left hand and arm in order to compare the difference.</li>
            <li> I was sent the Ultra-light sunscreen to try and I have to say it is the first sunscreen I have used that doesn&#x27;t make me break out and itch.</li>
            <li> Another winning product by Perfective Ceuticals that will be in my daily regimen for years to come!</li>
            <li> Perfective Ceuticals sunscreen is exactly what I&#x27;ve been needing for my face.  </li>
            <li> I have just recently started using this sunscreen, and I am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> I feel safer already with the higher SPF in this product than in what I&#x27;d been using.  </li>
            <li> It really feels more like a facial</li>
            <li> This is pretty much perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided</li>
            <li> used to wear sunscreen only in the summer, but after a recent &amp;#34;milestone birthday&amp;#34; I realized that I needed to take better care of my skin!</li>
            <li> As it warms to your skin it becomes much easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the price is very comparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the price is very comparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to rub in as it vanishes, while absorbing into the skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Since its important to wear sunscreen to protect your skin every time you go outside.</li>
            <li> I really like that it can be worn over your moisturizer or depending on my schedule, as my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By the time I&#x27;m ready to put on eyes and lips, the product has become part of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was gentle on my skin and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After rubbing Perfective Ceuticals&#x27; sunscreen into my skin, I was surprised that it was quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> ; this sunscreen is very moisturizing; I really don&#x27;t need to use  moisturizer with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With a similar price point, Perfective Ceuticals can hold it&#x27;s own in terms of protection, and actually tops them in terms of your skin looking</li>
            <li> My right hand and arm feel soft, like silky skin.</li>
            <li> Like most other Perfective Ceutical products, it is non-comedogenic* and fragrance</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this line as I try some of the other anti-aging products as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It being the hottest week in July, we spent most of the week camping and swimming at the lake, so this sunscreen got a real workout, tested on the 16 year old, my 30-something daughter and my age-not-to-be-mentioned skin.  </li>
            <li> In addition to more religiously applying moisturizer and actually remembering to remove makeup before bed, I&#x27;ve started wearing sunscreen year round.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Isopropyl Isostearate is highly comedogenic</li>
            <li> I high recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I need a sunscreen with a high SPF and this does the job.</li>
            <li> I know it will protect my skin since my makeup does not have high SPF in it.</li>
            <li> I normally cannot use chemical</li>
            <li> So many sunscreens clog your pours and feel heavy on the face.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear other make-up, but for me, it&#x27;s important to wear a sunscreen for protection from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently I received a new product to try and I have to say that I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> live in North Carolina,</li>
            <li> This stuff not only blends evenly and smoothly, but my skin is starting to feel a heck of a lot softer too.</li>
            <li> face does not look shiny and my skin feels very soft.</li>
            <li> In New Orleans it can get pretty sweaty and the sunscreen stays put, doesn&#x27;t drip into my eyes or go away in the humid outside.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far and above a much better feel than any other sunscreen I&#x27;ve used, particularly for my face.  </li>
            <li> I did notice a sort of greasiness when I wore it alone, without any powder on top, but that is what usually happens to me when I use any type of cream</li>
            <li> I usually use a makeup with an SPF rating, but the older I get, the less makeup I use, so finding a product that won&#x27;t clog my pores, looks natural, and actually makes my skin better seems like winning the skincare lottery.  </li>
            <li> I have &#x27;mature&#x27; skin, and use acid peels regularly, along with Retin-A so my skin is pretty primed for irritation anyway.</li>
            <li> As it was, it&#x27;s SO heavily pigmented that it actually did a great job of toning down the redness from my rosacea.  </li>
            <li> Also it reflects white in photos thanks to the titanium dioxide, so you might need to use something else if you will be around flash photography or indoor photography.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen just about feels like a primer as well, which really surprised me.</li>
            <li> This Ultra-light Sunscreen also acts as a skin-care product, that leaves your skin smooth, while protecting it from the harsh rays of the sun.</li>
            <li> At 54 years old and living under the harsh Florida sun I have to say this is my favorite facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have that icky clogged pore feeling you get when wearing most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> when you apply it, it&#x27;s not too thick nor is it runny and slimy like many sunscreen products.</li>
            <li> best part about this lotion is that it is not greasy nor oily: I use it as a make-up base and apply foundation and finishing powder over it and</li>
            <li> Since this is so thick and rich, you might find that you need to gently pat on the product instead of trying to swipe it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing only this product under my foundation for two weeks now and don&#x27;t even miss my normal primer/moisturizer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing only this product under my foundation for two weeks now and don&#x27;t even miss my normal primer/moisturizer</li>
            <li> Without jumping on my trusty soapbox, that single word can hide a whole bunch of ingredients that you do NOT want on your skin.</li>
            <li> in my mid-40s, I have combination skin with moderate rosacea, occasional breakouts, and a high degree of sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I will indeed be purchasing this product for both of us in the near future.</li>
            <li> B008AI211A Perfective Ceuticals Ultra-light Sunscreen SPF 40 with Titanium Dioxide]] arrived on my doorstep at just about the same time as my 16 year old granddaughter, here on her summer visit \\&quot;home\\&quot; from the UK.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft, &amp; moisturized without being oily..and protects it from the sun too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply liberally and uniformly 30 minutes prior to UV exposure.</li>
            <li> Other people who were with me and also under the umbrella (but not wearing any sunscreen because they don&#x27;t typically burn easily) DID burn, so I know it was this product that kept me from burning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used an umbrella to shade me for much of the day, but we were surrounded by concrete, and it&#x27;s the reflected rays that usually end up getting me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As it protects from the sun, it also repairs damaged, dry skin and leaves it feeling soft and silky, with no irritations after using it.</li>
            <li> Titanium dioxide, which is a naturally occurring mineral, blocks ultraviolet light from the sun and is less irritating for people with sensitive skin than the ingredients in some sunscreens.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We applied very little at a time, prior to going out in AZ temps of 97 degrees and higher in the sun.</li>
            <li> As someone whose skin reacts unpleasantly to that, I&#x27;m so appreciative that this company left out the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> an active ingredient of titanium dioxide, it&#x27;s clear that the company has the perfected the particle size of the titanium...</li>
            <li> I am relieved to say that I have applied this every day for the past month in the order recommended and I have not broken out once.</li>
            <li> know you&#x27;re supposed to reapply sunscreen every 90 minutes or so, but I never put it on again, and we were outside all day long.  </li>
            <li> It dispenses from the bottle as a very thick cream, but quickly liquefies with my body heat.  </li>
            <li> My left hand and arm has severely dry, damaged skin.</li>
            <li> Normally a sunscreen product causes my face to look like a shiny oily mess but this sunscreen DOES NOT!</li>
            <li> lotion itself is white, like any other sunscreen lotion, although it doesnâ€™t leave white stripes on your face and neck.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve gone so long without using this product.</li>
            <li> and I spend all summer long baking at the baseball fields with our sons.  </li>
            <li> I been looking for a sunscreen that is not too thick and sticky for my face, this one work very well.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended reapplying sunblock every 2 hours when I am outside to avoid skin damage which results in the dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , this is a very expensive sunscreen, but I&#x27;m so pleased with it</li>
            <li> It spreads a long way so not much is needed, and it absorbs evenly into the skin.</li>
            <li> Even though we were in and out of the water all week long, none of us suffered so much as a pink nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> with all the Perfective Ceuticals products, you only need a little.  </li>
            <li> it leaves the skin with a non-greasy finish, unlike traditional, heavy sunscreens.</li>
            <li> It has absolutely no scent&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fragrance intolerance issues - but this one smells only for a few minutes and doesn&#x27;t linger (and gag me)....</li>
            <li> you have (pale) blotchy skin or redness, the titanium dioxide in this tends to skew your skin to &#x27;pink&#x27;, so keep this in mind if you think that your foundation doesn&#x27;t quite look the same.</li>
            <li> A little bit seems to go a long ways in application.</li>
            <li> What better location to test this than Arizona, where summer begins in May, with brutal heat for the next 3 months.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t imagine using any other sunscreen on my face after this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using two other Perfective Ceuticals products, a skin cream and a serum.  </li>
            <li> And, if acne due to clogged pores is a problem, it&#x27;s so lightweight, it wonâ€™t cause</li>
            <li> I usually find that regular sunscreen is too heavy under my make-up and makes my foundation look really obvious and uneven.  </li>
            <li> I only need a very small pump of the product to apply to my face, and another small pump for my neck and upper chest.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely HATE putting sunscreen on my face, but I am extremely pale, and I burn very easily.  </li>
            <li> product does not apply like a typical sunscreen, nor does it behave like one.</li>
            <li> it leaves a slight luminous glow without being shimmery.</li>
            <li> It seems a little heavy going on</li>
            <li> Guess what is missing on the label of this product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to find sunscreen I can use on my face/neck, without a reaction. Normally I just make do with Roche-Posay products from my dermatologist&#x27;s office, because most drugstore products just make me break out or itch. I have &#x27;mature&#x27; skin, and use acid peels regularly, along with Retin-A so my skin is pretty primed for irritation anyway. I normally cannot use chemical sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost: there is no fakey chemical fragrance in this product! As someone whose skin reacts unpleasantly to that, I&#x27;m so appreciative that this company left out the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not apply like a typical sunscreen, nor does it behave like one. It feels like a skincare product/moisturizer when you apply it, it&#x27;s not too thick nor is it runny and slimy like many sunscreen products. It takes one pump to do my neck and one for my face, so it&#x27;s economical in usage. Since this is so thick and rich, you might find that you need to gently pat on the product instead of trying to swipe it. As it warms to your skin it becomes much easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have (pale) blotchy skin or redness, the titanium dioxide in this tends to skew your skin to &#x27;pink&#x27;, so keep this in mind if you think that your foundation doesn&#x27;t quite look the same. Also it reflects white in photos thanks to the titanium dioxide, so you might need to use something else if you will be around flash photography or indoor photography. This sunscreen just about feels like a primer as well, which really surprised me. It leaves a tacky feeling for several minutes, so you might find that you need to use a sponge application for your foundation. Normally I use a brush but the tacky surface grabbed at the brush and left a streaky application, but a damp BeautyBlender sponge made my liquid foundation stay on wonderfully. Normally a sunscreen product causes my face to look like a shiny oily mess but this sunscreen DOES NOT! It makes my face look dewy and fresh almost all day! It also plays well with my MAC Studio Fix Fluid and Urban Decay Naked foundations, no pilling or streaking. I&#x27;ve been wearing only this product under my foundation for two weeks now and don&#x27;t even miss my normal primer/moisturizer combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I also appreciate the high-quality pump that this is packaged in. It dispenses just the right amount of product with no spitting or leaking, and it isn&#x27;t flimsy. I&#x27;m confident that this will last right to the end of the bottle without breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was sent a bottle of this product in exchange for my usage and honest review. I will be purchasing more once this runs out :--) I like this better than the products I normally purchase from my dermatologist and the price is very comparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;m going on almost 2 months of usage and the bottle still seems to have plenty of product left! I like the longevity of it.also plays well with my MAC Studio Fix Fluid and Urban Decay Naked foundations, no pilling or streaking.

            <li> I received this product as a courtesy from Perfective Ceuticals in exchange for an honest review and put it to the test immediately. My daughter and I have been using it everyday for over a week, and the results are remarkable. We applied very little at a time, prior to going out in AZ temps of 97 degrees and higher in the sun. This Ultra-light Sunscreen also acts as a skin-care product, that leaves your skin smooth, while protecting it from the harsh rays of the sun. What better location to test this than Arizona, where summer begins in May, with brutal heat for the next 3 months. If you attempt to smell this after using, it is a very pleasant and gentle fragrance, but you need to take a good sniff. The attractive, plastic bottle is very light-weight, and the pump is perfect for small applications. You need very little to apply at once. You don&#x27;t need to rub in as it vanishes, while absorbing into the skin. I made sure Not to use on my left hand and arm in order to compare the difference. My right hand and arm feel soft, like silky skin. My left hand and arm has severely dry, damaged skin. The difference is incredible for both me, and my daughter. She has a few skin problems also, and finds this product the best she has ever used as it is extremely gentle. As it protects from the sun, it also repairs damaged, dry skin and leaves it feeling soft and silky, with no irritations after using it. We are still using this each day, prior to going outside, and appreciate the quality of skin-care it gives. I will indeed be purchasing this product for both of us in the near future. It is the best Sunscreen, skin-care product we ever used. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The Perfective Ceuticals Ultra-Light Sunscreen SPF 40 is perfect for daily use with or with out makeup! I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve gone so long without using this product. Since its important to wear sunscreen to protect your skin every time you go outside. This ultra light sunscreen is so easy to use &amp; is a great habit to get into wearing daily. I love the ease of applying, the light weight feel on my skin &amp; overall the skin protection from the sun. A must have daily moisturizer &amp; the perfect makeup primer.</li>
            <li> Isopropyl Isostearate is highly comedogenic&lt;br /&gt;Polyhydroxystearic Acid is comedogenic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mentioned before that I do not like using anything on my face that I can &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34;..and this includes sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I received a new product to try and I have to say that I like it a lot. The Perfective Ceuticals sunscreen rubs into my skin and is absorbed almost immediately. Nothing on my face felt or look oily. I really like that it can be worn over your moisturizer or depending on my schedule, as my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a fragrance free, super light but extremely effective facial sunscreen, I suggest you consider this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> I was sent the Ultra-light sunscreen to try and I have to say it is the first sunscreen I have used that doesn&#x27;t make me break out and itch. It seems a little heavy going on but once it is smoothed in I can&#x27;t tell its even there.  I use it over the divine serum/cream and it doesn&#x27;t have any negative affect on my skin at all. I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use in the summer yet, but it does stand up to the sun reflection off the snow and gives wind protection as well. Love the dispensing bottle giving just the right amount to apply.  Another winning product by Perfective Ceuticals that will be in my daily regimen for years to come!</li>
            <li> NOTE:  The manufacturer provided me with a free product for review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my mid-40s, I have combination skin with moderate rosacea, occasional breakouts, and a high degree of sensitivity. I absolutely HATE putting sunscreen on my face, but I am extremely pale, and I burn very easily.  So when I had a chance to try this, I had mixed feelings about it.  On one hand, having the chance to try a high-end sunscreen sounded good, but I didn&#x27;t really WANT to try it, just because I avoid needing sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I went to a daytime outdoor concert, I knew I was going to need something.  I used an umbrella to shade me for much of the day, but we were surrounded by concrete, and it&#x27;s the reflected rays that usually end up getting me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed in putting on this Perfective Ceuticals sunscreen was that it is very creamy and easy to apply.  There is absolutely no wateriness to it, but it&#x27;s so soft that you don&#x27;t need to apply any pressure at all to get it to smear around.  I also noticed that it has a LOT of white pigment to it from the titanium dioxide.  As I said, I&#x27;m very pale, so it doesn&#x27;t show on me, but I have to wonder if maybe it would show on someone with a tan.  As it was, it&#x27;s SO heavily pigmented that it actually did a great job of toning down the redness from my rosacea.  My skin looked great!  In fact, I noticed that in a picture taken of me that afternoon, my skin looked fantastically luminous and flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know you&#x27;re supposed to reapply sunscreen every 90 minutes or so, but I never put it on again, and we were outside all day long.  And I sweated a LOT because it was very hot.  I kept wiping my face against my shirt and on napkins.  But the sunscreen never ran into my eyes, and I didn&#x27;t burn even the slightest bit.  Other people who were with me and also under the umbrella (but not wearing any sunscreen because they don&#x27;t typically burn easily) DID burn, so I know it was this product that kept me from burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased that the product never made my skin sting, as most face creams (especially those with sunscreen) tend to do, especially when I get sweaty.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like a sunscreen (there is virtually no scent at all), and though I could feel that I had something on, it didn&#x27;t feel sticky and \\&quot;masky\\&quot; as most sunscreens do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this is a very expensive sunscreen, but I&#x27;m so pleased with it, I can&#x27;t imagine using any other sunscreen on my face after this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum and Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy for several months, with amazing results.  So when I had an opportunity to try a free sample of their SPF 40 sunscreen I was excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We live in North Carolina, and I spend all summer long baking at the baseball fields with our sons.  With our intense sun, sunscreen is not only a good idea, it&#x27;s mandatory. I use tons of Bull-Frog and Coppertone and Neutrogena on exposed body parts, but I&#x27;ve never been happy using them on my face.  They burn my eyes if I sweat, and they feel sticky and greasy on my face.  I&#x27;ve also had a chemical burn feeling from using regular sunscreens on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Perfective Ceuticals sunscreen is exactly what I&#x27;ve been needing for my face.  I only need a very small pump of the product to apply to my face, and another small pump for my neck and upper chest.  It dispenses from the bottle as a very thick cream, but quickly liquefies with my body heat.  I reapply it every couple of hours, and my face is perfectly protected.  I gave it the ultimate test when I had to be in the direct sun for a weekend tournament recently, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  Not only did it keep my skin from burning, but it also didn&#x27;t irritate my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried that the titanium dioxide would look sparkly or white, but I can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s there at all.  Titanium dioxide, which is a naturally occurring mineral, blocks ultraviolet light from the sun and is less irritating for people with sensitive skin than the ingredients in some sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the attractive bottle and high quality pump, and I look forward to using this product for years.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:82d76ea1fbd3cafe85865ee1efa49053]] Think of this as a BB with benefits. GREAT benefits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before discovering Vichy sun care in France, Shiseido was the favorite line for sunscreen. With a similar price point, Perfective Ceuticals can hold it&#x27;s own in terms of protection, and actually tops them in terms of your skin looking it&#x27;s best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With an active ingredient of titanium dioxide, it&#x27;s clear that the company has the perfected the particle size of the titanium...it leaves a slight luminous glow without being shimmery. Just enough to make others wonder if you&#x27;ve had a relaxing spa holiday or &#x27;had something done&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is very nice. If you are a germ-a-phobe like me, you&#x27;ll appreciate the hygienic pump, especially when asked to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And....I&#x27;m absolutely crazy about the scent! It is very light and clean. Now, anyone that knows me or has read any of my blogs knows that one of my pet peeves is &#x27;fragrance&#x27; as an ingredient. Without jumping on my trusty soapbox, that single word can hide a whole bunch of ingredients that you do NOT want on your skin. Guess what is missing on the label of this product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Fragrance&#x27;!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A company that actually discloses what is in the product, with total transparency! However, there some ingredients some people might not like, such as Propylparaben. I myself find the small amount 100% acceptable, it is highly unlikely to irritate. And considering the lovely natural ingredients involved, that propylparaben means that your sunscreen will not be rancid in 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;After researching the ingredients, and then talking them over with chemist, I&#x27;m using and recommending this product.</li>
            <li> Living in Florida, I need a good sun block for my face.  Perfective Ceuticals 40 spf sun block is just perfect.  It contain titanium oxide, the best sun blocker available.  I tried it out several times and my face did not get burnt at all.  In fact, it seemed moisturized and felt more resilient to the touch.  I high recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen perfective Ceuticals is wonderful for using every day. Sun is the enemy of skin and this works beautifully. I don&#x27;t have any rash, break out or any issues using the sunscreen.  In New Orleans it can get pretty sweaty and the sunscreen stays put, doesn&#x27;t drip into my eyes or go away in the humid outside. This is pretty much perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous about trying this since I have never been able to apply sunscreen to my face without it resulting in a breakout of some kind. I am relieved to say that I have applied this every day for the past month in the order recommended and I have not broken out once. It spreads a long way so not much is needed, and it absorbs evenly into the skin. I am better protected from sun damage when using this product so I like it. I would recommend it because my skin is very sensitive and prone to brown patches and this protects against sun damage better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> I been looking for a sunscreen that is not too thick and sticky for my face, this one work very well. Not making my face all white.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen is PERFECT if you need to wear sunscreen everyday. I usually find that regular sunscreen is too heavy under my make-up and makes my foundation look really obvious and uneven.  This stuff not only blends evenly and smoothly, but my skin is starting to feel a heck of a lot softer too. I want to find out what retail stores carry this!</li>
            <li> I have a family history of melanoma, and my dermatologist told me this summer that I needed to be sure to be wearing sunscreen with a higher SPF. One of my coworkers recommended that I try Perfective Ceuticals sunscreen, SPF 40. I have just recently started using this sunscreen, and I am extremely pleased. It goes on light, does not feel oily or greasy, and has a pleasant scent. A little bit seems to go a long ways in application. It&#x27;s far and above a much better feel than any other sunscreen I&#x27;ve used, particularly for my face.  It&#x27;s almost luxurious.  I don&#x27;t wear other make-up, but for me, it&#x27;s important to wear a sunscreen for protection from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays.  I feel safer already with the higher SPF in this product than in what I&#x27;d been using.  I also deal with a  bit of rosacea, and I&#x27;m thankful that this sunscreen does not agitate that condition. I heartily recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and never set foot outside without sunscreen.  I usually use a makeup with an SPF rating, but the older I get, the less makeup I use, so finding a product that won&#x27;t clog my pores, looks natural, and actually makes my skin better seems like winning the skincare lottery.  This is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all the Perfective Ceuticals products, you only need a little.  It takes a few minutes to absorb, so I apply it to my face and neck before getting dressed.  By the time I&#x27;m ready to put on eyes and lips, the product has become part of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using two other Perfective Ceuticals products, a skin cream and a serum.  They&#x27;re both awesome for repairing signs of aging and Sun damage, but if you&#x27;re going to try one product, let it be this one.  It&#x27;s unique; I&#x27;ve never used a sunscreen like this one.  It doesn&#x27;t make my face break out in the awful little painful bumps caused by other products I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s effective as a sunscreen, and it actually makes my skin better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received for review.</li>
            <li> I felt this lotion was too heavy to wear under makeup.  When I saw the white streaks from the sunscreen in this product, I wasn&#x27;t very happy, and I could actually feel this on my skin.  I much prefer a lightweight lotion that absorbs quickly and is still has excellent UV protection over one that I can feel (and see) rubbing off on my hands.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen as I love everything this company makes. At 54 years old and living under the harsh Florida sun I have to say this is my favorite facial sunscreen. it works very well under makeup and dose not pill or feel to heavy on the skin..It is a joy to use and very effective at keeping my skin from sun damage</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B008AI211A Perfective Ceuticals Ultra-light Sunscreen SPF 40 with Titanium Dioxide]] arrived on my doorstep at just about the same time as my 16 year old granddaughter, here on her summer visit \\&quot;home\\&quot; from the UK.  It being the hottest week in July, we spent most of the week camping and swimming at the lake, so this sunscreen got a real workout, tested on the 16 year old, my 30-something daughter and my age-not-to-be-mentioned skin.  Was it ever a hit! Even though we were in and out of the water all week long, none of us suffered so much as a pink nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B008AI211A Perfective Ceuticals Ultra-light Sunscreen SPF 40 with Titanium Dioxide]] is non-greasy and not at all sticky, blending right into your skin like a face cream, ideal for under makeup but perfect as a stand-alone.  (None of us took makeup camping.)  Like most other Perfective Ceutical products, it is non-comedogenic* and fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - the very best sunscreen that I&#x27;ve found for my face.  Highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Non-comedogenic products are ones that do not block the pores of your skin, leading to breakouts and blackheads.</li>
            <li> Note: I received a free sample of this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to wear sunscreen only in the summer, but after a recent &amp;#34;milestone birthday&amp;#34; I realized that I needed to take better care of my skin! In addition to more religiously applying moisturizer and actually remembering to remove makeup before bed, I&#x27;ve started wearing sunscreen year round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially love this sunscreen by Perfective Ceuticals because you can easily wear it under your regular makeup. Even though it provides great protection (SPF 40) it leaves the skin with a non-greasy finish, unlike traditional, heavy sunscreens. And, if acne due to clogged pores is a problem, it&#x27;s so lightweight, it wonâ€™t cause breakouts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also a great daily moisturizer, so you get two important benefits. Plus, it&#x27;s budget-friendly (especially important right now after the holiday shopping frenzy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An excellent product. I would DEFINITELY recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love that this sunscreen feels light and has good coverage! I need a sunscreen with a high SPF and this does the job. I know it will protect my skin since my makeup does not have high SPF in it. Also, I like that it goes great with my foundation powder during the day and does not ruin my makeup.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me to wear sun screen every day whether I am hiking outdoors or driving my car to work if I want to avoid additional sun spots pigmentation (or worse!) This sun screen is the kind that you can wear every day even to the office where you might want to put a bit of make up on top of the sunscreen. Good make up application does not look like you have make it just makes you look better, but other sunscreen I have used tend to attract make up like blush it makes it noticeable. This sun block does not. After wearing for several weeks I am very pleased with results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the reasons I like this sunscreen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;âœ” It has absolutely no scent&lt;br /&gt;âœ” It does not feel greasy&lt;br /&gt;âœ” It spreads on well and absorbed quickly&lt;br /&gt;âœ” It has nice consistency that is easy to work with&lt;br /&gt;âœ” It does not interfere with blush or foundation&lt;br /&gt;âœ” I like the pump delivery system that delivers small amount of sunscrean so that the sunblock will last&lt;br /&gt;âœ” The bottle size (5 inches tall and 2.9 oz) fits well into my purse, so I can always have it with me&lt;br /&gt;âœ” After I apply the sunblock my skin feels like I put on moisturizer not sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;âœ” The container is pretty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunblock is rated as SPF 40. SPF stands for Sun Protection Factor and it means that means you can stay in the sun 40 times longer than without sunscreen without getting burned. My dermatologist recommended reapplying sunblock every 2 hours when I am outside to avoid skin damage which results in the dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By a lucky coincidence I received an offer to test Perfective Ceuticals sunscreen a week before laser surgery to remove my sun spots, and now I am so pleased to have discovered it.  It was gentle on my skin and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua).

            <li> I love this sunscreen!!!! Living in California it is so important to wear sunscreen to protect my skin from the harmful rays! This product is amazing!!!!! It goes on light and I wear under my makeup! It is wonderful!! I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a good sunscreen with amazing protection!  It is worth it!!! :)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and love this product! While it protects my skin great, it is also super light and not greasy at all. Feels great on. Try it out, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is the lightest facial sunscreen I have ever found, period. It doesn&#x27;t have that icky clogged pore feeling you get when wearing most sunscreens. I&#x27;m one of those people that has to wash my face ASAP after applying sunscreen on my face. But with this sunscreen I don&#x27;t even remember I&#x27;m wearing it. It really feels more like a facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a very mild scent which worried me at first. I have fragrance intolerance issues - but this one smells only for a few minutes and doesn&#x27;t linger (and gag me)....It&#x27;s easy to apply and is very gentle on the skin. I didn&#x27;t feel any sting after applying unlike some facial sunscreens that I&#x27;ve tried. Especially around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face does not look shiny and my skin feels very soft. It&#x27;s cream based, but it&#x27;s not sticky. I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this sunscreen is really nice and it works as a great moisturizer as well. If you are looking for a product to combat the signs of aging and protect your skin from the damaging rays of the sun, this is a great product to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a blogger and one of the benefits is receiving products for free to test and review, including this product.</li>
            <li> The lotion comes in a nice, pale blue tube with a great pump system: this is one of the best packagings Iâ€™ve ever tried for a cream/moisturizer, because it is very sensitive and you get the exact amount of product that you need, without being left with extra on your hand.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion itself is white, like any other sunscreen lotion, although it doesnâ€™t leave white stripes on your face and neck. It absorbs quite easily and you donâ€™t need to rub your face for ever.&lt;br /&gt;The website claims it is a fragrance-free lotion but I can actually smell something: it is a very subtle, sunscreen-esque fragrance, if you know what I mean. It smells like a very expensive sunscreen lotion that you buy at Sephora, if it makes sense. It is not a strong smell and it goes away as soon as it gets absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;The best part about this lotion is that it is not greasy nor oily: I use it as a make-up base and apply foundation and finishing powder over it and my T-zone stays opaque all day. I did notice a sort of greasiness when I wore it alone, without any powder on top, but that is what usually happens to me when I use any type of cream and I donâ€™t buff the T-zone with finishing powder.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product in order to write an honest and biased review; I will order another one to carry in my purse for occasional touch-ups.</li>
            <li> So many sunscreens clog your pours and feel heavy on the face.  Not this one.  It is a smooth, light formula that has a pleasant smell (reminds me of the beach).  It stays on the skin and protects but needs reapplication if you perspire - it is recommended that it be reapplied every two hours as needed.  Light and fresh.  This lotion provides a nice protective layer under my makeup (I enjoy the Jane Iredale line of products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels like a special and luxurious product and the packaging doesn&#x27;t hurt (it&#x27;s beautiful).  I am enjoying this line as I try some of the other anti-aging products as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was provided with a sample of this product and per Amazon guidelines am disclosing this fact.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using sunscreen on my face because it leaves my skin shiny &amp; oily.  Perfective Ceuticals Ultra-light Sunscreen is  thicker than their [[ASIN:B004B9C8MO Anti-aging Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factor]]. I was expecting the  oily feel that I have experienced with other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used. After rubbing Perfective Ceuticals&#x27; sunscreen into my skin, I was surprised that it was quickly absorbed. My face &amp; neck didn&#x27;t feel or look oily.  It is definitely ultra-light as advertised.  I use it over my daily moisturizer, then apply my makeup; this sunscreen is very moisturizing; I really don&#x27;t need to use  moisturizer with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I never knew that there was a sunscreen on the market that would &#x27;feel&#x27; so good on my face. If you don&#x27;t like that oily feel &amp; shiny look you get after using sunscreen on your face, I suggest you try [[ASIN:B008AI211A Non-comedogenic Sunscreen - Perfective Ceuticals Ultra-light Sunscreen SPF 40 with Titanium Dioxide]]. It leaves my skin feeling soft, &amp; moisturized without being oily..and protects it from the sun too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply liberally and uniformly 30 minutes prior to UV exposure. Reapply to skin every 2 hours or as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for an unbiased, honest review.</li>
