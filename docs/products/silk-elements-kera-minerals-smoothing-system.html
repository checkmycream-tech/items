            <li>What more could you ask for!</li>
            <li>I applied it for her and her hair came out amazing as well....</li>
            <li>My own hair had been processed with a relaxer about six weeks ago, and I wondered how it would work out.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks better than ever ...</li>
            <li>I noticed when I washed it out that my hair clumped together like stuck spaghetti but felt better after I put the rinse in it.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews before buying the product and accessories from Sally Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was b/c</li>
            <li>and I spend more time detangling than anything else.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>Seems like it would work better if my hair was longer</li>
            <li>Im better off getting a perm.</li>
            <li>Ok, I digress....</li>
            <li>she said that most of the time after her relaxer, she sees more fallout...</li>
            <li>that being said, I wanted to write this review for all the women who may be looking at this product as a way to have more manageable hair for longer.  </li>
            <li>I now have hair that holds moisture better and doesn&#x27;t frizz in humidity.  </li>
            <li>I received so many compliments.  </li>
            <li>Then i tried silk elements which worked so much better.  </li>
            <li>Safe for her hair.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, for anyone using relaxers or who wants to straighten their hair in a healthy and effective manner.</li>
            <li>I had read many great reviews on long hair and most of the results were outstanding.</li>
            <li>I love my straight hair, it is illustrious and healthy!</li>
            <li>First, the shampoo and conditioner (which is simply amazing and worked wonders on my hair), then the smoothing system.  </li>
            <li>I used my own shampoo first, then I used the Silk Elements shampoo and followed the directions on the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooth her curls so that I could easily detangle.</li>
            <li>During the winter my hair does fine when u straighten it.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; description is accurate.</li>
            <li>It was fabulous,  no tell-tail line of demarcation.  </li>
            <li>I washed it about 5 days later with my own products, and it didn&#x27;t turn out as smooth, but it was still nice.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything to get it to be smooth.</li>
            <li>AND IT STRAIGHTEN AND SMOOTH MY HAIR</li>
            <li>literally, I could hear the squeaky sound while I lathered my hair with it.</li>
            <li>i will never ever try this again even for free ....</li>
            <li>I am sooooo happy I used this treatment system, because now I don&#x27;t have to go back to relaxers!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li>I was so excited about this product that I told my mom</li>
            <li>and I hope you love your hair as much as I do mine!</li>
            <li>I will say, that it does get your hair squeaky clean...</li>
            <li>By the way, the deep conditioner is REALLY good.</li>
            <li>My hair has grown so much since I started using this because my hair is hydrated, healthy, and stronger</li>
            <li>This morning, the braids looked almost as good as new, and grooming went fast.  </li>
            <li>process was pretty easy.  </li>
            <li>When I asked her about the smoothing system in comparison to the other blowout/keratin products, she told me this was the product for me and it would be great for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I washed again a few days after that with my own shampoo and some of the Kera shampoo, and my own conditioner.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t buy the whole system, get yourself a great deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I think this product is really a mild perm in disguise.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only has this product made my hair more manageable but it has allowed my hair to stay more manageable longer</li>
            <li>I believe it is a mild relaxer.</li>
            <li>It turned out pretty smooth and was shinier.</li>
            <li>This product,overall, did make my natural hair more manageable, but the shampoo has got to go.</li>
            <li>My hair is stick straight and has absolutely no frizz or fly always.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling soft as silk and IMO it is better than a relaxer treatment.</li>
            <li>After going through with the whole thing, it&#x27;s pretty silky and easy to comb</li>
            <li>To shorten this very long story, when I finished the treatment, my hair was so soft and manageable and smelled great (the leave in conditioner gets rid of any lingering smell from the smoother).</li>
            <li>I really want to be able to wash and go and also sleep on it and be able to have decent looking 2nd day  hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I applied it myself and it took me a good hour and a half.  </li>
            <li>I used Kera for the first time yesterday for myself and my great-grand daughter.  </li>
            <li>She went out to play afterwards, and had a hot bath after that.</li>
            <li>but I followed them exactly.</li>
            <li>the first day-</li>
            <li>It is still the first day and it may feel softer tomorrow.</li>
            <li>hahahaha!</li>
            <li>My beautician did my first treatment.  </li>
            <li>I first tried ION from Sally&#x27;s and that treatment didn&#x27;t work well in her hair at all.  </li>
            <li>At this point I didn&#x27;t have much hope, no matter what I try on my hair, it is good for the first day, then it just reverts into an unmanageable mess.</li>
            <li>If you are natural and you love rocking the natural curls and styles</li>
            <li>My first was back in August 2012 before a cruise (in which I got into the saltiest water ever and still had great hair that night for the Captain&#x27;s dinner after a quick 10 minute shower and a very fast wash and condition because wewere running late).  </li>
            <li>The sales person was totally in the dark which made me more suspicious that this product was more like a texturizer.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is designed to get your hair very, very clean from all oils which will leave hair feeling dry (this WILL go away).  </li>
            <li>Before my gray, my hair was stick straight.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t do much smoothing to her curls at all.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t do anything to help me out when you&#x27;ve washed and are ready to comb the hair out (</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of the whole \\&quot;hair classification system\\&quot; thing, but I guess if I were to use it, I would be a 4c.</li>
            <li>I should have know something was amiss when I felt the product tingling my scalp intensely, plus the fact it had that sulphur smell like rotten eggs.</li>
            <li>I tried this product 100 percent transformation my hair has no frizz and stay straight even when it&#x27;s raining which for me was unheard of.</li>
            <li>It will leave your hair bone straight.</li>
            <li>have now used this product on 3 different occasions all with FABULOUS results.  </li>
            <li>My hair has always grown fast</li>
            <li>If you do this yourself, be gentle with your hair once you start the smoothing process.  </li>
            <li>After about 7 weeks it isn&#x27;t as straight and won&#x27;t hold a curl</li>
            <li>This product has made my hair permanently straight.</li>
            <li>I still negative and figured everything looks good</li>
            <li>I wonder if the product really needed to be applied on the ends and what would happen if just the new growth were treated.</li>
            <li>The deep conditioner is the only reason I was able to get through this at all.  </li>
            <li>Next morning, my hair was just as soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>NO FRIZZ STRAIGHT AND VERY SOFT AND SILKY</li>
            <li>Which was more than high enough for me because on a normal basis I flat iron at 325.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair even held up during a 4 day rain spree with very high humidity, it didn&#x27;t revert to its natural state.</li>
            <li>I used the Coppola treatment and it worked great but is expensive.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the time it took to do the whole system, 4 hours for me.</li>
            <li>my hair was bone straight and soft like butter.</li>
            <li>Her natural is much easier to comb through after washing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will update how long the frizz stays under control and if I decide to try again with a better flat iron.</li>
            <li>and she has a ton of new growth that I&#x27;d been tackling every week.</li>
            <li>When I moved to a new region, my hair did not respond favorably.</li>
            <li>I am an  African american with natural hair and wanted to wear my hair straight for a special event.</li>
            <li>However, my hair was very straight after I flat ironed it like I normally do, and it seemed smoother and softer after using the system.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m giving the product a mixed review, because my hair seems more tangly and fragile, leading to some breakage, though I always had breakage with relaxers too.</li>
            <li>If you value you your natural curls then flee from this product!</li>
            <li>I left my first conditioner on for 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Kind of like a weak perm</li>
            <li>It has grown probably inch and a half to two inches around sides and back and the top is probably 4 to 5 inches.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna wait about 2 months and reapply the whole system (using a different, but natural, shampoo).</li>
            <li>I started using this on my 4b natural hair.</li>
            <li>I prematurely grayed in my early 20&#x27;s and now am almost 40.  </li>
            <li>It is day 5 and this is the longest I have ever had soft and manageable hair.</li>
            <li>and I got soft curls all day, and woke up this morning</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly frizzy frizzy hair</li>
            <li>ON MY NATURAL HAIR IM</li>
            <li>AND I HAVE BEEN NATURAL FOR 26 MONTHS</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>My reasons for going natural were because I have a health condition</li>
            <li>So anyway, my natural hair is a 3c/4a texture...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely sold.</li>
            <li>I have ruined my natural curls and after growing it out for 3 years I have to start over transitioning AGAIN.</li>
            <li>DO NOT use this product if your hair is natural.</li>
            <li>individually except the treatment, which is a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions exactly with the exception in order to have enough  shampoo.  </li>
            <li>so I do not have as much breakage during that time when my new growth is causing it to be harder to comb and keep hydrated.  </li>
            <li>But the sides and back was mostly new growth.</li>
            <li>It has suffered much breakage and damage, it was dry and unmanageable ....</li>
            <li>One MAJOR tip I can give when using this product is to substitute the shampoo.</li>
            <li>this time there was barely a hair that hit the floor!</li>
            <li>First the shampoo, then applied the smoothing treatment, shampoo, condition, leave in conditioner, blow dry, flat</li>
            <li>So I had decided after all of these years being natural to get a relaxer, but maybe only do it twice a year.....</li>
            <li>I have seen reviews that say the product is a mild relaxer or that it has the same chemical makeup as a relaxer or that it is too harsh for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so it is not dry and breaking off.  </li>
            <li>I think my hair does look a little healthier overall, so I&#x27;d be willing to try it again.</li>
            <li>However, my hair still has some wave it it when I let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get as much shine as I had seen in previous reviews.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, my hair was very soft and pliable, but not straight at all.</li>

            <li> My first was back in August 2012 before a cruise (in which I got into the saltiest water ever and still had great hair that night for the Captain&#x27;s dinner after a quick 10 minute shower and a very fast wash and condition because wewere running late).  </li>
            <li> The sales person was totally in the dark which made me more suspicious that this product was more like a texturizer.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is designed to get your hair very, very clean from all oils which will leave hair feeling dry (this WILL go away).  </li>
            <li> Before my gray, my hair was stick straight.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t do much smoothing to her curls at all.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t do anything to help me out when you&#x27;ve washed and are ready to comb the hair out (</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the whole \\&quot;hair classification system\\&quot; thing, but I guess if I were to use it, I would be a 4c.</li>
            <li> I should have know something was amiss when I felt the product tingling my scalp intensely, plus the fact it had that sulphur smell like rotten eggs.</li>
            <li> I tried this product 100 percent transformation my hair has no frizz and stay straight even when it&#x27;s raining which for me was unheard of.</li>
            <li> It will leave your hair bone straight.</li>
            <li> have now used this product on 3 different occasions all with FABULOUS results.  </li>
            <li> My hair has always grown fast</li>
            <li> If you do this yourself, be gentle with your hair once you start the smoothing process.  </li>
            <li> After about 7 weeks it isn&#x27;t as straight and won&#x27;t hold a curl</li>
            <li> This product has made my hair permanently straight.</li>
            <li> I still negative and figured everything looks good</li>
            <li> I wonder if the product really needed to be applied on the ends and what would happen if just the new growth were treated.</li>
            <li> The deep conditioner is the only reason I was able to get through this at all.  </li>
            <li> Next morning, my hair was just as soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> NO FRIZZ STRAIGHT AND VERY SOFT AND SILKY</li>
            <li> Which was more than high enough for me because on a normal basis I flat iron at 325.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair even held up during a 4 day rain spree with very high humidity, it didn&#x27;t revert to its natural state.</li>
            <li> I used the Coppola treatment and it worked great but is expensive.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the time it took to do the whole system, 4 hours for me.</li>
            <li> my hair was bone straight and soft like butter.</li>
            <li> Her natural is much easier to comb through after washing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will update how long the frizz stays under control and if I decide to try again with a better flat iron.</li>
            <li> and she has a ton of new growth that I&#x27;d been tackling every week.</li>
            <li> When I moved to a new region, my hair did not respond favorably.</li>
            <li> I am an  African american with natural hair and wanted to wear my hair straight for a special event.</li>
            <li> However, my hair was very straight after I flat ironed it like I normally do, and it seemed smoother and softer after using the system.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m giving the product a mixed review, because my hair seems more tangly and fragile, leading to some breakage, though I always had breakage with relaxers too.</li>
            <li> If you value you your natural curls then flee from this product!</li>
            <li> I left my first conditioner on for 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Kind of like a weak perm</li>
            <li> It has grown probably inch and a half to two inches around sides and back and the top is probably 4 to 5 inches.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna wait about 2 months and reapply the whole system (using a different, but natural, shampoo).</li>
            <li> I started using this on my 4b natural hair.</li>
            <li> I prematurely grayed in my early 20&#x27;s and now am almost 40.  </li>
            <li> It is day 5 and this is the longest I have ever had soft and manageable hair.</li>
            <li> and I got soft curls all day, and woke up this morning</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly frizzy frizzy hair</li>
            <li> ON MY NATURAL HAIR IM</li>
            <li> AND I HAVE BEEN NATURAL FOR 26 MONTHS</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> My reasons for going natural were because I have a health condition</li>
            <li> So anyway, my natural hair is a 3c/4a texture...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely sold.</li>
            <li> I have ruined my natural curls and after growing it out for 3 years I have to start over transitioning AGAIN.</li>
            <li> DO NOT use this product if your hair is natural.</li>
            <li> individually except the treatment, which is a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions exactly with the exception in order to have enough  shampoo.  </li>
            <li> so I do not have as much breakage during that time when my new growth is causing it to be harder to comb and keep hydrated.  </li>
            <li> But the sides and back was mostly new growth.</li>
            <li> It has suffered much breakage and damage, it was dry and unmanageable ....</li>
            <li> One MAJOR tip I can give when using this product is to substitute the shampoo.</li>
            <li> this time there was barely a hair that hit the floor!</li>
            <li> First the shampoo, then applied the smoothing treatment, shampoo, condition, leave in conditioner, blow dry, flat</li>
            <li> So I had decided after all of these years being natural to get a relaxer, but maybe only do it twice a year.....</li>
            <li> I have seen reviews that say the product is a mild relaxer or that it has the same chemical makeup as a relaxer or that it is too harsh for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so it is not dry and breaking off.  </li>
            <li> I think my hair does look a little healthier overall, so I&#x27;d be willing to try it again.</li>
            <li> However, my hair still has some wave it it when I let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get as much shine as I had seen in previous reviews.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my hair was very soft and pliable, but not straight at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to my normal amount of time washing and styling, so the system didn&#x27;t cut down on that.  </li>
            <li> Initially I didn&#x27;t think it was working because after the conditioner and blow drying process my hair still looked the same, but after you apply heat (I use a titanium flat iron)</li>
            <li> I have been natural for 4 years, and due to the fact that I never wear any \\&quot;natural\\&quot; styles like kinky twists or curls...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do tiny 1/8 in flat iron pieces as directed with the system, but I don&#x27;t have time to do that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m worried my previously relaxed hair will break off eventually where it meets the \\&quot;new growth\\</li>
            <li> but I decided that since she&#x27;s gotten older, she can handle sitting and getting her hair blow dried and flat ironed where as she couldn&#x27;t before.</li>
            <li> I used that a few days later, but my hair still seemed somewhat dull and not as smooth.</li>
            <li> I have extremely coarse, extremely dry, tightly curled, African American hair, natural.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my flat iron goes to the recommended 400-450 degrees though.  </li>
            <li> I think I might buy another flat iron and try again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and when I use the flat iron it makes it dryer.</li>
            <li> every time I flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have long bleach blonde highlighted hair</li>
            <li> Long story short, this product is not for ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> so I took a break before flat ironing.</li>
            <li> And my flat iron does not go up to the recommended temperature</li>
            <li> so I flat iron at 395.</li>
            <li> especially if you have long hair.</li>
            <li> For those saying it is not for ethnic hair, I don&#x27;t quite understand because I am black and natural and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> Also, if anyone is wondering what else I put in my hair, I only put in a few drops of Wild Growth Hair Oil on my scalp and rubbed it in, nothing else.</li>
            <li> However, my hair is not very soft.</li>
            <li> first the process is very long ,(almost 3 hours for me), and the part that i hated the most was the last part when you must apply the \\&quot;D\\&quot; leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> None of my long standing products worked anymore.</li>
            <li> This is a long review</li>
            <li> Process is long.  </li>
            <li> but I could not get the long hair I wanted because it would break from being dry and fighting with it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wished the product could go on dry, and wondered what would happen if it did.</li>
            <li> It was unmanageable, dry, and unruly, no matter what product I used.</li>
            <li> so it was dry and brittle ..</li>
            <li> The smoothing treatment will be applied while your hair is this dry so take your time and do not pull your hair out.  </li>
            <li> I went from having tons of single strand knots to having swinging luxurious hair.</li>
            <li> So there was plenty of down time in my process this last time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Her hair is past the middle of her back</li>
            <li> But the second time I had this treatment, I did it myself still a half day process.  </li>
            <li> My dad has tight nappy (now called kinky since everyone is going natural) hair, my mom has very thick hair that use to make for a killer afro in her day but the soft texture would make it lean a little and her new growth is wavy with a little frizz (she uses a relaxer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So when I saw this at Sally I decided to try it,the directions are a little different</li>
            <li> Yesterday I put curlers in my hair for a little extra body</li>
            <li> My hair is really soft but it looks dull.</li>
            <li> &quot; that is not straight but has been treated with the system, but hoping that won&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s five years old with thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> With as thick as her hair is, there wasn&#x27;t enough shampoo and barely enough of what was in the tall bottle.</li>
            <li> Her hair is extremely curly and when it gets wet and dries it&#x27;s downright kinky.  </li>
            <li> Hair is silky when blow dried and flat ironed.  </li>
            <li> I am unsure how it would work on other hair types.</li>
            <li> this is NOT for you , as one of the other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> You can purchase every other silk elements</li>
            <li> Her hair was matted and tangled after a braid take down.</li>
            <li> My hair seemed to be less shiny.</li>
            <li> I previously relaxed my hair probably two months ago.</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds in the past year trying to find something that works.</li>
            <li> but when I finished, my hair was a tangled mess.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser trimmed all my dead ends that I never had before.</li>
            <li> So if you desire dried out damage hair</li>
            <li> The tingly pain lasted for a few days after the treatment.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t WASTE your money ladies.</li>
            <li> It usually takes about half an hour to put it into ponytail/braids.    </li>
            <li> and I know it takes a little longer for my thick</li>
            <li> I wondered if her hair would be as usual.  </li>
            <li> I usually relax my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also sold separately and absolutely worth it even if you don&#x27;t feel like doing all this crap.</li>
            <li> and it is usually time for me to relax my hair every 5 weeks.  </li>
            <li> My little girl has very thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to apply to wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have been relaxing since at least the age of 8.  </li>
            <li> My hair is too thick for me to style with a blow dryer</li>
            <li> Then after I blow dried my arms were tired</li>
            <li> My hair is slowly recovering and regaining its curly texture but the ends are string, weak curls which I am gradually trimming off.</li>
            <li> The sales lady suggested I try this since it&#x27;s supposedly not a relaxer or just a really weak one.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and wavy.</li>
            <li> that being said, I can tell that there is a dramatic difference in my frizz.  </li>
            <li> Anyway for the price and seeing other results, I am a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Its been a year and a half since I put this crap in my hair</li>
            <li> It felt like fake hair.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a bad product, just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> but now I am afraid to!</li>
            <li> Although the shampoo is terrible, the conditioner is THEE BOMB!</li>
            <li> And this product smell so bad !!...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Let the picture speak for itself. I started using this on my 4b natural hair. I went from having tons of single strand knots to having swinging luxurious hair. My cousin is transitioning and she was considering going back to a relaxer. I told her to let me try this product on her hair and it worked wonders. Her hair was matted and tangled after a braid take down. After I applied the treatment, her hair had volume and shine.</li>
            <li> I have approx 80% gray hair that is frizzy and 2a.  I prematurely grayed in my early 20&#x27;s and now am almost 40.  Before my gray, my hair was stick straight.  I thought I&#x27;d give this product a shot based upon my local Sally Beauty Supply manager&#x27;s recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process was pretty easy.  I don&#x27;t think my flat iron goes to the recommended 400-450 degrees though.  I think I might buy another flat iron and try again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I can tell that there is a dramatic difference in my frizz.  However, my hair still has some wave it it when I let it dry naturally.  I really want to be able to wash and go and also sleep on it and be able to have decent looking 2nd day  hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is not a noticable difference in the amount of shine my hair has.  When I wash it and it is drying, I can smell the chemicals still.  I&#x27;ve washed it twice now.  Kind of like a weak perm smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update how long the frizz stays under control and if I decide to try again with a better flat iron.</li>
            <li> I used Kera for the first time yesterday for myself and my great-grand daughter.  She&#x27;s five years old with thick curly hair.  I groom her hair every day before school and work.  It usually takes about half an hour to put it into ponytail/braids.    She went out to play afterwards, and had a hot bath after that. I wondered if her hair would be as usual.  This morning, the braids looked almost as good as new, and grooming went fast.  We were finished in about 10 minutes.         My own hair had been processed with a relaxer about six weeks ago, and I wondered how it would work out.  It was fabulous,  no tell-tail line of demarcation.  My hair looks better than ever ... it has a glow, and body.  Wow!  This is an answer to my prayers for both our hair.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, and will continue to purchase and use it.    BettyC</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and wavy. I used the Coppola treatment and it worked great but is expensive. So when I saw this at Sally I decided to try it,the directions are a little different but I followed them exactly.I noticed when I washed it out that my hair clumped together like stuck spaghetti but felt better after I put the rinse in it. My hair now feels like synthetic hair. I have been washing it out with clarifying shampoos and deep conditioning it. My hair dresser trimmed all my dead ends that I never had before. My hair is too thick for me to style with a blow dryer and when I use the flat iron it makes it dryer.I would not recommend this for non ethnic hair.I would like to try the ion brand but now I am afraid to!</li>
            <li> I read many reviews before buying the product and accessories from Sally Beauty Supply. I used the Kera mineral system about two weeks ago. I usually relax my hair. I was surprised at the time it took to do the whole system, 4 hours for me. I brought a floor length mirror into my bathroom so I could see the back of my hair. It was difficult to apply to wet hair. I wished the product could go on dry, and wondered what would happen if it did. But I applied it by the package directions. Afterwards, my hair was very soft and pliable, but not straight at all. The \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; description is accurate. However, my hair was very straight after I flat ironed it like I normally do, and it seemed smoother and softer after using the system. I didn&#x27;t like the smell of the smoothing product or the leave-in conditioner, but my boyfriend didn&#x27;t mind it. I washed it about 5 days later with my own products, and it didn&#x27;t turn out as smooth, but it was still nice. My hair seemed to be less shiny. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was b/c I didn&#x27;t do tiny 1/8 in flat iron pieces as directed with the system, but I don&#x27;t have time to do that every time I flat iron. I went to Sally&#x27;s and bought the Kera minerals shampoo and conditioner. I used that a few days later, but my hair still seemed somewhat dull and not as smooth. I washed again a few days after that with my own shampoo and some of the Kera shampoo, and my own conditioner. It turned out pretty smooth and was shinier. Overall, I&#x27;m giving the product a mixed review, because my hair seems more tangly and fragile, leading to some breakage, though I always had breakage with relaxers too. I&#x27;m worried my previously relaxed hair will break off eventually where it meets the \\&quot;new growth\\&quot; that is not straight but has been treated with the system, but hoping that won&#x27;t happen. I wonder if the product really needed to be applied on the ends and what would happen if just the new growth were treated. I&#x27;m back to my normal amount of time washing and styling, so the system didn&#x27;t cut down on that.  I think my hair does look a little healthier overall, so I&#x27;d be willing to try it again. I&#x27;m taking my time combing and trying to minimize breakage.</li>
            <li> When I purchased it, what I wanted was something to make my 8 year old daughter&#x27;s wet hair easier to comb out ... Smooth her curls so that I could easily detangle. The sales lady suggested I try this since it&#x27;s supposedly not a relaxer or just a really weak one.  My little girl has very thick and curly hair. She&#x27;s had a relaxer before and I had no complaints about relaxing it but I decided that since she&#x27;s gotten older, she can handle sitting and getting her hair blow dried and flat ironed where as she couldn&#x27;t before. Well ... It&#x27;s been about a year and she has a ton of new growth that I&#x27;d been tackling every week. Her roots are something else! Her hair is past the middle of her back and I spend more time detangling than anything else. Anyway ... I tried this on her and it didn&#x27;t do much smoothing to her curls at all. They remained ... Maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough product ...? But I felt like their wasn&#x27;t enough. With as thick as her hair is, there wasn&#x27;t enough shampoo and barely enough of what was in the tall bottle. After going through with the whole thing, it&#x27;s pretty silky and easy to comb but it didn&#x27;t do anything to help me out when you&#x27;ve washed and are ready to comb the hair out (which was my initial reason for buying this). The deep conditioner is the only reason I was able to get through this at all.  Will I try it again? Probably so ... I&#x27;m gonna wait about 2 months and reapply the whole system (using a different, but natural, shampoo). If the results are still the same, I&#x27;m not using it anymore.  By the way, the deep conditioner is REALLY good. If you don&#x27;t buy the whole system, get yourself a great deep conditioner. It&#x27;s also sold separately and absolutely worth it even if you don&#x27;t feel like doing all this crap.</li>
            <li> Please note, I am only speaking of my experience with my hair. I am unsure how it would work on other hair types. I have extremely coarse, extremely dry, tightly curled, African American hair, natural. I am not a fan of the whole \\&quot;hair classification system\\&quot; thing, but I guess if I were to use it, I would be a 4c. It took me years to learn how to manage my hair successfully. When I moved to a new region, my hair did not respond favorably. It was unmanageable, dry, and unruly, no matter what product I used. None of my long standing products worked anymore. No form of styling would stop it from drawing up into one puffy mass within hours. I have spent hundreds in the past year trying to find something that works. At this point I didn&#x27;t have much hope, no matter what I try on my hair, it is good for the first day, then it just reverts into an unmanageable mess. To shorten this very long story, when I finished the treatment, my hair was so soft and manageable and smelled great (the leave in conditioner gets rid of any lingering smell from the smoother). My husband couldn&#x27;t stop touching and smelling it! I still negative and figured everything looks good the first day- when I wake up will be the determining factor. Next morning, my hair was just as soft and smooth. It is day 5 and this is the longest I have ever had soft and manageable hair. Yesterday I put curlers in my hair for a little extra body and I got soft curls all day, and woke up this morning and they are still there. No dryness, no frizz, no pouf...I just can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I am so happy with it. If you have tried everything and nothing has worked, give this a try. I have no complaints. Though I did run out of smoother at the end, I wished the bottle were just a tad bigger- like maybe 8oz instead of the 6 I think it comes with. Also, if anyone is wondering what else I put in my hair, I only put in a few drops of Wild Growth Hair Oil on my scalp and rubbed it in, nothing else. And remember not to rush it, follow to detailed instructions to the letter for best results.t to rush it, follow to detailed instructions to the letter for best results.</li>
            <li> I think this product is really a mild perm in disguise. So if you desire dried out damage hair this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;If I could give it zero stars I would. I should have know something was amiss when I felt the product tingling my scalp intensely, plus the fact it had that sulphur smell like rotten eggs. The tingly pain lasted for a few days after the treatment. Its been a year and a half since I put this crap in my hair and I still have breakage. I even called the company in the beginning to find out if there was a way to remove the product like a regular keratin treatment can be removed with sodium. The sales person was totally in the dark which made me more suspicious that this product was more like a texturizer. My hair is slowly recovering and regaining its curly texture but the ends are string, weak curls which I am gradually trimming off. If you value you your natural curls then flee from this product!</li>
            <li> I love tho product! I have long bleach blonde highlighted hair I&#x27;ve been highlighting my hair for years so it was dry and brittle .. During the winter my hair does fine when u straighten it. I have naturally curly frizzy frizzy hair I have tried everything to get it to be smooth. I tried this product 100 percent transformation my hair has no frizz and stay straight even when it&#x27;s raining which for me was unheard of. The smell of the product is not that great but it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li> I TRIED THIS PRODUCT ON MONDAY ON MY NATURAL HAIR IM AN AFRICAN AMERICAN AND I HAVE BEEN NATURAL FOR 26 MONTHS I HAVE 3C/4A TEXTURE HAIR AND IT STRAIGHTEN AND SMOOTH MY HAIR NO FRIZZ STRAIGHT AND VERY SOFT AND SILKY AS IF I HAVE HAD THE DOMINICAN BLOW OUT DONE I LOVE IT WOULD GIVE IT ONE HUNDRED STARS IF I COULD</li>
            <li> I tried silk element kera minerals just to see if it did the same for short hair. I had read many great reviews on long hair and most of the results were outstanding. I have short hair, it use to be faded on the sides and back. It has grown probably inch and a half to two inches around sides and back and the top is probably 4 to 5 inches. I previously relaxed my hair probably two months ago. But the sides and back was mostly new growth. I followed direction to a tee. Maybe it just doesnt work the same on short hair or maybe it&#x27;s just my hair. My hair is really soft but it looks dull. I didn&#x27;t get as much shine as I had seen in previous reviews. I did not add any oil because it did not tell me to. Maybe I should have. Anyway for the price and seeing other results, I am a bit disappointed. I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a bad product, just did not work for me. Seems like it would work better if my hair was longer and if I had put some oil in my hair. Good luck to all that try it. Hope your results are better than mine!</li>
            <li> One MAJOR tip I can give when using this product is to substitute the shampoo. This shampoo is TERRIBLE!!!&lt;br /&gt;OMG! I was nervous during the entire process because my hair felt like straw. I will say, that it does get your hair squeaky clean... literally, I could hear the squeaky sound while I lathered my hair with it. Although the shampoo is terrible, the conditioner is THEE BOMB! It instantly softened my hair and, at last, my heart was at ease. This product,overall, did make my natural hair more manageable, but the shampoo has got to go.</li>
            <li> i saw a lot of mixed reviews about this product , and on the package it was mentioned that it work with \\&quot;all types of hair\\&quot; , well i guess my hair is in ANY type of hair. first the process is very long ,(almost 3 hours for me), and the part that i hated the most was the last part when you must apply the \\&quot;D\\&quot; leave in conditioner. it was like i had put some glue on my hair.And this product smell so bad !!...&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line i will never ever try this again even for free ....</li>
            <li> Long story short, this product is not for ethnic hair. I have natural hair and I followed the directions but when I finished, my hair was a tangled mess. It felt like fake hair. I couldn&#x27;t even comb it out. I had to have it cut. My hair won&#x27;t even wrap, its so unmanageable. Im better off getting a perm. Don&#x27;t WASTE your money ladies.</li>
            <li> All in all, this product did what it was supposed to do. My hair is stick straight and has absolutely no frizz or fly always. However, my hair is not very soft. The leave in conditioner almost felt sticky. It is still the first day and it may feel softer tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase my product off of Amazon. I bought this at a local Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. I have been natural for 4 years, and due to the fact that I never wear any \\&quot;natural\\&quot; styles like kinky twists or curls...I always wear extensions. My reasons for going natural were because I have a health condition and I did not want to continue to contaminate my body and blood stream with toxic chemicals , like relaxer... So anyway, my natural hair is a 3c/4a texture... It has suffered much breakage and damage, it was dry and unmanageable ....So I had decided after all of these years being natural to get a relaxer, but maybe only do it twice a year.....Well ladies, let me tell YOU....I am sooooo happy I used this treatment system, because now I don&#x27;t have to go back to relaxers! This stuff is the bizznazzz...hahahaha! Ok, I digress....I applied it myself and it took me a good hour and a half.  It&#x27;s probably best to have someone apply it for you, but I am a do-it-myself type of person.  It leaves your hair feeling soft as silk and IMO it is better than a relaxer treatment. I had a lot of damaged ends before the treatment and after I applied KERA, it appears to have sealed and repaired my damaged hair from root to tip! I was so excited about this product that I told my mom and she bought one the next day! I applied it for her and her hair came out amazing as well....she said that most of the time after her relaxer, she sees more fallout...this time there was barely a hair that hit the floor! This stuff is amazing, for anyone using relaxers or who wants to straighten their hair in a healthy and effective manner. If you are natural and you love rocking the natural curls and styles this is NOT for you , as one of the other reviewers mentioned. It will leave your hair bone straight. I love my straight hair, it is illustrious and healthy! What more could you ask for!</li>
            <li> *Disclaimer* This is a long review but I want to give all the details and comfort I can to a person reading this review for guidance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Another Disclaimer* I am not the \\&quot;let&#x27;s cut our hair off and go natural\\&quot; type of girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I wanted to write this review for all the women who may be looking at this product as a way to have more manageable hair for longer.  I am African American and I have very coarse hair and it is usually time for me to relax my hair every 5 weeks.  My dad has tight nappy (now called kinky since everyone is going natural) hair, my mom has very thick hair that use to make for a killer afro in her day but the soft texture would make it lean a little and her new growth is wavy with a little frizz (she uses a relaxer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 30 year veteran beautician recommended this product line to me...First, the shampoo and conditioner (which is simply amazing and worked wonders on my hair), then the smoothing system.  When I asked her about the smoothing system in comparison to the other blowout/keratin products, she told me this was the product for me and it would be great for my hair.  She recommended using this product along with my relaxer for the best results.  And for those thinking maybe my relaxer just worked well... I have been relaxing since at least the age of 8.  So NO...It&#x27;s not the relaxer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another *Disclaimer* I do not pretend to know what the ingredients in the smoothing system are and how they compare to what is in a relaxer.  I have seen reviews that say the product is a mild relaxer or that it has the same chemical makeup as a relaxer or that it is too harsh for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now used this product on 3 different occasions all with FABULOUS results.  My first was back in August 2012 before a cruise (in which I got into the saltiest water ever and still had great hair that night for the Captain&#x27;s dinner after a quick 10 minute shower and a very fast wash and condition because wewere running late).  My beautician did my first treatment.  She applied the relaxer, rinsed, shampooed, conditioned, rinsed... During the rinse of the conditioner we started on the smoothing system.  First the shampoo, then applied the smoothing treatment, shampoo, condition, leave in conditioner, blow dry, flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW...I know what you are thinking...DAMN THAT&#x27;S A LOT OF STEPS! And it is... But the second time I had this treatment, I did it myself still a half day process.  The third time, just last night, I did this after getting off of work.  Started around 5 pm and finished around midnight.  I left my first conditioner on for 30 minutes.  Process time for the smoothing treatment is 20 to 30 minutes after you apply.  And I left the second conditioner on for an hour (because I was watching TV not because the directions said so).  Then after I blow dried my arms were tired so I took a break before flat ironing. So there was plenty of down time in my process this last time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only has this product made my hair more manageable but it has allowed my hair to stay more manageable longer so I do not have as much breakage during that time when my new growth is causing it to be harder to comb and keep hydrated.  I now have hair that holds moisture better and doesn&#x27;t frizz in humidity.  My hair has grown so much since I started using this because my hair is hydrated, healthy, and stronger so it is not dry and breaking off.  My hair has always grown fast but I could not get the long hair I wanted because it would break from being dry and fighting with it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Warning* If you do this yourself, be gentle with your hair once you start the smoothing process.  The shampoo is designed to get your hair very, very clean from all oils which will leave hair feeling dry (this WILL go away).  The smoothing treatment will be applied while your hair is this dry so take your time and do not pull your hair out.  When you rinse the smoothing systemyou will be using the same shampoo (think of it as a stronger version of a neutralizing shampoo) but then you put on the conditioner and your hair will feel like silk when you rinse the last time. (I always leave my conditioner on longer than 2 minutes.  It is the same conditioner that I used before starting this system and I know it takes a little longer for my thick hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend using a different shampoo during this process, it was in another review and the shampoo provided preps your hair the way the smoothing treatment needs it to.  And my flat iron does not go up to the recommended temperature so I flat iron at 395. Which was more than high enough for me because on a normal basis I flat iron at 325.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone decide and I hope you love your hair as much as I do mine!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Sally&#x27;s and have had wonderful results.  I just purchased my 2nd box today. For those saying it is not for ethnic hair, I don&#x27;t quite understand because I am black and natural and have had no problems. Initially I didn&#x27;t think it was working because after the conditioner and blow drying process my hair still looked the same, but after you apply heat (I use a titanium flat iron) my hair was bone straight and soft like butter. I received so many compliments.  My hair even held up during a 4 day rain spree with very high humidity, it didn&#x27;t revert to its natural state. I&#x27;m completely sold. After about 7 weeks it isn&#x27;t as straight and won&#x27;t hold a curl so it is now time to reapply. Hope this review helps those on the fence.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my teenage daughters hair.  Her hair is extremely curly and when it gets wet and dries it&#x27;s downright kinky.  We refuse to apply a relaxer, so I had to come up with another plan.  After looking at keratin treatment reviews I decided this was the route to go.  I first tried ION from Sally&#x27;s and that treatment didn&#x27;t work well in her hair at all.  Then i tried silk elements which worked so much better.  Below are the pro&#x27;s and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Curly pattern is definitely looser.  Hair is silky when blow dried and flat ironed.  Her hair still frizzes but not into a mini Afro any longer.  Safe for her hair.  Her natural is much easier to comb through after washing. Depending on the state of your hair product last about 4 to six weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Process is long.  Not enough product especially if you have long hair. You can purchase every other silk elements Kera products  individually except the treatment, which is a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions exactly with the exception in order to have enough  shampoo.  I used my own shampoo first, then I used the Silk Elements shampoo and followed the directions on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it&#x27;s a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Sally Beauty supply. I am an  African american with natural hair and wanted to wear my hair straight for a special event. This product has made my hair permanently straight. I have ruined my natural curls and after growing it out for 3 years I have to start over transitioning AGAIN. DO NOT..I repeat DO NOT use this product if your hair is natural. I believe it is a mild relaxer.</li>
