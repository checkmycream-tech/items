            <li>Shellac is a wonderful product and a must-try for nail fanatics.</li>
            <li>Flawless results, excellent durability.</li>
            <li>i noticed that if you shake the bottle real good it kinda smooths the thickness</li>
            <li>Excellent product and service</li>
            <li>Very impressed with them and would buy from them again.</li>
            <li>I used this with Romantique and was very, very happy.  </li>
            <li>LOVE it !!!</li>
            <li>i receive it in very good conditions</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller in regards to the condition of the product and they had extremely good customer service!</li>
            <li>great product.great service.</li>
            <li>The price is good, the shipping is great and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>The product is good too, aside from the clumpy brush, the product smoothed out nicely on my nails</li>
            <li>I do my own Shellac manicures at my home.</li>
            <li>Shellac is also wonderful because you can paint over it with regular nail polish and then remove the polish with non-acetone remover without damaging the Shellac!</li>
            <li>so it goes on better</li>
            <li>Love the CND products though.</li>
            <li>I love Shellac and this is a must have color.</li>
            <li>I LOVE shellac</li>
            <li>and i have a beautiful french manicure.</li>
            <li>Great full coverage white, I love Shellac by CND&#x27;s system.</li>
            <li>It genuinely stays chip-free for 14 days and is wayyyy shinier than any nail polish you can purchase in the store or from a salon.  </li>
            <li>The supplies can be a little pricey (light, base/top coat, color, etc) and it takes a time or two to perfect the technique, but at $20+ per Shellac manicure at a salon, it quickly pays itself off.</li>
            <li>The perfect white to use for your french manicures.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought my own Shellac, so I don&#x27;t waste time and money in the salon every two weeks.</li>
            <li>Clean crisp white, used it for French manicure and it looks good.  </li>
            <li>Such a cute color, but not what I ordered.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think this was the correct color choice at first</li>
            <li>I love how it is like whiteout white</li>
            <li>They put a replacement product in the mail the next day after i contacted them free of charge.</li>
            <li>This product came very quickly in the mail, but appeared to be used (brush was dried).</li>
            <li>great quality like all the other shellacs, my only complaint was the thickness.</li>
            <li>and it is the only one that does not damage my natural nails.</li>
            <li>Go thin for a better look.</li>
            <li>Comes out really clumpy like it&#x27;s old or has been opened previously.</li>
            <li>its super thick so its kinda  chunky looking when youre done.</li>

            <li> The bottle I received in the mail is super thick and clumpy!</li>
            <li> i put on my first coat way too thick...</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really easy to do yourself, and so much less expensive!  </li>
            <li> NO polish in bottle &amp; what little there was, was dry !!!  </li>
            <li> You CAN paint it on with less paint</li>
            <li> Just a reminder that you need the system (light, base, topcoat) for it to work.</li>
            <li> like all shellac, if its too thick when you cure it it gets wrinkly.</li>
            <li> but it does get extremely thick to put a thin coat on.</li>
            <li> It went on thick and after 5 seconds there were holes in the polish on my nails!</li>
            <li> Can also be used underneath other colors to enhance and brighten them as a base.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality I received from the seller!!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t polish a Customers Nails that day, VERY MAD &amp; UPSET !!!</li>

            <li> Shellac is a wonderful product and a must-try for nail fanatics.

Shellac is also wonderful because you can paint over it with regular nail polish and then remove the polish with non-acetone remover without damaging the Shellac! I do my own Shellac manicures at my home. The supplies can be a little pricey (light, base/top coat, color, etc) and it takes a time or two to perfect the technique, but at $20+ per Shellac manicure at a salon, it quickly pays itself off. I would truly recommend Shellac to any woman!!</li>
            <li> CND would like you to think you have to go to a salon to get Shellac nail polish - in reality, it&#x27;s really easy to do yourself, and so much less expensive!  I&#x27;m so glad I bought my own Shellac, so I don&#x27;t waste time and money in the salon every two weeks.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received in the mail is super thick and clumpy! It went on thick and after 5 seconds there were holes in the polish on my nails! Terrible quality I received from the seller!!</li>
            <li> Great full coverage white, I love Shellac by CND&#x27;s system. Just a reminder that you need the system (light, base, topcoat) for it to work. Flawless results, excellent durability.</li>
            <li> i put on my first coat way too thick... Go thin for a better look.</li>
            <li> great quality like all the other shellacs, my only complaint was the thickness. its super thick so its kinda  chunky looking when youre done. You CAN paint it on with less paint it just doesnt go on even. like all shellac, if its too thick when you cure it it gets wrinkly. i noticed that if you shake the bottle real good it kinda smooths the thickness so it goes on better but it can get bubbles.</li>
            <li> Clean crisp white, used it for French manicure and it looks good.  I use this white and zillionaire sometime for the tips of my nails.</li>
            <li> I ordered Cream Puff and they sent me Cake Pop. Such a cute color, but not what I ordered. Love the CND products though.</li>
            <li> Cream Puff is a Must Have for those who want French tip style nails, with a brighter white than Studio White. Can also be used underneath other colors to enhance and brighten them as a base.</li>
            <li> I love Shellac and this is a must have color. The price is good, the shipping is great and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Comes out really clumpy like it&#x27;s old or has been opened previously.</li>
            <li> great product.great service.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this was the correct color choice at first however this is the correct color for proper french manicures.  I LOVE shellac and it is the only one that does not damage my natural nails.</li>
            <li> Dislike a lot because it&#x27;s been three weeks and I still not receive the product. Probably I should be  waiting a year or something like that for a nail design by Shellac. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love how it is like whiteout white but it does get extremely thick to put a thin coat on.</li>
            <li> i receive it in very good conditions</li>
            <li> NO polish in bottle &amp; what little there was, was dry !!!  Couldn&#x27;t polish a Customers Nails that day, VERY MAD &amp; UPSET !!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service</li>
