            <li>works fine.</li>
            <li>It added the perfect little touch to my wife&#x27;s home salon.</li>
            <li>and the metal that pull the combs and scissors up is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>keep 1 comb in it with water and a light amount of Barbicide</li>
            <li>It is light weight but of a size that assists what I am using it for.  </li>
            <li>Keeps them clean and at hand.</li>
            <li>so now I replace it with this one I love it thanks</li>
            <li>it says unbreakable but I didn&#x27;t drop it on the ground to see if its true.</li>
            <li>It looks really cool.</li>
            <li>rinse it clean about once a week and add fresh water and just a capful of barbacide.</li>
            <li>This is great but it does not explain or excuse why it broke in the first place and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super useful if you&#x27;re a germaphobe and want to disinfect your stuff.</li>
            <li>Perfect size, and built tough...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many I&#x27;ve replaced over the last year alone.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s actually pretty</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Very high class product.</li>
            <li>Very usable container.  </li>
            <li>Really like this one.</li>
            <li>I really like how this product is not glass so not prone to break as advertise.</li>
            <li>Hopefully the replacement won&#x27;t suffer the same fate as the original.</li>
            <li>I bought the hard plastic kind</li>
            <li>works fine and just what i expected!</li>
            <li>When you pull the top off sometimes your stuff will fall in between the little crack from the actual jar itself and the metal cup that holds it.</li>
            <li>In fact mine has developed a crack 3/4 of the way around without ever being hit, dropped or abused in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have no idea why it developed a crack.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;sturdy, acrylic, clear and relatively stylish.&lt;br /&gt;so far no issues or rust seen anywhere.</li>
            <li>You see before I reviewed this in a negative light I had sent an email to the Marvy company</li>
            <li>it would have made it possible to close the lid completely with my rat tail comb in there,</li>

            <li> Just what I needed! It&#x27;s deep enough to contain my long combs and other implements. This was an awesome Christmas gift and the price is comparable to ones you buy at specialty stores.</li>
            <li> is very small, not standard barber or salon size at all. its not glass. its plastic. and the metal that pull the combs and scissors up is cheaply made. returned</li>
            <li> I like this one I had glass be for a long time then one day cut small kid hair and broke it so now I replace it with this one I love it thanks</li>
            <li> Yes it  exceeds my expectations</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 6 months now and it is great. Well made and looks good too. Should have bought this years ago.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a bottle also with my order... But it was just what it said unbreakable Great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually using it to hold 6&amp;#34; laboratory q-tips. Keeps them clean and at hand.</li>
            <li> Just what i needed for the salon! works fine and just what i expected! Its used with barbicide solution. I intend to soak combs in them.</li>
            <li> From beginning to end superb service and quality. Thank you.</li>
            <li> It it&#x27;s what it says.</li>
            <li> Love this jar, just wish the lid was more stable because it someone were to knock it over, it&#x27;d be a horrible mess</li>
            <li> It works great at the school im in everything I use fits in it all at once and it was great price and showed up on time I will be buying some more stuff soon :)</li>
            <li> For some reason our staff constantly broke the barbacide jars with increasing regularity. I can&#x27;t tell you how many I&#x27;ve replaced over the last year alone. So I almost couldn&#x27;t believe it when I came across this plastic version. I bought 1 for each room and some extra just in case. They work beautifully. There is no more reason to be sweeping up broken glass anymore! YEA!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: March 6, 2013&lt;br /&gt;Having a problem with cloudiness with the jars if using barbcide plus in them. Still not breaking, but doesn&#x27;t look good with a hazy look to the jars.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, and built tough...</li>
            <li> darn, i did not realize how big this thing is. it&#x27;s actually pretty deep.&lt;br /&gt;unless you need it for some seriously long items, shorter ones are probably plenty good.&lt;br /&gt;sturdy, acrylic, clear and relatively stylish.&lt;br /&gt;so far no issues or rust seen anywhere. we&#x27;ll see how it does over longer use period.&lt;br /&gt;overall happy with it. we use it in our lab to soak up various types of elements (plastic/metal) we use.</li>
            <li> I am a mobile groomer and it Fits into my silver tool holder.  Wish it were just about 1.5 inches taller but works great!</li>
            <li> I wish this was a little taller. it would have made it possible to close the lid completely with my rat tail comb in there, but oh well. It&#x27;s plastic and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking.</li>
            <li> In fact mine has developed a crack 3/4 of the way around without ever being hit, dropped or abused in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep 1 comb in it with water and a light amount of Barbicide (just enough to keep mold and mildew away). After 1.5 years I noticed a crack almost all the way around, it&#x27;s not leaking (yet) but this is actually very fragile and is made of thin acrylic plastic. When I purchased it and it said unbreakable I figured it would be polycarbonate but it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take very good care of it and it&#x27;s in my bathroom. My dad lives with me but he has his own bathroom. No kids or other people use my restroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rinse it clean about once a week and add fresh water and just a capful of barbacide. I have no idea why it developed a crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** Update 7/12/13 ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am adding 2 more stars to my original review. You see before I reviewed this in a negative light I had sent an email to the Marvy company and I never got a response. Well today (almost a month since I emailed them) I got a package from them with a replacement jar. This is great but it does not explain or excuse why it broke in the first place and why they never got back to me to let me know they would replace it. For this I upped the rating from 1 star to 3 stars now. Hopefully the replacement won&#x27;t suffer the same fate as the original.</li>
            <li> Very high class product. It added the perfect little touch to my wife&#x27;s home salon. It&#x27;s always nice to see clean tools when you get a cut at a friends house.</li>
            <li> In the past I have bought Marvy glass quats jar. It was great while it lasted. I noticed that it can also be a probability to why it cracked because my barber station always has the sun shining against it. In my case, heat from the sun which causes the glass to expand can also make it crack. I bought the hard plastic kind and I&#x27;m just loving it. Lighter and less fragile.</li>
            <li> Love that its unbreakable and easy to clean and care for does not get built up on the bottem like glass ones do! I would buy again! Great Transaction!</li>
            <li> I bought it because it was unbreakable. Breakable glass is not a good idea in the bathroom. And I needed some where for all of my combs.</li>
            <li> Excellent jar! I wish we could get barbicide here in Afghanistan.</li>
            <li> Very usable container.  It is light weight but of a size that assists what I am using it for.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> it says unbreakable but I didn&#x27;t drop it on the ground to see if its true. It feels like its good quality and it came fast.</li>
            <li> it was the best christmas gift ever</li>
            <li> Got no chance of breaking it, it&#x27;s better and lighter than the glass one</li>
            <li> Works awesome I have no issues with this beaker. Can fit as many siscors and combs as i have and works just great.</li>
            <li> I brought for my daughter that is a stylist, I need a bigger one!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed at a great price!</li>
            <li> Really like this one.</li>
            <li> Perfect for salon use, I used Amazon to get most everthing to open my salon.  Prices were the best by far.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Item just as described!</li>
            <li> I really like how this product is not glass so not prone to break as advertise. It looks really cool. My only real gripe I say would be the bottom plate that holds your shears, combs and etc seems small. When you pull the top off sometimes your stuff will fall in between the little crack from the actual jar itself and the metal cup that holds it. Hard to explain. Other than that the lid gets really dusty and dirty for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But works fine. It&#x27;s super useful if you&#x27;re a germaphobe and want to disinfect your stuff. I use it for cutting my hair and disinfecting my DE safety razors, just dip it in barbacide for like 10 minutes then rinse.</li>
