            <li>it&#x27;s cruelty free, Clairol isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>and I find it perfectly moisturizing which isn&#x27;t easy as we have very hard</li>

            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a thick rich lavender when it foams, I soap it up and let it sit for a few and then rinse, wring out as much water as possible then</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference when using this product. Would not purchase again.  I used this shampoo once a week for four weeks.  I have highlights and lowlights. My hair looked the same after using this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair except turn it purple.  Bad investment.</li>
            <li> Great for blonde color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Best purple shampoo for brassiness and orange blonde</li>
            <li> I let my roots grow to about an inch, cut off all the colored hair, bought a silver wig and let my hair grow out (took 3 months to little pixie). Love this shampoo as it takes me from grungy gray to shining silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I need a dandruff shampoo, so I wash once with the Selsun and a second time with the Silver.</li>
            <li> Got here in 4 days, so pretty fast shipping. I used it immediately &amp; the smell is just to die forrrr! I love it. Just used today so hopefully it keeps my blonde, blonde!</li>
            <li> Great for colored blonde hair. Came fast and great price.</li>
            <li> Works well but it makes my scalp itch if I use it daily.  So now I combine it with other shampoo and use it every third day.  I love the way it makes the grey in my hair sparkle in the sun.</li>
            <li> I am old enough now to actually appreciate white hair, got this shampoo and it makes my hair shine, have had lots of compliments on how nice my grey hair looks.  This stuff works well, and is good for your hair.  Nice Product for both men and women.  Dan</li>
            <li> Works real good with gray hair.</li>
            <li> This brand doesn&#x27;t tint your hair purple/lavender like others do.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is really fantastic, and worth the buy.&lt;br /&gt;My bangs are a dyed silver and this really helps keeping away all the brass yellow coloring that sneaks in while the roots start to come back and that the conditioners can sometimes set back in.&lt;br /&gt;Really great! Will definitely get more when I run out</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t turn hair purple. Brightens my silver hair and keeps the yellow away. Love it. Smells good, makes my hair feel healthy, plus the product is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> Performs well on gray or graying hair leaves out yellow other shampoos show.  Leaves hair clean and manageable easy to care for.</li>
            <li> I have grey hair with solid white around the front. This shampoo makes my hair shiny, and keeps the white, white. Grey/white hair can get a yellow tinge, depending on the shampoo.  This shampoo gets the yellow out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deep purple color took some getting used too, but I have had no problem adjusting. And it does not stain my fingers and/or my counter and tile.</li>
            <li> I love AG products. If you have blond hair and want to take the brassy tones out get this ASAP!!!</li>
            <li> Loooove this stuff! Does wonders on blondes!</li>
            <li> This stuff really makes a difference on my hair every time I use it--the light gold color I&#x27;m at gets less brassy/red every time I use it!! Excellent value for the price, and super friendly company.</li>
            <li> Professional barber/stylist here, and this is my #1 favorite toning shampoo, and I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;em all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this products and others from this company before. I love all there products. It does exactly what it is intended for and I never have to worry about my hair turning purple after using it.</li>
            <li> I tried an AG fast food trial size about six months ago and instantly switched all my hair products over to this company. I cannot express the level of awesomeness they contain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have white platinum hair, coming down from a black-brown - it&#x27;s very thick and very coarse. As you can imagine it takes quite a beating getting bleached and I always hit that pale yellow plateau. This silver shampoo and conditioner leaves them tinted perfectly, not a yellow hair to be found and I find it perfectly moisturizing which isn&#x27;t easy as we have very hard water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a thick rich lavender when it foams, I soap it up and let it sit for a few and then rinse, wring out as much water as possible then condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have to tone between bleaching using other purple shampoos, I&#x27;ve tried about five brands. Not with the AG. This is the HG for platinum mamas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add a cherry to the top it&#x27;s cruelty free, Clairol isn&#x27;t. I highly recommend, if you&#x27;re going for that white platinum it&#x27;s absolutely worth it. Amazing results.</li>
