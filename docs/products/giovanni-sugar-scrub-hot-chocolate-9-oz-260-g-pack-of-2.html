            <li>this scrub smells amazing, just what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing-</li>
            <li>I liked the Ole one a lot--despite its exorbitant price--but Sephora stopped carrying it quite a while ago.</li>
            <li>and I imagine it is every bit as effective as this one.</li>
            <li>it does warm up</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve not tried the lemon yet because I&#x27;ve been so happy with the hot chocolate, it still smells lovely</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got two, I&#x27;m keeping one.</li>
            <li>Just okay.</li>
            <li>Most skin scrubs are so crumbly that when scooped into your hand, a lot of the product drops onto the floor of your shower.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, I love the size of the scrub, I love the packaging.</li>
            <li>There is nothing I don&#x27;t love about this product.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel and it is such a great product!</li>
            <li>Really does a great job of exfoliating and the chocolate fragrance</li>
            <li>This is the best scrub out there, ESPECIALLY at this price</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t prefer oily scrubs and this one is definitely more grainy.  </li>
            <li>but now after using it, I think I&#x27;ll be the giftee...:-)</li>
            <li>I love this scrub...after it stopped being carried in stores</li>
            <li>but oh wells I love it.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>YUMMY scent, REAL CHOCOLATE SMELL, great sugared scrub.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>i will be buy some more when it run out</li>
            <li>my favorite scrub of all time.</li>
            <li>and i LOVE the smell.</li>
            <li>(so it&#x27;s reasonably in line with the MSRP); however, this stuff is so good that I would still probably pay up to $30 for it in a pinch--I never want to be without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this scrub for how gently but effectively it exfoliates the skin.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and warmth of the salty sweet chocolate that warms your skin when you put it on</li>
            <li>After that I made my own scrub for a while, which worked ok, but I still kept an eye out for something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter: Giovanni scrub, which I found in the natural section at my grocery store.</li>
            <li>Both the hot chocolate and lemon smell amazing (and true to name),</li>
            <li>Hot chocolate in the shower!!</li>
            <li>The scent is like decadent, rich, velvety smooth fudge.</li>
            <li>is extremely drying, which may make it an ideal scrub for someone with oily skin.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have tried many different scrubs from St. Ives apricot scrub to $20+ scrubs to my own homemade concoctions.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best scrub I have ever used and the only store bought scrub I am not allergic to.</li>
            <li>and i use it sparingly because i just love it so much.  </li>
            <li>one day I love the smell so much</li>
            <li>Ladies love the way it smell on me.the scent stay with u for the whole day</li>
            <li>I disliked the smell a great deal</li>
            <li>They use as a foot scrub for fun.</li>
            <li>This stuff really smells like Hot Chocolate and washes off easily without leaving a residue in the shower/</li>
            <li>The consistency of this product is just right, and is not as oily as some scrubs, but some improvements to refine that a bit would be helpful.  </li>
            <li>This would also make a great gift, because it has the packaging and effectiveness of a much more expensive product.</li>
            <li>it doesnt slide off my skin and it takes less to get a good scrub.</li>
            <li>I am lucky this product is sold on amazon (and for a much better price than it was available for locally) and dread the day it will no longer be available because it is the only body scrub I can use really.</li>
            <li>The way it leaves my skin is none other than utterly smooth and the ingredients are a lot better than some of the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I love this scrub and would recommend it to someone with my skin type but not to someone with oily skin because it is likely too moisturizing.</li>
            <li>At first I balked at the Amazon price, but then realized it&#x27;s for two containers</li>
            <li>My skin is totally smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>First time using a scrub</li>
            <li>in my opinion, just like hot chocolate.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy this scrub locally (for around $13) at Whole Foods, Publix, and Walmart</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin super soft and refreshed!</li>
            <li>The container looks small, but it&#x27;s definitely a good amount of concentrated product.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderfully amazing like a delicious cup of hot cocoa while sloughing away dead dry skin leaving behind smooth soft moisturized beauty!</li>
            <li>It really makes my skin much softer and you dont need to use that much of it.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is not heavy and leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve previously used some other (much pricier) natural brand scrubs, most notably Ole Henriksen&#x27;s sea salt lemongrass one and Fresh&#x27;s brown sugar scrub.</li>
            <li>The scent is really yummy; it&#x27;s easy to mess up synthetic chocolate scents, but these people got it right.</li>
            <li>This scrub has small exfoliating sugar crystals and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I am not a big purchaser of beauty products or such, but this was given to me as a gift and when I used it all, I had to buy more.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Pros: turns sandpaper-like skin into touchable skin, smells good, can be used on sensitive skin, gets rid of bumps on the back of the upper arm, no animal testing, 100% vegetarian ingredients, has several certified organic ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li>And it does actually give a slight warming effect for a short time which feels great in the winter.</li>
            <li>May buy more for xmas gifts for their little friends.</li>
            <li>The sugar granules are small enough that they don&#x27;t hurt or scrape your skin, but large and plentiful enough that they do a great job of exfoliating.</li>
            <li>It left my skin super soft!</li>
            <li>but I opted for the chocolate because it&#x27;s not a fragrance you normally see in beauty products.</li>
            <li>The texture is like a super-thick concentrated sugar paste, and everything is uniformly mixed (no ingredient separation like with Fresh).</li>
            <li>I generally smear about a large marble-sized chunk of the paste on my skin, and then work a little water into it until I can move it around easily and scrub a large area of my skin.</li>
            <li>Some of my skin (mostly my stomach) turns a little red at first after use because of the warming effect in conjunction with the rubbing of the sugar crystals across my skin.</li>
            <li>I primarily use this on my legs (because that is where I sometimes get dry skin), but this can definitely be used all over.</li>
            <li>Also, I am sensitive to fragrances and chemicals.</li>
            <li>But, I was very pleasantly surprised at how well it works (came with two</li>
            <li>I wish I got one chocolate and one coconut lime, the latter sounds promising too.</li>
            <li>i love the thick paste like texture...</li>
            <li>I am then left super soft and smooth, but my skin and shower floor are not slick like with the Fresh scrub (or Lush Buffy bar, which I was also disappointed in).</li>
            <li>The scrub is just the right consistency, not too harsh and not too soft, and it leaves your body well moisturized.</li>
            <li>The only bad thing is that is smells so good, it makes me crave chocolate!</li>
            <li>I use it daily on my legs after shaving and it does not hurt my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Not overly gritty, but really does the job nicely especially leaving in Buffalo with dry legs.</li>
            <li>My skin type is: very sensitive, dry, and prone to redness.</li>
            <li>The sugar and crushed cocoa beans are just abrasive enough to slough away any dry patches your skin may be plagued with, yet gentle enough to keep even sensitive skin from harm.</li>
            <li>During hot summer months, add a few drops of peppermint essential oil to this scrub.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a sort of sugar scrub addict, and this is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried. The scent is really yummy; it&#x27;s easy to mess up synthetic chocolate scents, but these people got it right. The scrub is just the right consistency, not too harsh and not too soft, and it leaves your body well moisturized. Furthermore, this is a great price. I bought this product at a local retailer for twice the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister who is only using organic (no parabens or any artificial stuff).  She loves it.  It smells delicious, just like chocolate.  I like sugar crystals because they aren&#x27;t as rough as salt.  I&#x27;m glad I got two, I&#x27;m keeping one.</li>
            <li> When I buy this product, I usually do so in quantity.    This exfoliant smells delicious, but it is also extremely effective.  It is the perfect balance of exfoliant and moisturizer.  I use it daily on my legs after shaving and it does not hurt my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Just okay. Average product</li>
            <li> this is perfect. i wish is was a perfume.  seriously i do.  the smell is so yummy,  it does the jobs of cleansing and softening and i use it sparingly because i just love it so much.  i put it on my wrists one day I love the smell so much</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! The scent is like decadent, rich, velvety smooth fudge. The sugar and crushed cocoa beans are just abrasive enough to slough away any dry patches your skin may be plagued with, yet gentle enough to keep even sensitive skin from harm. Most skin scrubs are so crumbly that when scooped into your hand, a lot of the product drops onto the floor of your shower. Not so with the Giovanni scrub. The consistency of this product is almost gel-like. The exfoliants are suspended in a this gel. It does not slip off the skin as soon as your hand smooths it on, so none of the product is wasted. I&#x27;ve tried products similar to the Giovanni Sugar Scrub, and nothing compares.  My showers suck without this stuff! Although Giovanni Sugar Scrub is a bit pricey, the quality of the product justifies the dollar amount. (One 9 ounce container should last one person about 2 or 3 months.) FYI.... During hot summer months, add a few drops of peppermint essential oil to this scrub. It smells just like a York Peppermint Patty, and the coolness of the mint makes your skin feel refreshed and tingley!</li>
            <li> Pros: turns sandpaper-like skin into touchable skin, smells good, can be used on sensitive skin, gets rid of bumps on the back of the upper arm, no animal testing, 100% vegetarian ingredients, has several certified organic ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: expensive, hard to find locally, does not last long, amazing smell does not linger, may be too moisturizing for someone with oily skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been buying this and only this scrub for several years now. Over the years I have tried many different scrubs from St. Ives apricot scrub to $20+ scrubs to my own homemade concoctions. This is by far the best scrub I have ever used and the only store bought scrub I am not allergic to. My skin type is: very sensitive, dry, and prone to redness. Also, I am sensitive to fragrances and chemicals. I used to be able to buy this scrub locally (for around $13) at Whole Foods, Publix, and Walmart but they all stopped carrying it. I am lucky this product is sold on amazon (and for a much better price than it was available for locally) and dread the day it will no longer be available because it is the only body scrub I can use really. This scrub has small exfoliating sugar crystals and smells amazing. I wish the chocolate fragrance lingered a bit. This scrub is warming when used which is likely why it is called &amp;#34;hot chocolate&amp;#34;. Some of my skin (mostly my stomach) turns a little red at first after use because of the warming effect in conjunction with the rubbing of the sugar crystals across my skin. This chocolate scrub actually helps keep away bumps I get on the backs of my arms. I love this scrub and would recommend it to someone with my skin type but not to someone with oily skin because it is likely too moisturizing. I do not, however, recommend the mint lemon salt scrub by Giovanni to anyone with my skin type at it is extremely drying, which may make it an ideal scrub for someone with oily skin.</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it! One use and I am hooked. It left my skin super soft!</li>
            <li> I love the smell, I love the size of the scrub, I love the packaging. There is nothing I don&#x27;t love about this product. It is my only body scrub. I use it about once a week. Highly recommended. I prefer this to Philosophy&#x27;s sugary food smelling scrubs.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest body scrub.  You may be tempted to eat it, as it smells delicious!  (but don&#x27;t!)  I love the way it makes my skin feel and it is such a great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a \\&quot;filler\\&quot; to round out a gift that included a bath pillow and slippers in similar colors (cream and brown).  But, I was very pleasantly surprised at how well it works (came with two so I kept one for myself).  Really does a great job of exfoliating and the chocolate fragrance is great but not overpowering.  For the price, it&#x27;s a great product - will be ordering again just for myself</li>
            <li> Oh my this has got to be the BEST sugar scrub I have ever used and the smells is so YUMMIE.  Not overly gritty, but really does the job nicely especially leaving in Buffalo with dry legs.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and makes my skin feel great</li>
            <li> This is the best scrub out there, ESPECIALLY at this price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MSRP from Giovanni on this is about $14, and I bought mine at the grocery store for around $11. At first I balked at the Amazon price, but then realized it&#x27;s for two containers (so it&#x27;s reasonably in line with the MSRP); however, this stuff is so good that I would still probably pay up to $30 for it in a pinch--I never want to be without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve previously used some other (much pricier) natural brand scrubs, most notably Ole Henriksen&#x27;s sea salt lemongrass one and Fresh&#x27;s brown sugar scrub. I liked the Ole one a lot--despite its exorbitant price--but Sephora stopped carrying it quite a while ago. The Fresh scrub (which was both highly rated and similarly highly priced) was just huge sugar granules in a ton of oil and the container leaked badly; it was slightly painful to use, did little to exfoliate, and only really served to slick my skin and shower floor with oil. After that I made my own scrub for a while, which worked ok, but I still kept an eye out for something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter: Giovanni scrub, which I found in the natural section at my grocery store. Both the hot chocolate and lemon smell amazing (and true to name), but I opted for the chocolate because it&#x27;s not a fragrance you normally see in beauty products. The container looks small, but it&#x27;s definitely a good amount of concentrated product. The sugar granules are small enough that they don&#x27;t hurt or scrape your skin, but large and plentiful enough that they do a great job of exfoliating. The texture is like a super-thick concentrated sugar paste, and everything is uniformly mixed (no ingredient separation like with Fresh). I primarily use this on my legs (because that is where I sometimes get dry skin), but this can definitely be used all over. I generally smear about a large marble-sized chunk of the paste on my skin, and then work a little water into it until I can move it around easily and scrub a large area of my skin. I am then left super soft and smooth, but my skin and shower floor are not slick like with the Fresh scrub (or Lush Buffy bar, which I was also disappointed in). While I&#x27;ve not tried the lemon yet because I&#x27;ve been so happy with the hot chocolate, it still smells lovely and I imagine it is every bit as effective as this one. This would also make a great gift, because it has the packaging and effectiveness of a much more expensive product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!!! Love it, good price, good smell. My skin is totally smooth and soft. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Great price. I have 2 girls, so gave one to each and they get a kick out of the warming feature. They use as a foot scrub for fun. May buy more for xmas gifts for their little friends.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub for how gently but effectively it exfoliates the skin.  There is no irritation and it smells super delicious.  It does not burn my skin like salt scrubs can if you have  small cuts after shaving. The way it leaves my skin is none other than utterly smooth and the ingredients are a lot better than some of the others I&#x27;ve used. I don&#x27;t prefer oily scrubs and this one is definitely more grainy.  I have noticed that this scrub helps diminish the appearance blemishes , probably because it causes skin cells to turn over faster. This scrub makes the skin on my décolleté  absolutely flawless and I hope the never stop making this stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff really smells like Hot Chocolate and washes off easily without leaving a residue in the shower/tub.&lt;br /&gt;Do use a lotion or oil afterwards as your skin may tend to be dry.  I bought the double pack with the intent of giving one away as a gift....but now after using it, I think I&#x27;ll be the giftee...:-)</li>
            <li> this scrub smells amazing, just what I was hoping for. I got the pack of 2. I wish I got one chocolate and one coconut lime, the latter sounds promising too.</li>
            <li> these are really nice and smell great</li>
            <li> I love this scrub...after it stopped being carried in stores I was happy to find it online...the price is great too</li>
            <li> I love that it smells so goooood!!! I also liked how it came in a pack of two!!! I read on other reviews that it gives off a burn feeling but it didn&#x27;t :( but oh wells I love it. It leaves my skin super soft and refreshed! I love organic products!!!</li>
            <li> Works great and smells divine.  Hot chocolate in the shower!!</li>
            <li> First time using a scrub and I LOVE THIS STUFF. Smells great and exfoliates wonderfully.</li>
            <li> YUMMY scent, REAL CHOCOLATE SMELL, great sugared scrub.  Extremely happy (and I am picky).  I took this scrub with me to the gym and opened it.  It has a TRUE Chocolate scent and is an excellent scrub.  Happy!</li>
            <li> This scrub smells yummy, but best of all it is a great exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I am not a big purchaser of beauty products or such, but this was given to me as a gift and when I used it all, I had to buy more.  It really makes my skin much softer and you dont need to use that much of it.  The only bad thing is that is smells so good, it makes me crave chocolate!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and warmth of the salty sweet chocolate that warms your skin when you put it on</li>
            <li> I disliked the smell a great deal</li>
            <li> What an amazingly delicious chocolate fragrance!!  The consistency of this product is just right, and is not as oily as some scrubs, but some improvements to refine that a bit would be helpful.  The fragrance is not heavy and leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth.  Did I mention how much I liked the chocolate-y fragrance!?</li>
            <li> Ladies love the way it smell on me.the scent stay with u for the whole day i will be buy some more when it run out</li>
            <li> my favorite scrub of all time. it does warm up and i LOVE the smell. this smells so good you want to eat it. i love the thick paste like texture...it doesnt slide off my skin and it takes less to get a good scrub. doesnt leave skin or the tub greasy. LOVE THIS!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this sugar scrub!!!!  Smells wonderfully amazing like a delicious cup of hot cocoa while sloughing away dead dry skin leaving behind smooth soft moisturized beauty! Even better it comes in a 2 pack!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing- in my opinion, just like hot chocolate. The sugar grains exfoliate enough without being rough on my skin. And it does actually give a slight warming effect for a short time which feels great in the winter. I will always have this in my shower.</li>
