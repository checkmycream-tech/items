    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

            <li>I have that skin where I&#x27;m yellowish when I&#x27;m not tanned, and Tickled is a perfect compliment.  </li>

            <li>I have the cheek stain in Blushing Bride and the color is just beautiful!!  </li>
            <li>And the colors are just delicious.  </li>
            <li>In my experience, that&#x27;s the best method.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a reason it has the reputation as the \\&quot;best blush ever\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>but it smells good!!</li>
            <li>Very bright pinky fushia.</li>
            <li>I am very fair.</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned with freckles</li>
            <li>If you want a great flushed look.... this is the perfect cheek stain for it.  </li>
            <li>Also, it smells SOO good, just like grape bubblegum!   </li>
            <li>I recommend Flush for those with fair skin, it looks perfect now</li>
            <li>Great for summer.</li>
            <li>and I am really really happy that I sprung for the product, despite the price.</li>
            <li>This product is versatile and great.  </li>
            <li>It is great stuff.  </li>
            <li>This is a GREAT product.  </li>
            <li>Both are very nice colors</li>
            <li>Beautiful color for fair skin.</li>
            <li>EVERY time I use one I feel like it&#x27;s the most delicious and luxurious thing to be doing.</li>
            <li>It blends wonderfully, and you have much better control than with powder blush.  </li>
            <li>So, the quality is amazing and the colors are just beautiful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning to purchase another color soon, it&#x27;s just that good.</li>
            <li>lot of people have compared this to Benetint which is also a good product</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a good gel blush since Beauticontrol stopped making their version of this stuff.</li>
            <li>Looks like the perfect rosy cheek - very pretty color for the summer.  </li>
            <li>Would probably be great for someone with a bit darker skin tone than myself (which most people are).</li>
            <li>This gel looks incredibly natural--like you&#x27;re lightly flushed.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wonderful reputation and is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I just think it is so much easier and quicker to apply the perfect color blush with a good powder brush.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with this one!  </li>
            <li>&quot; I love it!</li>
            <li>Regardless, I love it!</li>
            <li>They smell amazing, are easy to blend, and come in great colors.</li>
            <li>i have been wanting this product for a while and just received it yesterday, it is amazing...</li>
            <li>Definately a warm tone on me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely thrilled with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I really liked this too.  </li>
            <li>The raspberry scent is pleasant but not, thankfully, too strong.  </li>
            <li>It is not purple at all on my cheeks; just a beautiful light lavender-pink, and not too strong for fain skin.  </li>
            <li>It arrived and I tried it right away, and I am SOLD!!!  </li>
            <li>I own many of the Tarte Cheek Stain colors.</li>
            <li>this gives me a nice healthy glow of color.  </li>
            <li>It blends well (although you don&#x27;t have tons of work-time) and is the perfect shade for that natural flushed look I love.  </li>
            <li>I had seen it on a friend in a more peachy color and it looked nice, but I opted for the more pinky color \\&quot;Flush.\\</li>
            <li>&quot; look of most powder blushes</li>
            <li>I imagine it would work well on a variety of skin tones since there are so many gel colors</li>
            <li>despite my better judgement, and because I&#x27;ve heard so many rave reviews, I bought Tickled, a peachy/red color.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure there are more sanitary ways to do it</li>
            <li>Tarte Cheek Stain is my favorite product of ALL TIME.</li>
            <li>This is after many years of trying and wasting money on drug store brands.    </li>
            <li>This is one of my all time favorite colors.</li>
            <li>Tends to show a bit more peach.</li>
            <li>Really love this color.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite bronzer for me.</li>
            <li>I truly believe they have changed how I look for the better.</li>
            <li>Not so opaque like most blushes.</li>
            <li>i love the product, just not the color i chose.</li>
            <li>I keep make sure to keep one at home and in my purse</li>
            <li>Tickled Peach is a lovely color.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t toss my powder blush, but I&#x27;m also glad I got this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like the gel form because I have always used powder blush</li>
            <li>I suggest you take my word for it and try it yourself! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>am in love with Tarte Cheek Stain.</li>
            <li>I love to apply it with a sponge or MAC fondation brush.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t let your boyfriend mistake it for his deodorant.  : ) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;</li>
            <li>I love the \\&quot;Flush\\&quot; color.</li>
            <li>I finally decided on Tickled and the flushed peachy-red is perfect for my golden-when-I&#x27;m-tanned, sallow-yellow-when-I&#x27;m-not skin.  </li>
            <li>And I love the gel formula.  </li>
            <li>I just bought the Tickled cheek stain and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I use this under my moisturizer/sunscreen and I like the effect much better than a powder blush.  </li>
            <li>It comes in several shades and there is definately one that is the best for each skin type, so I reccomend going somewhere like Sephora to test out the colors.  </li>
            <li>but I feel like this looks better on, and is easier to apply.  </li>
            <li>and I like it a lot better.</li>
            <li>But the Tarte cheekstain was unbelievably easy to use, no experience necessary, and it looks incredible!  </li>
            <li>I can wear warm tones or cool tones just depending on what I&#x27;m wearing on the rest of my face and what clothing I am wearing.</li>
            <li>It looks just like my 4 year old&#x27;s naturally beautiful rosy cheeks---</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so bummed because I LOVED the look so much!</li>
            <li>I have medium skin, and I purchased flush, and it is a really good first color.</li>
            <li>They glide on more easily and blend more easily.  </li>
            <li>Blushing bride i think is a safe color for most light to medium skin tones.</li>
            <li>I am very fair and have very dry skin, she&#x27;s olive-skinned and has very oily skin, and the Cloud 9 looks great on both of us.  </li>
            <li>I was a huge junkie and still am in many ways.</li>
            <li>It is great for us dark haired, fair skinned ladies.  </li>
            <li>Yet, more importantly, I have used it on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The application is so easy.</li>
            <li>so they are easy to put on cheeks or lips.</li>
            <li>Strong fruit scent.</li>
            <li>I have a very fair complexion .. which is a nice way of saying that I&#x27;m PALE.</li>
            <li>I have high cheekbones, however they are not even so it takes some time to get powder blush to look good.  </li>
            <li>messy,(it comes in a push up stick that tends to leak a bit on the sides)Other than than im very satisfied with product, ive never broken out from using it.</li>
            <li>I look so much younger, get compliments on my skin all the time now and feel beautiful again.     </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t entirely sure what to expect from this product, but have thus far been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smooth texture made it extremely easy to apply and blend on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Could be a bit light for darker skin tones.</li>
            <li>Is equally as light as Dollface</li>
            <li>More like tropical fresh.</li>
            <li>This has a light coconutty scent - beachy.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m caucasian with light olive skin and dark-brown hair.)  </li>
            <li>it goes on smoothly and blends well</li>
            <li>So blush is an important product to me</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d see what the fuss was about, and oh my gosh--it really is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so natural and dewey and bright.  </li>
            <li>With my light skin, freckles and brown hair/hazel eyes</li>
            <li>As far as colors go, I own many colors.</li>
            <li>But you do really have to experiment with it in different ways to get a good application that looks good.</li>
            <li>Flush and Blushing Bride work the best with my pale skin.</li>
            <li>As a blush, this is superior to any other product I&#x27;ve used, but is not as effective on lips because of how quicky it fades.  </li>
            <li>It is pricey in my opinion for blush, but very worth it.  </li>
            <li>It is the most beautiful light pink/red flush; not overpowering or clowny on my pale skin.  </li>
            <li>It dries to a slightly shiny finish that I didn&#x27;t find objectionable, but might not be the best for more oily skin types, or someone desiring an absolute matte finish.</li>
            <li>Definitely, definitely, worth the money!</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic, like sweet plums.   </li>
            <li>(I tried the Flush one first, and I&#x27;ve bought three others now) and I love it.  </li>
            <li>(unlike liquid stain which dries fast), looks completely natural, it&#x27;s very blendable, the tube lasts a looong time, and the best part, it stays put all day, no matter what the weather.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and urge anyone to try it!!:)</li>
            <li>a healthy, hot glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also been a tasty pucker for my lips and dipped on eyelids for sheerness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have pale skin and have had wonderful results with \\&quot;tickled\\&quot; which is kinda red, kinda peach-y and just gorgeous.</li>
            <li>but skin is best left natural and dewy youthful.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and VERY natural color!  </li>
            <li>If you are like me and are looking for a nice pretty natural color that most people will not realize is makeup, this product is for you.  </li>
            <li>first you must learn how to use it to get best results, so play around with it a little to get a feel for it...</li>
            <li>I own every color Tarte cheekstain other than Bronze Goddess and Sunkissed, and every single on looks wonderful on me!   </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>and I think it would better suit fair skin tones as it doesn&#x27;t show up as much as the colors I am listing next.</li>
            <li>On the cool toned side.    </li>
            <li>so I am able to blend it very well.  </li>
            <li>but, the two colors I own, Flush and Doll Face, are both over a year old</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;d heard such good things about it, and I have, like, NO color on my cheeks at all unless I impart it myself.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Sweet Cheeks set of 4 mini cheek stains.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, to make a good purchase decision of these cheek stains, a customer would need to buy several colors.  </li>
            <li>At first it was a bit challenging to get the hang of it, but once you get past that point, you will have incredible results with skin that looks radiant and glowing.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use this one as much as I prefer the more cool tones because of my skin tone.    </li>
            <li>latest favorite colors are Cloud 9 (it looks so purple in the bottle, but it goes on so pretty and natural!)</li>
            <li>And it smells super yummy.  </li>
            <li>The first blend of its kind, the t5 super fruit complex(tm) is loaded with naturally occurring, antioxidant rich nutrients and vitamins that have been known to deliver refining,  anti-aging and skin-restorative benefits with each application.         </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even realize my skin looked &#x27;cakey&#x27; until I started my new make up technique and started getting compliments immediately on how much better my skin looks now.    </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Flush and Blushing Bride are beautiful colors, gel blush, VERY STICKY, and when you glide the stick over your skin the product sits in fine pores, amplifying the appearance of pores that would otherwise go unnoticed.  </li>
            <li>antioxidant rich super fruit helps fight free radicals, promotes cell regeneration, has known anti-inflammatory and skin softening properties and combats premature signs of aging       acerola: rich in vitamin C and antioxidants, which not only aid in brightening skin, but also help fight skin damaging free radicals       goji berry extract:</li>
            <li>I bought the Blushing Bride Tarte Cheek Stain last year and fell in love with it!  </li>
            <li>The smell, first of all, makes me want to eat it!  </li>
            <li>Very light color and extremely natural on my skin.</li>
            <li>Flushed - Bright Fushia Pink.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS COLOR for a natural glow.</li>
            <li>I love how they are so transparent and natural.</li>
            <li>So much more natural looking than powder blushes.</li>
            <li>I found that the \\&quot;flush\\&quot; color looks the most natural with my</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the $$$.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great - yes a little expensive but most good things are!  </li>
            <li>At first glance, this bold raspberry stain could look intimidating to a fair-skinned woman, like myself.</li>
            <li>No small feat too, since I live in a warm, humid climate.    </li>
            <li>Do not apply right from the tube, or it will stay sticky.</li>
            <li>It also requires some practice before you learn how to get it in just the right area.  </li>
            <li>the colors are not that great, and they are sooo sheer that you can barely see them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a product you don&#x27;t have to continually apply all day long.</li>
            <li>Long after my lipstick has worn off, I still have a nice wash of color from the cheek stain.  </li>
            <li>it comes on very intensely and you end up looking like a clown.</li>
            <li>I know that sounds totally over the top</li>
            <li>Putting smooth, soft and dewy deliciously-scented blush on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>would absolutely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>Well, not only do you get variety with so many colors to choose from at tarte</li>
            <li>;)    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really pretty look, once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the smell, which is exactly like a raspberry popsicle.  </li>
            <li>Still can look natural on me but in certain light I can see my cheeks look a bit neon fushia.          </li>
            <li>One word of advice: do not apply the product directly to your face, or you will have far too much of it to be able to blend.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I have darker skin, I went with the most intense shade and purchased Flush, which turned out to be a deep ruby color.</li>
            <li>And peony is really bright and the powder is hard to get just right</li>
            <li>and True Love (part of the Lovin&#x27; the Fast Stain set, and the prettiest pink!).</li>
            <li>My secret to beautiful youthful skin at any age?</li>
            <li>Makes me feel young and sweet.    </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t spend this much on cosmetics, but this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Customers won&#x27;t know this, and even if they do know it, they won&#x27;t know if their pores are too large to wear which color.  </li>
            <li>I think I have actually found my new favorite product.</li>
            <li>but I like the Blissful just a little bit better for my coloring (blonde hair, blue eyes, and fair</li>
            <li>much like if I were really blushing.</li>
            <li>I find that this color is a bit too much for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Very cool-toned.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Pictures can be very deceiving.</li>
            <li>The consistency is light so it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m actually wearing it.</li>
            <li>---I&#x27;d always end up putting too much on and then trying to dab it off with a tissue.      </li>
            <li>and I could not take a chance with my very acne prone face.  </li>
            <li>They are really sheer, blendable and have a light moisturized texture to them</li>
            <li>It smells really fruity.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>they are very greasy feeling as well.  </li>
            <li>Many customers would experience post-purchase regrets.  </li>
            <li>The reason I kinda use a lot is because over my makeup, it doesn&#x27;t show up as much.</li>
            <li>My skin is oily and I really need something that&#x27;s not going to make my face break out.  </li>
            <li>A little about me - I prefer higher end products for colored make up as I think pigments are better</li>
            <li>I used to wear powder blush when I was in high school, but quit because it took too much time.  </li>
            <li>The shade i bought is Tickled peach, which is in between light pink and light red.</li>
            <li>First of all, there&#x27;s something to be said about a natural glow.</li>
            <li>I used to wear a &#x27;full face&#x27; of makeup from my teen years on.</li>
            <li>For me, foundation and powder blush just made me look older</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend Tarte Cheek Stain.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of careful with the hygenic nature of what I use though and wouldn&#x27;t want to hold onto blush that actually touches my face for more than a few months.  </li>
            <li>Now the downside is 2 things: the price is high</li>
            <li>so say if after you apply it, you decide you want a little more blush and swipe some powder blush over it...</li>
            <li>If you like to use a little self tanner on your face you can also layer this on top to add another dimension of color.</li>
            <li>I had worried that this color might be too bright, but was pleased to find that the color was very sheer and could be layered for a more subtle or dramatic effect.</li>
            <li>Cloud 9 - Light lavender pink.</li>
            <li>These are SO worth the money because they last forever and they are foolproof!</li>
            <li>color stays true all day long.</li>
            <li>For those of you who don&#x27;t normally wear blush and would like to start this stuff is for you.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;A must have for those winter months in Connecticut when skin is more than likely dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>Based on a former review, I applied with a finger right on the apples of my cheeks.</li>
            <li>the color swatch online wasnt enough to inform me that the color is very light pink.</li>
            <li>Inc. New York, NY 10018.</li>
            <li>i was very excited to buy these, but very let down when it actually came.  </li>
            <li>It literally gave me a sun-kissed glow that looked very natural and lasted all day.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin and for over 7 years, I could not find any blush that I was not allergic to.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very natural look</li>
            <li>I use it on my cheeks and lips for a very natural look.  </li>
            <li>Like many other women, I was nervous about purchasing cosmetics online, especially when it costs $30.</li>
            <li>The gel form provides a nice subtle color that is natural and flattering.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I find that powder blushes make you look older (especially in the cool &amp; dry months)</li>
            <li>application is a breeze, very blendable, it does not dry too quickly like other stains.</li>
            <li>stick can get a little messy, but you can clean it easily with a makeup sponge.  </li>
            <li>Even if I&#x27;m not going to wear any makeup, I always dab a little on my cheeks, and it gives me just enough of a glow that looks totally natural and sexy.</li>
            <li>I was a sucker for all the products on the market just like so many women today.</li>
            <li>I now just use Burt&#x27;s Bees Pomegranate Naturally Ageless Day Creme and one of my Tarte Cheek Stain blushes.</li>
            <li>Incredibly natural color on me.</li>
            <li>So natural that even I am fooled.     </li>
            <li>The tarte t5 super fruit complex (tm) is a proprietary blend of the five most active superfruits: goji, acai, maracuja, acerola and pomegranate.</li>
            <li>parfum/fragrance (natural).</li>
            <li>It gave my lips a matte rosy color, as if it is naturally that way.</li>
            <li>The cheekstain also works very well on both of our skins, even though we have very different skin types.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying forever to recreate that \\&quot;just in from the cold\\&quot; natural flushed look with blush.  </li>
            <li>but I have been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I like my make-up to look natural.  </li>
            <li>never ends up looking natural.  </li>
            <li>If you want it darker, you can just layer in on, and it still looks natural.  </li>
            <li>This is the only blush I use now, and it works really well on my combination skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about makeup and this definitely meets all of my expectations.</li>
            <li>A nice thick moisturizing day cream with a bit of sheen to it (not too matte is key) and some of this Tarte Cheek Stain.</li>
            <li>I have it in Flush (a sheer red, very fresh) and Blushing Bride (sheer plum-red).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for months and wear it every day (and not a little dab either)</li>
            <li>nutrient dense berry often referred to as a &#x27;super fruit&#x27; due to its numerous nutritional benefits       maracuja: has been known to reduce redness, irritation &amp; inflammation of the skin       pomegranate: high concentration of antioxidants and vitamin C             skinvigorating(tm)</li>
            <li>It gives you an authentic, natural flush of color and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>This product blends/manipulates well and looks very natural, whether it is on bare skin or over foundation.</li>
            <li>The gel goes on clean, it stays \\&quot;workable\\&quot; for a little while</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;d like to try another shade (and will probably need to in fall/winter seasons), so it would be nice if they offered half the size at half the price.  </li>
            <li>The experience is just plain FUN!</li>
            <li>(If you are using powder I would HIGHLY recommend Guerlain Les Meteorites balls powder as they are the ONLY powder that doesn&#x27;t look cakey.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price, and will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li>color lasts MUCH longer than a powder or cream blush, though not quite as long as a liquid tint.</li>
            <li>The product can be sticky, but, I usually just lightly set it with a translucent powder.</li>
            <li>my friend has the regular sized stain, and these are about a sixth of the size of a normal tube.  </li>
            <li>but it dries quickly, and fades just a little</li>
            <li>Smells is hard to define - fruity but not as strong.</li>
            <li>I thought that they wouldnt blend easily or dry too fast.  </li>
            <li>Powder is cakey and heavy while this is so fresh and natural.</li>
            <li>It dried quickly and I just couldn&#x27;t blend it well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Tarte gel blush in Blushing Bride for the past few months and it always looks fresh and clean, unlike the \\&quot;Dynasty\\</li>
            <li>I swear to you, my face went from dull, drab and cakey with no glow or light to simply youthful, glowy and natural.     </li>
            <li>Bronze Goddess - Soft tan with hint of white shimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sheer and natural looking with a hint of raspberry scent.</li>
            <li>The result you will get from this gel is a sheer natural looking flush on skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it sticky at all...maybe a tiny bit tacky when you first put it on, but this doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>And you use so little of it that it&#x27;s worth the price, because it will last almost forever.</li>
            <li>I wear it on my cheek-bones and  down the bridge of my nose where natural sunlight would normally hit.  </li>
            <li>It feels a little tacky at first</li>
            <li>As for the price, it is more than the average blush, but this little tube will last forever, I only recently purchased my second one (Flush color) after using my last tube all the way to the bottom.</li>
            <li>The color is a natural flush and it is long lasting!</li>
            <li>It is a little drying on the lips, but it lasts much longer than any regular lipstick.  </li>

            <li> There&#x27;s a reason it has the reputation as the \\&quot;best blush ever\\&quot;!</li>

            <li> EVERY time I use one I feel like it&#x27;s the most delicious and luxurious thing to be doing.</li>
            <li> It blends wonderfully, and you have much better control than with powder blush.  </li>
            <li> So, the quality is amazing and the colors are just beautiful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning to purchase another color soon, it&#x27;s just that good.</li>
            <li> lot of people have compared this to Benetint which is also a good product</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good gel blush since Beauticontrol stopped making their version of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Looks like the perfect rosy cheek - very pretty color for the summer.  </li>
            <li> Would probably be great for someone with a bit darker skin tone than myself (which most people are).</li>
            <li> This gel looks incredibly natural--like you&#x27;re lightly flushed.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wonderful reputation and is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I just think it is so much easier and quicker to apply the perfect color blush with a good powder brush.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this one!  </li>
            <li> &quot; I love it!</li>
            <li> Regardless, I love it!</li>
            <li> They smell amazing, are easy to blend, and come in great colors.</li>
            <li> i have been wanting this product for a while and just received it yesterday, it is amazing...</li>
            <li> Definately a warm tone on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely thrilled with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I really liked this too.  </li>
            <li> The raspberry scent is pleasant but not, thankfully, too strong.  </li>
            <li> It is not purple at all on my cheeks; just a beautiful light lavender-pink, and not too strong for fain skin.  </li>
            <li> It arrived and I tried it right away, and I am SOLD!!!  </li>
            <li> I own many of the Tarte Cheek Stain colors.</li>
            <li> this gives me a nice healthy glow of color.  </li>
            <li> It blends well (although you don&#x27;t have tons of work-time) and is the perfect shade for that natural flushed look I love.  </li>
            <li> I had seen it on a friend in a more peachy color and it looked nice, but I opted for the more pinky color \\&quot;Flush.\\</li>
            <li> &quot; look of most powder blushes</li>
            <li> I imagine it would work well on a variety of skin tones since there are so many gel colors</li>
            <li> despite my better judgement, and because I&#x27;ve heard so many rave reviews, I bought Tickled, a peachy/red color.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m sure there are more sanitary ways to do it</li>
            <li> Tarte Cheek Stain is my favorite product of ALL TIME.</li>
            <li> This is after many years of trying and wasting money on drug store brands.    </li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite colors.</li>
            <li> Tends to show a bit more peach.</li>
            <li> Really love this color.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite bronzer for me.</li>
            <li> I truly believe they have changed how I look for the better.</li>
            <li> Not so opaque like most blushes.</li>
            <li> i love the product, just not the color i chose.</li>
            <li> I keep make sure to keep one at home and in my purse</li>
            <li> Tickled Peach is a lovely color.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t toss my powder blush, but I&#x27;m also glad I got this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like the gel form because I have always used powder blush</li>
            <li> I suggest you take my word for it and try it yourself! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> am in love with Tarte Cheek Stain.</li>
            <li> I love to apply it with a sponge or MAC fondation brush.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t let your boyfriend mistake it for his deodorant.  : ) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;</li>
            <li> I love the \\&quot;Flush\\&quot; color.</li>
            <li> I finally decided on Tickled and the flushed peachy-red is perfect for my golden-when-I&#x27;m-tanned, sallow-yellow-when-I&#x27;m-not skin.  </li>
            <li> And I love the gel formula.  </li>
            <li> I just bought the Tickled cheek stain and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I use this under my moisturizer/sunscreen and I like the effect much better than a powder blush.  </li>
            <li> It comes in several shades and there is definately one that is the best for each skin type, so I reccomend going somewhere like Sephora to test out the colors.  </li>
            <li> but I feel like this looks better on, and is easier to apply.  </li>
            <li> and I like it a lot better.</li>
            <li> But the Tarte cheekstain was unbelievably easy to use, no experience necessary, and it looks incredible!  </li>
            <li> I can wear warm tones or cool tones just depending on what I&#x27;m wearing on the rest of my face and what clothing I am wearing.</li>
            <li> It looks just like my 4 year old&#x27;s naturally beautiful rosy cheeks---</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so bummed because I LOVED the look so much!</li>
            <li> I have medium skin, and I purchased flush, and it is a really good first color.</li>
            <li> They glide on more easily and blend more easily.  </li>
            <li> Blushing bride i think is a safe color for most light to medium skin tones.</li>
            <li> I am very fair and have very dry skin, she&#x27;s olive-skinned and has very oily skin, and the Cloud 9 looks great on both of us.  </li>
            <li> I was a huge junkie and still am in many ways.</li>
            <li> It is great for us dark haired, fair skinned ladies.  </li>
            <li> Yet, more importantly, I have used it on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The application is so easy.</li>
            <li> so they are easy to put on cheeks or lips.</li>
            <li> Strong fruit scent.</li>
            <li> I have a very fair complexion .. which is a nice way of saying that I&#x27;m PALE.</li>
            <li> I have high cheekbones, however they are not even so it takes some time to get powder blush to look good.  </li>
            <li> messy,(it comes in a push up stick that tends to leak a bit on the sides)Other than than im very satisfied with product, ive never broken out from using it.</li>
            <li> I look so much younger, get compliments on my skin all the time now and feel beautiful again.     </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t entirely sure what to expect from this product, but have thus far been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smooth texture made it extremely easy to apply and blend on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Could be a bit light for darker skin tones.</li>
            <li> Is equally as light as Dollface</li>
            <li> More like tropical fresh.</li>
            <li> This has a light coconutty scent - beachy.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m caucasian with light olive skin and dark-brown hair.)  </li>
            <li> it goes on smoothly and blends well</li>
            <li> So blush is an important product to me</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d see what the fuss was about, and oh my gosh--it really is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so natural and dewey and bright.  </li>
            <li> With my light skin, freckles and brown hair/hazel eyes</li>
            <li> As far as colors go, I own many colors.</li>
            <li> But you do really have to experiment with it in different ways to get a good application that looks good.</li>
            <li> Flush and Blushing Bride work the best with my pale skin.</li>
            <li> As a blush, this is superior to any other product I&#x27;ve used, but is not as effective on lips because of how quicky it fades.  </li>
            <li> It is pricey in my opinion for blush, but very worth it.  </li>
            <li> It is the most beautiful light pink/red flush; not overpowering or clowny on my pale skin.  </li>
            <li> It dries to a slightly shiny finish that I didn&#x27;t find objectionable, but might not be the best for more oily skin types, or someone desiring an absolute matte finish.</li>
            <li> Definitely, definitely, worth the money!</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic, like sweet plums.   </li>
            <li> (I tried the Flush one first, and I&#x27;ve bought three others now) and I love it.  </li>
            <li> (unlike liquid stain which dries fast), looks completely natural, it&#x27;s very blendable, the tube lasts a looong time, and the best part, it stays put all day, no matter what the weather.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and urge anyone to try it!!:)</li>
            <li> a healthy, hot glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also been a tasty pucker for my lips and dipped on eyelids for sheerness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have pale skin and have had wonderful results with \\&quot;tickled\\&quot; which is kinda red, kinda peach-y and just gorgeous.</li>
            <li> but skin is best left natural and dewy youthful.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and VERY natural color!  </li>
            <li> If you are like me and are looking for a nice pretty natural color that most people will not realize is makeup, this product is for you.  </li>
            <li> first you must learn how to use it to get best results, so play around with it a little to get a feel for it...</li>
            <li> I own every color Tarte cheekstain other than Bronze Goddess and Sunkissed, and every single on looks wonderful on me!   </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> and I think it would better suit fair skin tones as it doesn&#x27;t show up as much as the colors I am listing next.</li>
            <li> On the cool toned side.    </li>
            <li> so I am able to blend it very well.  </li>
            <li> but, the two colors I own, Flush and Doll Face, are both over a year old</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d heard such good things about it, and I have, like, NO color on my cheeks at all unless I impart it myself.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Sweet Cheeks set of 4 mini cheek stains.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, to make a good purchase decision of these cheek stains, a customer would need to buy several colors.  </li>
            <li> At first it was a bit challenging to get the hang of it, but once you get past that point, you will have incredible results with skin that looks radiant and glowing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this one as much as I prefer the more cool tones because of my skin tone.    </li>
            <li> latest favorite colors are Cloud 9 (it looks so purple in the bottle, but it goes on so pretty and natural!)</li>
            <li> And it smells super yummy.  </li>
            <li> The first blend of its kind, the t5 super fruit complex(tm) is loaded with naturally occurring, antioxidant rich nutrients and vitamins that have been known to deliver refining,  anti-aging and skin-restorative benefits with each application.         </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even realize my skin looked &#x27;cakey&#x27; until I started my new make up technique and started getting compliments immediately on how much better my skin looks now.    </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Flush and Blushing Bride are beautiful colors, gel blush, VERY STICKY, and when you glide the stick over your skin the product sits in fine pores, amplifying the appearance of pores that would otherwise go unnoticed.  </li>
            <li> antioxidant rich super fruit helps fight free radicals, promotes cell regeneration, has known anti-inflammatory and skin softening properties and combats premature signs of aging       acerola: rich in vitamin C and antioxidants, which not only aid in brightening skin, but also help fight skin damaging free radicals       goji berry extract:</li>
            <li> I bought the Blushing Bride Tarte Cheek Stain last year and fell in love with it!  </li>
            <li> The smell, first of all, makes me want to eat it!  </li>
            <li> Very light color and extremely natural on my skin.</li>
            <li> Flushed - Bright Fushia Pink.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS COLOR for a natural glow.</li>
            <li> I love how they are so transparent and natural.</li>
            <li> So much more natural looking than powder blushes.</li>
            <li> I found that the \\&quot;flush\\&quot; color looks the most natural with my</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great - yes a little expensive but most good things are!  </li>
            <li> At first glance, this bold raspberry stain could look intimidating to a fair-skinned woman, like myself.</li>
            <li> No small feat too, since I live in a warm, humid climate.    </li>
            <li> Do not apply right from the tube, or it will stay sticky.</li>
            <li> It also requires some practice before you learn how to get it in just the right area.  </li>
            <li> the colors are not that great, and they are sooo sheer that you can barely see them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a product you don&#x27;t have to continually apply all day long.</li>
            <li> Long after my lipstick has worn off, I still have a nice wash of color from the cheek stain.  </li>
            <li> it comes on very intensely and you end up looking like a clown.</li>
            <li> I know that sounds totally over the top</li>
            <li> Putting smooth, soft and dewy deliciously-scented blush on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> would absolutely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Well, not only do you get variety with so many colors to choose from at tarte</li>
            <li> ;)    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really pretty look, once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the smell, which is exactly like a raspberry popsicle.  </li>
            <li> Still can look natural on me but in certain light I can see my cheeks look a bit neon fushia.          </li>
            <li> One word of advice: do not apply the product directly to your face, or you will have far too much of it to be able to blend.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I have darker skin, I went with the most intense shade and purchased Flush, which turned out to be a deep ruby color.</li>
            <li> And peony is really bright and the powder is hard to get just right</li>
            <li> and True Love (part of the Lovin&#x27; the Fast Stain set, and the prettiest pink!).</li>
            <li> My secret to beautiful youthful skin at any age?</li>
            <li> Makes me feel young and sweet.    </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t spend this much on cosmetics, but this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Customers won&#x27;t know this, and even if they do know it, they won&#x27;t know if their pores are too large to wear which color.  </li>
            <li> I think I have actually found my new favorite product.</li>
            <li> but I like the Blissful just a little bit better for my coloring (blonde hair, blue eyes, and fair</li>
            <li> much like if I were really blushing.</li>
            <li> I find that this color is a bit too much for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Very cool-toned.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Pictures can be very deceiving.</li>
            <li> The consistency is light so it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m actually wearing it.</li>
            <li> ---I&#x27;d always end up putting too much on and then trying to dab it off with a tissue.      </li>
            <li> and I could not take a chance with my very acne prone face.  </li>
            <li> They are really sheer, blendable and have a light moisturized texture to them</li>
            <li> It smells really fruity.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> they are very greasy feeling as well.  </li>
            <li> Many customers would experience post-purchase regrets.  </li>
            <li> The reason I kinda use a lot is because over my makeup, it doesn&#x27;t show up as much.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily and I really need something that&#x27;s not going to make my face break out.  </li>
            <li> A little about me - I prefer higher end products for colored make up as I think pigments are better</li>
            <li> I used to wear powder blush when I was in high school, but quit because it took too much time.  </li>
            <li> The shade i bought is Tickled peach, which is in between light pink and light red.</li>
            <li> First of all, there&#x27;s something to be said about a natural glow.</li>
            <li> I used to wear a &#x27;full face&#x27; of makeup from my teen years on.</li>
            <li> For me, foundation and powder blush just made me look older</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend Tarte Cheek Stain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of careful with the hygenic nature of what I use though and wouldn&#x27;t want to hold onto blush that actually touches my face for more than a few months.  </li>
            <li> Now the downside is 2 things: the price is high</li>
            <li> so say if after you apply it, you decide you want a little more blush and swipe some powder blush over it...</li>
            <li> If you like to use a little self tanner on your face you can also layer this on top to add another dimension of color.</li>
            <li> I had worried that this color might be too bright, but was pleased to find that the color was very sheer and could be layered for a more subtle or dramatic effect.</li>
            <li> Cloud 9 - Light lavender pink.</li>
            <li> These are SO worth the money because they last forever and they are foolproof!</li>
            <li> color stays true all day long.</li>
            <li> For those of you who don&#x27;t normally wear blush and would like to start this stuff is for you.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;A must have for those winter months in Connecticut when skin is more than likely dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> Based on a former review, I applied with a finger right on the apples of my cheeks.</li>
            <li> the color swatch online wasnt enough to inform me that the color is very light pink.</li>
            <li> Inc. New York, NY 10018.</li>
            <li> i was very excited to buy these, but very let down when it actually came.  </li>
            <li> It literally gave me a sun-kissed glow that looked very natural and lasted all day.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin and for over 7 years, I could not find any blush that I was not allergic to.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very natural look</li>
            <li> I use it on my cheeks and lips for a very natural look.  </li>
            <li> Like many other women, I was nervous about purchasing cosmetics online, especially when it costs $30.</li>
            <li> The gel form provides a nice subtle color that is natural and flattering.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I find that powder blushes make you look older (especially in the cool &amp; dry months)</li>
            <li> application is a breeze, very blendable, it does not dry too quickly like other stains.</li>
            <li> stick can get a little messy, but you can clean it easily with a makeup sponge.  </li>
            <li> Even if I&#x27;m not going to wear any makeup, I always dab a little on my cheeks, and it gives me just enough of a glow that looks totally natural and sexy.</li>
            <li> I was a sucker for all the products on the market just like so many women today.</li>
            <li> I now just use Burt&#x27;s Bees Pomegranate Naturally Ageless Day Creme and one of my Tarte Cheek Stain blushes.</li>
            <li> Incredibly natural color on me.</li>
            <li> So natural that even I am fooled.     </li>
            <li> The tarte t5 super fruit complex (tm) is a proprietary blend of the five most active superfruits: goji, acai, maracuja, acerola and pomegranate.</li>
            <li> parfum/fragrance (natural).</li>
            <li> It gave my lips a matte rosy color, as if it is naturally that way.</li>
            <li> The cheekstain also works very well on both of our skins, even though we have very different skin types.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying forever to recreate that \\&quot;just in from the cold\\&quot; natural flushed look with blush.  </li>
            <li> but I have been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I like my make-up to look natural.  </li>
            <li> never ends up looking natural.  </li>
            <li> If you want it darker, you can just layer in on, and it still looks natural.  </li>
            <li> This is the only blush I use now, and it works really well on my combination skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about makeup and this definitely meets all of my expectations.</li>
            <li> A nice thick moisturizing day cream with a bit of sheen to it (not too matte is key) and some of this Tarte Cheek Stain.</li>
            <li> I have it in Flush (a sheer red, very fresh) and Blushing Bride (sheer plum-red).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for months and wear it every day (and not a little dab either)</li>
            <li> nutrient dense berry often referred to as a &#x27;super fruit&#x27; due to its numerous nutritional benefits       maracuja: has been known to reduce redness, irritation &amp; inflammation of the skin       pomegranate: high concentration of antioxidants and vitamin C             skinvigorating(tm)</li>
            <li> It gives you an authentic, natural flush of color and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This product blends/manipulates well and looks very natural, whether it is on bare skin or over foundation.</li>
            <li> The gel goes on clean, it stays \\&quot;workable\\&quot; for a little while</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;d like to try another shade (and will probably need to in fall/winter seasons), so it would be nice if they offered half the size at half the price.  </li>
            <li> The experience is just plain FUN!</li>
            <li> (If you are using powder I would HIGHLY recommend Guerlain Les Meteorites balls powder as they are the ONLY powder that doesn&#x27;t look cakey.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price, and will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> color lasts MUCH longer than a powder or cream blush, though not quite as long as a liquid tint.</li>
            <li> The product can be sticky, but, I usually just lightly set it with a translucent powder.</li>
            <li> my friend has the regular sized stain, and these are about a sixth of the size of a normal tube.  </li>
            <li> but it dries quickly, and fades just a little</li>
            <li> Smells is hard to define - fruity but not as strong.</li>
            <li> I thought that they wouldnt blend easily or dry too fast.  </li>
            <li> Powder is cakey and heavy while this is so fresh and natural.</li>
            <li> It dried quickly and I just couldn&#x27;t blend it well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tarte gel blush in Blushing Bride for the past few months and it always looks fresh and clean, unlike the \\&quot;Dynasty\\</li>
            <li> I swear to you, my face went from dull, drab and cakey with no glow or light to simply youthful, glowy and natural.     </li>
            <li> Bronze Goddess - Soft tan with hint of white shimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sheer and natural looking with a hint of raspberry scent.</li>
            <li> The result you will get from this gel is a sheer natural looking flush on skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it sticky at all...maybe a tiny bit tacky when you first put it on, but this doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> And you use so little of it that it&#x27;s worth the price, because it will last almost forever.</li>
            <li> I wear it on my cheek-bones and  down the bridge of my nose where natural sunlight would normally hit.  </li>
            <li> It feels a little tacky at first</li>
            <li> As for the price, it is more than the average blush, but this little tube will last forever, I only recently purchased my second one (Flush color) after using my last tube all the way to the bottom.</li>
            <li> The color is a natural flush and it is long lasting!</li>
            <li> It is a little drying on the lips, but it lasts much longer than any regular lipstick.  </li>
            <li> It is very natural looking, fairly subtle, blends well and stays put for a pretty long time.  </li>
            <li> so it takes a few tries to learn how much is right for your skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I use very little makeup and have always been skeptical about blushes; they never look good on me.  </li>
            <li> I have seen some of the other reviewers mention it&#x27;s a little sticky at first</li>
            <li> If used correctly, you have complete control of how dark it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li> and it actually lasts surprisingly long.  </li>
            <li> stuff stays on for HOURS and goes on very nicely, not setting too quickly</li>
            <li> i spent wayyyyy to much for wayyyyy to little.  </li>
            <li> I look sick, and this stuff makes me look healthy and natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long time ago since I kicked powder blushes to the curb once and for all.</li>
            <li> So long as Tarte continues to make this product, I swear to never use powder blush again.</li>
            <li> If you apply with a finger, it will dry.</li>
            <li> I was not enthused about spending so much on a single makeup product...</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and ordered the Tarte cheek-stain in flush.  </li>
            <li> It will feel a bit moist for a few minutes but it will dry down and sink into your skin and look so natural.</li>
            <li> (it does, after all, come in only one color), one of my longtime beauty staples, and wanted a little bit of variety.    </li>
            <li> because really---you use SO little that this jar will last forever.  </li>
            <li> The cheek will be stained, and with little tiny darker dots wherever you applied the stain over pores.  </li>
            <li> BUT, Nars has some shimmer in it that I never liked--- (If you&#x27;re going for \\&quot;natural beauty\\</li>
            <li> And I know people always say this about expensive products, but it really does last you forever.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive, but worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I wear minimal make-up, concealer, powder, mascara, and lip-gloss.  </li>
            <li> I found that DABBING with my fingers makes a world of a difference, start in the middle and work your way out in a circular \\&quot;dabbing\\&quot; motion, repeat for deeper color(rubbing can give uneven results if you dont blend well)For the stickiness feeling, it will pass</li>
            <li> and I just kept looking worse and &#x27;older.&#x27;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry immediately, but you do have to rub a little harder to blend it than I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and nothing compares to Tarte.</li>
            <li> I use one or the other every day.</li>
            <li> I think the firmness is due to the shimmer.</li>
            <li> , the flatter is endless.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and I have worn it everyday since it arrived a month ago.  </li>
            <li> MAC NW15 is too dark for me.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown/auburn hair with blue/grey eyes.</li>
            <li> usual, an expensive makeup product that is well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> (I also like Nars and a few other brands).</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t even used half the product yet.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t mess up the makeup you have on underneath</li>
            <li> I just put a little on my fingers and work it along my cheekbones.</li>
            <li> I swipe it across my lips for a little bit of added color.</li>
            <li> Just apply a little bit to a blendy-sponge and blend from the cheekbone outwards (towards the hairline).   </li>
            <li> i would say and the packaging is a little</li>
            <li> well i just bought this kit, and when it came i was sooo let down!  </li>
            <li> formulated without gluten                green packaging                </li>
            <li> I have been using this product almost everyday for probably close to four years now.  </li>
            <li> It gives me just a hint of color, without looking harsh.  </li>
            <li> I rub it in a lot on the apple of my cheeks, wait a few seconds and then use a round cosmetic sponge to blend.</li>
            <li> I think foundation is one of the worst possible things for skin unless you are trying to mask significant flaws on your face.</li>
            <li> You really cannot go wrong with this stuff!    </li>
            <li> Initially, I do remember it being a little difficult to get used to, but it is now the product I won&#x27;t leave home without putting on.  </li>
            <li> One caveat, do not blend too hard or you&#x27;ll have uneven areas.</li>
            <li> I had an instantly bad reaction when I heard people fawning over this product--this much money for blush??  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I had a few people tell me that my skin looked &#x27;cakey&#x27;!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not highly skilled at applying makeup, though, so that may have been the problem.  </li>
            <li> For my Ivory complexion I use a combo of Bronze {For the length of my cheekbone} and Flush {For the apples of my cheeks, down the thin of my neck, and between my cleavage for</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I own four of them.</li>
            <li> I always found them to be heavy and fake looking once on my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff lasts forever, so don&#x27;t let the price send cold water down your spine.  </li>
            <li> However, it is a bit thin and sticky for use on lips.</li>
            <li> and I turned to tarte cheek stain as I&#x27;d grown a bit bored of the color imparted by Benetint</li>
            <li> I sadly had to return this because it contains one ingredient that is comedeogenic</li>
            <li> I used to be skeptical about liquid/gel blushes.</li>
            <li> I was sooo wrong</li>
            <li> I just felt WRONG somehow.  </li>
            <li> That is somewhat inconvenient.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Tarte!    </li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this blush!</li>
            <li> The customer will have to buy it, try it, then they&#x27;ll be disappointed and have to return it.  </li>
            <li> I hate looking like I have a lot of makeup on and therefore never use foundation or anything powder-based because of the caking issues -it</li>
            <li> When I bought this I hated it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tarte gel blush in Blushing Bride for the past few months and it always looks fresh and clean, unlike the \\&quot;Dynasty\\&quot; look of most powder blushes I&#x27;ve used in the past.  It won&#x27;t mess up the makeup you have on underneath and it actually lasts surprisingly long.  I imagine it would work well on a variety of skin tones since there are so many gel colors and it works with your skin tone instead of covering it up.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The stick can get a little messy, but you can clean it easily with a makeup sponge.  Lives up to the promise!</li>
            <li> I was not enthused about spending so much on a single makeup product...despite my better judgement, and because I&#x27;ve heard so many rave reviews, I bought Tickled, a peachy/red color.  I have that skin where I&#x27;m yellowish when I&#x27;m not tanned, and Tickled is a perfect compliment.  It feels a little tacky at first but it fades as it blends.  The raspberry scent is pleasant but not, thankfully, too strong.  One word of advice: do not apply the product directly to your face, or you will have far too much of it to be able to blend.  I just touch a finger to it and then to my face and blend (I&#x27;m sure there are more sanitary ways to do it but I don&#x27;t like spending tons of time).  At this rate, it will probably last the rest of the decade.  Definitely, definitely, worth the money!</li>
            <li> Tarte Cheek Stain is my favorite product of ALL TIME. I know that sounds totally over the top but it&#x27;s true. I am 35 and used to use foundation, powder and powder blush and I just kept looking worse and &#x27;older.&#x27; I had a few people tell me that my skin looked &#x27;cakey&#x27;! GASP! I was horrified and decided to try something totally different. Tarte Cheek stain totally changed my face and how I apply make up! I look so much younger, get compliments on my skin all the time now and feel beautiful again.     First of all, there&#x27;s something to be said about a natural glow. I never used to believe it. I was a sucker for all the products on the market just like so many women today. I used to wear a &#x27;full face&#x27; of makeup from my teen years on. I still to this day don&#x27;t know why I did! I think foundation is one of the worst possible things for skin unless you are trying to mask significant flaws on your face. For me, foundation and powder blush just made me look older and my skin didn&#x27;t &#x27;glow&#x27; the way it should. I didn&#x27;t even realize my skin looked &#x27;cakey&#x27; until I started my new make up technique and started getting compliments immediately on how much better my skin looks now.    A little about me - I prefer higher end products for colored make up as I think pigments are better and they last longer. I prefer MAC for lipsticks, lipgloss, eyeshadows, eyeliners, etc. (I also like Nars and a few other brands). This is after many years of trying and wasting money on drug store brands.    My secret to beautiful youthful skin at any age? A nice thick moisturizing day cream with a bit of sheen to it (not too matte is key) and some of this Tarte Cheek Stain. I am telling you if you try it once you will be hooked. I now just use Burt&#x27;s Bees Pomegranate Naturally Ageless Day Creme and one of my Tarte Cheek Stain blushes. I swear to you, my face went from dull, drab and cakey with no glow or light to simply youthful, glowy and natural.     I was a huge junkie and still am in many ways. I loveto do up my eyes and lips but skin is best left natural and dewy youthful. Trust me!     EVERY time I use one I feel like it&#x27;s the most delicious and luxurious thing to be doing. Putting smooth, soft and dewy deliciously-scented blush on my cheeks. The experience is just plain FUN! You can&#x27;t go wrong with Tarte!    The application is so easy. Just put it on any which way. I tend to swirl it around the apples of my cheeks about 7 times and then blend with my fingers up my cheek bones. You can also dab it on instead of smoothing it on. You really cannot go wrong with this stuff!    The product is a bit moist and goes on with a moist feel. It will feel a bit moist for a few minutes but it will dry down and sink into your skin and look so natural. I prefer not to use powder over it to keep me looking even younger but at any point you can put powder over it. (If you are using powder I would HIGHLY recommend Guerlain Les Meteorites balls powder as they are the ONLY powder that doesn&#x27;t look cakey. It also lasts YEARS AND YEARS! Plus they look and smell like candy, too!)    As far as colors go, I own many colors. I am very fair. MAC NW15 is too dark for me. My skin is almost transparent I&#x27;ve been told. Think vampire white. ;) I have dark brown/auburn hair with blue/grey eyes. I can wear warm tones or cool tones just depending on what I&#x27;m wearing on the rest of my face and what clothing I am wearing. I own many of the Tarte Cheek Stain colors. I am a neutral in terms of skin tone.       My Tarte Cheek Stain Descriptions:    1. Dollface - Soft Cotton Candy Pink with white microshimmer. Smells like strawberries and cream. Beautiful color for fair skin. One of my favorites. I especially like the &#x27;white&#x27; sheen to it. It is not sparkly at all, just glowy. This is one of my all time favorite colors. Could be a bit light for darker skin tones. You literally will look a bit like a doll with this on. Makes me feel young and sweet.    2. Cloud 9 - Light lavender pink. Smells like grape juice. Very light color and extremely natural on my skin. Is equally as light as Dollface and I think it would better suit fair skin tones as it doesn&#x27;t show up as much as the colors I am listing next. Incredibly natural color on me. On the cool toned side.    3. Blushing Bride - Pinkish red with a peach undertone. Smells is hard to define - fruity but not as strong. I tend to wear this one a lot. Shows up on my face much like if I were really blushing. Tends to show a bit more peach. Really love this color. Shows warmer than Dollface or Cloud 9. No shimmer.    4. Tipsy - Peachy/Coraly with a hint of white shimmer. Strong fruit scent. Definately a warm tone on me. More like tropical fresh. Great for summer. Don&#x27;t use this one as much as I prefer the more cool tones because of my skin tone.    5. Bronze Goddess - Soft tan with hint of white shimmer. LOVE THIS COLOR for a natural glow. This is my all time favorite bronzer for me. I have tried them all, too! This has a light coconutty scent - beachy. So natural that even I am fooled.     6. Flushed - Bright Fushia Pink. Very bright pinky fushia. I find that this color is a bit too much for my skin tone. Smells a bit like rasberries. Would probably be great for someone with a bit darker skin tone than myself (which most people are). Very cool-toned. Still can look natural on me but in certain light I can see my cheeks look a bit neon fushia.          I would HIGHLY recommend Tarte Cheek Stain. I truly believe they have changed how I look for the better. I love how they are so transparent and natural. Not so opaque like most blushes. Give them a try.

            <li> I just bought the Tickled cheek stain today. It is the best beauty product I&#x27;ve ever used. It literally gave me a sun-kissed glow that looked very natural and lasted all day. Based on a former review, I applied with a finger right on the apples of my cheeks. Do not apply right from the tube, or it will stay sticky. If you apply with a finger, it will dry. And you use so little of it that it&#x27;s worth the price, because it will last almost forever. I also used it on my lips. It gave my lips a matte rosy color, as if it is naturally that way. Love it!</li>
            <li> i bought the color tipsy because of the name. the color swatch online wasnt enough to inform me that the color is very light pink. i love the product, just not the color i chose. will buy again. when you give reviews talk about the color. thanks</li>
            <li> I bought the Blushing Bride Tarte Cheek Stain last year and fell in love with it!  It is the most beautiful light pink/red flush; not overpowering or clowny on my pale skin.  It smells fantastic, like sweet plums.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A couple weeks ago, when Cloud 9 came out, I bought it.  I am in LOVE with this one!  It looks like it would be too purple in the package, but it actually gives me the prettiest \\&quot;post-workout\\&quot; type color.  It is not purple at all on my cheeks; just a beautiful light lavender-pink, and not too strong for fain skin.  Also, it smells SOO good, just like grape bubblegum!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This stuff stays on for HOURS and goes on very nicely, not setting too quickly so I am able to blend it very well.  I keep make sure to keep one at home and in my purse so I am never without one!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will be trying Dollface next, then Tipsy.  These are SO worth the money because they last forever and they are foolproof!</li>
            <li> I own every color Tarte cheekstain other than Bronze Goddess and Sunkissed, and every single on looks wonderful on me!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and for over 7 years, I could not find any blush that I was not allergic to.  I tried powders, cremes, gels, bronzers, and every one left me looking like someone had slapped me - my cheeks would wind up red and puffy.  Finally, in desperation, I figured I would try one last time and try Tarte&#x27;s cheekstain, and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  It doesn&#x27;t bother my skin in the slightest!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My latest favorite colors are Cloud 9 (it looks so purple in the bottle, but it goes on so pretty and natural!) and True Love (part of the Lovin&#x27; the Fast Stain set, and the prettiest pink!). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also recently got my mother-in-law hooked on Tarte cheeekstains.  I am very fair and have very dry skin, she&#x27;s olive-skinned and has very oily skin, and the Cloud 9 looks great on both of us.  The cheekstain also works very well on both of our skins, even though we have very different skin types.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I use very little makeup and have always been skeptical about blushes; they never look good on me.  I&#x27;m also not highly skilled at applying makeup, though, so that may have been the problem.  But the Tarte cheekstain was unbelievably easy to use, no experience necessary, and it looks incredible!  It&#x27;s a very natural look (I tried the Flush one first, and I&#x27;ve bought three others now) and I love it.  Definitely worth the price, and will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product almost everyday for probably close to four years now.  Initially, I do remember it being a little difficult to get used to, but it is now the product I won&#x27;t leave home without putting on.  It lasts all day, through work, through going to the gym - everything.  It&#x27;s nice to have a product you don&#x27;t have to continually apply all day long. I have seen some of the other reviewers mention it&#x27;s a little sticky at first and I&#x27;ll agree but it dries quickly, and fades just a little so it takes a few tries to learn how much is right for your skin tone.  As for the price, it is more than the average blush, but this little tube will last forever, I only recently purchased my second one (Flush color) after using my last tube all the way to the bottom. This is one product I will continue to use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long time ago since I kicked powder blushes to the curb once and for all. I became a devotee of liquid stain and I turned to tarte cheek stain as I&#x27;d grown a bit bored of the color imparted by Benetint (it does, after all, come in only one color), one of my longtime beauty staples, and wanted a little bit of variety.    Well, not only do you get variety with so many colors to choose from at tarte, I got wonderful quality as well. The gel goes on clean, it stays \\&quot;workable\\&quot; for a little while (unlike liquid stain which dries fast), looks completely natural, it&#x27;s very blendable, the tube lasts a looong time, and the best part, it stays put all day, no matter what the weather. No small feat too, since I live in a warm, humid climate.    So, the quality is amazing and the colors are just beautiful. I have pale skin and have had wonderful results with \\&quot;tickled\\&quot; which is kinda red, kinda peach-y and just gorgeous. I&#x27;m planning to purchase another color soon, it&#x27;s just that good. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely thrilled with my purchase. I took a gamble and won. Like many other women, I was nervous about purchasing cosmetics online, especially when it costs $30. Pictures can be very deceiving. I purchased this in \\&quot;Flush\\&quot;. At first glance, this bold raspberry stain could look intimidating to a fair-skinned woman, like myself. However, it does not apply this way. It&#x27;s very sheer and natural looking with a hint of raspberry scent. If used correctly, you have complete control of how dark it&#x27;s applied. So long as Tarte continues to make this product, I swear to never use powder blush again. Powder is cakey and heavy while this is so fresh and natural. The consistency is light so it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m actually wearing it. I normally don&#x27;t spend this much on cosmetics, but this is worth every penny. I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying forever to recreate that \\&quot;just in from the cold\\&quot; natural flushed look with blush.  I&#x27;ve gotten close with Nars&#x27; Orgasm powder blush, and Bobbi Brown&#x27;s peony powder blush.  BUT, Nars has some shimmer in it that I never liked--- (If you&#x27;re going for \\&quot;natural beauty\\&quot; you don&#x27;t want the shimmer to give your makeup away!)  And peony is really bright and the powder is hard to get just right---I&#x27;d always end up putting too much on and then trying to dab it off with a tissue.      WELL, Tarte&#x27;s \\&quot;flush\\&quot; is perfect.  It blends well (although you don&#x27;t have tons of work-time) and is the perfect shade for that natural flushed look I love.  It looks just like my 4 year old&#x27;s naturally beautiful rosy cheeks---the look I&#x27;m always trying to recreate at age 34 ;)    I wish it came in a smaller size though, because really---you use SO little that this jar will last forever.  I&#x27;m kind of careful with the hygenic nature of what I use though and wouldn&#x27;t want to hold onto blush that actually touches my face for more than a few months.  Other than that it&#x27;s perfect!    UPDATE:  I sadly had to return this because it contains one ingredient that is comedeogenic and I could not take a chance with my very acne prone face.  I&#x27;m so bummed because I LOVED the look so much!</li>
            <li> This gel looks incredibly natural--like you&#x27;re lightly flushed.  Tickled Peach is a lovely color.  (I&#x27;m caucasian with light olive skin and dark-brown hair.)  I just put a little on my fingers and work it along my cheekbones. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry immediately, but you do have to rub a little harder to blend it than I&#x27;d like.  It also requires some practice before you learn how to get it in just the right area.  I wouldn&#x27;t toss my powder blush, but I&#x27;m also glad I got this product.  It&#x27;s a really pretty look, once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I have purchase this Tarte cheek stain in two colors - Blissful and Tickled.  Both are very nice colors but I like the Blissful just a little bit better for my coloring (blonde hair, blue eyes, and fair skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like the gel form because I have always used powder blush but I have been pleasantly surprised.  The gel form provides a nice subtle color that is natural and flattering.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000N93A0U tarte cheek stain cheek color, Tickled 1 oz (28.4 g)]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001QB7JM4 Tarte Cheek Stain Blissful]]</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t entirely sure what to expect from this product, but have thus far been very pleased with it.  &lt;br /&gt;It is a solid gel formula in a push-up plastic tube. The first thing I noticed was the smell, which is exactly like a raspberry popsicle.  &lt;br /&gt;Since I have darker skin, I went with the most intense shade and purchased Flush, which turned out to be a deep ruby color. I had worried that this color might be too bright, but was pleased to find that the color was very sheer and could be layered for a more subtle or dramatic effect. &lt;br /&gt;The smooth texture made it extremely easy to apply and blend on my cheeks. However, it is a bit thin and sticky for use on lips. It dries to a slightly shiny finish that I didn&#x27;t find objectionable, but might not be the best for more oily skin types, or someone desiring an absolute matte finish. &lt;br /&gt;The color lasts MUCH longer than a powder or cream blush, though not quite as long as a liquid tint. As a blush, this is superior to any other product I&#x27;ve used, but is not as effective on lips because of how quicky it fades.  &lt;br /&gt;As usual, an expensive makeup product that is well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this blush! I have it in Flush (a sheer red, very fresh) and Blushing Bride (sheer plum-red). I am definitely planning on buying another one! They smell amazing, are easy to blend, and come in great colors. Plus, they last forever. Definitely, definitely buy this!</li>
            <li> i have been wanting this product for a while and just received it yesterday, it is amazing...it goes on smoothly and blends well</li>
            <li> I use this in TICKLED and I don&#x27;t think it can be beat when it comes to getting a natural-looking flush.  It is very natural looking, fairly subtle, blends well and stays put for a pretty long time.  However, it is a bit sticky...so say if after you apply it, you decide you want a little more blush and swipe some powder blush over it...it comes on very intensely and you end up looking like a clown.</li>
            <li> I used to be skeptical about liquid/gel blushes. I thought that they wouldnt blend easily or dry too fast.  I was sooo wrong the moment i came across Tarte Cheek Stains. The shade i bought is Tickled peach, which is in between light pink and light red. They are really sheer, blendable and have a light moisturized texture to them so they are easy to put on cheeks or lips. I have tried other brands and nothing compares to Tarte. I suggest you take my word for it and try it yourself! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> If you want a great flushed look.... this is the perfect cheek stain for it.  Thank God for Tarte Cheek stain.  I recommend Flush for those with fair skin, it looks perfect now all my sisters want it too.</li>
            <li> This was an impulse buy at Sephora&#x27;s and I am really really happy that I sprung for the product, despite the price. I had seen it on a friend in a more peachy color and it looked nice, but I opted for the more pinky color \\&quot;Flush.\\&quot; I love it! I think I have actually found my new favorite product. It smells really fruity. I never wear blush because I look too made up nomatter what I use, even bronzers don&#x27;t do the trick. This product blends/manipulates well and looks very natural, whether it is on bare skin or over foundation.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Yes... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am in love with Tarte Cheek Stain. Believe it or not, I own four of them. Flush and Blushing Bride work the best with my pale skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is a girl&#x27;s best friend. Goes on smooth and lasts the whole day. I love to apply it with a sponge or MAC fondation brush. And it smells super yummy.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t let your boyfriend mistake it for his deodorant.  : ) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Perfect product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-- Thalia.</li>
            <li> I have the cheek stain in Blushing Bride and the color is just beautiful!!  The color is a natural flush and it is long lasting! I like putting it under my brow,my lips, the apples of my cheeks, my chin, the bridge of my nose, and even a bit on my forehead!! This product is versatile and great.  I too have oily skin and don&#x27;t have any problems with this product. I highly recommend this product and urge anyone to try it!!:)</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this cheek stain over a year ago by an MA at my local Sephora. I love the \\&quot;Flush\\&quot; color. It is great for us dark haired, fair skinned ladies.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The application is a breeze, very blendable, it does not dry too quickly like other stains. One caveat, do not blend too hard or you&#x27;ll have uneven areas. The product can be sticky, but, I usually just lightly set it with a translucent powder. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The color stays true all day long. It doesn&#x27;t oxidize and get darker like powder blush and it doesn&#x27;t slide off your face either, even in the summer.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After I apply it to my cheeks I swipe it across my lips for a little bit of added color. Long after my lipstick has worn off, I still have a nice wash of color from the cheek stain.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The price may seem steep but, the two colors I own, Flush and Doll Face, are both over a year old and I haven&#x27;t even used half the product yet. I use one or the other every day. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I had an instantly bad reaction when I heard people fawning over this product--this much money for blush??  I just felt WRONG somehow.  But I&#x27;d heard such good things about it, and I have, like, NO color on my cheeks at all unless I impart it myself.  So blush is an important product to me so I thought I&#x27;d see what the fuss was about, and oh my gosh--it really is a fabulous product.  The smell, first of all, makes me want to eat it!  And the colors are just delicious.  I finally decided on Tickled and the flushed peachy-red is perfect for my golden-when-I&#x27;m-tanned, sallow-yellow-when-I&#x27;m-not skin.  And I love the gel formula.  It gives a not quite shiny, but just glow-y look to your skin.  And it gives you enough time to work with it, doesn&#x27;t set practically immediately like liquid blush does.  And I know people always say this about expensive products, but it really does last you forever.  I&#x27;ve had it for months and wear it every day (and not a little dab either) and I haven&#x27;t even had to push-up the product yet.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I just bought the Tickled cheek stain and LOVE it.  It&#x27;s so natural and dewey and bright.  It is expensive, but worth the price.  So much more natural looking than powder blushes. Although I&#x27;d like to try another shade (and will probably need to in fall/winter seasons), so it would be nice if they offered half the size at half the price.  Regardless, I love it!</li>
            <li> I have a very fair complexion .. which is a nice way of saying that I&#x27;m PALE. If I don&#x27;t wear blush I look sick, and this stuff makes me look healthy and natural. No one can even tell I&#x27;m wearing makeup. I&#x27;m never going back to powder</li>
            <li> I have not worn blush for years.  I used to wear powder blush when I was in high school, but quit because it took too much time.  I have high cheekbones, however they are not even so it takes some time to get powder blush to look good.  I wear minimal make-up, concealer, powder, mascara, and lip-gloss.  I like my make-up to look natural.  I finally broke down and ordered the Tarte cheek-stain in flush.  It arrived and I tried it right away, and I am SOLD!!!  It blends wonderfully, and you have much better control than with powder blush.  A little bit goes a long way, and I have worn it everyday since it arrived a month ago.  It gives me just a hint of color, without looking harsh.  I wear it on my cheek-bones and  down the bridge of my nose where natural sunlight would normally hit.  It is great stuff.  For those of you who don&#x27;t normally wear blush and would like to start this stuff is for you.  I am going to order the sun-kissed for the summer months.  It is pricey in my opinion for blush, but very worth it.  Buy this product ASAP!!</li>
            <li> I use this under my moisturizer/sunscreen and I like the effect much better than a powder blush.  I find that powder blushes make you look older (especially in the cool &amp; dry months) but this instead has a youthful effect.  Just apply a little bit to a blendy-sponge and blend from the cheekbone outwards (towards the hairline).   It lasts all day.  If you accidently over-apply, immediately blend moisturizer or sunscreen over it to diminish the color.  Otherwise, wait 60 seconds before applying the moisturizer/sunscreen to let it set in.  In my experience, that&#x27;s the best method.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great - yes a little expensive but most good things are!  Very easy to apply and VERY natural color!  Looks like the perfect rosy cheek - very pretty color for the summer.  Looks like you got some sun.  I am very fair skinned with freckles so can&#x27;t do a lot of brozer type stuff, but this gives me a nice healthy glow of color.  I hate looking like I have a lot of makeup on and therefore never use foundation or anything powder-based because of the caking issues -it never ends up looking natural.  If you are like me and are looking for a nice pretty natural color that most people will not realize is makeup, this product is for you.  If you like to use a little self tanner on your face you can also layer this on top to add another dimension of color. It comes in several shades and there is definately one that is the best for each skin type, so I reccomend going somewhere like Sephora to test out the colors.  With my light skin, freckles and brown hair/hazel eyes I found that the \\&quot;flush\\&quot; color looks the most natural with my coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people have compared this to Benetint which is also a good product but I feel like this looks better on, and is easier to apply.  Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it!  There&#x27;s a reason it has the reputation as the \\&quot;best blush ever\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> well i just bought this kit, and when it came i was sooo let down!  my friend has the regular sized stain, and these are about a sixth of the size of a normal tube.  the colors are not that great, and they are sooo sheer that you can barely see them. i was very excited to buy these, but very let down when it actually came.  they are very greasy feeling as well.  people with oily skin like mine should not purchase this product.  i spent wayyyyy to much for wayyyyy to little.  stay away!</li>
            <li> I bought the Sweet Cheeks set of 4 mini cheek stains.  The colors were Flush, Blushing Bride, Tipsy, and Dollface. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Flush and Blushing Bride are beautiful colors, gel blush, VERY STICKY, and when you glide the stick over your skin the product sits in fine pores, amplifying the appearance of pores that would otherwise go unnoticed.  The cheek will be stained, and with little tiny darker dots wherever you applied the stain over pores.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tipsy and Dollface are lighter colors, cream blush, not as sticky, and they DO NOT increase the appearance of pores.  They glide on more easily and blend more easily.  These lighter cream shades are not truly creamy; there is a firmness to the stick.  I think the firmness is due to the shimmer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The stickiness will not persist all day; it decreases as the hours go by.  Each color is buildable.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I rated this with 3 stars b/c some of the shades are sticky and amplify pores.  Customers won&#x27;t know this, and even if they do know it, they won&#x27;t know if their pores are too large to wear which color.  The customer will have to buy it, try it, then they&#x27;ll be disappointed and have to return it.  It&#x27;s sort of hit &#x27;n&#x27; miss.  Many customers would experience post-purchase regrets.  Additionally, to make a good purchase decision of these cheek stains, a customer would need to buy several colors.  That is somewhat inconvenient.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product.  I use it on my cheeks and lips for a very natural look.  It is a little drying on the lips, but it lasts much longer than any regular lipstick.  I have several colors and rotate depending on what I&#x27;m wearing.  This stuff lasts forever, so don&#x27;t let the price send cold water down your spine.  It&#x27;s worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product on and off now for about 2 years. there are some downsides but there are some upsides too...first you must learn how to use it to get best results, so play around with it a little to get a feel for it... I found that DABBING with my fingers makes a world of a difference, start in the middle and work your way out in a circular \\&quot;dabbing\\&quot; motion, repeat for deeper color(rubbing can give uneven results if you dont blend well)For the stickiness feeling, it will pass but...if you cant wait for that, i dust on some face powder and problem solved without it affecting color. The result you will get from this gel is a sheer natural looking flush on skin. Blushing bride i think is a safe color for most light to medium skin tones. Now the downside is 2 things: the price is high i would say and the packaging is a little messy,(it comes in a push up stick that tends to leak a bit on the sides)Other than than im very satisfied with product, ive never broken out from using it. At first it was a bit challenging to get the hang of it, but once you get past that point, you will have incredible results with skin that looks radiant and glowing.</li>
            <li> When I bought this I hated it. It dried quickly and I just couldn&#x27;t blend it well. Granted I was using my fingers. I bought the color flush which I do like. It&#x27;s been a couple weeks and I like it a lot better. But you do really have to experiment with it in different ways to get a good application that looks good. I rub it in a lot on the apple of my cheeks, wait a few seconds and then use a round cosmetic sponge to blend. The reason I kinda use a lot is because over my makeup, it doesn&#x27;t show up as much. This is no miracle product but it smells good!! I just think it is so much easier and quicker to apply the perfect color blush with a good powder brush. Instead I&#x27;m standing at the mirror, layering and layering and blending away. So it&#x27;s taking me longer than I wish. But it is 28.00 and I will use it all.</li>
            <li> I really liked this too.  I have medium skin, and I purchased flush, and it is a really good first color. If you want it darker, you can just layer in on, and it still looks natural.  This is the only blush I use now, and it works really well on my combination skin. Even if I&#x27;m not going to wear any makeup, I always dab a little on my cheeks, and it gives me just enough of a glow that looks totally natural and sexy.</li>
            <li> I have used this blush at runway shows and for sets and commercials. Yet, more importantly, I have used it on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter the skin colour, the flatter is endless. For my Ivory complexion I use a combo of Bronze {For the length of my cheekbone} and Flush {For the apples of my cheeks, down the thin of my neck, and between my cleavage for a healthy, hot glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also been a tasty pucker for my lips and dipped on eyelids for sheerness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possibilities - endless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have for those winter months in Connecticut when skin is more than likely dry and flaky. A stain that compliments any complexion and at any age without leaving you without rent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tarte cheek stain, an essential. Five stars.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good gel blush since Beauticontrol stopped making their version of this stuff. I&#x27;ve tried powders and creams and just don&#x27;t like them...I always found them to be heavy and fake looking once on my face. My skin is oily and I really need something that&#x27;s not going to make my face break out.  I came across this product and after reading the reviews decided to give it a try.  I must say it lives up to it&#x27;s wonderful reputation and is worth every penny.  I don&#x27;t find it sticky at all...maybe a tiny bit tacky when you first put it on, but this doesn&#x27;t last long.  It gives you an authentic, natural flush of color and a little goes a long way.  I purchased the Blushing Bride and plan on purchasing Tickled Peach.  I&#x27;m very picky about makeup and this definitely meets all of my expectations.</li>
