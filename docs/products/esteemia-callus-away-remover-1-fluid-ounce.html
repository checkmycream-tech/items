    <ol>
            <li>One of the best product to remove callus on my feet!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m so impressed.</li>
            <li>it is actually very good ...</li>
            <li>this is some great stuff to use</li>
            <li>Great stuff gets the job done</li>
            <li>and if you use it as directed it works amazingly well and doesn&#x27;t harm your skin.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really is amazing, I plan on stock piling.</li>
            <li>Absolute wonderful results!  </li>
            <li>I bought this product and i was very happy to see that it really works.</li>
            <li>It works better if you soak your feet in warm water before applying.</li>
            <li>This is probably more effective in tandem with a pumice stone &amp; who knows what else...</li>
            <li>Might want to wear rubber gloves on your hands, as my finger pads were very very smooth after the treatment.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth my feet were afterward!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but you will be pleased with results.</li>
            <li>I garden all summer, and most of the time I&#x27;m barefoot.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with callused heels for many years, before finding this product</li>
            <li>Bio derm from heelaway.com is better choice.</li>
            <li>Plus it is cheap!</li>
            <li>The product work well, but I just wish these was more sizes available.  </li>
            <li>Easily removed all of my callouses.  </li>
            <li>NOT AS EASY TO USE AS LISTED.</li>
            <li>I use it whenever I notice my feet looking less than their best.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re leery, apply a light coat for a couple of minutes, scrub, rinse and evaluate.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Pretty strong stuff!</li>
            <li>Great for dry, neglected winter feet.</li>
            <li>More applications with less time will give you the desired results safely!  </li>
            <li>at the price its worth a shot</li>
            <li>Removing all the calloused tissue (or even most of it) at one time leaves feet sensitive to all of the stuff the callouses protected us from.  </li>
            <li>It was inexpensive though, so definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Be sure not to leave it on too long, as it IS quite strong.</li>
            <li>This works great for removing calluses, seems to be the same (or similar) to what they use in the salons.  </li>
            <li>but this does exactly as it says.</li>
            <li>I applied this medication exactly as directed, you can feel it working almost immediately</li>
            <li>So... the first time i used this stuff was about five years ago, and then it disappeared from the shelves.</li>
            <li>It did not remove all of the callus the first time though, so I am doing it again today.</li>
            <li>People have actually asked me how I keep my heels so soft, and I&#x27;m always happy to recommend the only product that works FAST!</li>
            <li>This product is hands down the best for removing dry crusted skin to make heels soft.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t recognize anything that stood out as strong enough to eat the flesh off the bottom of my feet...</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t require a whole lot of filing or sanding to get rid of the callouses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it requires a bit of elbow grease to really make a difference.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper then a pedicure.</li>
            <li>calluses do come back, I suppose that is natural, so better to buy 2 or 3 .</li>
            <li>Be careful not to get it on healthy skin because this product doesn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t know the difference between dead or healthy skin.</li>
            <li>In the past I&#x27;ve purchased this product from retail stores and this price is much better, the product was shipped promptly and arrived exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>and you will not be able to use it after a few minutes .....</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn my very sensitive skin, even when I get it on the soft sides of my foot.</li>
            <li>This product surprised me.  </li>
            <li>Callus Away is not a harsh product and works well for me.  </li>
            <li>it literally turns dry callouses into a gel which can be gently scrubbed away, leaving your feet baby soft!</li>
            <li>be careful not to drop some on your leg or top of your foot while applying, because it will leave a little burn mark that will hurt.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let what you&#x27;ve read in a few negative reviews keep you from having baby-smooth, gorgeous feet.  </li>
            <li>I live in extremely dry climate facilitating chaps on feet.</li>

            <li> I live in extremely dry climate facilitating chaps on feet.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of all the dead skin on your heals, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Well, long story short</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product because I saw it being used in my nail salon and really thought it would be good.</li>
            <li> It also took away the dry, gross cracked skin on the sides of my heel.</li>
            <li> My wife suggests to apply it on dry skin.</li>
            <li> , the only downside to it is that the bottle is too small for persons with big feet like mine!</li>
            <li> So, I put this stuff on and 3 min later I was filling the gel, callus, and all of the other dry skin off the feet!!!</li>
            <li> It removes the callus away as expected and I would recommend this</li>
            <li> other than that ...</li>
            <li> They also have other heel products&lt;</li>
            <li> The file is ridiculously small but the cream actually works.</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful not to get it on your nails or areas other than where you have callous or rough skin, but that is common sense.</li>
            <li> Instead, do it little by little - that way you&#x27;ll have time to adjust.</li>
            <li> Did not hurt or burn at all (not sure what happened with other people who said this).</li>
            <li> BUT the file will automatically become clogged with gooey dead skin</li>
            <li> softens the dead cells so you can slough them off with the file &amp; your skin</li>
            <li> Waste of money, NOT RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> Seriously, Jurassic Park had nothing on his doggies)</li>
            <li> what a joke&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely bad calluses all over my feet and softening dead, hard skin is a waste.</li>
            <li> (No Good, when your in boots all the time)</li>
            <li> The dirt seems to imbed itself in the dry cracks, and it&#x27;s embarrassing to have anyone see my ugly feet.  </li>
            <li> The reason i didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because,the additional item is very small and after using it couple times,it s impossible to use it after.</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> Softened up those nasty back feet calluses, and off they came with the file.</li>
            <li> if your heels are really bad it will take two applications to make it work ......</li>
            <li> If you still see thickened, ugly calluses, do it again and re-evaluate.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still changing  the bloody dressings.</li>
            <li> File supplied is worthless and solution</li>
            <li> Very ugly and very painful.</li>
            <li> Awful!!!  </li>

            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve purchased this product from retail stores and this price is much better, the product was shipped promptly and arrived exactly as promised.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy from this seller again.  As for the product, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 8 months and if you use it as directed it works amazingly well and doesn&#x27;t harm your skin.  You do have to be careful not to get it on your nails or areas other than where you have callous or rough skin, but that is common sense.</li>
            <li> One of the best product to remove callus on my feet!</li>
            <li> This did not work for me.  I was very disappointed with this product because I saw it being used in my nail salon and really thought it would be good.</li>
            <li> This worked like a charm!  Easily removed all of my callouses.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth my feet were afterward!</li>
            <li> Efficiently removes calluses on my and my wife&#x27;s feet. I live in extremely dry climate facilitating chaps on feet. This product really helps to heal or avoid the chaps by using it once in few months. My wife suggests to apply it on dry skin.</li>
            <li> This product is hands down the best for removing dry crusted skin to make heels soft. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Saw this in a hair place and got it....it is actually very good ...BUT the file will automatically become clogged with gooey dead skin and you will not be able to use it after a few minutes .....you need to buy another larger same grade file ........other than that ... It works .....if your heels are really bad it will take two applications to make it work ......at the price its worth a shot</li>
            <li> so much money wasted on over the counter creams, lotions, potions, heel tastic, etc. what a joke&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely bad calluses all over my feet and softening dead, hard skin is a waste. but this does exactly as it says. softens the dead cells so you can slough them off with the file &amp; your skin looks renewed .  calluses do come back, I suppose that is natural, so better to buy 2 or 3 . but you will be pleased with results. be careful not to drop some on your leg or top of your foot while applying, because it will leave a little burn mark that will hurt.  Pretty strong stuff!</li>
            <li> I applied this medication exactly as directed, you can feel it working almost immediately but when you wipe it off you find the skin below the callous is burnt away. Very ugly and very painful. I will not use this method ever again. It&#x27;s been two days and I&#x27;m still changing  the bloody dressings.</li>
            <li> The product work well, but I just wish these was more sizes available.  Be careful not to get it on healthy skin because this product doesn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t know the difference between dead or healthy skin.</li>
            <li> I garden all summer, and most of the time I&#x27;m barefoot.  The dirt seems to imbed itself in the dry cracks, and it&#x27;s embarrassing to have anyone see my ugly feet.  They even catch on fleece blankets and lingerie.  I found Callus Away two years ago after trying pumice stones, callus shavers, creams and metal rasps to no effect. It took care of the problem in two consecutive 3-minute treatments.  Don&#x27;t let what you&#x27;ve read in a few negative reviews keep you from having baby-smooth, gorgeous feet.  If you&#x27;re leery, apply a light coat for a couple of minutes, scrub, rinse and evaluate.  If you still see thickened, ugly calluses, do it again and re-evaluate. More applications with less time will give you the desired results safely!  I use it whenever I notice my feet looking less than their best. People have actually asked me how I keep my heels so soft, and I&#x27;m always happy to recommend the only product that works FAST!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. it literally turns dry callouses into a gel which can be gently scrubbed away, leaving your feet baby soft! I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough. Be sure not to leave it on too long, as it IS quite strong. It works better if you soak your feet in warm water before applying. Great for dry, neglected winter feet.</li>
            <li> This product is a must-have for in-home pedicures!  Absolute wonderful results!  I&#x27;ve struggled with callused heels for many years, before finding this product and I have to say, I&#x27;m so impressed.</li>
            <li> This product surprised me.  After reading the ingredients list (I&#x27;m not a chemist, mind you), I didn&#x27;t recognize anything that stood out as strong enough to eat the flesh off the bottom of my feet... but I was definitely mistaken.  This didn&#x27;t require a whole lot of filing or sanding to get rid of the callouses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will caution you, however, to not leave it on the entire suggested time.  Make it a marathon instead of a sprint.  Removing all the calloused tissue (or even most of it) at one time leaves feet sensitive to all of the stuff the callouses protected us from.  Instead, do it little by little - that way you&#x27;ll have time to adjust.</li>
            <li> So... the first time i used this stuff was about five years ago, and then it disappeared from the shelves. So now that I&#x27;ve found it again, it&#x27;s a miracle. i hope they are still using the same formula. Well, long story short i had a callus patch on the side of my foot, and it was creeping up to the baby toe. (No Good, when your in boots all the time) So, I put this stuff on and 3 min later I was filling the gel, callus, and all of the other dry skin off the feet!!! About three weeks later, I had a male friend of mine use it (Dino feet! Seriously, Jurassic Park had nothing on his doggies) he got years of corn, callus, and death off his feet. This stuff really is amazing, I plan on stock piling.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and i was very happy to see that it really works.The reason i didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because,the additional item is very small and after using it couple times,it s impossible to use it after.</li>
            <li> Callus Away is not a harsh product and works well for me.  It doesn&#x27;t burn my very sensitive skin, even when I get it on the soft sides of my foot.</li>
            <li> everything that this product says it is.... it is! It removes the callus away as expected and I would recommend this, the only downside to it is that the bottle is too small for persons with big feet like mine!</li>
            <li> Did not rub in well. Bio derm from heelaway.com is better choice. They also have other heel products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heelaway.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip this product please</li>
            <li> This works great for removing calluses, seems to be the same (or similar) to what they use in the salons.  Gets rid of all the dead skin on your heals, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> this is some great stuff to use</li>
            <li> The file is ridiculously small but the cream actually works. I wish it came in a bigger bottle with a bigger, washable file.</li>
            <li> it requires a bit of elbow grease to really make a difference. This is probably more effective in tandem with a pumice stone &amp; who knows what else...</li>
            <li> This product definitely took away some of the callus on my feet. It also took away the dry, gross cracked skin on the sides of my heel. It seemed to moisture that area as well as removing the callus. It did not remove all of the callus the first time though, so I am doing it again today. It was inexpensive though, so definitely worth the buy. Much cheaper then a pedicure.</li>
            <li> TRIED THIS PRODUCT THREE TIMES AND IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE WORKING.  I  WILL NOT REPURCHASE  THIS ITEM. NOT AS EASY TO USE AS LISTED.</li>
            <li> Great stuff gets the job done</li>
            <li> I thought this would not work and I would be returning it. WRONG. Softened up those nasty back feet calluses, and off they came with the file. Did not hurt or burn at all (not sure what happened with other people who said this). Might want to wear rubber gloves on your hands, as my finger pads were very very smooth after the treatment. Plus it is cheap! Go for it.</li>
            <li> Awful!!!  File supplied is worthless and solution just makes your feet feel slippery but does remove callus.  Waste of money, NOT RECOMMENDED.</li>
