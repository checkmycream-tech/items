            <li>I love this back and body loofah scrubber!</li>
            <li>I love my Exfoliating Loofah for Back and Body.  </li>

            <li>I love this back scrubber!</li>

            <li>He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I has handles on each end and is very well made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the loofah back and body scrubber for about a week and its been fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.!</li>
            <li>as described, thanks.</li>
            <li>Just Eh..I expected so much more based upon the reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made very well.  </li>
            <li>I love how it has the two different sides -- a soft side and a scrubber side.  </li>
            <li>handles are long and easy to grab onto comfortably, without having to strain and try and twist your body just to clean and get rid of dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I loved the length and the handles - but they were useless since the product didn&#x27;t clean.</li>
            <li>With the nice long loofa scrubber I can reach every where and feels terrific!</li>
            <li>and it was great for those hard to reach area on my back.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I use this on my whole body and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>It simply moves across my back for a light coating of soap.</li>
            <li>Hard to reach places on the back are easy to clean and exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get enough of the awesomely satisfying back scrubbing and back scratching action!</li>
            <li>This exfoliated better then the others I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>/&gt;One side of the back scrubber is rough, which is great at exfoliating dead skin.</li>
            <li>Great product, fills the need for hard to reach spots!!!</li>
            <li>It is too stiff to easily create a lather.</li>
            <li>It is soft and can get sudsy.</li>
            <li>Epic.</li>
            <li>my photos, I&#x27;ve added both the scrubber side and the soft side to show the difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The scrubber was a bit stiff at first, but after a few uses it became more flexible.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of very durable material, which means that it will probably be around for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First it&#x27;s long enough!</li>
            <li>This loofah helps do that in ways no other loofah has.</li>
            <li>suds up with one in the shower - then after my shower I put lotion on the soft side of the strap so I can moisturize my back.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard to reach all of my back with just a traditional loofah, with this guy I am able to wash my back and body without a struggle.</li>
            <li>Honestly, for a full-grown man, such as myself, it can be nearly impossible to actually get the mid to upper part of your back clean.</li>
            <li>I was them on gentle &amp; hang to dry!!!</li>
            <li>Second two different textures, rougher and soft.</li>
            <li>Long story short, I was very pleasantly surprised!</li>

            <li> It is too stiff to easily create a lather.</li>
            <li> It is soft and can get sudsy.</li>
            <li> Epic.</li>
            <li> my photos, I&#x27;ve added both the scrubber side and the soft side to show the difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The scrubber was a bit stiff at first, but after a few uses it became more flexible.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of very durable material, which means that it will probably be around for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First it&#x27;s long enough!</li>
            <li> This loofah helps do that in ways no other loofah has.</li>
            <li> suds up with one in the shower - then after my shower I put lotion on the soft side of the strap so I can moisturize my back.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to reach all of my back with just a traditional loofah, with this guy I am able to wash my back and body without a struggle.</li>
            <li> Honestly, for a full-grown man, such as myself, it can be nearly impossible to actually get the mid to upper part of your back clean.</li>
            <li> I was them on gentle &amp; hang to dry!!!</li>
            <li> Second two different textures, rougher and soft.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I was very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> When I received it and opened the box, I looked at the scrubber and thought it looked cheap and would not work well because the loofah was so thin &amp; flat.</li>
            <li> makes it much easier to scrub difficult to reach areas on my back with as much pressure as i want.  </li>
            <li> Long handles, solid construction.  </li>
            <li> Because I am an older woman,  I have a hard time reaching around my back with a back bush.  </li>
            <li> The loofah side is rough but not too rough for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is to long for me.</li>
            <li> but it has only the rough, scrubber side, unlike this one which has both a scrubber side that will scrub off dead skin, as well as a SOFT side that you can polish your skin with after scrubbing.</li>
            <li> I think it is one of the nicest bath and body products in our house in a long time!  </li>
            <li> Arthritis keeps my range of motion limited.  </li>
            <li> A little too long or the handles need a smaller opening to navigate.</li>
            <li> This little scrubby-dubby delight turned my regular shower routine into a spa treatment!</li>
            <li> I have so much trouble reaching my back</li>
            <li> I even used it to scrub my legs and the rough skin on the bottoms of my feet/heels.</li>
            <li> First-off, I&#x27;ve never really been a loofah person.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I find in order to get the center section of loofah to hit my skin I have to hold it at a shorter length.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t help that I&#x27;m always hurting due to Fibromyalgia.</li>
            <li> No more stapling my loofah to the wall and rubbing my back on it like a grizzly bear on a pine tree.</li>
            <li> I recommend this fine product, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> some other loofah&#x27;s have felt to me in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still make use of it anyway, but seems a little overpriced.</li>
            <li> Is stiff without the rough surface which would at least give it an exfoliating feel.  </li>
            <li> think the soft side makes this much less likely to harden up and become difficult and uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It is too stiff to mold to the surface of a body.  </li>

            <li> I love that this product has a loofah side and a soft side.  It&#x27;s design and length makes it much easier to scrub difficult to reach areas on my back with as much pressure as i want.  I purchase this because I have a constant itchy back and hoped exfoliating would alleviate the problem.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this back and body loofah! Being 6&#x27;4 it&#x27;s hard to reach all of my back with just a traditional loofah, with this guy I am able to wash my back and body without a struggle. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Completely flawless!! I love my loofah back and body scrubber. I like the length of it. So I don&#x27;t have strain my arms trying to reach toward the back. It is soft and can get sudsy. I was very pleased with the delivery date of the items. I placed orders on June 24, 2015 and items were delivered on July 3, 2015.</li>
            <li> The loofah performs exactly as promised! Delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly and I was excited to give it a try. LOVE IT!!  The quality of the material was wonderful and it definitely exceeded my expectations. I like the easy of use and it was great for those hard to reach area on my back. It exfoliated wonderfully and left the skin feeling polish and rejuvenated. I would definitely recommend for yourself or for a gift. A+</li>
            <li> Is stiff without the rough surface which would at least give it an exfoliating feel.  It is too stiff to easily create a lather. It is too stiff to mold to the surface of a body.  Feels like I&#x27;m washing above the curves and crevices, but not in them.  I loved the length and the handles - but they were useless since the product didn&#x27;t clean.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband. He absolutely loves it. Very nice to handle &amp; does a wonderful job. He even uses it for a back massage!</li>
            <li> I love this thing. I finally feel like I don&#x27;t need to hide my loofah to keep my man card.</li>
            <li> I love this back and body loofah scrubber! I have so much trouble reaching my back and it doesn&#x27;t help that I&#x27;m always hurting due to Fibromyalgia. So I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this when it was offered to me for a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I like that there is the loofah side and a softer side. The loofah side is rough but not too rough for my sensitive skin. There is a pocket to squeeze your bath gel into and it makes a really good lather. I use this on my whole body and my skin is so soft. The rope grips are strong and enable a nice vigorous scrubbing and are also convenient for hanging the loofah to dry. This is the best back and body scrubber that I have used and I recommend it. Thank you for a great product Carolina Global Brands.</li>
            <li> The back and body scrubber is great!  I love it!  It is an excellent size and has just the right texture for effective scrubbing of your back.  I like the fact that it is easily hung in our shower and it will be used by both of us.  I think it is one of the nicest bath and body products in our house in a long time!  I look forward to a long use of this great loofah.  It was obtained at a reduced price in exchange for a fair review.  Review of such a high quality item is for sure an easy task.  Great job on product creation Carolina Global Brands.  I hope to own more of your products in the future.</li>
            <li> I love my Exfoliating Loofah for Back and Body.  I actually use it all over from my feet to my back.  I has handles on each end and is very well made. It has 2 sides, I use body wash on the scrubber side and flip it over to the smooth side that feels like a soft wash cloth.It does a great job.  I would recommend this product. Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount or free in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I recieved this loofah back scrubber for free to review and it is great! Works just perfectly in the shower and gets those hard to reach spots on your back. Would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the loofah back and body scrubber for about a week and its been fantastic.  Hard to reach places on the back are easy to clean and exfoliate.  The product was delivered on time and I would definitely recommend buying products from this company again.</li>
            <li> This loofah has a couple of features I like. First it&#x27;s long enough! Makes it easier to use. Second two different textures, rougher and soft. Also the quality seems to be excellent.</li>
            <li> Wonderful back scrubber.  Long handles, solid construction.  Highly recommend.!</li>
            <li> This little scrubby-dubby delight turned my regular shower routine into a spa treatment! My shower took 5 minutes longer! I couldn&#x27;t get enough of the awesomely satisfying back scrubbing and back scratching action!</li>
            <li> I love this back scrubber! It makes getting your back so easy! It&#x27;s made well and the straps are so easy to use to get my back and shoulders. Itâ€™s durable and well-made and is the perfect width which keeps it from rolling up like most of the other ones do.  I canâ€™t believe I used a scrubber on a stick before I found this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of loofah&#x27;s, but this one is by far my favorite. It&#x27;s designed to be for the back, but I didn&#x27;t stop there. It made all my skin feel smooth and polished without being to abrasive on my sensitive skin. This exfoliated better then the others I&#x27;ve used in the past. It held my body wash well, but also rinsed clean easily.</li>
            <li> I received this item free of charge in return for an honest review. My honest review is very positive. The loofah is easy to grab and hold and works well for scrubbing your back and shoulders. I even used it to scrub my legs and the rough skin on the bottoms of my feet/heels. It hangs easily on a hook in my glass shower and dries quickly. The structure of the item is strong and doesn&#x27;t feel like it would fall apart when pulling on it to wash, like some other loofah&#x27;s have felt to me in the past.</li>
            <li> This item makes it easy to clean your back, and allows you to clean parts of your back a normal loofah would never reach. I didn&#x27;t know I needed this product until a friend of mine started selling it, and allowed me to purcahse one with a coupone code.  Now with this loofah my back will stay cleaner than ever before.</li>
            <li> First-off, I&#x27;ve never really been a loofah person. But I had an opportunity to try this product at a reduced price so I thought, why not? Long story short, I was very pleasantly surprised! It is so easy and handy to hold it by it&#x27;s &amp;#34;handles&amp;#34; that scrubbing your back is something you might want to do all day. And it is very nice on the other scrubbable parts of your body also. This product is well made and easy to use so the rest is a no-brainer. If you decide to try it, have fun!</li>
            <li> Very effective, easy to use scrubber. Not too abrasive on the loofah side and comforting on the polishing side. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I received the Loofah Back and Body Scrubber at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.  Product arrived quickly and as advertised.  Company even shipped to my APO address with no problem.  The scrubber works perfectly and I was able to exfoliate and wash my back without an issue.  The scrubber was a bit stiff at first, but after a few uses it became more flexible.  Rinses and dries nicely.  Does a very nice job.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my brother who could not lift his arm to wash his back.  He thinks this is great for he can wash his back and it has stopped the itching.  Thank you for your prompt service.  I would gladly order from you agin.</li>
            <li> This product... I can&#x27;t even begin to describe how fantastic it is. As a self-proclaimed exercise nut, it&#x27;s very important to get extra clean in the shower. This loofah helps do that in ways no other loofah has.</li>
            <li> as described, thanks.</li>
            <li> Just Eh..I expected so much more based upon the reviews. I ended up buying a back brush for a good scrubbing experience. This is now second fiddle and will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 &amp; have purchased 4 more.&lt;br /&gt;I suds up with one in the shower - then after my shower I put lotion on the soft side of the strap so I can moisturize my back.  Works great. I was them on gentle &amp; hang to dry!!!</li>
            <li> Great shower with the loofah.  Arthritis keeps my range of motion limited.  With the nice long loofa scrubber I can reach every where and feels terrific!</li>
            <li> Good, well made product. Honestly, for a full-grown man, such as myself, it can be nearly impossible to actually get the mid to upper part of your back clean. This nice, discreet back and body scrubber does the trick. It&#x27;s made of very durable material, which means that it will probably be around for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One side of the back scrubber is rough, which is great at exfoliating dead skin. The other is soft, which worked well with my body soap (good sudsing action)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all I recommend this fine product, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> What can I say? This is the Cadillac of loofah stuff. No more stapling my loofah to the wall and rubbing my back on it like a grizzly bear on a pine tree. Life now has a demarcation point - before this loofah, and everything after it. Epic.</li>
            <li> Great product, fills the need for hard to reach spots!!! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic loofah!  I love how it has the two different sides -- a soft side and a scrubber side.  It&#x27;s made very well.  The length  and loop style handles make it very easy to wash your back.  My favorite part is the pocket to put your soap.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nothing special! Overpriced.</li>
            <li> Well made.. works great.. would purchase again</li>
            <li> This is a really nice spa-like experience for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a similar one but it has only the rough, scrubber side, unlike this one which has both a scrubber side that will scrub off dead skin, as well as a SOFT side that you can polish your skin with after scrubbing. It feels really nice to flip over to the soft, gentle washcloth-like side after using the loofah side on my back.&lt;br /&gt;The handles are long and easy to grab onto comfortably, without having to strain and try and twist your body just to clean and get rid of dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;I think the soft side makes this much less likely to harden up and become difficult and uncomfortable to use. After several uses, I find it pliable and maneuverable.&lt;br /&gt;In my photos, I&#x27;ve added both the scrubber side and the soft side to show the difference.&lt;br /&gt;I used some body wash on the soft side to help clean and polish my skin, and have to say it feels incredibly pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*product provided for my opinion and review</li>
            <li> It is nicely made, but a couple of flaws for me. It is to long for me. I am petite and have to grip above the hands, which I don&#x27;t mind, but I cannot get the pressure I need to actually scrub my back. It simply moves across my back for a light coating of soap. I like more of an exfoliating scrub that you can get with something firmer. Not what I expected it to be. But it is nicely made if you like a light wash.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time; love it.</li>
            <li> Seems to be good guality, soft but durable.</li>
            <li> I love it!  Great price!</li>
            <li> BEST ONE I EVER HAD  THANKS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my loofa back strap almost a week now and even though I&#x27;m still in the process of learning how to maneuver it,  I LOVE IT!!!!  Because I am an older woman,  I have a hard time reaching around my back with a back bush.  Most of the time I didn&#x27;t get my whole back scrubbed with the brush but this does the trick.  So far it rinses out and dries easily.  For the price, I recommend trying this one!  Your back will feel rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> Before I ordered this loofah back and body scrubber I checked all that were offer on Amazon and selected this one because of its reviews and value. When I received it and opened the box, I looked at the scrubber and thought it looked cheap and would not work well because the loofah was so thin &amp; flat. To my surprise the first time I used it, &amp;#34;poof&amp;#34;, the loofah expanded and it worked perfectly. I recommend this product to anyone that wants a good safe back scrubber!</li>
            <li> A little too long or the handles need a smaller opening to navigate. I find in order to get the center section of loofah to hit my skin I have to hold it at a shorter length. I&#x27;ll still make use of it anyway, but seems a little overpriced.</li>
