            <li>I wish there was more I could say about them,but all I can say is they are a good buy and works very good.</li>
            <li>When I got the opportunity to received this great product in Exchange for my Honest and Unbiased Opinion</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a good quality tweezer for those stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li>They feel good in the hand like a quality tool.</li>
            <li>Was a good buy.</li>
            <li>34;how good can tweezers truly get?&amp;#34</li>
            <li>The tweezers work really good</li>
            <li>I loved the tweezers.</li>
            <li>I brought these because there were ratings saying they are good to get ingrown hair...</li>
            <li>they do a good and still will do my eye brows.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied</li>
            <li>great quality, love these.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied and</li>
            <li>With Tweezty, I was able to do it with its pointy aligned tips!</li>
            <li>They also help prevent me from plucking more than one eyebrow hair at a time!</li>
            <li>I love these and you will too!</li>
            <li>I LOVE these!</li>
            <li>Got a $1 pair from target that works 1000x better!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these tweezers!</li>
            <li>This product is great to get the ingrown hairs exposed, but it does not have a strong grip to pull the hairs out.</li>
            <li>I was very excited about it!</li>
            <li>For a splinter or ingrown hair these are amazing.</li>
            <li>these are amazing thank you</li>
            <li>Might cut the tip off and grind my own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, precise, and perfectly functional.</li>
            <li>: If you are wondering, they meet perfect at the very end.</li>
            <li>Honestly, when I bought them I thought to myself &amp;#</li>
            <li>I like this because I can effectively operate the tweezers from a position farther from the tip.  </li>
            <li>Not the best ive had but really close.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done and looks/feels nice.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;above are my own findings...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning on keeping them in the first-aid kit in the trunk of my car, but I&#x27;m sure they would be great for grooming your eyebrows which seems to be what most people are using them for.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think I can ever use another pair of tweezers again.</li>
            <li>Fits nicely between my magnify glass and lube.</li>
            <li>AT A DISCOUNT PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li>, my review is honest and i would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>looks nice and pointy, but the one I got cannot hold a hair at the tip.</li>
            <li>however, my reviews remain 100% honest.</li>
            <li>Literally best tweezers ever, highly recommended</li>
            <li>I received these tweezers free for review, and......they are AMAZING!</li>
            <li>received the tweezers free but there is no obligation to leave a good review, this is my honest thinking.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold, good quality coating.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing to me how fine of a hair the tweezers can grasp!  </li>
            <li>These tweezers are very sturdy and look very appealing which is a great perk.</li>
            <li>They are so nice and top of the line.</li>
            <li>Will have to see how they hold up, but so far these are perfect!</li>
            <li>Grabs even the very fine hairs.</li>
            <li>It gets even the finest of hairs, easily!</li>
            <li>they do have a very fine point and seem to be sturdy</li>
            <li>I am just so much more used to using my old pair of tweezers, when I used these tweezers correctly they gripped the hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>The first thing he said about these was &amp;#34;they will be great for ingrown hairs!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Good item, fair price, decent quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tips are very precise which is probably a selling point for some people</li>
            <li>Very precise for plucking eyebrow hairs which is what I use them for.  </li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s a good product and worthy of 4-stars.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, high quality tweezers.</li>
            <li>:They make more of a weapon than a tweezer you can use.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the Tweezty.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I was able to get this product in exchanged for my review.</li>
            <li>I love these tweezers.  </li>
            <li>i am really love them....</li>
            <li>Love,</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice that the hair was being gripped more on the side than from the end of the tip.</li>
            <li>I ended up spending the extra and ordered the Tweezerman - and those worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>This gives me better visibility at the business end since my fingers aren&#x27;t blocking my view when I&#x27;m trying to grab that splinter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyone would love these.</li>
            <li>I have yet been able to use them and tweeze ANY hair...</li>
            <li>Im returning this for sure.</li>
            <li>It works for some hairs but 1 out of every 5 or so just won&#x27;t come out, just slips out no matter how many times you try.</li>
            <li>The tweezers that are thicker, i.e. wider, at the end seem to work better.</li>
            <li>, the are more of a point, I have never&lt;br /&gt;used</li>
            <li>I love them!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>DID love them :</li>
            <li>Am really &amp; truly happy that I&#x27;ve found these &amp; have found peace-of-mind {for now}.&lt;br /&gt;BTW</li>
            <li>love love love :)</li>
            <li>Wanted to love these</li>
            <li>I got these for free using a promo code (booya!)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t stab or pinch yourself while using these tweezers.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure the skinniness of the tweezers can put out the smallest splinters.</li>
            <li>so you are able to get a better grip.</li>
            <li>product could be better</li>
            <li>I would most definetly buy&lt;br /&gt;these tweezers, and recommend everyone have a pair in their home.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price on these and the quality is top notch.</li>
            <li>I am a senior and have had many tweezers in my life time.</li>
            <li>Well I contacted the company with questions like &amp;#34;how many times will I have to attempt to pull the hair, I have the tweezerman ones and I am not impressed.&amp;#34; there response &amp;#34;give it a try&amp;#34</li>
            <li>But ok for the price.</li>
            <li>I trust these tweezers to get all the tiniest hairs out of my face and anywhere else they need to be gotten from:)</li>
            <li>These are great and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a high quality and precise pair of tweezers!  </li>
            <li>The handle is very smooth and easy to grip.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t receive them in exchange for my honest review, I purchased them full price</li>
            <li>It does the job, but when they claimed it&#x27;s &amp;#34;The best tweezers ever&amp;#34;, I naturally expected something better...</li>
            <li>However, my favorite part of them is the rubber grip, allowing you to really get a good grip on them for whatever use you are using them for.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are ok but not on fine hairs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve NEVER used tweezers as amazing as these, they are totally worth every cent.</li>
            <li>The stainless steel gives them great durability, they are super strong most tweezers are easy to bend and break these held up to the test.</li>
            <li>Great for resizing wild eye brownies.</li>
            <li>I was able to get this product for free to review as part of a promotion.</li>
            <li>I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>These are extremely sharp but they work wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a week now and cannot say enough good things!</li>
            <li>They are easy to hold and easy to use for whatever you need to use them for.</li>
            <li>Easy to use with out fighting with seeing what you are doing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other inexpensive brands before and have always had to spend a fair amount of time doing a good job.</li>
            <li>Tip is fine and grips</li>
            <li>/&gt;The grip is secure,  they are easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>The fine points just didn&#x27;t grab them.</li>
            <li>Even though the tweezer is quite fine the hair slips from its grasp.</li>
            <li>Strong and precise.</li>
            <li>These have a fine point and are precisely aligned to help grab those stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li>But which these, it is very easy to pull the exact hairs that you need to.  </li>
            <li>They are nice and sharp, which is what you want out of tweezers and are still strong and of good make.</li>
            <li>a huge curled up hair.</li>
            <li>Extremely accurate with pin point grip.</li>
            <li>They are precise</li>
            <li>Received this item for free after a promotion code.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the tweezers come with a plastic cover to shield it.&lt;br /&gt;-Because</li>
            <li>: I did not receive this for free in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are incredibly precise.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic tweezers.</li>
            <li>great for pulling out hairs that are starting to regrow on eyebrows and chin or are ingrown like a splinter.</li>
            <li>Fantastic tweezers</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was offered this item for free in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li>They are perfect for those tiny hairs, and if you have kids like I do that seem to get splinters all the time, these tweezers work perfectly to get those tiny splinters and even the big ones out.  </li>
            <li>I love this and perfect for very small hairs to pull off from eyebrows.</li>
            <li>In addition, the points are very easily bent so they weren&#x27;t very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Item is very easy to you and perfect to have in a first aid kit for splinters or getting things in hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>I hope you enjoy them just as much as we will:)</li>
            <li>what a great price!!&lt;br /&gt;I received these a little or no cost to give my honest opinion and that is exactly what I did.</li>
            <li>Great grip, sharp, incredibly precise.</li>
            <li>They have a good hold and won&#x27;t let the hair slip out ,like most other tweezers do.</li>
            <li>Either that or there must be some special way to use them that I haven&#x27;t figured out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see how anyone is able to grab an ingrown hair or splinter with these.</li>
            <li>If you are needing a good tweezers look no further and buy these.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t think they would work very well since they were so skinny at the top</li>
            <li>The design is cool as well.</li>
            <li>These are the most intensely pointy tweezers I&#x27;ve ever seen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally---super huge sigh of relief---as I&#x27;ve been searching for a good pair of tweezers for a very long time now.</li>
            <li>sharp pointed tip of these tweezers are also great for removing splinters.</li>
            <li>Works great super sharp</li>
            <li>These are pretty great especially for ingrown hairs, they are like magnetic to pulling them right out with no problem.</li>
            <li>Did arrive quickly though.</li>
            <li>This one gets the job done super quickly.</li>
            <li>I am super Picky about my tweezers.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly and packed well ...</li>
            <li>My son and I were amazed at how quick and painless it was.</li>
            <li>I have been very satisfied with these and plan on buying extra pair for my travel bags.</li>
            <li>Great tweezers, very sharp</li>
            <li>black matte finish is great for grip.</li>
            <li>Gets the little hairs I couldn&#x27;t get before with slant tweezers, they work great for eyebrows.</li>
            <li>love how they get all the tiny hairs from my eyebrows that are hard to get and there perfect!!!</li>
            <li>These work great on those fine small hairs!</li>
            <li>But for how well they work and price, it was worth it.</li>
            <li>They might be useful for ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>I received complimentary product for review.</li>
            <li>The seem well worth the price.</li>
            <li>am keeping my old ones, but using these more often...</li>
            <li>Simply wanted to state an honest opinion to hopefully help someone out.</li>
            <li>I have an old pair of Tweezerman tweezers that are more than 10 years old that do a better job than these.  </li>
            <li>I tried with the tip, I tried with the side, I changed my angle, nothing nada, a clear as day exposed hair that I needed to pull I could not for the life of me get them to be able to grip it.</li>
            <li>Great tweezers for working in tight places!</li>
            <li>price&amp;#34;etc yet loved them, thus left a highly favorable review to let others know.</li>
            <li>They just slide right off at my uni-brow</li>
            <li>It just slips right through.</li>
            <li>They are so pointed that you can get right to</li>
            <li>/&gt;the edge of the splinter and pull it right out.</li>
            <li>First, the design of these make them look much nicer than those cheap silver ones.</li>
            <li>We use these tweezers in our sign shop for weeding small decal details and heat press materials for t-shirts and they are by far the best tools for that I have ever used!</li>
            <li>They have great precision at getting even the toughest little hair out!</li>
            <li>Very sharp and try not to take your whole eyebrow off LOL</li>
            <li>The tweezers work great on getting this really small hairs on your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The tips are very fine which makes them great for splinters or any other situations that require extreme precision.</li>
            <li>The eyebrow hairs I need to remove are very fine and blonde</li>
            <li>ordered a second pair, tip a little finer, very happy</li>
            <li>It certainly does what it says it does!</li>
            <li>We liked them so much we bought a second one for my wife&#x27;s son&#x27;s family.</li>
            <li>The surface is still completely  smooth so wiping with alcohol to clean after the splinter procedure was a breeze and left me confident that they would be clean and ready to go for the next injury!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It came with a rubber tip guard that I will try my hardest not to lose because these are very, very</li>
            <li>I just got these and right in time:) we live in a old farm house and all of our floors are made of wood.</li>
            <li>I received the Tweezty tweezers just last week, and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li>It may be ok for larger things like splinters.  </li>
            <li>really well getting the tiniest hair would recommend!</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazed by these tweezers!</li>
            <li>Very well made tweezers!</li>
            <li>some time :) They are the basic slanted tweezer.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through Tweezerman {ok} to Rubis {great while it remained sharp; too much hassle to re-sharpen} to Revlon and other drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>The part you hold is nice and wide</li>
            <li>These really do make a difference!  </li>
            <li>You definitely don&#x27;t want to be ramming your hands into these while they&#x27;re hiding in a drawer - I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll draw blood.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly what is going on with my hair and my tweezers.  </li>
            <li>My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.</li>
            <li>the tips are fine enough to pretty much grab anything!</li>
            <li>Wow these tweezers are sharp, I was not expecting such ideal sharpness with this product.  </li>
            <li>I have only used the tweezers for ingrown hairs, but it is easy to see that they could be used for a multitude of purposes.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how large they were though</li>
            <li>so you can tweeze the really tiny, fine hairs.</li>
            <li>Will need to practice using them and use a light touch since the steel is not as strong and springy instead of stiff</li>
            <li>They come with a nice little case.</li>
            <li>Great for precise piercing, but not great for plucking individual hairs.</li>
            <li>this is really works for my eyebrow,i like it</li>
            <li>I need something very precision, under magnification</li>
            <li>It really is a struggle to pluck any eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Despite my relationship with this pair of tweezers getting off to a rough start, they truly are magical at plucking those elusive stray eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like this tweezer.</li>
            <li>I really use it to shape my eyebrows....</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY  T H</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>These are really well make, let me tell you.</li>
            <li>Made of stainless steel - feels very chic and</li>
            <li>The only tweezers I have ever used before are the cheap ones that you get for a dollar or two.</li>
            <li>But, for simple jobs, these are precise and well made.</li>
            <li>ever thanks</li>
            <li>but I discovered they don&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem to grip very well.</li>
            <li>They are made of stainless steel.</li>
            <li>I prefer these over a needle for getting splinters out and they work really well.</li>
            <li>I believed all the reviews from the folks who received the product for free, don&#x27;t make the same mistake.</li>
            <li>Very well made item.</li>
            <li>If you want sharp and pointy, this is your tool for optimum digging,  But it does not have much grip when it comes to pulling out a big gnarly splinter..</li>
            <li>They grip even at the most sharp point if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I have a bunch of tiny ingrown hairs on different sites and have successfully used these tweezers to remove the tiny curled hairs.  </li>
            <li>It is small enough to carry in my purse and works great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are okay for removing splinters and ingrown hairs, but they do not grip very well unless you get down to the thicker part of the tweezer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can easily grab a single hair, splinter or anything needing precision.&lt;br /&gt;extremely</li>
            <li>Tweezty does a phenomenal job latching on to both large and very tiny short hairs.  </li>
            <li>I have never had such precise little tweezers, I love them.  </li>
            <li>They work pretty well the only thing I would like to see different is if they had just a little bit more gripping power.</li>
            <li>These are sharp so you have to be careful but do they work nicely!</li>
            <li>These are sharp; precise; and easy-to-maneuver once you figure out exactly where to hold the tweezers.</li>
            <li>They work okay for a while, but deform over time and become less useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got a hair that was super deep under the skin</li>
            <li>These type of tweezers are the only kind I have found that can do the job with minimal disruption to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have super fine hairs that need tweezing and I was just not able to get a grip on them using these tweezers.</li>
            <li>All in all, these are decent tweezers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting older (and so are my eyes)</li>
            <li>Highly recomment</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>These are high quality tweezers.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for hard to get small hairs or splinters.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All I know for sure is that I wasted my money on these.</li>
            <li>Should have stuck with getting a new pair of pointies from Tweezerpain...</li>
            <li>Ok for tiny hairs, not much else.</li>
            <li>so the narrow, thin tip makes this a perfect tool for me.</li>
            <li>These are professional grade - highly recommend if you need precision tip tweezers.</li>
            <li>They are durable, easy to hold  and maintain a tight clamp</li>
            <li>I think if you are looking for a pair of tweezers that are going to get those tiny hairs (the first time)</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I always in the past bought the cheap metal tweezers, and thought they work, but after using these, I don&#x27;t know why I use those cheap ones for so long.  </li>
            <li>The point is very sharp and precise.</li>
            <li>The tweezers I had wouldn&#x27;t get any of the little fine hairs,&lt;br /&gt;these pulled them with no problem.</li>
            <li>Not sure I like these-they do work best on ingrown hairs but surprisingly do not have a strong enough grip to pull out simple, single hair--</li>
            <li>I found that these Tweezty tweezers work great for getting into your eyebrow for more detailed thinning with less chance of plucking the wrong hair and leaving behind a gap in your eyebrow,...</li>
            <li>I love the exhilaration I feel when I see what I think is a tiny little hair but after tugging on it with these things it is in fact</li>
            <li>Super sharp, and grip the hair well.</li>
            <li>I love these for hard to grap hairs and splinters</li>
            <li>If you want a little more umph behind your tweezers, maybe go with something more.</li>
            <li>This one is clearly a hit</li>
            <li>I especially like the how the tweezers are not made out of plastic but rather stainless steel, and when holding them I feel the sturdiness and durability of the product.  </li>
            <li>I think the metal that these are made of is far too soft.</li>
            <li>Very well made and will probably last a life time.</li>
            <li>They seem professional.</li>
            <li>They are doing a fabulous job at getting those few pesky and embarrassing whiskers.</li>
            <li>I will still be using my old pair of tweezers, but these Tweezty tweezers will have their place too.</li>
            <li>but they actually work very well</li>
            <li>pair of TWEEZTY tweezers are whole different</li>
            <li>However, I was spoiled before because I had industrial ones that were considerably stronger.</li>
            <li>Overall, really like it.</li>
            <li>These are just like the professional tweezers I paid A LOT of money for.  </li>
            <li>This: by far.</li>
            <li>Be sure to save the rubbery tip or at least the plastic sleeve.</li>
            <li>I find these tweezers quite useful in gently releasing trapped hairs.  </li>
            <li>sharp, good so far though if you press too hard, the grip point moves up from the tip.</li>
            <li>I used to end up with gaps in my eyebrows from plucking too many in one spot, but with these tweezers, that is a thing of the past!</li>
            <li>This works as expected but I&#x27;m sure why it has to be so sharp.  </li>
            <li>A little tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it it works really well.</li>
            <li>Perhaps useful for &amp;#34;digging&amp;#34; - The points are quite sharp, so picking out a splinter would be easier with these and perhaps for pulling an ingrown hair from under the skin.  </li>
            <li>I actually ended up with a splinter a few days after I received them, and they pulled it out quite easily.</li>
            <li>and if your hand slips even a little, the ends are so sharp you&#x27;ll easily stab yourself!</li>
            <li>I use them not only for helping me remove hair that is under the skin that you cannot pull out with regular tweezers unless you make a whole on your skin, but I find them also useful to help me drain some abcesses that I have now and then, on my lips, due to some cosmetic filling the placed on them years ago.</li>
            <li>the point on these tweezers are not sharp.  </li>
            <li>They are as sharp as a pair of tweezers can get so it is easy to get through that top layer of skin to grab those annoying ingrown hairs right underneath.  </li>
            <li>These are a high quality stainless steel extra sharp well made tweezers.</li>
            <li>durable.&lt;br /&gt;-Very accurate in removing hairs due to the sharp tip at the end of the tweezers</li>
            <li>there Stainless steel which means they will last a really long time</li>
            <li>Gets the thin hairs most tweezers can grasp onto.</li>
            <li>This product is not as advertised, this product leaves more behind than it removes.  </li>
            <li>These tweezers are so sharp on the end that when I first attempted to use them I stabbed myself several times!</li>
            <li>The tip is not stiff enough, it contacts where the paint begins, which causes the tip to open.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I wish the tweezers themselves were smooth, instead they have that scratchy, matte, spray paint feel to them.</li>
            <li>I was able to snag out a splinter from the foot of a squirmy 2 year old much easier than pinching over and over with the outdated dull pair I had hanging around.  </li>
            <li>The sharpness will really help for splinters, regular tweezers do not have the pointy ends they are flat which make it harder to get splinters and hairs out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My regular tweezers have a sharp slant tip and work very well for regular tweezing and eyebrow plucking.</li>
            <li>They are black stainless steel, it comes with a protector tip(cover)  </li>
            <li>So instead of using a needle and a pair of tweezers that leave behind half a splinter and a large hole in your skin, you can use the fine tip of these tweezers to work the splinter out and grip it all in one go, without losing your focus.</li>
            <li>,you don&#x27;t have to worry about them rusting like other normal Tweezers.</li>
            <li>After unsuccessfully trying over and over again to remove a single hair and breaking it shorter everytime, I went back to my old tweezer and it came off effortlessly.</li>
            <li>I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.</li>

            <li> 34;how good can tweezers truly get?&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The tweezers work really good</li>
            <li> I loved the tweezers.</li>
            <li> I brought these because there were ratings saying they are good to get ingrown hair...</li>
            <li> they do a good and still will do my eye brows.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> great quality, love these.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied and</li>
            <li> With Tweezty, I was able to do it with its pointy aligned tips!</li>
            <li> They also help prevent me from plucking more than one eyebrow hair at a time!</li>
            <li> I love these and you will too!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these!</li>
            <li> Got a $1 pair from target that works 1000x better!</li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these tweezers!</li>
            <li> This product is great to get the ingrown hairs exposed, but it does not have a strong grip to pull the hairs out.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about it!</li>
            <li> For a splinter or ingrown hair these are amazing.</li>
            <li> these are amazing thank you</li>
            <li> Might cut the tip off and grind my own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, precise, and perfectly functional.</li>
            <li> : If you are wondering, they meet perfect at the very end.</li>
            <li> Honestly, when I bought them I thought to myself &amp;#</li>
            <li> I like this because I can effectively operate the tweezers from a position farther from the tip.  </li>
            <li> Not the best ive had but really close.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done and looks/feels nice.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;above are my own findings...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on keeping them in the first-aid kit in the trunk of my car, but I&#x27;m sure they would be great for grooming your eyebrows which seems to be what most people are using them for.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think I can ever use another pair of tweezers again.</li>
            <li> Fits nicely between my magnify glass and lube.</li>
            <li> AT A DISCOUNT PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> , my review is honest and i would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> looks nice and pointy, but the one I got cannot hold a hair at the tip.</li>
            <li> however, my reviews remain 100% honest.</li>
            <li> Literally best tweezers ever, highly recommended</li>
            <li> I received these tweezers free for review, and......they are AMAZING!</li>
            <li> received the tweezers free but there is no obligation to leave a good review, this is my honest thinking.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold, good quality coating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing to me how fine of a hair the tweezers can grasp!  </li>
            <li> These tweezers are very sturdy and look very appealing which is a great perk.</li>
            <li> They are so nice and top of the line.</li>
            <li> Will have to see how they hold up, but so far these are perfect!</li>
            <li> Grabs even the very fine hairs.</li>
            <li> It gets even the finest of hairs, easily!</li>
            <li> they do have a very fine point and seem to be sturdy</li>
            <li> I am just so much more used to using my old pair of tweezers, when I used these tweezers correctly they gripped the hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> The first thing he said about these was &amp;#34;they will be great for ingrown hairs!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Good item, fair price, decent quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tips are very precise which is probably a selling point for some people</li>
            <li> Very precise for plucking eyebrow hairs which is what I use them for.  </li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s a good product and worthy of 4-stars.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, high quality tweezers.</li>
            <li> :They make more of a weapon than a tweezer you can use.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the Tweezty.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I was able to get this product in exchanged for my review.</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers.  </li>
            <li> i am really love them....</li>
            <li> Love,</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice that the hair was being gripped more on the side than from the end of the tip.</li>
            <li> I ended up spending the extra and ordered the Tweezerman - and those worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> This gives me better visibility at the business end since my fingers aren&#x27;t blocking my view when I&#x27;m trying to grab that splinter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyone would love these.</li>
            <li> I have yet been able to use them and tweeze ANY hair...</li>
            <li> Im returning this for sure.</li>
            <li> It works for some hairs but 1 out of every 5 or so just won&#x27;t come out, just slips out no matter how many times you try.</li>
            <li> The tweezers that are thicker, i.e. wider, at the end seem to work better.</li>
            <li> , the are more of a point, I have never&lt;br /&gt;used</li>
            <li> I love them!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> DID love them :</li>
            <li> Am really &amp; truly happy that I&#x27;ve found these &amp; have found peace-of-mind {for now}.&lt;br /&gt;BTW</li>
            <li> love love love :)</li>
            <li> Wanted to love these</li>
            <li> I got these for free using a promo code (booya!)</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t stab or pinch yourself while using these tweezers.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure the skinniness of the tweezers can put out the smallest splinters.</li>
            <li> so you are able to get a better grip.</li>
            <li> product could be better</li>
            <li> I would most definetly buy&lt;br /&gt;these tweezers, and recommend everyone have a pair in their home.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price on these and the quality is top notch.</li>
            <li> I am a senior and have had many tweezers in my life time.</li>
            <li> Well I contacted the company with questions like &amp;#34;how many times will I have to attempt to pull the hair, I have the tweezerman ones and I am not impressed.&amp;#34; there response &amp;#34;give it a try&amp;#34</li>
            <li> But ok for the price.</li>
            <li> I trust these tweezers to get all the tiniest hairs out of my face and anywhere else they need to be gotten from:)</li>
            <li> These are great and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a high quality and precise pair of tweezers!  </li>
            <li> The handle is very smooth and easy to grip.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive them in exchange for my honest review, I purchased them full price</li>
            <li> It does the job, but when they claimed it&#x27;s &amp;#34;The best tweezers ever&amp;#34;, I naturally expected something better...</li>
            <li> However, my favorite part of them is the rubber grip, allowing you to really get a good grip on them for whatever use you are using them for.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are ok but not on fine hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve NEVER used tweezers as amazing as these, they are totally worth every cent.</li>
            <li> The stainless steel gives them great durability, they are super strong most tweezers are easy to bend and break these held up to the test.</li>
            <li> Great for resizing wild eye brownies.</li>
            <li> I was able to get this product for free to review as part of a promotion.</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> These are extremely sharp but they work wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week now and cannot say enough good things!</li>
            <li> They are easy to hold and easy to use for whatever you need to use them for.</li>
            <li> Easy to use with out fighting with seeing what you are doing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other inexpensive brands before and have always had to spend a fair amount of time doing a good job.</li>
            <li> Tip is fine and grips</li>
            <li> /&gt;The grip is secure,  they are easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> The fine points just didn&#x27;t grab them.</li>
            <li> Even though the tweezer is quite fine the hair slips from its grasp.</li>
            <li> Strong and precise.</li>
            <li> These have a fine point and are precisely aligned to help grab those stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> But which these, it is very easy to pull the exact hairs that you need to.  </li>
            <li> They are nice and sharp, which is what you want out of tweezers and are still strong and of good make.</li>
            <li> a huge curled up hair.</li>
            <li> Extremely accurate with pin point grip.</li>
            <li> They are precise</li>
            <li> Received this item for free after a promotion code.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, the tweezers come with a plastic cover to shield it.&lt;br /&gt;-Because</li>
            <li> : I did not receive this for free in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are incredibly precise.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic tweezers.</li>
            <li> great for pulling out hairs that are starting to regrow on eyebrows and chin or are ingrown like a splinter.</li>
            <li> Fantastic tweezers</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was offered this item for free in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> They are perfect for those tiny hairs, and if you have kids like I do that seem to get splinters all the time, these tweezers work perfectly to get those tiny splinters and even the big ones out.  </li>
            <li> I love this and perfect for very small hairs to pull off from eyebrows.</li>
            <li> In addition, the points are very easily bent so they weren&#x27;t very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Item is very easy to you and perfect to have in a first aid kit for splinters or getting things in hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> I hope you enjoy them just as much as we will:)</li>
            <li> what a great price!!&lt;br /&gt;I received these a little or no cost to give my honest opinion and that is exactly what I did.</li>
            <li> Great grip, sharp, incredibly precise.</li>
            <li> They have a good hold and won&#x27;t let the hair slip out ,like most other tweezers do.</li>
            <li> Either that or there must be some special way to use them that I haven&#x27;t figured out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see how anyone is able to grab an ingrown hair or splinter with these.</li>
            <li> If you are needing a good tweezers look no further and buy these.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t think they would work very well since they were so skinny at the top</li>
            <li> The design is cool as well.</li>
            <li> These are the most intensely pointy tweezers I&#x27;ve ever seen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally---super huge sigh of relief---as I&#x27;ve been searching for a good pair of tweezers for a very long time now.</li>
            <li> sharp pointed tip of these tweezers are also great for removing splinters.</li>
            <li> Works great super sharp</li>
            <li> These are pretty great especially for ingrown hairs, they are like magnetic to pulling them right out with no problem.</li>
            <li> Did arrive quickly though.</li>
            <li> This one gets the job done super quickly.</li>
            <li> I am super Picky about my tweezers.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and packed well ...</li>
            <li> My son and I were amazed at how quick and painless it was.</li>
            <li> I have been very satisfied with these and plan on buying extra pair for my travel bags.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers, very sharp</li>
            <li> black matte finish is great for grip.</li>
            <li> Gets the little hairs I couldn&#x27;t get before with slant tweezers, they work great for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> love how they get all the tiny hairs from my eyebrows that are hard to get and there perfect!!!</li>
            <li> These work great on those fine small hairs!</li>
            <li> But for how well they work and price, it was worth it.</li>
            <li> They might be useful for ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> I received complimentary product for review.</li>
            <li> The seem well worth the price.</li>
            <li> am keeping my old ones, but using these more often...</li>
            <li> Simply wanted to state an honest opinion to hopefully help someone out.</li>
            <li> I have an old pair of Tweezerman tweezers that are more than 10 years old that do a better job than these.  </li>
            <li> I tried with the tip, I tried with the side, I changed my angle, nothing nada, a clear as day exposed hair that I needed to pull I could not for the life of me get them to be able to grip it.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers for working in tight places!</li>
            <li> price&amp;#34;etc yet loved them, thus left a highly favorable review to let others know.</li>
            <li> They just slide right off at my uni-brow</li>
            <li> It just slips right through.</li>
            <li> They are so pointed that you can get right to</li>
            <li> /&gt;the edge of the splinter and pull it right out.</li>
            <li> First, the design of these make them look much nicer than those cheap silver ones.</li>
            <li> We use these tweezers in our sign shop for weeding small decal details and heat press materials for t-shirts and they are by far the best tools for that I have ever used!</li>
            <li> They have great precision at getting even the toughest little hair out!</li>
            <li> Very sharp and try not to take your whole eyebrow off LOL</li>
            <li> The tweezers work great on getting this really small hairs on your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The tips are very fine which makes them great for splinters or any other situations that require extreme precision.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow hairs I need to remove are very fine and blonde</li>
            <li> ordered a second pair, tip a little finer, very happy</li>
            <li> It certainly does what it says it does!</li>
            <li> We liked them so much we bought a second one for my wife&#x27;s son&#x27;s family.</li>
            <li> The surface is still completely  smooth so wiping with alcohol to clean after the splinter procedure was a breeze and left me confident that they would be clean and ready to go for the next injury!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came with a rubber tip guard that I will try my hardest not to lose because these are very, very</li>
            <li> I just got these and right in time:) we live in a old farm house and all of our floors are made of wood.</li>
            <li> I received the Tweezty tweezers just last week, and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li> It may be ok for larger things like splinters.  </li>
            <li> really well getting the tiniest hair would recommend!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazed by these tweezers!</li>
            <li> Very well made tweezers!</li>
            <li> some time :) They are the basic slanted tweezer.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through Tweezerman {ok} to Rubis {great while it remained sharp; too much hassle to re-sharpen} to Revlon and other drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> The part you hold is nice and wide</li>
            <li> These really do make a difference!  </li>
            <li> You definitely don&#x27;t want to be ramming your hands into these while they&#x27;re hiding in a drawer - I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll draw blood.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly what is going on with my hair and my tweezers.  </li>
            <li> My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.</li>
            <li> the tips are fine enough to pretty much grab anything!</li>
            <li> Wow these tweezers are sharp, I was not expecting such ideal sharpness with this product.  </li>
            <li> I have only used the tweezers for ingrown hairs, but it is easy to see that they could be used for a multitude of purposes.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how large they were though</li>
            <li> so you can tweeze the really tiny, fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Will need to practice using them and use a light touch since the steel is not as strong and springy instead of stiff</li>
            <li> They come with a nice little case.</li>
            <li> Great for precise piercing, but not great for plucking individual hairs.</li>
            <li> this is really works for my eyebrow,i like it</li>
            <li> I need something very precision, under magnification</li>
            <li> It really is a struggle to pluck any eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Despite my relationship with this pair of tweezers getting off to a rough start, they truly are magical at plucking those elusive stray eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this tweezer.</li>
            <li> I really use it to shape my eyebrows....</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY  T H</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> These are really well make, let me tell you.</li>
            <li> Made of stainless steel - feels very chic and</li>
            <li> The only tweezers I have ever used before are the cheap ones that you get for a dollar or two.</li>
            <li> But, for simple jobs, these are precise and well made.</li>
            <li> ever thanks</li>
            <li> but I discovered they don&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to grip very well.</li>
            <li> They are made of stainless steel.</li>
            <li> I prefer these over a needle for getting splinters out and they work really well.</li>
            <li> I believed all the reviews from the folks who received the product for free, don&#x27;t make the same mistake.</li>
            <li> Very well made item.</li>
            <li> If you want sharp and pointy, this is your tool for optimum digging,  But it does not have much grip when it comes to pulling out a big gnarly splinter..</li>
            <li> They grip even at the most sharp point if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I have a bunch of tiny ingrown hairs on different sites and have successfully used these tweezers to remove the tiny curled hairs.  </li>
            <li> It is small enough to carry in my purse and works great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are okay for removing splinters and ingrown hairs, but they do not grip very well unless you get down to the thicker part of the tweezer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can easily grab a single hair, splinter or anything needing precision.&lt;br /&gt;extremely</li>
            <li> Tweezty does a phenomenal job latching on to both large and very tiny short hairs.  </li>
            <li> I have never had such precise little tweezers, I love them.  </li>
            <li> They work pretty well the only thing I would like to see different is if they had just a little bit more gripping power.</li>
            <li> These are sharp so you have to be careful but do they work nicely!</li>
            <li> These are sharp; precise; and easy-to-maneuver once you figure out exactly where to hold the tweezers.</li>
            <li> They work okay for a while, but deform over time and become less useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got a hair that was super deep under the skin</li>
            <li> These type of tweezers are the only kind I have found that can do the job with minimal disruption to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have super fine hairs that need tweezing and I was just not able to get a grip on them using these tweezers.</li>
            <li> All in all, these are decent tweezers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting older (and so are my eyes)</li>
            <li> Highly recomment</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> These are high quality tweezers.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for hard to get small hairs or splinters.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All I know for sure is that I wasted my money on these.</li>
            <li> Should have stuck with getting a new pair of pointies from Tweezerpain...</li>
            <li> Ok for tiny hairs, not much else.</li>
            <li> so the narrow, thin tip makes this a perfect tool for me.</li>
            <li> These are professional grade - highly recommend if you need precision tip tweezers.</li>
            <li> They are durable, easy to hold  and maintain a tight clamp</li>
            <li> I think if you are looking for a pair of tweezers that are going to get those tiny hairs (the first time)</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I always in the past bought the cheap metal tweezers, and thought they work, but after using these, I don&#x27;t know why I use those cheap ones for so long.  </li>
            <li> The point is very sharp and precise.</li>
            <li> The tweezers I had wouldn&#x27;t get any of the little fine hairs,&lt;br /&gt;these pulled them with no problem.</li>
            <li> Not sure I like these-they do work best on ingrown hairs but surprisingly do not have a strong enough grip to pull out simple, single hair--</li>
            <li> I found that these Tweezty tweezers work great for getting into your eyebrow for more detailed thinning with less chance of plucking the wrong hair and leaving behind a gap in your eyebrow,...</li>
            <li> I love the exhilaration I feel when I see what I think is a tiny little hair but after tugging on it with these things it is in fact</li>
            <li> Super sharp, and grip the hair well.</li>
            <li> I love these for hard to grap hairs and splinters</li>
            <li> If you want a little more umph behind your tweezers, maybe go with something more.</li>
            <li> This one is clearly a hit</li>
            <li> I especially like the how the tweezers are not made out of plastic but rather stainless steel, and when holding them I feel the sturdiness and durability of the product.  </li>
            <li> I think the metal that these are made of is far too soft.</li>
            <li> Very well made and will probably last a life time.</li>
            <li> They seem professional.</li>
            <li> They are doing a fabulous job at getting those few pesky and embarrassing whiskers.</li>
            <li> I will still be using my old pair of tweezers, but these Tweezty tweezers will have their place too.</li>
            <li> but they actually work very well</li>
            <li> pair of TWEEZTY tweezers are whole different</li>
            <li> However, I was spoiled before because I had industrial ones that were considerably stronger.</li>
            <li> Overall, really like it.</li>
            <li> These are just like the professional tweezers I paid A LOT of money for.  </li>
            <li> This: by far.</li>
            <li> Be sure to save the rubbery tip or at least the plastic sleeve.</li>
            <li> I find these tweezers quite useful in gently releasing trapped hairs.  </li>
            <li> sharp, good so far though if you press too hard, the grip point moves up from the tip.</li>
            <li> I used to end up with gaps in my eyebrows from plucking too many in one spot, but with these tweezers, that is a thing of the past!</li>
            <li> This works as expected but I&#x27;m sure why it has to be so sharp.  </li>
            <li> A little tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it it works really well.</li>
            <li> Perhaps useful for &amp;#34;digging&amp;#34; - The points are quite sharp, so picking out a splinter would be easier with these and perhaps for pulling an ingrown hair from under the skin.  </li>
            <li> I actually ended up with a splinter a few days after I received them, and they pulled it out quite easily.</li>
            <li> and if your hand slips even a little, the ends are so sharp you&#x27;ll easily stab yourself!</li>
            <li> I use them not only for helping me remove hair that is under the skin that you cannot pull out with regular tweezers unless you make a whole on your skin, but I find them also useful to help me drain some abcesses that I have now and then, on my lips, due to some cosmetic filling the placed on them years ago.</li>
            <li> the point on these tweezers are not sharp.  </li>
            <li> They are as sharp as a pair of tweezers can get so it is easy to get through that top layer of skin to grab those annoying ingrown hairs right underneath.  </li>
            <li> These are a high quality stainless steel extra sharp well made tweezers.</li>
            <li> durable.&lt;br /&gt;-Very accurate in removing hairs due to the sharp tip at the end of the tweezers</li>
            <li> there Stainless steel which means they will last a really long time</li>
            <li> Gets the thin hairs most tweezers can grasp onto.</li>
            <li> This product is not as advertised, this product leaves more behind than it removes.  </li>
            <li> These tweezers are so sharp on the end that when I first attempted to use them I stabbed myself several times!</li>
            <li> The tip is not stiff enough, it contacts where the paint begins, which causes the tip to open.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish the tweezers themselves were smooth, instead they have that scratchy, matte, spray paint feel to them.</li>
            <li> I was able to snag out a splinter from the foot of a squirmy 2 year old much easier than pinching over and over with the outdated dull pair I had hanging around.  </li>
            <li> The sharpness will really help for splinters, regular tweezers do not have the pointy ends they are flat which make it harder to get splinters and hairs out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My regular tweezers have a sharp slant tip and work very well for regular tweezing and eyebrow plucking.</li>
            <li> They are black stainless steel, it comes with a protector tip(cover)  </li>
            <li> So instead of using a needle and a pair of tweezers that leave behind half a splinter and a large hole in your skin, you can use the fine tip of these tweezers to work the splinter out and grip it all in one go, without losing your focus.</li>
            <li> ,you don&#x27;t have to worry about them rusting like other normal Tweezers.</li>
            <li> After unsuccessfully trying over and over again to remove a single hair and breaking it shorter everytime, I went back to my old tweezer and it came off effortlessly.</li>
            <li> I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t even grab the regular long hairs.</li>
            <li> Makes me wonder why I ever tried using flat tweezers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to find a decent pair of tweezers that are actually sharp and will pull it on the first few attempts</li>
            <li> sharp enough to get those tiny stuck-under-the-skin hairs too!</li>
            <li> I was fully expecting some Made in China junk, but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these little guys.</li>
            <li> I have been in search of a splinter puller outer for a long time now.  </li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I watched closely in the mirror as each hair I wanted to remove slipped between on numerous tries.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but they certainly beat your average drugstore pair.</li>
            <li> The sharp points can (and likely will) poke a hole in your check or nose.  </li>
            <li> and I was excited to get them, however I&#x27;ve been unable to pluck a SINGLE HAIR with these tweezers.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tweeze a single hair with these, so I threw them out.  </li>
            <li> single hairs.  </li>
            <li> Not a good tweezer for me, the hunt continues for a great tweezer that actually will grip, pull. :(</li>
            <li> Other tweezers I used had a flat tip and sometimes not aligned</li>
            <li> Not only have I noticed that eyebrow tweezing is less painful, but also easily removed a splinter from my childs finger!</li>
            <li> Not as great as some of the reviews say but not the worst either.</li>
            <li> and it makes it harder to pull the hair.</li>
            <li> but it did not pull any of the short eyebrow hairs, it would pull longer hairs after a few attempts.</li>
            <li> Get the job done, but I like the wide ones as while.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to get hold of a hair with the fine points, and if you do, it will likely slip out or break in half.</li>
            <li> I was really not a fan of these.</li>
            <li> Super-sharp tip so be careful.</li>
            <li> sharp so be careful</li>
            <li> recommend these over any other tweezers, I can not imagine using any other type again.</li>
            <li> Edges are sharp, tend to cut hair.  </li>
            <li> its sharp, pointed like I wanted</li>
            <li> They look sharp, but the hairs seem to slip out of the tweezers.</li>
            <li> end of the tweezers are extremely sharp.</li>
            <li> Needed sharp tweezers for grooming needs, not the wimpy ones that are squared.  </li>
            <li> Sharp point</li>
            <li> They are sharp</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> and it was impossible for regular tweezers to grab these slip right into the tiniest places like a ninja.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t know how to use them for ingrowns, be very careful that you don&#x27;t damage the skin because the tips are extremely sharp.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp tip so be careful.</li>
            <li> Very sharp though be careful, i have poked myself accidentally and pulled skin</li>
            <li> VERY SHARP be careful.</li>
            <li> I needed new tweezers to apply my false lashes.  </li>
            <li> They really grab the small hairs!!!</li>
            <li> Sometimes they slip on the hairs and it takes a few tries to get the unwanted hair out.</li>
            <li> Amazon didn&#x27;t let me down.  </li>
            <li> (ie I had a battery stuck down inside a flashlight</li>
            <li> I am throwing out all of my other tweezers!  </li>
            <li> but they are not super tight at the end, it&#x27;s not easy to grab every single hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased them for ingrown hairs, but found that they only capture long hairs and must be held on a dramatic angle.</li>
            <li> These are very very sharp.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp, does what I need it to.</li>
            <li> The pointed tip is very sharp and includes a slip on rubber cover for storing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very sharp and pointy tweezers.  </li>
            <li> the end is extremely sharp and narrow, it does not have the grip of, say, a blunted pair of tweezers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very sharp, though.</li>
            <li> Sharp out of the box, but tips are bent and uneven within 3 days of receiving the product.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that they are sharp and allow you to get those annoying hairs that regular tweezers leave behind.</li>
            <li> When pulling hair it like cuts the hair in half, it doesn&#x27;t grab from the root.</li>
            <li> I have some stray whiskers, and when I go to pull them out, these tweezers will cut them in half rather than holding onto them.  </li>
            <li> Small sharp tips to get the smallest hair</li>
            <li> but this thing gets the job down in ONE SWIPE!</li>
            <li> Heavy and durable</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with a few ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> And sometimes when I pluck out my white hairs, it slips because it&#x27;s too thin.  </li>
            <li> These tweezers are some heavy duty tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp!</li>
            <li> narrow tip for pinning down those hard to see/grab slivers.</li>
            <li> They are so sharp that if you pull hard you break the hair, if you pull slow the hair just slides out of the tweezer.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast, however the actual grip on the tweezers was horrible.</li>
            <li> Difficult to grasp individual hairs.</li>
            <li> I am usually prone to ingrown hair</li>
            <li> with a pointed ends..even a small hair stand can be picked up with dis ..</li>
            <li> I did notice some hairs did slip through the tweezers, but I think what was happening was since the tip is so small</li>
            <li> The tips are too sharp, and the grip a bit weak.</li>
            <li> Keep away from small children.</li>
            <li> They have these tiny hooks on the end, which made them totally useless.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if they were designed that way or if they got bent in shipping.</li>
            <li> My husband is always taking my tweezers and using them to grab a hold of small screws or pull glass or metal out</li>
            <li> The surface area to grab hair is too small.</li>
            <li> Not very good.  </li>
            <li> My son got a splinter in his foot and was crying and my other tweezers would not get it out because they were the wrong angle.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are pretty much worthless.  </li>
            <li> Once you get used to using it, it&#x27;s not too hard.</li>
            <li> and I find it hard to get the hair beneath it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to grasp the hairs</li>
            <li> Maybe I was just pressing the end too hard.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been working out ingrown hairs with a needle and dull pair of tweezers...</li>
            <li> The tweezers are all dull and do not work at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They worked well to get into crevices that were hard to reach</li>
            <li> These tweezers can grab the hair but when I pluck it out it loses grip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This makes it very difficult to pull out specific hairs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tweezers have a tough time with thick hair.</li>
            <li> Tweezers work but steel used is weak.  </li>
            <li> They are VERY SHARP on the end and dangerous.</li>
            <li> Not really happy.</li>
            <li> They are vary sharp but don&#x27;t have gripes to grab hair :(</li>
            <li> useless , I&#x27;m sorry , but they don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> These tweezers are useless.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid the daughters (or even husband) will abscond with them.</li>
            <li> Very very sad as I did not receive the 1st pair at a &amp;#34;discounted</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad pair ...</li>
            <li> I may have gotten a bad one.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, painfully well.  </li>
            <li> EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED AND UPSET</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soooo disappointed in these tweezers.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t you hate that!?&lt;br</li>
            <li> Annoying.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with Tweezty!</li>
            <li> Worst Tweezer Ive ever owned.</li>
            <li> Terrible tweezers.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great super sharp</li>
            <li> These tweezers are very sturdy and look very appealing which is a great perk. I love the fact that they are sharp and allow you to get those annoying hairs that regular tweezers leave behind. The stainless steel gives them great durability, they are super strong most tweezers are easy to bend and break these held up to the test. The sharpness will really help for splinters, regular tweezers do not have the pointy ends they are flat which make it harder to get splinters and hairs out.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these over any other tweezers, I can not imagine using any other type again.</li>
            <li> Tip is fine and grips well. Once you get used to using it, it&#x27;s not too hard. My only complaint is that I wish the tweezers themselves were smooth, instead they have that scratchy, matte, spray paint feel to them. But for how well they work and price, it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Tip is too pointy.  I can&#x27;t actually grab anything with it.</li>
            <li> Not really happy. When pulling hair it like cuts the hair in half, it doesn&#x27;t grab from the root. Gets aggravating after a while.</li>
            <li> These are very very sharp.  :They make more of a weapon than a tweezer you can use.</li>
            <li> These are extremely sharp but they work wonderfully! Got a hair that was super deep under the skin so it def works!</li>
            <li> this is really works for my eyebrow,i like it</li>
            <li> Very nice.  I need something very precision, under magnification, the tips align -almost- perfectly.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, does what I need it to.</li>
            <li> Difficult to grasp individual hairs. Slips while trying to pull.</li>
            <li> Grabs even the very fine hairs. Love it.</li>
            <li> Worst Tweezer Ive ever owned. The tip of the tweezer bent like it was made of aluminum. From day one</li>
            <li> AWESOME Tweezers and probably the sharpest that I have ever encountered.  Perfect for picking at anything you want to pick at!</li>
            <li> Terrible tweezers. It really is a struggle to pluck any eyebrows. They might be useful for ingrown hairs but I have yet to try them for that.</li>
            <li> These work great on those fine small hairs!</li>
            <li> These are pretty great especially for ingrown hairs, they are like magnetic to pulling them right out with no problem.</li>
            <li> Wow these tweezers are sharp, I was not expecting such ideal sharpness with this product.  Gets the job done, painfully well.  I have only used the tweezers for ingrown hairs, but it is easy to see that they could be used for a multitude of purposes.  I especially like the how the tweezers are not made out of plastic but rather stainless steel, and when holding them I feel the sturdiness and durability of the product.  This durability in conjunction with the price make the tweezers an ideal purchase.</li>
            <li> I needed new tweezers to apply my false lashes.  I love the Tweezty.  It is small enough to carry in my purse and works great.  I received complimentary product for review.</li>
            <li> Not the best I&#x27;ve purchased. Did arrive quickly though.</li>
            <li> These are sharp so you have to be careful but do they work nicely!</li>
            <li> the point on these tweezers are not sharp.  I don&#x27;t really see how anyone is able to grab an ingrown hair or splinter with these.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers! I am usually prone to ingrown hair and I find it hard to get the hair beneath it. With Tweezty, I was able to do it with its pointy aligned tips! Other tweezers I used had a flat tip and sometimes not aligned and it makes it harder to pull the hair. I am glad I was able to get this product in exchanged for my review.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are so sharp on the end that when I first attempted to use them I stabbed myself several times! Despite my relationship with this pair of tweezers getting off to a rough start, they truly are magical at plucking those elusive stray eyebrow hairs. Best tweezers ever? I&#x27;m not sure, but they certainly beat your average drugstore pair.</li>
            <li> These dont grip my hairs. They just slide right off at my uni-brow remains -.-</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this tweezer. It&#x27;s hard to grasp the hairs and if your hand slips even a little, the ends are so sharp you&#x27;ll easily stab yourself!</li>
            <li> Amazing tweezers! Gets the little hairs I couldn&#x27;t get before with slant tweezers, they work great for eyebrows. sharp enough to get those tiny stuck-under-the-skin hairs too!</li>
            <li> I think the metal that these are made of is far too soft. They work okay for a while, but deform over time and become less useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are okay for removing splinters and ingrown hairs, but they do not grip very well unless you get down to the thicker part of the tweezer.</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers.  Thew work great.</li>
            <li> They worked great in the beginning. Would even hold on its grip to finest hair. But lasted only for a month. Maybe I was just pressing the end too hard. Anyway, it&#x27;s inexpensive so will just buy another pair.</li>
            <li> I received the Tweezty tweezers just last week, and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM. The pointed tip allows me to pin-point those pesky eyebrow hairs that get low on my eyelids without pinching my skin. They also help prevent me from plucking more than one eyebrow hair at a time! I used to end up with gaps in my eyebrows from plucking too many in one spot, but with these tweezers, that is a thing of the past! I can perfectly shape my eyebrows to my own taste!</li>
            <li> I often get cactus needles as I  work with cactus. These tweezers do the trick. They are precise</li>
            <li> This tweezer is great! A little tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it it works really well. Very sharp tip so be careful. Gets all my tiny hairs that are starting to grow back that regular tweezers won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> These are some of the best tweezers that I have ever owned. Very well made and will probably last a life time. For a splinter or ingrown hair these are amazing. The point is very sharp and precise. If you are needing a good tweezers look no further and buy these.</li>
            <li> great product, excellant results</li>
            <li> sharp, good so far though if you press too hard, the grip point moves up from the tip.</li>
            <li> Great pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li> Edges are sharp, tend to cut hair.  The tip is not stiff enough, it contacts where the paint begins, which causes the tip to open.  It may be ok for larger things like splinters.  Might cut the tip off and grind my own.</li>
            <li> Tweezers work really well getting the tiniest hair would recommend!</li>
            <li> This.look like they work amazing!!</li>
            <li> Great tweezers, very sharp</li>
            <li> Wonderful tool! Strong and precise. They seem professional. I think if you are looking for a pair of tweezers that are going to get those tiny hairs (the first time) then these are your tweezers. I also like the protective case they came in too. Impressive.</li>
            <li> These are awesome. Great quality and they get they job done.</li>
            <li> Not The Best as Claim...Sent Back!</li>
            <li> I like that its sharp, pointed like I wanted but it did not pull any of the short eyebrow hairs, it would pull longer hairs after a few attempts. Not a good tweezer for me, the hunt continues for a great tweezer that actually will grip, pull. :(</li>
            <li> Received this item for free after a promotion code. Item is very easy to you and perfect to have in a first aid kit for splinters or getting things in hard to reach areas. Great, sturdy product.</li>
            <li> do not pull well at all..... save you money.</li>
            <li> As described. Very sharp though be careful, i have poked myself accidentally and pulled skin</li>
            <li> How did I NOT know that they made tweezers like this?!!  For years I&#x27;ve been working out ingrown hairs with a needle and dull pair of tweezers...but this thing gets the job down in ONE SWIPE! It&#x27;s amazing to me how fine of a hair the tweezers can grasp!  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> best tweezeers...with a pointed ends..even a small hair stand can be picked up with dis ..I really use it to shape my eyebrows....i am really love them....</li>
            <li> I find these tweezers quite useful in gently releasing trapped hairs.  These type of tweezers are the only kind I have found that can do the job with minimal disruption to my skin.  This one seems well made, too.  The seem well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great product. Highly recomment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other inexpensive brands before and have always had to spend a fair amount of time doing a good job. When I got the opportunity to received this great product in Exchange for my Honest and Unbiased Opinion I was very excited about it! WOW! Love, Love it!&lt;br /&gt;This is the best tweezer I have ever owned!  This one gets the job done super quickly. They are durable, easy to hold  and maintain a tight clamp so you can tweeze the really tiny, fine hairs. It&#x27;s light, precise, and perfectly functional. Excellent tool! A must have for the make-up case. I highly recommend it. You will not be disappointed with Tweezty!</li>
            <li> useless , I&#x27;m sorry , but they don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY  T H E  B E S T  tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had!!  It gets even the finest of hairs, easily!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a good quality tweezer for those stubborn hairs. This doesn&#x27;t fit the bill. It won&#x27;t grip the hair at all, even a thicker hair. It just slips right through. Maybe they were damaged in shipping? All I know for sure is that I wasted my money on these.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Small sharp tips to get the smallest hair&lt;br /&gt;- Heavy and durable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: If you are wondering, they meet perfect at the very end. They grip even at the most sharp point if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> Get the job done, but I like the wide ones as while. Depends on what you are using them for.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!. I have been using it for a week now and cannot say enough good things! This one is clearly a hit and I will be purchasing again my daughter! Not only have I noticed that eyebrow tweezing is less painful, but also easily removed a splinter from my childs finger! Best tweezers I have ever owned!&lt;br /&gt;Received for honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> excellent tweezers -very pleased</li>
            <li> Really nice! They have great precision at getting even the toughest little hair out! They come with a nice little case. They are heavy duty stainless steel. They feel good in the hand like a quality tool. They have a coating that allows for easier grasping.  I am happy to recieve these tweezers to review. They are doing a fabulous job at getting those few pesky and embarrassing whiskers. Just what I needed!</li>
            <li> Super sharp, and grip the hair well. Was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> This product is great to get the ingrown hairs exposed, but it does not have a strong grip to pull the hairs out. I have to get my regular tweezers to pull the hair out.</li>
            <li> If you want sharp and pointy, this is your tool for optimum digging,  But it does not have much grip when it comes to pulling out a big gnarly splinter..&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazed by these tweezers! Honestly, when I bought them I thought to myself &amp;#34;how good can tweezers truly get?&amp;#34; well, they are great.</li>
            <li> ordered a second pair, tip a little finer, very happy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this item for years.  Amazon didn&#x27;t let me down.  I like the precision, strength and accuracy.  Yes, I would recommend it to others without reservation.</li>
            <li> My regular tweezers have a sharp slant tip and work very well for regular tweezing and eyebrow plucking. I found that these Tweezty tweezers work great for getting into your eyebrow for more detailed thinning with less chance of plucking the wrong hair and leaving behind a gap in your eyebrow,...don&#x27;t you hate that!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The  sharp pointed tip of these tweezers are also great for removing splinters. The tip is almost needle like. So instead of using a needle and a pair of tweezers that leave behind half a splinter and a large hole in your skin, you can use the fine tip of these tweezers to work the splinter out and grip it all in one go, without losing your focus. Same with removing ingrown hairs. The pointed tip is very sharp and includes a slip on rubber cover for storing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip is secure,  they are easy to hold and use. I did notice some hairs did slip through the tweezers, but I think what was happening was since the tip is so small I didn&#x27;t notice that the hair was being gripped more on the side than from the end of the tip. I am just so much more used to using my old pair of tweezers, when I used these tweezers correctly they gripped the hair perfectly. I will still be using my old pair of tweezers, but these Tweezty tweezers will have their place too. I like them and will be using them often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free product sample received in exchange for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I try now and it works well , i got this product with a great discount and its durable perfect .</li>
            <li> Great for precise piercing, but not great for plucking individual hairs.</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement I had for years. Great for resizing wild eye brownies.</li>
            <li> great quality, love these.</li>
            <li> Tweezers work but steel used is weak.  Will need to practice using them and use a light touch since the steel is not as strong and springy instead of stiff had a stronger/better steel been used.</li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t hold onto any of the hairs I try to pull out. I purchased them for ingrown hairs, but found that they only capture long hairs and must be held on a dramatic angle. This makes it very difficult to pull out specific hairs.</li>
            <li> The tweezers work really good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soooo disappointed in these tweezers. I didn&#x27;t receive them in exchange for my honest review, I purchased them full price and I was excited to get them, however I&#x27;ve been unable to pluck a SINGLE HAIR with these tweezers. I tried on my eyebrows, my arms, etc, nothing worked. They are so sharp that if you pull hard you break the hair, if you pull slow the hair just slides out of the tweezer. EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED AND UPSET AT THESE TWEEZERS, I would also like to note that I am an aesthetician so I know how to work the tweezers, so it&#x27;s not a performance issue on my part. After unsuccessfully trying over and over again to remove a single hair and breaking it shorter everytime, I went back to my old tweezer and it came off effortlessly. I&#x27;ll be returning these ASAP!</li>
            <li> Not very good.  Very sharp and pointy tweezers.  The sharp points can (and likely will) poke a hole in your check or nose.  It is very difficult to get hold of a hair with the fine points, and if you do, it will likely slip out or break in half.</li>
            <li> Very well made tweezers! I have always had a problem with a few ingrown hairs and I could never find tweezers that would get them. These have a fine point and are precisely aligned to help grab those stubborn hairs. I have been very satisfied with these and plan on buying extra pair for my travel bags. At this price I can afford to! I love these and you will too! I highly recommend these! Great quality!</li>
            <li> These are a high quality stainless steel extra sharp well made tweezers. I am amzed with the quality, and I am used to use surgical instruments. These are really well make, let me tell you. I use them not only for helping me remove hair that is under the skin that you cannot pull out with regular tweezers unless you make a whole on your skin, but I find them also useful to help me drain some abcesses that I have now and then, on my lips, due to some cosmetic filling the placed on them years ago. This tweezers are great to introduce in the fistulaes and pull out the strings of material.&lt;br /&gt;I received the tweezers free but there is no obligation to leave a good review, this is my honest thinking.</li>
            <li> The tip doesn&#x27;t close properly. I can&#x27;t grip any hairs because as you squeeze it, it&#x27;s got a bow in it so the tip doesn&#x27;t close and can&#x27;t grasp the hair properly. I ended up spending the extra and ordered the Tweezerman - and those worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are longer than regular tweezers. I like this because I can effectively operate the tweezers from a position farther from the tip.  This gives me better visibility at the business end since my fingers aren&#x27;t blocking my view when I&#x27;m trying to grab that splinter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black matte finish is great for grip. The steel has a nice spring to it, and the ground tips are aligned perfectly for a successful &amp;#34;tweeze&amp;#34; every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with a rubber tip guard that I will try my hardest not to lose because these are very, very sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These tweezers were provided to me for the purpose of inspection and review.</li>
            <li> This will handle sliver-picking quite well. Every parent needs a tool like this. Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> looks good!! very nice!</li>
            <li> They are vary sharp but don&#x27;t have gripes to grab hair :(</li>
            <li> Easy to hold, good quality coating.</li>
            <li> They look sharp, but the hairs seem to slip out of the tweezers.</li>
            <li> I have super fine hairs that need tweezing and I was just not able to get a grip on them using these tweezers.</li>
            <li> I loved the tweezers. They are so nice and top of the line. Anyone would love these. Get them for yourself or as a gift for someone.</li>
            <li> I find that these tweezers act like scissors. When I grasp an eyebrow hair it snips it so that I can&#x27;t pull it.</li>
            <li> The tips are too sharp, and the grip a bit weak. It does the job, but when they claimed it&#x27;s &amp;#34;The best tweezers ever&amp;#34;, I naturally expected something better...</li>
            <li> I brought these because there were ratings saying they are good to get ingrown hair... I have yet been able to use them and tweeze ANY hair... They do not even come totally together at the point tips ... I give two stars ...giving them the benefit of the doubt... Maybe I just got a bad pair ... Either that or there must be some special way to use them that I haven&#x27;t figured out.</li>
            <li> great for working on projects but not for use on your body.  they do have a very fine point and seem to be sturdy</li>
            <li> I may have gotten a bad one. The tweezers are all dull and do not work at all. I use this for my eyebrows and they don&#x27;t do anything. They don&#x27;t even grab the regular long hairs. Im returning this for sure.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes them but I don&#x27;t. They are VERY SHARP on the end and dangerous. Could be used as a weapon. Keep away from small children.</li>
            <li> Great ingrown hair tweezers.  Not the best ive had but really close.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Beautiful, sturdy design. Made of stainless steel - feels very chic and durable.&lt;br /&gt;-Very accurate in removing hairs due to the sharp tip at the end of the tweezers&lt;br /&gt;-Multipurpose tool - can be used to remove stray hairs, ingrown hairs, and even splinters&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The end of the tweezers are extremely sharp. Fortunately, the tweezers come with a plastic cover to shield it.&lt;br /&gt;-Because the end is extremely sharp and narrow, it does not have the grip of, say, a blunted pair of tweezers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this product. It gets the job done and looks/feels nice. It is very sharp, though.</li>
            <li> They really grab the small hairs!!!</li>
            <li> It works for some hairs but 1 out of every 5 or so just won&#x27;t come out, just slips out no matter how many times you try. The ends are just too tiny I suppose. The tweezers that are thicker, i.e. wider, at the end seem to work better.</li>
            <li> The item description doesn&#x27;t lie. These are the best tweezers ever. I didn&#x27;t realize how large they were though (just the handle part), but the tips are fine enough to pretty much grab anything!</li>
            <li> Not sure I like these-they do work best on ingrown hairs but surprisingly do not have a strong enough grip to pull out simple, single hair--if you don&#x27;t know how to use them for ingrowns, be very careful that you don&#x27;t damage the skin because the tips are extremely sharp.  (caution: not for amateurs, not for regular tweezing).</li>
            <li> My aunt has these i didn&#x27;t think they would work very well since they were so skinny at the top but they actually work very well they get even the tiniest of hairs.</li>
            <li> Needed sharp tweezers for grooming needs, not the wimpy ones that are squared.  Happy with results.</li>
            <li> My current tweezers and I have had a relationship, for&lt;br /&gt;quite some time :) They are the basic slanted tweezer.&lt;br /&gt;This pair of TWEEZTY tweezers are whole different&lt;br /&gt;product....&lt;br /&gt;Instead of being slanted, the are more of a point, I have never&lt;br /&gt;used this type before now. I will say, if you tweeze your brows,&lt;br /&gt;you want a pair of these,,,&lt;br /&gt;I can define my eyebrows easier and quicker with this&lt;br /&gt;set of tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;I am keeping my old ones, but using these more often...&lt;br /&gt;I receive this product as a sample, for reviewing purposes, the statements&lt;br /&gt;above are my own findings...</li>
            <li> I love them!&lt;br /&gt;I DID love them :(&lt;br /&gt;Tips bent, protect them dearly.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are useless.  They do NOT grasp the hair you&#x27;re trying to pluck.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I am super Picky about my tweezers. I&#x27;ve gone through Tweezerman {ok} to Rubis {great while it remained sharp; too much hassle to re-sharpen} to Revlon and other drugstore brands. I LOVE these! Thankfully. Finally---super huge sigh of relief---as I&#x27;ve been searching for a good pair of tweezers for a very long time now. These are sharp; precise; and easy-to-maneuver once you figure out exactly where to hold the tweezers. Am really &amp; truly happy that I&#x27;ve found these &amp; have found peace-of-mind {for now}.&lt;br /&gt;BTW: I did not receive this for free in exchange for a review. Simply wanted to state an honest opinion to hopefully help someone out. Subjective though....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  08/2016: Purchased 2nd pair &amp; DO NOT recommend. Somehow it has changed &amp; I do not like them. Very very sad as I did not receive the 1st pair at a &amp;#34;discounted price&amp;#34;etc yet loved them, thus left a highly favorable review to let others know. Sigh.......Once again, looking for the perfect tweezers.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers!!! love love love :)</li>
            <li> these are amazing thank you</li>
            <li> Tweezers are good and great one to hold the hairs perfect and easy to pull off with nice grip. I love this and perfect for very small hairs to pull off from eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Worst tweezers I&#x27;ve ever bought! It wouldn&#x27;t pluck anything out. Got a $1 pair from target that works 1000x better!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tweeze a single hair with these, so I threw them out.  They have these tiny hooks on the end, which made them totally useless.  Not sure if they were designed that way or if they got bent in shipping.</li>
            <li> The only tweezers I have ever used before are the cheap ones that you get for a dollar or two. First, the design of these make them look much nicer than those cheap silver ones. However, my favorite part of them is the rubber grip, allowing you to really get a good grip on them for whatever use you are using them for.</li>
            <li> I have been in search of a splinter puller outer for a long time now.  These tweezers are incredibly precise.  I was able to snag out a splinter from the foot of a squirmy 2 year old much easier than pinching over and over with the outdated dull pair I had hanging around.  The surface is still completely  smooth so wiping with alcohol to clean after the splinter procedure was a breeze and left me confident that they would be clean and ready to go for the next injury!</li>
            <li> Not as great as some of the reviews say but not the worst either.</li>
            <li> Wanted to love these but they are not super tight at the end, it&#x27;s not easy to grab every single hair. Annoying. Should have stuck with getting a new pair of pointies from Tweezerpain...</li>
            <li> All in all, these are decent tweezers. However, I was spoiled before because I had industrial ones that were considerably stronger. There was a review that said these were &amp;#34;weak&amp;#34; and I should have listened. If you want a little more umph behind your tweezers, maybe go with something more. But, for simple jobs, these are precise and well made.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are pretty much worthless.  They did not perform as was written in their description.  A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I got these for free using a promo code (booya!), I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed. I was fully expecting some Made in China junk, but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these little guys. The tips are very fine which makes them great for splinters or any other situations that require extreme precision. I&#x27;m planning on keeping them in the first-aid kit in the trunk of my car, but I&#x27;m sure they would be great for grooming your eyebrows which seems to be what most people are using them for. Great Product!</li>
            <li> best tweezer  ever thanks</li>
            <li> Beautiful, high quality tweezers. These are professional grade - highly recommend if you need precision tip tweezers.</li>
            <li> I was really not a fan of these. The tips are very precise which is probably a selling point for some people but I discovered they don&#x27;t really work for me. The eyebrow hairs I need to remove are very fine and blonde so I need a bigger surface to use when grabbing those. The fine points just didn&#x27;t grab them. In addition, the points are very easily bent so they weren&#x27;t very sturdy.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t lying when they say these are the best tweezers ever! I&#x27;ve NEVER used tweezers as amazing as these, they are totally worth every cent. I honestly don&#x27;t think I can ever use another pair of tweezers again.</li>
            <li> Great tool for crafting!  :)</li>
            <li> They can&#x27;t grasp anything thinner than a pube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: They can&#x27;t even do that.</li>
            <li> Gets the thin hairs most tweezers can grasp onto.</li>
            <li> Does not grab the hair.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and try not to take your whole eyebrow off LOL</li>
            <li> Fits nicely between my magnify glass and lube.</li>
            <li> Tweezty&#x27;s are crapzty&#x27;s!  Sharp point but they don&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; single hairs.  Wasted my money.  Delivered quickly and packed well ... but they just don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to grip very well. Even though the tweezer is quite fine the hair slips from its grasp. Perhaps useful for &amp;#34;digging&amp;#34; - The points are quite sharp, so picking out a splinter would be easier with these and perhaps for pulling an ingrown hair from under the skin.  I give it a 2.5 Would I recommend it for tweezing?  No.</li>
            <li> These are high quality tweezers.They have a good hold and won&#x27;t let the hair slip out ,like most other tweezers do.They are made of stainless steel. They work great for your eyebrows,ingrown hair, splinters or anything like that.I wish there was more I could say about them,but all I can say is they are a good buy and works very good. My husband is always taking my tweezers and using them to grab a hold of small screws or pull glass or metal out they do a good and still will do my eye brows. I DID RECEIVE THIS AT A DISCOUNT PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers for working in tight places!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are ok but not on fine hairs.</li>
            <li> These tweezers can grab the hair but when I pluck it out it loses grip.&lt;br /&gt;Tweezers have a tough time with thick hair.</li>
            <li> The tweezers work great on getting this really small hairs on your eyebrows. Make sure you don&#x27;t stab or pinch yourself while using these tweezers. The handle is very smooth and easy to grip. They work perfect on getting rid of in grown hairs. I can&#x27;t say how they are with splinters but I&#x27;m sure the skinniness of the tweezers can put out the smallest splinters. I was able to get this product for free to review as part of a promotion.</li>
            <li> They work pretty well the only thing I would like to see different is if they had just a little bit more gripping power. Sometimes they slip on the hairs and it takes a few tries to get the unwanted hair out. Overall, really like it.</li>
            <li> Good item, fair price, decent quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holding back 1 star for lack of any grip surface.</li>
            <li> I have never had such precise little tweezers, I love them.  I have a bunch of tiny ingrown hairs on different sites and have successfully used these tweezers to remove the tiny curled hairs.  I love the exhilaration I feel when I see what I think is a tiny little hair but after tugging on it with these things it is in fact a huge curled up hair.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast, however the actual grip on the tweezers was horrible. I have course hair and these tweezers didn&#x27;t pull out anything.</li>
            <li> These suck. The surface area to grab hair is too small.</li>
            <li> Wow!  These are awesome.  I received today and couldn&#x27;t wait to try them out.  I am throwing out all of my other tweezers!  These work awesome.  They grip the hair perfectly.  The part you hold is nice and wide so you are able to get a better grip. These would be the best tool for getting out splinters too!  The design is cool as well.</li>
            <li> Literally best tweezers ever, highly recommended</li>
            <li> product could be better</li>
            <li> I ordered these tweezers to use for myself but my husband saw them and claimed them!  They are so awesome.  Very precise for plucking eyebrow hairs which is what I use them for.  I often am trying to pluck and get every hair around the one hair that I am trying to get!  But which these, it is very easy to pull the exact hairs that you need to.  My husband struggles with ingrown hairs.  He gets them on his neck and face, and also on his legs.  He will spend hours picking at them and end up with big scabs and spots from trying to dig them out.  The first thing he said about these was &amp;#34;they will be great for ingrown hairs!&amp;#34; And they are!  They are as sharp as a pair of tweezers can get so it is easy to get through that top layer of skin to grab those annoying ingrown hairs right underneath.  These are great and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a high quality and precise pair of tweezers!  I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> These tweezers work wonderfully! They are nice and sharp, which is what you want out of tweezers and are still strong and of good make. I actually ended up with a splinter a few days after I received them, and they pulled it out quite easily. They are easy to hold and easy to use for whatever you need to use them for. I would definitely recommend these tweezers.</li>
            <li> I prefer these over a needle for getting splinters out and they work really well.</li>
            <li> This works as expected but I&#x27;m sure why it has to be so sharp.  I almost cut myself/poked myself using this.  And sometimes when I pluck out my white hairs, it slips because it&#x27;s too thin.  Still, it&#x27;s a good product and worthy of 4-stars.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers work excellent on my eyebrows. Easy to use with out fighting with seeing what you are doing.  I am reviewing this product that i recieved a promotional discount for However, my review is honest and i would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> This product is not as advertised, this product leaves more behind than it removes.  I watched closely in the mirror as each hair I wanted to remove slipped between on numerous tries.  I have an old pair of Tweezerman tweezers that are more than 10 years old that do a better job than these.  I believed all the reviews from the folks who received the product for free, don&#x27;t make the same mistake.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for removing ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> I received these tweezers free for review, and......they are AMAZING! The tweezers I had wouldn&#x27;t get any of the little fine hairs,&lt;br /&gt;these pulled them with no problem. They also work wonders getting splinters out.... They are so pointed that you can get right to&lt;br /&gt;the edge of the splinter and pull it right out. My son and I were amazed at how quick and painless it was. I would most definetly buy&lt;br /&gt;these tweezers, and recommend everyone have a pair in their home. They are wonderful!</li>
            <li> Fantastic tweezers. Great grip, sharp, incredibly precise. Love them! Makes me wonder why I ever tried using flat tweezers.</li>
            <li> We use these tweezers in our sign shop for weeding small decal details and heat press materials for t-shirts and they are by far the best tools for that I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I have ever owned. I am ocd about removing nose hairs and it does a great job grabbing on to and removing my nose hairs.  Tweezty does a phenomenal job latching on to both large and very tiny short hairs.  Once the tweezty latches onto a hair it is almost a foregone conclusion that it is coming out.</li>
            <li> Sharp out of the box, but tips are bent and uneven within 3 days of receiving the product.</li>
            <li> These are just like the professional tweezers I paid A LOT of money for.  Can&#x27;t beat the price on these and the quality is top notch.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve had! Loved it!</li>
            <li> I am a senior and have had many tweezers in my life time. This: by far. is the best tweezer ever. It doesn&#x27;t miss a hair. It certainly does what it says it does! You must try, it won&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
            <li> Great precision tweezers. They are sharp</li>
            <li> Very sharp! Will get out anything that is stuck in your skin. I wouldn&#x27;t use it for plucking your eyebrows lol you might poke an eye out!</li>
            <li> great for pulling out hairs that are starting to regrow on eyebrows and chin or are ingrown like a splinter.</li>
            <li> Well I contacted the company with questions like &amp;#34;how many times will I have to attempt to pull the hair, I have the tweezerman ones and I am not impressed.&amp;#34; there response &amp;#34;give it a try&amp;#34; I said &amp;#34;ok, but I will be writing a review comparing the two&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;These stink...It will not for the life of anything grasp onto the hair and pull, I showered,  I tried with the tip, I tried with the side, I changed my angle, nothing nada, a clear as day exposed hair that I needed to pull I could not for the life of me get them to be able to grip it. I then moved to a different area of the body and still had the same problem. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to find a decent pair of tweezers that are actually sharp and will pull it on the first few attempts</li>
            <li> looks nice and pointy, but the one I got cannot hold a hair at the tip. if you want to pull a hair out you need to use the side and wrap it around a bit.  it seems the tips are not properly aligned.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as I had hoped. But ok for the price.</li>
            <li> Ok for tiny hairs, not much else. VERY SHARP be careful.</li>
            <li> I just got these and right in time:) we live in a old farm house and all of our floors are made of wood. My son got a splinter in his foot and was crying and my other tweezers would not get it out because they were the wrong angle. I opened these and used them and it took all of two seconds to get out. I was so happy and so was he.&lt;br /&gt;I love how they get all the tiny hairs from my eyebrows that are hard to get and there perfect!!! there Stainless steel which means they will last a really long time,you don&#x27;t have to worry about them rusting like other normal Tweezers. I trust these tweezers to get all the tiniest hairs out of my face and anywhere else they need to be gotten from:) Very satisfied and what a great price!!&lt;br /&gt;I received these a little or no cost to give my honest opinion and that is exactly what I did.I hope you enjoy them just as much as we will:)</li>
            <li> Fantastic tweezers I love these for hard to grap hairs and splinters</li>
            <li> Very well made item. It was great for getting a splinter out tonight!! These are perfect for hard to get small hairs or splinters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this item for free in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> These are the best ever tweezers for removing those pesky ticks. We liked them so much we bought a second one for my wife&#x27;s son&#x27;s family.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these tweezers! Extremely accurate with pin point grip.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are some heavy duty tweezers.  They are black stainless steel, it comes with a protector tip(cover)  They are perfect for plucking your eyebrows.  They are perfect for those tiny hairs, and if you have kids like I do that seem to get splinters all the time, these tweezers work perfectly to get those tiny splinters and even the big ones out.  I always in the past bought the cheap metal tweezers, and thought they work, but after using these, I don&#x27;t know why I use those cheap ones for so long.  These really do make a difference!  I totally recommend these.  I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad. My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.</li>
            <li> These are the most intensely pointy tweezers I&#x27;ve ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;They worked well to get into crevices that were hard to reach (ie I had a battery stuck down inside a flashlight and it was impossible for regular tweezers to grab these slip right into the tiniest places like a ninja.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can easily grab a single hair, splinter or anything needing precision.&lt;br /&gt;extremely sharp so be careful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a promotional discount however, my reviews remain 100% honest.</li>
            <li> Barely able to grab any hair, they are not the best.</li>
            <li> Will have to see how they hold up, but so far these are perfect! Super-sharp tip so be careful. Be sure to save the rubbery tip or at least the plastic sleeve. You definitely don&#x27;t want to be ramming your hands into these while they&#x27;re hiding in a drawer - I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll draw blood.&lt;br /&gt;Very narrow tip for pinning down those hard to see/grab slivers. I&#x27;m getting older (and so are my eyes) so the narrow, thin tip makes this a perfect tool for me. I might have to buy another pair to stash for myself...I&#x27;m afraid the daughters (or even husband) will abscond with them.</li>
            <li> I have five pairs of tweezers, these are the best ones yet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly what is going on with my hair and my tweezers.  I have some stray whiskers, and when I go to pull them out, these tweezers will cut them in half rather than holding onto them.  Maybe I have deep roots...</li>
