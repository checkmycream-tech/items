            <li>Good looking but a bit flimsy.</li>

            <li>So much more gorgeous in person and great quality.</li>
            <li>It looks beautiful, much better in person than in the picture which was a really nice surprise.</li>
            <li>A very nice crown...very pretty!!!</li>
            <li>What a shame because it really is a stunning tiara!</li>
            <li>Lovely!</li>
            <li>It was well made and came packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>With this tiara, which is at an excellent price, I will feel and know I am the princess this marine has been waiting for his whole life.</li>
            <li>otherwise it is one of the most good looking crown on Amazon..</li>
            <li>I loved this crown and thought it would be perfect for her big 21.  </li>
            <li>Perfect fit and stays on my hair very well.</li>
            <li>But, it would look GRAND on any lady for a party or princess themed night out.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Ordered this for a friend who is a drag queen and it&#x27;s GREAT!  </li>
            <li>It shines and much more beautiful outside.</li>
            <li>and it was fine.</li>
            <li>I bought this tiara to use as part of an Irish dance competitive outfit and am so happy with it.</li>
            <li>I have a round face and the height of this tiara balanced out my face perfectly.</li>
            <li>I enjoy wearing it beneath my helmet during deployments.</li>
            <li>the crown is as pretty as it was in the picture but the top of it arrived bent somewhat, and it needed some spacing with hands.</li>
            <li>It has been a tradition that every year I would get her a crown, and every year I have gone larger and larger or more intricate or more beautiful than the year before.  </li>
            <li>This crown is absolutely gorgeous, but for some reason I thought it would be smaller.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly too.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.  </li>
            <li>It worked exactly as I wnted it to!  </li>
            <li>very soft metals and easily misforms</li>
            <li>but if I open it up so it sits on the front of my forehead (more like a crown than tiara)</li>
            <li>Getting married in a week.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>it make the whole effect!  </li>
            <li>It reminds me that I&#x27;m special and have a reason to live.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we needed for a high profile client&#x27;s 50th birthday cake topper.  </li>
            <li>i loveeee it so much..</li>
            <li>It has an adjustable ring around the whole thing</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really adjustable to any size; and</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous detailing, lightweight and beautifully delicate looking.</li>
            <li>Returned item due to dis satisfied.</li>
            <li>This tiara totally surprised me!</li>
            <li>but product is off poor quality and bends easily.</li>

            <li> This tiara totally surprised me!</li>
            <li> but product is off poor quality and bends easily.</li>
            <li> I tried other tiaras that were about 2 or 3 inches, but this one is definitely a choice pick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a sharp downward point in the middle of the crown..</li>
            <li> I love this crown but the design is painful.</li>
            <li> It does have a pointed center as others have reported, but I didn&#x27;t find it uncomfortable except when the tiara was straight down on my head.</li>
            <li> Half the price of the one in the bridal shop at the mall.</li>
            <li> Oh, and with my Prime membership I think I got this less than twenty four hours after ordering it.  </li>
            <li> This tiara is absolutely gorgeous...and dramatic!  </li>
            <li> It came one stone was missing</li>
            <li> Very flimsy and painful to wear.</li>
            <li> The pointy bit in the center front is like a knife in the head if you have thin hair</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure I would trust it for my wedding day.</li>
            <li> everyone has said they would wear something fun and a little outrageous.</li>
            <li> I mean ANY size.</li>
            <li> you need to have very thick layer of hair to avoid it..</li>
            <li> Expensive for the quality.</li>

            <li> Bought this for a friends 21st birthday.  It has been a tradition that every year I would get her a crown, and every year I have gone larger and larger or more intricate or more beautiful than the year before.  I loved this crown and thought it would be perfect for her big 21.  I had it shipped to her and she loved it.  It was well made and came packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> Expensive for the quality. Very flimsy and painful to wear.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for a friend who is a drag queen and it&#x27;s GREAT!  It looks beautiful, much better in person than in the picture which was a really nice surprise.</li>
            <li> Half the price of the one in the bridal shop at the mall. More beautiful too.</li>
            <li> This worked great for The Ice Queen costume I wore this year. Perfect size and looks really good for the price.</li>

            <li> this is a very beautiful tiara...i loveeee it so much..its adjustable band is just great..i am happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> The pointy bit in the center front is like a knife in the head if you have thin hair but if I open it up so it sits on the front of my forehead (more like a crown than tiara) it works.  Very pretty.  The expandable band that goes around the head saved the day for me.</li>
            <li> Got this for a girl&#x27;s 15th bday and it looke great that day with her hair done up and everything!</li>
            <li> This crown is absolutely gorgeous, but for some reason I thought it would be smaller. So I can&#x27;t use it for my wedding, I will have to sell it and try something different.</li>
            <li> the crown is as pretty as it was in the picture but the top of it arrived bent somewhat, and it needed some spacing with hands. very soft metals and easily misforms</li>
            <li> A very nice crown...very pretty!!!</li>
            <li> This tiara is so beautiful. I have a round face and the height of this tiara balanced out my face perfectly. It shines and much more beautiful outside. I tried other tiaras that were about 2 or 3 inches, but this one is definitely a choice pick. The packaging is good. Perfect fit and stays on my hair very well. Getting married in a week. With this tiara, which is at an excellent price, I will feel and know I am the princess this marine has been waiting for his whole life. Las Vegas, here I come!</li>
            <li> Beautiful and just as pictured. It does have a pointed center as others have reported, but I didn&#x27;t find it uncomfortable except when the tiara was straight down on my head. I tipped it back a bit and had it angled on my head and it was fine.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture but product is off poor quality and bends easily. Returned item due to dis satisfied.</li>
            <li> Oh, my living god! This tiara is absolutely gorgeous...and dramatic!  It has an adjustable ring around the whole thing so it&#x27;s really adjustable to any size; and I mean ANY size. I bought this for a meet &amp; mingle party on my upcoming cruise...everyone has said they would wear something fun and a little outrageous. That I&#x27;m over six feet two inches tall and built like a bear with a shaved head...this tiara is the cherry on my cake!  But, it would look GRAND on any lady for a party or princess themed night out. Oh, and with my Prime membership I think I got this less than twenty four hours after ordering it.  Really.</li>
            <li> It worked exactly as I wnted it to!  this was for a costume...and tho spendy for a costume...it make the whole effect!  Beautiful tiara!</li>
            <li> Good Design,Good Product&lt;br /&gt;I love it.I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  Exactly what we needed for a high profile client&#x27;s 50th birthday cake topper.  Arrived quickly too.</li>
            <li> This tiara totally surprised me! So much more gorgeous in person and great quality. I wanted to give it five stars but since it won&#x27;t stay to where I adjust it I have to give it four stars. What a shame because it really is a stunning tiara!</li>
            <li> It came one stone was missing it was not what I was looking for sending back wasn&#x27;t happy about this, tiara</li>
            <li> Very nice.....It was a hit with the show.....not quite as glittery as I thought. but was very nice.  Would recommend it to anyone for use again.</li>
            <li> Good looking but a bit flimsy. Great for a Halloween costume, which is what I ordered it for but I&#x27;m not sure I would trust it for my wedding day.</li>
            <li> I love this crown but the design is painful. i have not paid attention to it earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a sharp downward point in the middle of the crown.. you can see that in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when you wear it..it keep on hurting as it pushed into the skin... you need to have very thick layer of hair to avoid it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wanted to return it but i already used it once for halloween..so i could not...... otherwise it is one of the most good looking crown on Amazon..</li>
            <li> Lovely! I enjoy wearing it beneath my helmet during deployments. It reminds me that I&#x27;m special and have a reason to live.</li>
            <li> Beautiful.... Just wish it were easier to be held on my head....</li>
            <li> Very nice product, i very happy with the tiara, good good good good good good good good good good good!!!</li>
