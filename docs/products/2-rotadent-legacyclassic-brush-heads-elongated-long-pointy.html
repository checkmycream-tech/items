            <li>Hey anybody out there remember when the razor handles were cheap but the razors not so.</li>

            <li>Dr. Carol sold me my first Rotadent.  </li>
            <li>These have helped keep me teeth clean with braces cleaning between the brackets in a way that no other tooth brush can.</li>
            <li>They get between your teeth and really massage the gum well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>

            <li>This was replacement brushes for my existing Rotadent Classic model.  </li>
            <li>Apparently they were defective because when I changed to the flat tip brushes, they rotated fine.</li>
            <li>Inadvertently I bought brushes for the new Zila Rotadent.  </li>
            <li>These are for the older version and they printed that on the arm this time so you can buy the correct one next time...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t fit properly ....... not secure.</li>

            <li> They last quite a long time , as does the toothbrush .</li>
            <li> I also use the *flat tipped* brushes .</li>
            <li> Cheaper because the dumb down of product with the high price sticker that got them there  in the first place is their rise to excess.  </li>
            <li> The company was &amp;#34;outwhere&amp;#34; luckily for me Amazon stood behind.</li>
            <li> These particular brush heads refused to rotate in my Rotadent toothbrush and I was forced to discard them.</li>
            <li> Be careful when ordering this product.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> Now that there is a newer version, these heads are getting harder to find.</li>
            <li> Sonic and other companies can&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> 14 years ago I lost all my teeth due to a virus.  </li>
            <li> Yep, dumbed down copies.  </li>
            <li> Really helps to keep your breath  fresh plus reducing nasty bacteria .</li>
            <li> The heads did not fit.  </li>
            <li> 12 years ago as I sat crying in my dentist/friends chair, &amp;#34;oh, Jim, help me.  </li>
            <li> These are sooo expensive but Rotadent and their brush heads are the only thing that prevents cavaties for me.  </li>
            <li> The ad did not give me enough info to tell that it was for the wrong rotadent</li>
            <li> The base wasn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> Oh, and you guys a generation behind, think about the price of batteries.</li>
            <li> Rotadent is very expensive</li>
            <li> He was not the dentist that put me in my awful predicament.  </li>

            <li> Rotadent is very expensive so it&#x27;s nice to find Zila offer a good price for such an expensive product.  I love my rotadent even though the prices for the replacement brush heads can be high.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fit properly ....... not secure.</li>
            <li> Be careful when ordering this product.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you order the correct replacement head prior to placing your order.</li>

            <li> Rotadent is the best toothbrush ever.  Now that there is a newer version, these heads are getting harder to find.</li>
            <li> One of two brushes doesn&#x27;t  work well. It stops spininig, Pops out of the grove holding the head in the machine, Disppointing!</li>
            <li> used to be able to just replace the brush head. Now you have to buy the entire arm. May be just as well because the pin the brush sits on eventually gives out any and needs to be replaced. These are for the older version and they printed that on the arm this time so you can buy the correct one next time...</li>
            <li> Ordered and received as advertised.  Thanks</li>
            <li> 1 of the toothbrush heads was defective.</li>
            <li> The Rotadent head had to be changed too soon before it wore out, because the charge on the unit was lost too soon.</li>
            <li> Although the brush heads are pricy for me it is the best way to brush teeth with excellent results for sensitive gums</li>
            <li> This was replacement brushes for my existing Rotadent Classic model.  If you have sensitive gums or recession or simply want a thorough but gentle method of cleaning then Rotadent is an excellent item to consider.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for years and have always been very happy with the product. We will continue to order them.</li>
            <li> These are sooo expensive but Rotadent and their brush heads are the only thing that prevents cavaties for me.  Sonic and other companies can&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I was able to find the classic brush heads for my rotodent, and at a decent price.  They arrived when they were suppose to, and they were sent by USPS, so they were left in my mailbox. No need to be at home for a delivery.</li>
            <li> Really like how these clean my teeth.  As you clean tooth by tooth, the long brush head is able to proovide a good cleaning in between teeth to assist like flossing.  Very pleased with these brush heads</li>
            <li> Have to return as it doesn&#x27;t fit my toothbrush holder.</li>
            <li> when I received it the bristle was falling off..</li>
            <li> Serves the purpose......price has increased, tho&#x27;, since last time I ordered it (not on Amazon).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the products and service...</li>
            <li> These are the same ones from my dentist, which I had to find online when they were out of stock.</li>
            <li> The heads did not fit.  The ad did not give me enough info to tell that it was for the wrong rotadent</li>
            <li> These have helped keep me teeth clean with braces cleaning between the brackets in a way that no other tooth brush can. I have had my bottom braces taken off after 3 1/2 years &amp; there was no discoloration &amp; there were no cavities.</li>
            <li> Rotadent products are awesome -  years ago I had gum disease &amp; having / using this toothbrush was required as part of my treatment . The  *pointy tipped * brushes do a super great job of cleaning out debris from *pockets*. They last quite a long time , as does the toothbrush . The *tongue scraper*  clears away that film from your tongue : Really helps to keep your breath  fresh plus reducing nasty bacteria . I used a regular toothbrush for an interval and my mouth did NOT feel clean at all . I also use the *flat tipped* brushes . So that&#x27;s my story !!</li>
            <li> Love the product but have a hard time finding it locally, so being able to order it is really great.</li>
            <li> 14 years ago I lost all my teeth due to a virus.  12 years ago as I sat crying in my dentist/friends chair, &amp;#34;oh, Jim, help me.  He was not the dentist that put me in my awful predicament.  I had ill fitting dentures and nowhere else to go. Jim said go see Dr. Carol Phillips.  The woman is amazing. I now have a full mouth of implants and a beautiful smile (four years later.)&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a vested interest.  Dr. Carol sold me my first Rotadent.  I get a thumbs up on every exam.  My second Rotadent is nearing the end of its battery life.  Inadvertently I bought brushes for the new Zila Rotadent.  Yep, dumbed down copies.  The base wasn&#x27;t the same. The company was &amp;#34;outwhere&amp;#34; luckily for me Amazon stood behind. Those Guys and Gal  are so great.  Bottom line I ordered this batch hoping they were the last of what Zila bought from Rotadent--Close.&lt;br /&gt;I really need the pointy guy brush.  However I don&#x27;t think it will last 5 minutes in my mouth and at $15.00 a pop that doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Hey anybody out there remember when the razor handles were cheap but the razors not so. Oh, and you guys a generation behind, think about the price of batteries. So bottom  line these brushes are close to what they were and we are looking for something better and cheaper.  Cheaper because the dumb down of product with the high price sticker that got them there  in the first place is their rise to excess.  Shame on you!&lt;br /&gt;O, Um, You asked if I would rate.  Yes.</li>
            <li> These particular brush heads refused to rotate in my Rotadent toothbrush and I was forced to discard them. Apparently they were defective because when I changed to the flat tip brushes, they rotated fine.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed very happy with them</li>
            <li> seems to wear out fast</li>
            <li> Brush heads are superior. Wish I could say the same about the inferior Rotadent. Underpowered and each charge only lasts a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> What I wanted,all good</li>
    </ol>
