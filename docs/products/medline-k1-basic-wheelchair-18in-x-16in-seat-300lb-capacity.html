            <li>Ordered it for the price, its 18\\&quot; width, the removable Desk Length Arms, Removable Foot Rest and most of all, the vynle seat for using in the shower/pools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon</li>

            <li>this 18\\&quot; wide is perfect.</li>
            <li>Amazing for right before Christmas.</li>
            <li>best wheel chair i have ever had,  would not trade or give up  for any other chair i have tried out</li>
            <li>So easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The legs come off easily and it fits in the trunk of a Honda Civic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, sturdy and easy to transport.  </li>
            <li>This enabled me to return to school and stay off my foot and get around my two story school easily.  </li>
            <li>The leg/foot adjustment is easy to operate.</li>
            <li>Just take off the leg sections, which is easy to do, and fold it up.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for my wife with the ides of using it at its lower seat height, but found out very quickly that it was not height adjustable.  </li>
            <li>Folds up easily.</li>
            <li>It assembles easily,  </li>
            <li>it rolls easily.  </li>
            <li>its easy to roll myself around the house.  </li>
            <li>its easy to store.  </li>
            <li>It was comfortable to sit in and easy to roll around.</li>
            <li>It is light and is easy to assamble and to use.</li>
            <li>The wheelchair arrived in a semi-damaged box but the contents were fine.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and easy to transport which enables her to get out and about.</li>
            <li>It is fairly light weight, for a wheelchair.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and moves smoothly.</li>
            <li>This chair is a fantastic value.  </li>
            <li>It is a smooth roller.</li>
            <li>There is a height adjustment, but I didn&#x27;t try to change it, the chair being of a comfortable height already.  </li>
            <li>Wheelchair is comfortable with cushions.</li>
            <li>Comfortable sitting.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call it light, but manageable.  </li>
            <li>If you exceed either of those limits, depending on how you are shaped it may not be totally comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Good construction, easy to move, folds easily, and is light enough to load in a trunk for transportation.  </li>
            <li>It fits through most doorways and is pretty lightweight.  </li>
            <li>Nice and sturdy, and very easy to handle due to its light weight.</li>
            <li>but I did not think I would pay a good price and get the same quality of a hopital Wheelchair.</li>
            <li>comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;Not being able to put any weight on the injured leg for more than 2 months it allowed me to move in the house and outside comfortably.</li>
            <li>Only good for remaining at facility, household, etc., but not in and out of vehicles.</li>
            <li>Had difficulties with this company but they finally made good.  </li>
            <li>This chair is very comfortable--I ought to know, as I have to sit in it many hours a day.</li>
            <li>Good for my use, which is rather infrequent, but is stable and durable enough for my needs.</li>
            <li>My walker-rollator gave me so much more ease and freedom than a normal walker, one or even two canes, that it didnt occur to me</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>For me with several surgeries upcoming that limit my mobility, and some time pre surgery with limited, this was the best choice.  </li>
            <li>The arms take just a few seconds to detach, which is great for a musician who needs that space to hold an instrument.</li>
            <li>Nice wheelchair simple to put together.</li>
            <li>, finally, you really need a good pair of wheelchair gloves.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I broke my leg, I work in an office and what a relief to have something affordable and I chose Amazon Prime and got it right away.  </li>
            <li>The right foot bracket doesnt lock into place causing it to swing.  </li>
            <li>I used this recently for the first time and was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for someone wanting a light weight chair.</li>
            <li>I received my new wheelchair the other day, it was easy to put together, and very comfortable to sit in, I also ordered a seat pillow, it&#x27;s comfortable without it though.</li>
            <li>I am five feet two inches tall and weigh in the 140&#x27;s - there is plenty of room in the seat and a bigger person would fit just fine.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipper.  </li>
            <li>The chair is also far better quality than one I paid more than twice as much for at a local store.</li>
            <li>Had to take a hammer to it last night to be able to transfer her to bed, and now I&#x27;m just done with this chair.  </li>
            <li>If you purchase this product, be advised that it might not be exactly what is shown.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described and works well.  </li>
            <li>and I believe this one is higher quality.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it&#x27;s not what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this will be much more durable than the more common vinyl.  </li>
            <li>Simply too much work with too many people involved.</li>
            <li>I give this a high rating because it is worth it.</li>
            <li>It is often difficlut to locate a wheelchair is large department stores in close proximity to the Handicapped locat ions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I consider it smart of the manufacturer not to ship it overly lubricated and chance leaks.  </li>
            <li>The legs elevate very high, which we needed; it came fully assembled except for legs which went on with no tools and the push handles which used an included Allen wrench.</li>
            <li>I tested the chair and found that it is very durable.</li>
            <li>the whole idea of a wheel chair</li>
            <li>Very lightweight and asy to manage.</li>
            <li>Because of the low price and free shipping, I opted to keep the chair.</li>
            <li>This chair was advertized as a lightweight though it weighed as much as the chair we were borrowing.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Will be put to much use.  </li>
            <li>Recovering from a very severe knee injury, I purchased this wheelchair enabling me to get around</li>
            <li>/&gt;This will make it much easier to navigate the stores etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i dont know really</li>
            <li>i could get that much of an upgrade again.  </li>
            <li>The instructions could be better only problem is the back support on the right side could tighten but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an extremely comfortable chair and sitting in it hurts my back after a while, but the same is true for all wheel chairs - they do sell cushions for them.  </li>
            <li>It arrived exactly when expected and with free shipping..</li>
            <li>As far as the Invacare chair that I received, it is well-made and it was easy to reset the wheels for use by a short person.</li>
            <li>I purchased this chair for one of our high schools for use in the event of an injury or emergency involving a student, teacher, parent, etc.  </li>
            <li>It is too wide to fit though a 22\\&quot; doorway (unless you remove the door.)</li>
            <li>Even though I only needed it for a month, it was worth every penney.</li>
            <li>You would&#x27;ve thought she got a new Cadillac.  </li>
            <li>and she is going to use her new Wheelchair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting some new arm muscles though.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have a new respect for people permanently in wheelchairs.</li>
            <li>My mother had just returned from Florida to New York.</li>
            <li>I realize that it is not the most expensive unit available but is quite sufficient for our needs.</li>
            <li>if so i&#x27;ll add to my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ITEM 2 to know:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not very strong in terms of unfolding, and have found that sometimes  it doesnt want to open all the way in terms of seat width very easily.  </li>
            <li>The funny thing that happen when we brought this wheelchair to her it turned out to be the same model that she had from the hospital</li>
            <li>Wow..!</li>
            <li>, narrow enough to turn tight corners, wide enough to be comfortable, and very lightweight, make it super easy to get it into the car for trips to the grocery store (remember to lock those wheels before lifting into the trunk!).  </li>
            <li>If you are buying this for a temporary use, as in a broken leg, it&#x27;s probably fine and economical.</li>
            <li>We have had no problems so far with this wheelchair.</li>
            <li>No worries about safety issues so far.</li>
            <li>My 14 year old son transports the chair for me without difficulty.</li>
            <li>Thanks to all who jumped to make this happen in only one&lt;br /&gt;day.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 90 year old</li>
            <li>Price is much lower than my mother&#x27;s last chair</li>
            <li>She has been on a Knee Scooter but that  is very difficlut when going out in public and is extremly</li>
            <li>how hot depended on how long used.  </li>
            <li>We didnt read the manual but it probably says to lubricate the wheels when you get it, they squeaked a bit but a shot of wd40 fixed that.  </li>
            <li>, i&#x27;d absolutely recommend this to a friend or relative.  </li>
            <li>&quot; may be good for outdoor use but slide all over the linoleum, rendering the chair useless.</li>
            <li>We tried to send it b ack but didn&#x27;t want to put out the $90 it would take to mail it back, so it is here, we would like to get one that works, but right now we have this investment and don&#x27;t feel I want a second chair around even it that one doesn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li>Anyway, they both found it very easy to use even though they were both fairly weak when they used it.</li>
            <li>Its light enough without the legs that I can lift it.(i&#x27;m a middle aged normal sized woman) and the legs go separately when its folded anyway.  </li>
            <li>Now needing to buy another chair, will not buy on the net this time, will buy local to see it first.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to manipulate on flat surface but hard on any type carpet.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for short term needs.</li>
            <li>However, the left arm doesn&#x27;t fit right and is very hard to take in and out.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted faster than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Seconds later JDS Supplies Customer Service apologized and promised a new chair.</li>
            <li>Mom passed away in April, soon after Dad became ill and found himself using that same wheel chair, this time around he loved it.      </li>
            <li>This is generally a well put together chair.</li>
            <li>Now we are prepared for the next emergency which will, hopefully, be in the far distance.</li>
            <li>My 5&#x27;1\\&quot; partner has no trouble loading it into the back of the SUV.  </li>
            <li>Full sized wheelchair that isn&#x27;t as heavy as regular wheelchairs.  </li>
            <li>The only problem we are having is that the rubber on the wheels is apparently disintegrating.</li>
            <li>It is PRETTY HEAVY, even without box and foot pads.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is that the left wheel slips sometimes starting off from a stationary position, not gripping like the right</li>
    </ol>

            <li> She was so excited when it arrived, she was mobile again!  </li>
            <li> Overall, a very good chair at an affordable price.  </li>
            <li> Arrived safe and sound....</li>
            <li> this 18\\&quot; wide is perfect.</li>
            <li> Amazing for right before Christmas.</li>
            <li> best wheel chair i have ever had,  would not trade or give up  for any other chair i have tried out</li>
            <li> So easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The legs come off easily and it fits in the trunk of a Honda Civic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, sturdy and easy to transport.  </li>
            <li> This enabled me to return to school and stay off my foot and get around my two story school easily.  </li>
            <li> The leg/foot adjustment is easy to operate.</li>
            <li> Just take off the leg sections, which is easy to do, and fold it up.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife with the ides of using it at its lower seat height, but found out very quickly that it was not height adjustable.  </li>
            <li> Folds up easily.</li>
            <li> It assembles easily,  </li>
            <li> it rolls easily.  </li>
            <li> its easy to roll myself around the house.  </li>
            <li> its easy to store.  </li>
            <li> It was comfortable to sit in and easy to roll around.</li>
            <li> It is light and is easy to assamble and to use.</li>
            <li> The wheelchair arrived in a semi-damaged box but the contents were fine.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and easy to transport which enables her to get out and about.</li>
            <li> It is fairly light weight, for a wheelchair.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and moves smoothly.</li>
            <li> This chair is a fantastic value.  </li>
            <li> It is a smooth roller.</li>
            <li> There is a height adjustment, but I didn&#x27;t try to change it, the chair being of a comfortable height already.  </li>
            <li> Wheelchair is comfortable with cushions.</li>
            <li> Comfortable sitting.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it light, but manageable.  </li>
            <li> If you exceed either of those limits, depending on how you are shaped it may not be totally comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Good construction, easy to move, folds easily, and is light enough to load in a trunk for transportation.  </li>
            <li> It fits through most doorways and is pretty lightweight.  </li>
            <li> Nice and sturdy, and very easy to handle due to its light weight.</li>
            <li> but I did not think I would pay a good price and get the same quality of a hopital Wheelchair.</li>
            <li> comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;Not being able to put any weight on the injured leg for more than 2 months it allowed me to move in the house and outside comfortably.</li>
            <li> Only good for remaining at facility, household, etc., but not in and out of vehicles.</li>
            <li> Had difficulties with this company but they finally made good.  </li>
            <li> This chair is very comfortable--I ought to know, as I have to sit in it many hours a day.</li>
            <li> Good for my use, which is rather infrequent, but is stable and durable enough for my needs.</li>
            <li> My walker-rollator gave me so much more ease and freedom than a normal walker, one or even two canes, that it didnt occur to me</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> For me with several surgeries upcoming that limit my mobility, and some time pre surgery with limited, this was the best choice.  </li>
            <li> The arms take just a few seconds to detach, which is great for a musician who needs that space to hold an instrument.</li>
            <li> Nice wheelchair simple to put together.</li>
            <li> , finally, you really need a good pair of wheelchair gloves.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I broke my leg, I work in an office and what a relief to have something affordable and I chose Amazon Prime and got it right away.  </li>
            <li> The right foot bracket doesnt lock into place causing it to swing.  </li>
            <li> I used this recently for the first time and was thrilled.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it for someone wanting a light weight chair.</li>
            <li> I received my new wheelchair the other day, it was easy to put together, and very comfortable to sit in, I also ordered a seat pillow, it&#x27;s comfortable without it though.</li>
            <li> I am five feet two inches tall and weigh in the 140&#x27;s - there is plenty of room in the seat and a bigger person would fit just fine.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipper.  </li>
            <li> The chair is also far better quality than one I paid more than twice as much for at a local store.</li>
            <li> Had to take a hammer to it last night to be able to transfer her to bed, and now I&#x27;m just done with this chair.  </li>
            <li> If you purchase this product, be advised that it might not be exactly what is shown.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described and works well.  </li>
            <li> and I believe this one is higher quality.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s not what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this will be much more durable than the more common vinyl.  </li>
            <li> Simply too much work with too many people involved.</li>
            <li> I give this a high rating because it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It is often difficlut to locate a wheelchair is large department stores in close proximity to the Handicapped locat ions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I consider it smart of the manufacturer not to ship it overly lubricated and chance leaks.  </li>
            <li> The legs elevate very high, which we needed; it came fully assembled except for legs which went on with no tools and the push handles which used an included Allen wrench.</li>
            <li> I tested the chair and found that it is very durable.</li>
            <li> the whole idea of a wheel chair</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and asy to manage.</li>
            <li> Because of the low price and free shipping, I opted to keep the chair.</li>
            <li> This chair was advertized as a lightweight though it weighed as much as the chair we were borrowing.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Will be put to much use.  </li>
            <li> Recovering from a very severe knee injury, I purchased this wheelchair enabling me to get around</li>
            <li> /&gt;This will make it much easier to navigate the stores etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i dont know really</li>
            <li> i could get that much of an upgrade again.  </li>
            <li> The instructions could be better only problem is the back support on the right side could tighten but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an extremely comfortable chair and sitting in it hurts my back after a while, but the same is true for all wheel chairs - they do sell cushions for them.  </li>
            <li> It arrived exactly when expected and with free shipping..</li>
            <li> As far as the Invacare chair that I received, it is well-made and it was easy to reset the wheels for use by a short person.</li>
            <li> I purchased this chair for one of our high schools for use in the event of an injury or emergency involving a student, teacher, parent, etc.  </li>
            <li> It is too wide to fit though a 22\\&quot; doorway (unless you remove the door.)</li>
            <li> Even though I only needed it for a month, it was worth every penney.</li>
            <li> You would&#x27;ve thought she got a new Cadillac.  </li>
            <li> and she is going to use her new Wheelchair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting some new arm muscles though.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have a new respect for people permanently in wheelchairs.</li>
            <li> My mother had just returned from Florida to New York.</li>
            <li> I realize that it is not the most expensive unit available but is quite sufficient for our needs.</li>
            <li> if so i&#x27;ll add to my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ITEM 2 to know:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not very strong in terms of unfolding, and have found that sometimes  it doesnt want to open all the way in terms of seat width very easily.  </li>
            <li> The funny thing that happen when we brought this wheelchair to her it turned out to be the same model that she had from the hospital</li>
            <li> Wow..!</li>
            <li> , narrow enough to turn tight corners, wide enough to be comfortable, and very lightweight, make it super easy to get it into the car for trips to the grocery store (remember to lock those wheels before lifting into the trunk!).  </li>
            <li> If you are buying this for a temporary use, as in a broken leg, it&#x27;s probably fine and economical.</li>
            <li> We have had no problems so far with this wheelchair.</li>
            <li> No worries about safety issues so far.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old son transports the chair for me without difficulty.</li>
            <li> Thanks to all who jumped to make this happen in only one&lt;br /&gt;day.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 90 year old</li>
            <li> Price is much lower than my mother&#x27;s last chair</li>
            <li> She has been on a Knee Scooter but that  is very difficlut when going out in public and is extremly</li>
            <li> how hot depended on how long used.  </li>
            <li> We didnt read the manual but it probably says to lubricate the wheels when you get it, they squeaked a bit but a shot of wd40 fixed that.  </li>
            <li> , i&#x27;d absolutely recommend this to a friend or relative.  </li>
            <li> &quot; may be good for outdoor use but slide all over the linoleum, rendering the chair useless.</li>
            <li> We tried to send it b ack but didn&#x27;t want to put out the $90 it would take to mail it back, so it is here, we would like to get one that works, but right now we have this investment and don&#x27;t feel I want a second chair around even it that one doesn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li> Anyway, they both found it very easy to use even though they were both fairly weak when they used it.</li>
            <li> Its light enough without the legs that I can lift it.(i&#x27;m a middle aged normal sized woman) and the legs go separately when its folded anyway.  </li>
            <li> Now needing to buy another chair, will not buy on the net this time, will buy local to see it first.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to manipulate on flat surface but hard on any type carpet.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for short term needs.</li>
            <li> However, the left arm doesn&#x27;t fit right and is very hard to take in and out.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted faster than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Seconds later JDS Supplies Customer Service apologized and promised a new chair.</li>
            <li> Mom passed away in April, soon after Dad became ill and found himself using that same wheel chair, this time around he loved it.      </li>
            <li> This is generally a well put together chair.</li>
            <li> Now we are prepared for the next emergency which will, hopefully, be in the far distance.</li>
            <li> My 5&#x27;1\\&quot; partner has no trouble loading it into the back of the SUV.  </li>
            <li> Full sized wheelchair that isn&#x27;t as heavy as regular wheelchairs.  </li>
            <li> The only problem we are having is that the rubber on the wheels is apparently disintegrating.</li>
            <li> It is PRETTY HEAVY, even without box and foot pads.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that the left wheel slips sometimes starting off from a stationary position, not gripping like the right</li>
            <li> She plans on having surgery on her other foot early next year.</li>
            <li> Construction was very solid and would last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I know hospital wheelchairs have to or should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I think this chair should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Unless it&#x27;s totally flat like in an airport or mall.</li>
            <li> cant speak to how long it will last from experience, but during the couple of months I have had it</li>
            <li> Bought this for my  daughter when she was ill, we used it for 4 months with no problem, easy to travel with</li>
            <li> She could not keep the wheelchair she had from the hospital for long term use.</li>
            <li> The chairs we have with the grey rubber never did this.</li>
            <li> But for long term use I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> After only a month of use, it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to remove the left arm</li>
            <li> Also this chair cost eighty dollars less than the price of a much lesser quality chair at the local discount store.</li>
            <li> The back of the wheelchair needed assembled to the seat before using; whereas, other wheelchairs arrive all one piece.</li>
            <li> No biggie as long as no one tries to stand up on them.  </li>
            <li> It has been my experience with prior wheelchairs that the black wears off from being transported in the car trunk.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is attach both leg and foot rest platform and attach the back handle and tight it up and Hex wrench is provided..</li>
            <li> I thought I lived in a flat area, but the slightest incline is a workout and a half.</li>
            <li> &quot; wide and</li>
            <li> Seller seemed to feel it was what I was using to wash the floor, which is just *wet jet</li>
            <li> That is not much of a problem.  </li>
            <li> Only problem is that it can&#x27;t get through some of the narrow doorways in my home, but I use crutches at those points.  </li>
            <li> I ordered for a family member and they could not even drag the box into the house.  </li>
            <li> This wheelchair is as I expected.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had the chair 2 months and it sheds rubber daily on the floor, leaves black marks and actual small pieces of the wheels.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping it to use when I have my other foot done.</li>
            <li> READ CAREFULLY WHAT YOU ARE BUYING!</li>
            <li> I was once very heavy temporarily and at that time, other wheelchairs this size were very uncomfortable because my behind didnt fit well and the friction from the wheels against the sides made hot spots.  </li>
            <li> As I don&#x27;t have a long term injury, I&#x27;m not able to advise for longevity of this product.</li>
            <li> I know hopitals buy in bulk and that keeps their cost down</li>
            <li> But when you are using it the seat adjusts anyway, so just sit down</li>
            <li> Considering putting black rubber electrical tape on the tires...don&#x27;t know what else to do.  </li>
            <li> What arrived was an Invacare with all of the features, except that the metal is a mottled-gray and the handwheels are painted black.</li>
            <li> With wheelchair closed, my wife can hardly lift it, so can not put it into a car trunk.    </li>
            <li> I still had trouble loading it in my trunk though.  </li>
            <li> The correct chair arrived in a few days followed by an email with \\&quot;return label\\&quot; attachment for the Transport Chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not easy to pick up and put in car.</li>
            <li> I HAVE rolled myself accross grass and its not easy</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether the seller shipped me the correct one.    </li>
            <li> Overall it took a couple of weeks to get a working wheelchair and mom (age &#x3D; 93) was unable to leave her apartment during this period.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Wheelchair for my wife due to a broken foot (3 time in 4 years).  </li>
            <li> , we just shot dirty looks in his general direction.  </li>
            <li> gotta say as a novice, self-propelled wheelchairing is HARD.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too late to return it.  </li>
            <li> It was less expensive than renting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My wife had foot surgery and is not good with crutches.  </li>
            <li> Arms are very hard to get in and out of the frame.</li>
            <li> However, the wheel chair came with broken parts.</li>
            <li> When we contacted the company, they seemingly felt that there was no hurry to replace the broken parts.</li>
            <li> I bought this chair for my Mom when she became too ill to walk.  </li>
            <li> The tires come to a point making it extremely difficult to manuvere over carpenting.  </li>
            <li> points for the wrong shipment.</li>
            <li> When they eventually sent them, they were the wrong parts.</li>
            <li> But worst of all, I was looking forward to elevating my leg while sitting but the bottom of the seat is so uncomfortable after sitting in it for about 20 min.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Arrived safe and sound....Thank you.  Full sized wheelchair that isn&#x27;t as heavy as regular wheelchairs.  Amazon service was excellent...arrived in timely fashion.</li>
            <li> My wife had foot surgery and is not good with crutches.  A walker is too tiring, so we bought the chair.  Leg/foot rests are detachable, which is a good feature.  The chair folds up nicely.  I only wish that it could lock in the folded position, which would make transport easier.  Overall, a very good chair at an affordable price.  She plans on having surgery on her other foot early next year.</li>
            <li> This is a great wheel chair.  I had one the hospital gave me after my accident, but had to return it when I got back to walking. I like having one on hand for when I go to the Mall or an event where I don&#x27;t know if I am going to have to stand for a while.  I used this recently for the first time and was thrilled.  It is fairly light weight, for a wheelchair. I still had trouble loading it in my trunk though.  It is comfortable and moves smoothly. It comes all in one piece except for the legs, which always need to be taken off/put on anyway. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product work out well for my mother in law. She could not keep the wheelchair she had from the hospital for long term use. When we ordered this chair we did not know the type she had. We just knew we needed something that would meet her needs and wanted good quality. We reviewed several and decided on this model. My mother in law was happy with the wheelchair she had but could not keep it. The funny thing that happen when we brought this wheelchair to her it turned out to be the same model that she had from the hospital but now she owns it. Wow..! that worked out well. To us this shows the quality of product that Amazon sells. I know hopitals buy in bulk and that keeps their cost down but I did not think I would pay a good price and get the same quality of a hopital Wheelchair. I know hospital wheelchairs have to or should last a long time. I tested the chair and found that it is very durable. I think this chair should last a long time. Thanks!! Amazon for good Quality and a good price..</li>
            <li> I bought this chair for my Mom when she became too ill to walk.  She was so excited when it arrived, she was mobile again!  You would&#x27;ve thought she got a new Cadillac.  While she used it, she loved it, she found it easy to maneuver.  Dad pooh-pooh&#x27;d the whole idea of a wheel chair, we just shot dirty looks in his general direction.  Mom passed away in April, soon after Dad became ill and found himself using that same wheel chair, this time around he loved it.      We lost Dad in August, I guess after 61 wonderful years together, he just had to be with her.  Anyway, they both found it very easy to use even though they were both fairly weak when they used it. It fits through most doorways and is pretty lightweight.  The legs come off and it leaves just the foot rests, the arms come off as well.  Its very easy to close and pack up into a vehicle.  All in all, this was probably the best purchase I ever made.  It made them feel safe and gave them freedom.</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether the seller shipped me the correct one.    But I ordered yesterday with one-day shipping, and got it now.   It is PRETTY HEAVY, even without box and foot pads.  It is a Derby branded, but without any model information.    With wheelchair closed, my wife can hardly lift it, so can not put it into a car trunk.    I don&#x27;t have a way to measure the weight, but looks like over 36LB as it indicated.  Not a lightweight one.  [UPDATE]: weight it, it is 39.5lb if not 40lb.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wheelchair before my surgery and it has been wonderful. It is a great value.  So easy to use.  I would highly recommend it for someone wanting a light weight chair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this chair for one of our high schools for use in the event of an injury or emergency involving a student, teacher, parent, etc.  The District Nurse and Safety Officer say it&#x27;s everything they need.  An excellent product at a very fair, resonable price.</li>
            <li> We have had no problems so far with this wheelchair. it is well made comfy and sturdy. No worries about safety issues so far. it is very easy to operate also.</li>
            <li> The wheelchair is as described.  Very lightweight and asy to manage. My mother is very happy to have the security offered by the chair.</li>
            <li> This chair is a fantastic value.  Good construction, easy to move, folds easily, and is light enough to load in a trunk for transportation.  I had looked at others but the pricing was out of range.  The only thing I see that might be a problem is that the foot rests are plastic.  No biggie as long as no one tries to stand up on them.  The bars are all metal, it is just the foot plate that is plastic.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it for an emergency for my husband.  Last week we needed one to get him out to the car to go to the hospital and we didn&#x27;t have one.  Now we are prepared for the next emergency which will, hopefully, be in the far distance.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this wheelchair to everyone.  It is pre-assemble already. All you have to do is attach both leg and foot rest platform and attach the back handle and tight it up and Hex wrench is provided.. Very easy as 1-2-3 and you do not need an instruction.  I bought this wheelchair for my mom to replace her 16\\&quot; wide and this 18\\&quot; wide is perfect. She is not going to have problem to get thru doors.  And the price is cheap and the quality is very good.  Tomorrow, we are going to take her to her Doctor for a periodical check-up and she is going to use her new Wheelchair. Roland D.

            <li> The legs come off easily and it fits in the trunk of a Honda Civic.  I would definitely not consider this lightweight However. It is a smooth roller.</li>
            <li> I broke my leg, I work in an office and what a relief to have something affordable and I chose Amazon Prime and got it right away.  It&#x27;s served it&#x27;s purpose and was very similar to the ones in the hospitals and medical centers for visitors to use. It folds up and the arms and legs are simple to put on and off.  There is a height adjustment, but I didn&#x27;t try to change it, the chair being of a comfortable height already.  The only thing is that the left wheel slips sometimes starting off from a stationary position, not gripping like the right, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just an adjustment thing or anything (could possibly be that I am only using the left leg support), but it doesn&#x27;t interfere with it&#x27;s useage.  The chair also has brakes, which is nice to get in and out of so that the chair doesn&#x27;t roll away.  Even though I only needed it for a month, it was worth every penney. It&#x27;s not an extremely comfortable chair and sitting in it hurts my back after a while, but the same is true for all wheel chairs - they do sell cushions for them.  I am five feet two inches tall and weigh in the 140&#x27;s - there is plenty of room in the seat and a bigger person would fit just fine. My 14 year old son transports the chair for me without difficulty.</li>
            <li> This is generally a well put together chair. It&#x27;s lightweight, sturdy and easy to transport.  The only problem we are having is that the rubber on the wheels is apparently disintegrating. We&#x27;ve had the chair 2 months and it sheds rubber daily on the floor, leaves black marks and actual small pieces of the wheels.  Seller seemed to feel it was what I was using to wash the floor, which is just *wet jet*. Unsure if the tiny amount of chemicals it might leave on the floor would do that, but will rinse with water. It has not left the house, and has only been on linoleum. The chairs we have with the grey rubber never did this. Considering putting black rubber electrical tape on the tires...don&#x27;t know what else to do.  Back to edit after 7 months. Never put tape on the wheels. \\&quot;Tires\\&quot; may be good for outdoor use but slide all over the linoleum, rendering the chair useless. Mom gets stuck in one place. Arms are very hard to get in and out of the frame. Had to take a hammer to it last night to be able to transfer her to bed, and now I&#x27;m just done with this chair.  If you are buying this for a temporary use, as in a broken leg, it&#x27;s probably fine and economical. But for long term use I&#x27;d look elsewhere. Now needing to buy another chair, will not buy on the net this time, will buy local to see it first.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted faster than I expected.  Great chair.  Thanks to all who jumped to make this happen in only one&lt;br /&gt;day. This was truly great customer service. The chair had the wheels attached and it came in one box.</li>
            <li> Wheelchair is comfortable with cushions. It is not easy to pick up and put in car. It is heavier than you think. The handles on the back used to push do not stay tight.&lt;br /&gt;Overall for the price it is a good chair.</li>
            <li> Seems that every time I&#x27;ve looked at this item on Amazon, the picture, brand, and seller change. When I ordered &amp;#34;it&amp;#34;, the brand was MDS and the seller ORBS. The picture showed the features I wanted: lightweight, desk-length arms, elevated leg rests, chrome handwheels. What arrived was an Invacare with all of the features, except that the metal is a mottled-gray and the handwheels are painted black. It has been my experience with prior wheelchairs that the black wears off from being transported in the car trunk. Because of the low price and free shipping, I opted to keep the chair. If you purchase this product, be advised that it might not be exactly what is shown. As far as the Invacare chair that I received, it is well-made and it was easy to reset the wheels for use by a short person.</li>
            <li> I purchased this wheelchair before my recent foot reconstructive surgery. Since I am in school administration, I&#x27;m on my feet a lot.  This enabled me to return to school and stay off my foot and get around my two story school easily.  It was comfortable to sit in and easy to roll around. The leg/foot adjustment is easy to operate. Construction was very solid and would last a long time.  I&#x27;m keeping it to use when I have my other foot done.</li>
            <li> This chair was advertized as a lightweight though it weighed as much as the chair we were borrowing. It is very easy to manipulate on flat surface but hard on any type carpet. the hand wheel needs texture to allow for more traction when moving them. Comfortable sitting.</li>
            <li> Thye lightweight weelchair received meet the expectations. It is light and is easy to assamble and to use. We are happy with the delivery and the equipment received</li>
            <li> I received my new wheelchair the other day, it was easy to put together, and very comfortable to sit in, I also ordered a seat pillow, it&#x27;s comfortable without it though. Thank you so much for this.</li>
            <li> This chair does NOT meet expectations.  The right foot bracket doesnt lock into place causing it to swing.  The tires come to a point making it extremely difficult to manuvere over carpenting.  We tried to send it b ack but didn&#x27;t want to put out the $90 it would take to mail it back, so it is here, we would like to get one that works, but right now we have this investment and don&#x27;t feel I want a second chair around even it that one doesn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipper.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Happy with this purchase.  Will be put to much use.  I give this a high rating because it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Recovering from a very severe knee injury, I purchased this wheelchair enabling me to get around comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;Not being able to put any weight on the injured leg for more than 2 months it allowed me to move in the house and outside comfortably. The leg attachment let me keep my leg elevated and supported.</li>
            <li> The picture looks like it&#x27;s a leather chair, but it&#x27;s made of canvas.  That is not much of a problem.  However, the left arm doesn&#x27;t fit right and is very hard to take in and out.  After only a month of use, it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to remove the left arm and it&#x27;s too late to return it.  I need to remove the left arm to get into the passenger seat of a car.</li>
            <li> The wheelchair arrived in a semi-damaged box but the contents were fine. The back of the wheelchair needed assembled to the seat before using; whereas, other wheelchairs arrive all one piece. It is too wide to fit though a 22\\&quot; doorway (unless you remove the door.) But worst of all, I was looking forward to elevating my leg while sitting but the bottom of the seat is so uncomfortable after sitting in it for about 20 min., I had to change chairs.</li>
            <li> Excellent value! Nice and sturdy, and very easy to handle due to its light weight. I bought it for my 90 year old, 5&#x27;10\\&quot; Father and it fits him perfectly. Love the removable arm feature. And, it arrived the very next day after I ordered it online. No shipping costs!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who is having some issues with her back.  She loves this chair.  It is comfortable and easy to transport which enables her to get out and about.</li>
            <li> best wheel chair i have ever had,  would not trade or give up  for any other chair i have tried out</li>
            <li> I thought this wheelchair would be lightweight, but I couldn&#x27;t lift it so I had to send it back and it cost alot to do so.</li>
            <li> Needed this in a hurry when I broke my foot and was in a cast that I couldn&#x27;t walk on.  It is exactly as described and works well.  My 5&#x27;1\\&quot; partner has no trouble loading it into the back of the SUV.  Just take off the leg sections, which is easy to do, and fold it up.  Only problem is that it can&#x27;t get through some of the narrow doorways in my home, but I use crutches at those points.  This chair is doing the trick for me.</li>
            <li> Nice wheelchair simple to put together. The instructions could be better only problem is the back support on the right side could tighten but its ok&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping nicely packaged&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD FOR SURE RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO BE BOUGHT</li>
            <li> Bought this for my  daughter when she was ill, we used it for 4 months with no problem, easy to travel with</li>
            <li> I ordered this wheelchair at five o&#x27;clock on Wednesday at five PM and found it on my front porch at three o&#x27;clock on Friday. You can&#x27;t get any better than that! The chair itself is a quite good quality chair. The fabric is a nylon canvas type material. I think this will be much more durable than the more common vinyl.  Price is much lower than my mother&#x27;s last chair and I believe this one is higher quality. The reason I gave this chair and company five stars is because there was no provision to give them six!&lt;br /&gt;  Also this chair cost eighty dollars less than the price of a much lesser quality chair at the local discount store.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Wheelchair for my wife due to a broken foot (3 time in 4 years).  She has been on a Knee Scooter but that  is very difficlut when going out in public and is extremly tireing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We expect to use this in place of the Knee Scooter when it is necessary to be out for any length of time.  It is often difficlut to locate a wheelchair is large department stores in close proximity to the Handicapped locat ions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will make it much easier to navigate the stores etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that this wheelchair fully meets my expectations and appears to be well made.  I realize that it is not the most expensive unit available but is quite sufficient for our needs.</li>
            <li> This is a well-constructed wheelchair and a good value for the money.  It is NOT, however, adjustable for height as advertised.  I bought it for my wife with the ides of using it at its lower seat height, but found out very quickly that it was not height adjustable.  I gave it away to a local nursing home and they were very happy with it.  Do NOT buy this chair if you need the lower seat height.</li>
            <li> This wheelchair was represented as being lightweight, but with no weight listed.  I ordered for a family member and they could not even drag the box into the house.  It weighs 52 pounds.  It is not convenient for transport.  Only good for remaining at facility, household, etc., but not in and out of vehicles.</li>
            <li> I needed this for a while after knee surgery. It was less expensive than renting.&lt;br /&gt;I gotta say as a novice, self-propelled wheelchairing is HARD. Unless it&#x27;s totally flat like in an airport or mall. I thought I lived in a flat area, but the slightest incline is a workout and a half. I&#x27;m getting some new arm muscles though.&lt;br /&gt;The legs adjust and come off very easily. Arms detach too. It comes assembled.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, finally, you really need a good pair of wheelchair gloves.&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased with this. Folds up easily. I wouldn&#x27;t call it light, but manageable.  If I need it again I&#x27;ll add a cup or bottle holder.&lt;br /&gt;I have a new respect for people permanently in wheelchairs.</li>
            <li> Had difficulties with this company but they finally made good.  Picture should be changed.  It looks like legs go up but they don&#x27;t.  I sent the chair back with difficulties, however; everything was finally resolved. I am grateful that they finally followed through.  READ CAREFULLY WHAT YOU ARE BUYING!</li>
            <li> Ordered it for the price, its 18\\&quot; width, the removable Desk Length Arms, Removable Foot Rest and most of all, the vynle seat for using in the shower/pools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon a \\&quot;Transport Chair\\&quot; arrived to the organization I donate it to. Unfortunately it&#x27;s not what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reported it on-line to Amazon.com. Seconds later JDS Supplies Customer Service apologized and promised a new chair. The correct chair arrived in a few days followed by an email with \\&quot;return label\\&quot; attachment for the Transport Chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 points for the fast shippings, good Customer Services, good quality and good price.&lt;br /&gt;3 points for the wrong shipment. Reluctant to order it again. Simply too much work with too many people involved.</li>
            <li> After my son broke his leg, we needed to get a wheelchair for him to get around school and places we went that using crutches just didn&#x27;t make sense. We looked into renting, and needed something for about 5 or 6 weeks. After comparing prices, it was cheaper to purchase this chair. We received it virtually the next day and it was wonderful for the full 5 weeks he used it!  Could not be happier with it. Will have it now for any friends or family that need it in the future!</li>
            <li> Compared to what it would cost to rent, this was an amazing value. Works great, narrow enough to turn tight corners, wide enough to be comfortable, and very lightweight, make it super easy to get it into the car for trips to the grocery store (remember to lock those wheels before lifting into the trunk!).  Highly recommended for short term needs. As I don&#x27;t have a long term injury, I&#x27;m not able to advise for longevity of this product.</li>
            <li> This chair is very comfortable--I ought to know, as I have to sit in it many hours a day. The legs are simple to raise or lower, according to my needs. The arms take just a few seconds to detach, which is great for a musician who needs that space to hold an instrument. We noticed that this brand is the same one they carry at the big name hospital where I&#x27;m getting treatment.</li>
            <li> My mother had just returned from Florida to New York. We had ordered the wheel chair for her arrival. However, the wheel chair came with broken parts. Since there were essentially no instructions on putting it together, it took a while to figure that out. When we contacted the company, they seemingly felt that there was no hurry to replace the broken parts. When they eventually sent them, they were the wrong parts. So, we they had to call them again. Overall it took a couple of weeks to get a working wheelchair and mom (age &#x3D; 93) was unable to leave her apartment during this period.</li>
            <li> I received the wheelchair in 1 or 2 days. Amazing for right before Christmas. The chair is also far better quality than one I paid more than twice as much for at a local store. The legs elevate very high, which we needed; it came fully assembled except for legs which went on with no tools and the push handles which used an included Allen wrench. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> This was the perfect wheelchair for me.  Its light enough without the legs that I can lift it.(i&#x27;m a middle aged normal sized woman) and the legs go separately when its folded anyway.  It assembles easily,  it rolls easily.  its easy to roll myself around the house.  I HAVE rolled myself accross grass and its not easy but it never is.  this wheelchair tolerates bumps much better than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;way better deal than renting a wheelchair.  For me with several surgeries upcoming that limit my mobility, and some time pre surgery with limited, this was the best choice.  I have aging parents and there may come a time they need one even temporarily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with this purchase and with this vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A couple of items to know before you buy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This is great for a person under 6 foot and 200 lbs.  If you exceed either of those limits, depending on how you are shaped it may not be totally comfortable.  I&#x27;m not saying it wont work, up to the manufacturers limit, i dont even know what that is mind you.  I&#x27;m saying comfort may be an issue.  I was once very heavy temporarily and at that time, other wheelchairs this size were very uncomfortable because my behind didnt fit well and the friction from the wheels against the sides made hot spots.  how hot depended on how long used.  So I am neither recommending or not recommending it for big and tall people.  tall i dont know really, i&#x27;m just guessing that there is a good chance weight goes with it.  I may have a 230 6&#x27;2 friend test it out. if so i&#x27;ll add to my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ITEM 2 to know:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not very strong in terms of unfolding, and have found that sometimes  it doesnt want to open all the way in terms of seat width very easily.  But when you are using it the seat adjusts anyway, so just sit down and it will take care of the width on its own.  even start to sit down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish i had bought this mONTHS before I did.  it gave me so much more freedom than my walker.  My walker-rollator gave me so much more ease and freedom than a normal walker, one or even two canes, that it didnt occur to me i could get that much of an upgrade again.  But it did.  it didnt mark up my wood floors either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant speak to how long it will last from experience, but during the couple of months I have had it, I have found it to be well made and plenty sturdy enough for my needs.  I see zero indication that it would have a breakage issue.  We didnt read the manual but it probably says to lubricate the wheels when you get it, they squeaked a bit but a shot of wd40 fixed that.  I consider it smart of the manufacturer not to ship it overly lubricated and chance leaks.  So A plus in my book for quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;within the limits of my experience as mentioned above, i&#x27;d absolutely recommend this to a friend or relative.  And at the price its a ridiculously good deal.  It paid for itself vs renting one almost immediately, and i have it around for whoever needs it. its easy to store.  It arrived exactly when expected and with free shipping.. well.  walk do not run.  i&#x27;m also putting an accolade on the vendors site.</li>
            <li> This wheelchair is as I expected. Good for my use, which is rather infrequent, but is stable and durable enough for my needs.</li>
