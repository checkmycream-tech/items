            <li>This was the best investment I could have made on her behalf.</li>
            <li>This is the best solution I&#x27;ve found for dandruff.  </li>
            <li>The best thing for me to tell you is to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Best option for controlling dandruff, and as a face wash for seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>Its great to find something that doesn&#x27;t require a prescription!</li>
            <li>Perfect for my son&#x27;s dandruff.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect, works well!</li>
            <li>This is a great product!  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is wonderful!!  </li>
            <li>Amazing!!</li>
            <li>UPDATE got the KETAZON product from Thailand and it&#x27;s IDENTICAL to this for a very good price.</li>
            <li>ideal, I know, I&#x27;m hooked for life.</li>
            <li>Good Luck!</li>
            <li>I have great beautiful hair except that during season changes I get itchy and smelly scalp.  </li>
            <li>I use the Nizoral once every 3 days and look forward to using it each time - I feel as if my scalp can breath - very refreshing!</li>
            <li>Does a great job of preventing dandruff and can make hair feel/appear thicker.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, this is the best product on the market for people with seborrheic dermatitis (which is what I believe I have).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great product has always took care of my dandruff and NEVER caused any hair</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot even express how happy his daddy</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s also great for shampooing eyebrows and beards/mustaches if you have a problem with dandruff there as well.</li>
            <li>so I was happy to find it online.</li>
            <li>and I cannot believe how amazing my scalp and hair feel!</li>
            <li>This product is as good as it&#x27;s advertisements make it out to be.</li>
            <li>This is a good dandruff shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is really good</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading the good reviews here</li>
            <li>After eight months, it is still good, but I get flakes and itching every day.  </li>
            <li>A couple use coal tar or salycilic acid, which can be good for some conditions, but not what I have.  </li>
            <li>I used to use this shampoo for five years and I really loved it.</li>
            <li>and I searched a lot through the web and every where to find a good replacement.</li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>In summary, inexpensive, pleasant smelling,moisturizing, effective medication.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I use it in conjuction with my Paul Mitchell shampoo and conditioner and my hair and scalp look and feel amazing.  </li>
            <li>Happy to see this item is once again available.</li>
            <li>I was kind of amazed.</li>
            <li>For me, the absolute best treatment seems to be lathering with coal tar (T/Gel), rinsing, then using Nizoral.  </li>
            <li>I have been able to use it once every 2-3 days with good results.  </li>
            <li>I saw many good reviews about this product, but the truth is that it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a nice scent too.</li>
            <li>used to have some kind of scalp infection or something-- itchy sores and scabs--</li>
            <li>I did some research of my own and learned dandruff is sometimes caused by a fungus growth.  </li>
            <li>Result is good, my daughter&#x27;s flaky scalp is now much better.  </li>
            <li>They want me to write more words! :)</li>
            <li>I have used this for about nine months straight, and I have found it to be very, very good in helping rid me of dandruff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found Selenium Sulfide 1% to be the most effective in treating seborrhoeic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>Nizoral is the most effective shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>not too girlie or manly...just a perfect soft scent.</li>
            <li>has done the best, because my dandruff apparently is a reaction to the yeast/fungus that is on my skin to which I am allergic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve written a review there (albeit, it isn&#x27;t very detailed).</li>
            <li>Nice on hair, makes it shiny and easy to comb.  </li>
            <li>It is a really good product to remove dandruff when I first use it!   </li>
            <li>/&gt;It also helped my skin and agree with others that it makes a great cleanser for a whole assortment of issues, including dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been researching and trying many items.  </li>
            <li>We are back to washing her hair every two weeks and the added benefit of this shampoo is that it smells GREAT!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis and dandruff.</li>
            <li>Nizoral/Ketoconazole 1% are the best treatments (if the latter works for you).</li>
            <li>One of the better shampoo&#x27;s on the market.</li>
            <li>Its more pricey than others but works better</li>
            <li>Try it for a month you will love it.</li>
            <li>I Love using Nizoral.</li>
            <li>either be wealthy or have insurance</li>
            <li>I was glad to find it on line.</li>
            <li>I can wake up next to my g/f and not be embarassed that theres flakes all over the pillow, its great!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products but nothing works like this one.</li>
            <li>Just like many of you this product was a life saver.</li>
            <li>She would say, if you did drink more H20 you will not be living with this embarrasing problem.</li>
            <li>Weekly or bi-weekly at most.</li>
            <li>Nizoral keeps it suppressed better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t go away entirely, but I&#x27;m fairly impressed with the results.  </li>
            <li>Bought this shampoo as recommended by my dermatologists and love it</li>
            <li>This serves OK as a dandruff shampoo, but is way too pricey.  </li>
            <li>I noticed better results almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the difference is, but the Nizoral brand just works better.  </li>
            <li>I think I can see a bit more scalp</li>
            <li>It gives me a ton more confidence.&lt;br /&gt;MONTH 5: I may be hallucinating, but I think my hair starts to look fuller.</li>
            <li>I now use it for my thinning hair and I can see a bit more growth.</li>
            <li>, this stuff smell fabulous!</li>
            <li>This seller is ripping people off more than just about anything I have seen on Amazon.</li>
            <li>When it disappeared I&#x27;m sure they jacked up the price to prey on people who who don&#x27;t know any better.</li>
            <li>I was more than a bit frantic, then, when McNeill pulled it from the US retail market for over a year.</li>
            <li>Sure, with a doctor&#x27;s prescription you could get the 2% \\&quot;prescription strength\\&quot;, but it cost more.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite dandruff shampoo</li>
            <li>Works like a charm, and I&#x27;ve tried many others.  </li>
            <li>and if I used it more then twice a week I&#x27;d get rashes from</li>
            <li>Buy it, use it, you&#x27;ll love the results!&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve found out that many suggest Nizoral&#x27;s chemical makeup helps with hair loss...</li>
            <li>It also minimizes hair loss which is becoming more important as I age--sadly!  </li>
            <li>It started out great, nearly eliminating the flaking and itching.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the steep price if it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>The best part is there is no discomfort like with other soaps.</li>
            <li>not a bad plus!</li>
            <li>again, not a bad plus!</li>
            <li>I am currently 6 weeks in to these products and I am more than happy with the results.</li>
            <li>with all that said, I figured the strong psoriasis/dermatitis shampoos would work for my son too.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>and I had to go back to the stinky H&amp;S Clinical( I have to use a very strong pleasant fragrant conditioner just to over ride the yucky medicinal</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fine.      </li>
            <li>works fine for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li>It is popular because it is cheap and was the first widely available treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis.    </li>
            <li>stuck with the 2% Nizoral to this day and while I eventually go on Propecia and my hair was thinning a bit, this shampoo was essential in keeping my skin and hair looking great.</li>
            <li>Both did not appear to be effective (also, I did not notice much of difference between 1% and 2%).</li>
            <li>The two important DRAWBACKS are the price and the fact that, in my experience, it is ineffective in treating seborrhoeic dermatitis</li>
            <li>I recommend Selenium Sulfide 1% (sold as \\&quot;Selsun Blue\\&quot; or \\&quot;Head and Shoulders Intensive Treatment\\&quot; in the Dark-Blue bottle) because it is EFFECTIVE and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It works fantastic.</li>
            <li>Amazon sales two 7 oz for $21 with free shipping that was the lower price I could find.</li>
            <li>but I am so happy to say he finally is FLAKE FREE!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a dandruff problem since my teens and have tried just about everything available up to the point of discovering this product.</li>
            <li>Well, I can honestly say after 1.5 months of using this every 3-4 days, my hair is *almost* completely flake free!</li>
            <li>, I feel so much more confident just because I think the Nizoral is what really helped volumize my hair.</li>
            <li>I use this 3 times a week and so far so good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it is an excelllent product for dealing with persistant dandruff, it is also very useful for handling skin problems elsewhere on the body.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can pull on my hair like I did in my youth, and not end up with a fist full of fine hairs.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the cost!</li>
            <li>I was SO excited</li>
            <li>had to use it for about a month to take full effect but your hair always feels soft, manageable, and smell great; even on the first shampoo.</li>
            <li>I find this product by Nizoral for $43.I was happy that I made a good deal by they never actually deliver the product and after 3 weeks they gave back my money instead of Shampoo!</li>
            <li>, I bought this originally on amazon for $25...</li>
            <li>The best product I&#x27;ve used so far is Selsun Blue Naturals w/3%Salicylic Acid.</li>
            <li>It certainly worked better than anything else.</li>
            <li>Does anyone know for sure if this one from Amazon really works???</li>
            <li>This shampoo not only smells good, it works on dandruff.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Nizoral is by far the best single treatment for me.  </li>
            <li>Do NOT buy this product if your stubborn dandruff is the dry kind!</li>
            <li>Good for when my hair is long, not as good when it is short.</li>
            <li>It is not as mild as Nizoral/Ketoconazole</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t expect quick delivery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of the many, MANY dandruff shampoos I had tried, the only one that worked well for me was Nizoral.</li>
            <li>Luckily while browsing one day my wife came across the Nizoral Antidandruff shampoo on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shampoo but not worth this price.</li>
            <li>has gorgeous long silky blackened/brown hair.....</li>
            <li>It has worked great and every other day use does the trick!</li>
            <li>For now I can say &amp;#34;Selsun Blue Dandruff Shampoo - Medicated&amp;#34; worked also pretty good for me if you are looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li>You should be very clear so a customer can be sure as to what type [product you are selling.</li>
            <li>Is that because it competes too successfully against the other brands?</li>
            <li>Hoping that it is available everywhere very soon.</li>
            <li>After the first wash, I noticed my hair was full of color and shine.</li>
            <li>My dandruff is completely gone using this product from just couple of applications, way better</li>
            <li>Seems to do the job and is worth buying if you need it.</li>
            <li>oh and the smell and burning wasn&#x27;t fun either,,lol.</li>
            <li>worth the money for us.</li>
            <li>Works far better than the competition</li>
            <li>it worth every penny.</li>
            <li>But Nizoral has the best results, I&#x27;ve used numerous other shampoos and none of them had even temporary</li>
            <li>The BENEFITS of Nizoral/Ketoconazole is that it is relatively mild, can be used frequently, does not have a strong fragrance or odor, and does not affect the texture or quality of your hair.</li>
            <li>My scalp is itch free and the dandruff is completely GONE!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in New York, so you would think if anyone had it, it would be available here, but there seems to be none anywhere (I&#x27;ve tried 12+ pharmacies in 3 boroughs).  </li>
            <li>(it doesn&#x27;t appear to do anything more than a regular shampoo).    </li>
            <li>no (though the Troy Polamalu commercials are funny - even to a Browns fan)    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be interested to see what it does long-term</li>
            <li>It starts to work on the first use.</li>
            <li>(I think the prescription version still exits, it&#x27;s only like 1 or 2% more ketoconazole.)</li>
            <li>(you can buy the sulfur gel on here) and also VO5 hot oil treatments once a month.</li>
            <li>from the first week of using i felt the change.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>After coming to this realization and rapidly panicking over the fate of my ever-shinier forehead, I began researching ways to abate the march of baldness over my dome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Propecia, despite its effectiveness, required doctor&#x27;s office visits and involved possible sexual side effects.</li>
            <li>My first breakthrough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve resolved to using this product on my most affected dandruff spot only to continue to test until finished &amp; use a moisturizing milk shampoo on the rest of scalp.</li>
            <li>my hair is now more stronger and healthy and NO MORE Dandruff&lt;</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Have to use this shampoo every other day to make it effective.  </li>
            <li>For the most part my dandruff is either gone or so minor that it no longer shows.</li>
            <li>I am sure that after a few more weeks of using this product, my daughter will get complete relief.</li>
            <li>If it were any other site I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;d make the sellers conform to reasonable pricing or kick them off.</li>
            <li>Not only did the product have a light, pleasant scent, but it was also moisturizing and left hair feeling soft unlike aforementioned products.</li>
            <li>but it has given me so much relief.  </li>
            <li>When I use it I try to be very thorough.</li>
            <li>On the whole, perople&#x27;s experience are that Selenium Sulfide 1% and</li>
            <li>I had read the reviews on here, and I really didn&#x27;t have anything to lose (except flakes, hopefully).</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li>and it worked very well for me too.</li>
            <li>my scalp is really thanking me.  </li>
            <li>, it was something I was very selfconscious about and embarrassed.  </li>
            <li>(much cheaper)</li>
            <li>but it really works...</li>
            <li>(Per the CSR from Nizoral) and be available at your local resellers.</li>
            <li>That way I don&#x27;t need to use nearly as much Nizoral.</li>
            <li>really thought I was hallucinating, but these results were shown in a couple of clinical trials as well.</li>
            <li>Nizoral is a very versatile product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I eventually discovered UK sellers on Amazon offering the UK retail version (which is the 2% strength) at reasonable prices, and I have been using that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Me and my wife were very concerned and wanted to try out alternatives.</li>
            <li>If you have a scalp problem that just will not go away no matter what you&#x27;ve tried, you really need to try Nizoral.</li>
            <li>The only thing it was really good for, remotely, was for my scalp.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough, just shampoo every day as you normally would.</li>
            <li>In truth, the active ingredient in Nizoral was responsible which you can read more about throughout the net.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mix it in with other products safely</li>
            <li>It is better than any other dandruff shampoo out there.</li>
            <li>Like many others who like and used this product, I&#x27;m done, will look for other alternatives.</li>
            <li>Most dandruff shampoos on the US market use pyrithone zinc as the active ingredient.</li>
            <li>I do realize (unlike some people obviously) that a single product won&#x27;t work for everyone, but I recommend this highly if you&#x27;re still on your quest to a healthy scalp!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried almost everything out there so far and nothing worked, even tried the \\&quot;Home remedy\\&quot; vinegar, which at first helped but after awhile didn&#x27;t for some reason,</li>
            <li>I once ran out of it and quickly reverted back so called me hooked.  </li>
            <li>But at 15 bucks or more per bottle, it really was a waste of money and never did what it was designed to do.</li>
            <li>and I think Amazon has a decent price on it as well.</li>
            <li>The smell is decent and there is no burning,</li>
            <li>Our pediatrician recommended this shampoo for my teenage son after he had tried many of the regular dandruff shampoos with no relief.  </li>
            <li>I apply Nizoral to the main areas I want to manage and leave it on while I finish my shower.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest that you use conditioner after using this product.</li>
            <li>4 stars because the price is so high.</li>
            <li>why is it priced so high now?</li>
            <li>I have been able to find it pretty easily since the supply issue was resolved nearly a year ago, but am completely unable to find any in stores (Rite Aid, Duane Read, CVS, Walgreens etc.)</li>
            <li>I finally bought this after researching it on Amazon through reviews (Thanks Amazon!!).  </li>
            <li>I had to wait for new hair to grow and get a haircut to get the my original relatively soft hair hair back.    </li>
            <li>This is truly amazing since I could wash her hair on a Sunday and by Tuesday she had thick patches and severe itching.  </li>
            <li>Being a guy though, I rarely go to the doctor, and really how many guys would go to the doctor to talk about such a small problem.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s had dandruff as long as I can remember and we have tried many different shampoos.  </li>
            <li>You can type \\&quot;Seborrheic Dermatitis Versus Psoriasis\\&quot; into Google to read the difference between the two (Quickly: scalp psoriasis is the less-common, more-painful condition; its scales often have minor bleeding when scarped off manually).</li>
            <li>In general Nizoral AntiDandruff shows positive effects after two days use.</li>
            <li>I normally use it every 2-3 days, but anytime I get itchy more often (usually the result of working out or anything that makes me sweat)</li>
            <li>Actually, I have only used the 2% version of this product, also available here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Why would a shampoo for dandruff use sulphate as  ingredient that&#x27;s known to make scalp super dry??... causing dandruff?</li>
            <li>I have no idea why it went away, but the product is exactly the same:</li>
            <li>when I bought it the first time last fall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been receiving comments from people left and right about how much hair I&#x27;ve lost in the last 2 years.</li>
            <li>After using it every day for probably 2 weeks or so, I can make do with using this 2-3 times per week and then using a regular shampoo on the other days, but it is a nice enough product that you can use every day if you can afford it.</li>
            <li>He told me that before he would write me a prescription, I needed to clear up some dandruff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I now have been acne clear for almost a year.</li>
            <li>After two weeks my scalp is clear, no flakes, no itching,</li>
            <li>After nearly 20 years of dandruff, I found Nizoral after reading about it on Reddit.  </li>
            <li>Changed my pillow case frequently</li>
            <li>I therefore can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness, but I wanted to alert others who may be sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit spendy, but completely controlls flaking.  </li>
            <li>However, if you are washing your hair once every three days it takes about four weeks to completely get rid of the flakes.</li>
            <li>After just two weeks, my problems were completely gone.</li>
            <li>I am an HR professional</li>
            <li>This is the only one that really controls itching and flaking.  </li>
            <li>Old times with prescriptions.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely the only thing that worked for my husband.  </li>
            <li>read from Wikipedia the following: \\&quot;Although ketoconazole may be useful as a hair loss treatment, the shampoo is currently only FDA-approved for the treatment of dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp\\&quot;</li>
            <li>To whomever the price gouger is--this is available for a third the price from stocks made in Belgium and sold in the U.S. from other online retailers.  </li>
            <li>I used it every time I showered for a week or so, and now I use it maybe once a week using regular cheap shampoo every other time.</li>
            <li>The price of this stuff here on Amazon also confirms that something is amiss: if people would readily find this at local stiores for its usual price ($12-16), sellers would never be able to charge $22-25 plus shipping for the same product on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I am fairly certain that the new product is identical to this one, my guess is they had found some side effects that made it necessary to reformulate it and release it in different packaging.</li>
            <li>No other shampoos seem to relieve the itching or clear up the patches.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t itch with Nizoral but did with pretty much any other regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Once a week seems to be about right, but every other week might work too.</li>
            <li>I can let it get as greasy as I want with no other unpleasantness!</li>
            <li>This kept my hair dandruff free for no more then 8 hours at a time...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this product is suddenly off the shelves at every store in town, but I was relieved to find it on-line, as it is the only treatment for seb-derm I have ever found that is in the least effective.</li>
            <li>Cant wait for this product to go back to normal production</li>
            <li>My hair is grown out, I&#x27;m never annoyed by that itch on the back of my head just above the hair line and where that swirly thing is.  </li>
            <li>I actually PRAYED for something to give me much needed relief from the constant flaking &amp; itching.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t necessarily look fuller, but at least I don&#x27;t see more scalp each morning in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;MONTH 4</li>
            <li>I have tried all the major dandruff shampoo cures:  pyrithione zinc (Head and Shoulders), coal tar (T/gel), salicilic acid (Dermarest) and ketoconazole (Nizoral).  </li>
            <li>beats all other shampoo for treating  dandruff....cost a little more  </li>
            <li>followed the directions and used it frequently at first to get rid of the dandruff/yeast, and tapered off to using it about once a week, between my other shampoos.</li>
            <li>I have had an itcy/flaky scalp my entire adult life.  </li>
            <li>I used Nizoral for over 15 years, from my teen years up until my early 30s.  </li>
            <li>Modern day Costanza I felt like (not really that bad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have make a weekly trip to my beautician, only to have my scalp revert to its normal consistancy 3 to 4 days later (flakey and</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;ve lost hair in the front now, and the back is starting to get better slowly</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks of use about every 3 days, it became less effective, with flaking and itching starting in the afternoon -- but the flakes were smaller and the itching less intense than with other shampoos.  </li>
            <li>The only way I can actually verify this is to read both labels, so when I do buy the new product I&#x27;ll try to post the result.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mine was particularly bad in a inch and a half diameter area at the crown of my head, just the perfect place to scratch and spread it.</li>
            <li>so I just decided that I must have had some fungul issue or something other than real hairloss.</li>
            <li>The active ingredient is an antifungal compound so those of you saying it works have a fungal infection on your scalp (really).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 25 years old, and in the last year I&#x27;ve increasingly started getting 2 bald spots, one in the back, and one in the front(middle).</li>
            <li>/&gt;He used it almost daily at first and now he is down to 2 times a week to control</li>
            <li>First, let me start off by giving a little background.</li>
            <li>I had a major problem several months ago with seborreic dermatitis in my scalp...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this in the past for about $20-25 for two 7-ounce bottles, but it seems to go out of stock or become rare and the price shoots up to around $60-80 for two bottles, which is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price was a little expensive but it is a hard to find item right now, the shipping was quick and I was pleased with my product.</li>
            <li>bottle might seem small, but you only need a tiny amount to shampoo your hair, and since you only use it once a week after the first month, it really goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Its been very hard to fine Nizoral in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>Frequent washes will cause the hair to become brittle, breakf off, and dry out.</li>

            <li> ideal, I know, I&#x27;m hooked for life.</li>
            <li> Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I have great beautiful hair except that during season changes I get itchy and smelly scalp.  </li>
            <li> I use the Nizoral once every 3 days and look forward to using it each time - I feel as if my scalp can breath - very refreshing!</li>
            <li> Does a great job of preventing dandruff and can make hair feel/appear thicker.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, this is the best product on the market for people with seborrheic dermatitis (which is what I believe I have).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great product has always took care of my dandruff and NEVER caused any hair</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot even express how happy his daddy</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s also great for shampooing eyebrows and beards/mustaches if you have a problem with dandruff there as well.</li>
            <li> so I was happy to find it online.</li>
            <li> and I cannot believe how amazing my scalp and hair feel!</li>
            <li> This product is as good as it&#x27;s advertisements make it out to be.</li>
            <li> This is a good dandruff shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is really good</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the good reviews here</li>
            <li> After eight months, it is still good, but I get flakes and itching every day.  </li>
            <li> A couple use coal tar or salycilic acid, which can be good for some conditions, but not what I have.  </li>
            <li> I used to use this shampoo for five years and I really loved it.</li>
            <li> and I searched a lot through the web and every where to find a good replacement.</li>
            <li> Smells good too.</li>
            <li> In summary, inexpensive, pleasant smelling,moisturizing, effective medication.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I use it in conjuction with my Paul Mitchell shampoo and conditioner and my hair and scalp look and feel amazing.  </li>
            <li> Happy to see this item is once again available.</li>
            <li> I was kind of amazed.</li>
            <li> For me, the absolute best treatment seems to be lathering with coal tar (T/Gel), rinsing, then using Nizoral.  </li>
            <li> I have been able to use it once every 2-3 days with good results.  </li>
            <li> I saw many good reviews about this product, but the truth is that it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice scent too.</li>
            <li> used to have some kind of scalp infection or something-- itchy sores and scabs--</li>
            <li> I did some research of my own and learned dandruff is sometimes caused by a fungus growth.  </li>
            <li> Result is good, my daughter&#x27;s flaky scalp is now much better.  </li>
            <li> They want me to write more words! :)</li>
            <li> I have used this for about nine months straight, and I have found it to be very, very good in helping rid me of dandruff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found Selenium Sulfide 1% to be the most effective in treating seborrhoeic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> Nizoral is the most effective shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> not too girlie or manly...just a perfect soft scent.</li>
            <li> has done the best, because my dandruff apparently is a reaction to the yeast/fungus that is on my skin to which I am allergic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve written a review there (albeit, it isn&#x27;t very detailed).</li>
            <li> Nice on hair, makes it shiny and easy to comb.  </li>
            <li> It is a really good product to remove dandruff when I first use it!   </li>
            <li> /&gt;It also helped my skin and agree with others that it makes a great cleanser for a whole assortment of issues, including dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been researching and trying many items.  </li>
            <li> We are back to washing her hair every two weeks and the added benefit of this shampoo is that it smells GREAT!  </li>
            <li> I have tried many treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis and dandruff.</li>
            <li> Nizoral/Ketoconazole 1% are the best treatments (if the latter works for you).</li>
            <li> One of the better shampoo&#x27;s on the market.</li>
            <li> Its more pricey than others but works better</li>
            <li> Try it for a month you will love it.</li>
            <li> I Love using Nizoral.</li>
            <li> either be wealthy or have insurance</li>
            <li> I was glad to find it on line.</li>
            <li> I can wake up next to my g/f and not be embarassed that theres flakes all over the pillow, its great!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products but nothing works like this one.</li>
            <li> Just like many of you this product was a life saver.</li>
            <li> She would say, if you did drink more H20 you will not be living with this embarrasing problem.</li>
            <li> Weekly or bi-weekly at most.</li>
            <li> Nizoral keeps it suppressed better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t go away entirely, but I&#x27;m fairly impressed with the results.  </li>
            <li> Bought this shampoo as recommended by my dermatologists and love it</li>
            <li> This serves OK as a dandruff shampoo, but is way too pricey.  </li>
            <li> I noticed better results almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the difference is, but the Nizoral brand just works better.  </li>
            <li> I think I can see a bit more scalp</li>
            <li> It gives me a ton more confidence.&lt;br /&gt;MONTH 5: I may be hallucinating, but I think my hair starts to look fuller.</li>
            <li> I now use it for my thinning hair and I can see a bit more growth.</li>
            <li> , this stuff smell fabulous!</li>
            <li> This seller is ripping people off more than just about anything I have seen on Amazon.</li>
            <li> When it disappeared I&#x27;m sure they jacked up the price to prey on people who who don&#x27;t know any better.</li>
            <li> I was more than a bit frantic, then, when McNeill pulled it from the US retail market for over a year.</li>
            <li> Sure, with a doctor&#x27;s prescription you could get the 2% \\&quot;prescription strength\\&quot;, but it cost more.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite dandruff shampoo</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, and I&#x27;ve tried many others.  </li>
            <li> and if I used it more then twice a week I&#x27;d get rashes from</li>
            <li> Buy it, use it, you&#x27;ll love the results!&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve found out that many suggest Nizoral&#x27;s chemical makeup helps with hair loss...</li>
            <li> It also minimizes hair loss which is becoming more important as I age--sadly!  </li>
            <li> It started out great, nearly eliminating the flaking and itching.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the steep price if it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> The best part is there is no discomfort like with other soaps.</li>
            <li> not a bad plus!</li>
            <li> again, not a bad plus!</li>
            <li> I am currently 6 weeks in to these products and I am more than happy with the results.</li>
            <li> with all that said, I figured the strong psoriasis/dermatitis shampoos would work for my son too.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> and I had to go back to the stinky H&amp;S Clinical( I have to use a very strong pleasant fragrant conditioner just to over ride the yucky medicinal</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m fine.      </li>
            <li> works fine for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> It is popular because it is cheap and was the first widely available treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis.    </li>
            <li> stuck with the 2% Nizoral to this day and while I eventually go on Propecia and my hair was thinning a bit, this shampoo was essential in keeping my skin and hair looking great.</li>
            <li> Both did not appear to be effective (also, I did not notice much of difference between 1% and 2%).</li>
            <li> The two important DRAWBACKS are the price and the fact that, in my experience, it is ineffective in treating seborrhoeic dermatitis</li>
            <li> I recommend Selenium Sulfide 1% (sold as \\&quot;Selsun Blue\\&quot; or \\&quot;Head and Shoulders Intensive Treatment\\&quot; in the Dark-Blue bottle) because it is EFFECTIVE and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It works fantastic.</li>
            <li> Amazon sales two 7 oz for $21 with free shipping that was the lower price I could find.</li>
            <li> but I am so happy to say he finally is FLAKE FREE!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a dandruff problem since my teens and have tried just about everything available up to the point of discovering this product.</li>
            <li> Well, I can honestly say after 1.5 months of using this every 3-4 days, my hair is *almost* completely flake free!</li>
            <li> , I feel so much more confident just because I think the Nizoral is what really helped volumize my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this 3 times a week and so far so good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it is an excelllent product for dealing with persistant dandruff, it is also very useful for handling skin problems elsewhere on the body.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can pull on my hair like I did in my youth, and not end up with a fist full of fine hairs.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> I was SO excited</li>
            <li> had to use it for about a month to take full effect but your hair always feels soft, manageable, and smell great; even on the first shampoo.</li>
            <li> I find this product by Nizoral for $43.I was happy that I made a good deal by they never actually deliver the product and after 3 weeks they gave back my money instead of Shampoo!</li>
            <li> , I bought this originally on amazon for $25...</li>
            <li> The best product I&#x27;ve used so far is Selsun Blue Naturals w/3%Salicylic Acid.</li>
            <li> It certainly worked better than anything else.</li>
            <li> Does anyone know for sure if this one from Amazon really works???</li>
            <li> This shampoo not only smells good, it works on dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Nizoral is by far the best single treatment for me.  </li>
            <li> Do NOT buy this product if your stubborn dandruff is the dry kind!</li>
            <li> Good for when my hair is long, not as good when it is short.</li>
            <li> It is not as mild as Nizoral/Ketoconazole</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t expect quick delivery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of the many, MANY dandruff shampoos I had tried, the only one that worked well for me was Nizoral.</li>
            <li> Luckily while browsing one day my wife came across the Nizoral Antidandruff shampoo on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shampoo but not worth this price.</li>
            <li> has gorgeous long silky blackened/brown hair.....</li>
            <li> It has worked great and every other day use does the trick!</li>
            <li> For now I can say &amp;#34;Selsun Blue Dandruff Shampoo - Medicated&amp;#34; worked also pretty good for me if you are looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> You should be very clear so a customer can be sure as to what type [product you are selling.</li>
            <li> Is that because it competes too successfully against the other brands?</li>
            <li> Hoping that it is available everywhere very soon.</li>
            <li> After the first wash, I noticed my hair was full of color and shine.</li>
            <li> My dandruff is completely gone using this product from just couple of applications, way better</li>
            <li> Seems to do the job and is worth buying if you need it.</li>
            <li> oh and the smell and burning wasn&#x27;t fun either,,lol.</li>
            <li> worth the money for us.</li>
            <li> Works far better than the competition</li>
            <li> it worth every penny.</li>
            <li> But Nizoral has the best results, I&#x27;ve used numerous other shampoos and none of them had even temporary</li>
            <li> The BENEFITS of Nizoral/Ketoconazole is that it is relatively mild, can be used frequently, does not have a strong fragrance or odor, and does not affect the texture or quality of your hair.</li>
            <li> My scalp is itch free and the dandruff is completely GONE!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in New York, so you would think if anyone had it, it would be available here, but there seems to be none anywhere (I&#x27;ve tried 12+ pharmacies in 3 boroughs).  </li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t appear to do anything more than a regular shampoo).    </li>
            <li> no (though the Troy Polamalu commercials are funny - even to a Browns fan)    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be interested to see what it does long-term</li>
            <li> It starts to work on the first use.</li>
            <li> (I think the prescription version still exits, it&#x27;s only like 1 or 2% more ketoconazole.)</li>
            <li> (you can buy the sulfur gel on here) and also VO5 hot oil treatments once a month.</li>
            <li> from the first week of using i felt the change.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> After coming to this realization and rapidly panicking over the fate of my ever-shinier forehead, I began researching ways to abate the march of baldness over my dome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Propecia, despite its effectiveness, required doctor&#x27;s office visits and involved possible sexual side effects.</li>
            <li> My first breakthrough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve resolved to using this product on my most affected dandruff spot only to continue to test until finished &amp; use a moisturizing milk shampoo on the rest of scalp.</li>
            <li> my hair is now more stronger and healthy and NO MORE Dandruff&lt;</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> Have to use this shampoo every other day to make it effective.  </li>
            <li> For the most part my dandruff is either gone or so minor that it no longer shows.</li>
            <li> I am sure that after a few more weeks of using this product, my daughter will get complete relief.</li>
            <li> If it were any other site I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;d make the sellers conform to reasonable pricing or kick them off.</li>
            <li> Not only did the product have a light, pleasant scent, but it was also moisturizing and left hair feeling soft unlike aforementioned products.</li>
            <li> but it has given me so much relief.  </li>
            <li> When I use it I try to be very thorough.</li>
            <li> On the whole, perople&#x27;s experience are that Selenium Sulfide 1% and</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews on here, and I really didn&#x27;t have anything to lose (except flakes, hopefully).</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> and it worked very well for me too.</li>
            <li> my scalp is really thanking me.  </li>
            <li> , it was something I was very selfconscious about and embarrassed.  </li>
            <li> (much cheaper)</li>
            <li> but it really works...</li>
            <li> (Per the CSR from Nizoral) and be available at your local resellers.</li>
            <li> That way I don&#x27;t need to use nearly as much Nizoral.</li>
            <li> really thought I was hallucinating, but these results were shown in a couple of clinical trials as well.</li>
            <li> Nizoral is a very versatile product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I eventually discovered UK sellers on Amazon offering the UK retail version (which is the 2% strength) at reasonable prices, and I have been using that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Me and my wife were very concerned and wanted to try out alternatives.</li>
            <li> If you have a scalp problem that just will not go away no matter what you&#x27;ve tried, you really need to try Nizoral.</li>
            <li> The only thing it was really good for, remotely, was for my scalp.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy enough, just shampoo every day as you normally would.</li>
            <li> In truth, the active ingredient in Nizoral was responsible which you can read more about throughout the net.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mix it in with other products safely</li>
            <li> It is better than any other dandruff shampoo out there.</li>
            <li> Like many others who like and used this product, I&#x27;m done, will look for other alternatives.</li>
            <li> Most dandruff shampoos on the US market use pyrithone zinc as the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> I do realize (unlike some people obviously) that a single product won&#x27;t work for everyone, but I recommend this highly if you&#x27;re still on your quest to a healthy scalp!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost everything out there so far and nothing worked, even tried the \\&quot;Home remedy\\&quot; vinegar, which at first helped but after awhile didn&#x27;t for some reason,</li>
            <li> I once ran out of it and quickly reverted back so called me hooked.  </li>
            <li> But at 15 bucks or more per bottle, it really was a waste of money and never did what it was designed to do.</li>
            <li> and I think Amazon has a decent price on it as well.</li>
            <li> The smell is decent and there is no burning,</li>
            <li> Our pediatrician recommended this shampoo for my teenage son after he had tried many of the regular dandruff shampoos with no relief.  </li>
            <li> I apply Nizoral to the main areas I want to manage and leave it on while I finish my shower.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest that you use conditioner after using this product.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because the price is so high.</li>
            <li> why is it priced so high now?</li>
            <li> I have been able to find it pretty easily since the supply issue was resolved nearly a year ago, but am completely unable to find any in stores (Rite Aid, Duane Read, CVS, Walgreens etc.)</li>
            <li> I finally bought this after researching it on Amazon through reviews (Thanks Amazon!!).  </li>
            <li> I had to wait for new hair to grow and get a haircut to get the my original relatively soft hair hair back.    </li>
            <li> This is truly amazing since I could wash her hair on a Sunday and by Tuesday she had thick patches and severe itching.  </li>
            <li> Being a guy though, I rarely go to the doctor, and really how many guys would go to the doctor to talk about such a small problem.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s had dandruff as long as I can remember and we have tried many different shampoos.  </li>
            <li> You can type \\&quot;Seborrheic Dermatitis Versus Psoriasis\\&quot; into Google to read the difference between the two (Quickly: scalp psoriasis is the less-common, more-painful condition; its scales often have minor bleeding when scarped off manually).</li>
            <li> In general Nizoral AntiDandruff shows positive effects after two days use.</li>
            <li> I normally use it every 2-3 days, but anytime I get itchy more often (usually the result of working out or anything that makes me sweat)</li>
            <li> Actually, I have only used the 2% version of this product, also available here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Why would a shampoo for dandruff use sulphate as  ingredient that&#x27;s known to make scalp super dry??... causing dandruff?</li>
            <li> I have no idea why it went away, but the product is exactly the same:</li>
            <li> when I bought it the first time last fall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been receiving comments from people left and right about how much hair I&#x27;ve lost in the last 2 years.</li>
            <li> After using it every day for probably 2 weeks or so, I can make do with using this 2-3 times per week and then using a regular shampoo on the other days, but it is a nice enough product that you can use every day if you can afford it.</li>
            <li> He told me that before he would write me a prescription, I needed to clear up some dandruff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I now have been acne clear for almost a year.</li>
            <li> After two weeks my scalp is clear, no flakes, no itching,</li>
            <li> After nearly 20 years of dandruff, I found Nizoral after reading about it on Reddit.  </li>
            <li> Changed my pillow case frequently</li>
            <li> I therefore can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness, but I wanted to alert others who may be sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit spendy, but completely controlls flaking.  </li>
            <li> However, if you are washing your hair once every three days it takes about four weeks to completely get rid of the flakes.</li>
            <li> After just two weeks, my problems were completely gone.</li>
            <li> I am an HR professional</li>
            <li> This is the only one that really controls itching and flaking.  </li>
            <li> Old times with prescriptions.  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely the only thing that worked for my husband.  </li>
            <li> read from Wikipedia the following: \\&quot;Although ketoconazole may be useful as a hair loss treatment, the shampoo is currently only FDA-approved for the treatment of dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp\\&quot;</li>
            <li> To whomever the price gouger is--this is available for a third the price from stocks made in Belgium and sold in the U.S. from other online retailers.  </li>
            <li> I used it every time I showered for a week or so, and now I use it maybe once a week using regular cheap shampoo every other time.</li>
            <li> The price of this stuff here on Amazon also confirms that something is amiss: if people would readily find this at local stiores for its usual price ($12-16), sellers would never be able to charge $22-25 plus shipping for the same product on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I am fairly certain that the new product is identical to this one, my guess is they had found some side effects that made it necessary to reformulate it and release it in different packaging.</li>
            <li> No other shampoos seem to relieve the itching or clear up the patches.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t itch with Nizoral but did with pretty much any other regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Once a week seems to be about right, but every other week might work too.</li>
            <li> I can let it get as greasy as I want with no other unpleasantness!</li>
            <li> This kept my hair dandruff free for no more then 8 hours at a time...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product is suddenly off the shelves at every store in town, but I was relieved to find it on-line, as it is the only treatment for seb-derm I have ever found that is in the least effective.</li>
            <li> Cant wait for this product to go back to normal production</li>
            <li> My hair is grown out, I&#x27;m never annoyed by that itch on the back of my head just above the hair line and where that swirly thing is.  </li>
            <li> I actually PRAYED for something to give me much needed relief from the constant flaking &amp; itching.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t necessarily look fuller, but at least I don&#x27;t see more scalp each morning in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;MONTH 4</li>
            <li> I have tried all the major dandruff shampoo cures:  pyrithione zinc (Head and Shoulders), coal tar (T/gel), salicilic acid (Dermarest) and ketoconazole (Nizoral).  </li>
            <li> beats all other shampoo for treating  dandruff....cost a little more  </li>
            <li> followed the directions and used it frequently at first to get rid of the dandruff/yeast, and tapered off to using it about once a week, between my other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have had an itcy/flaky scalp my entire adult life.  </li>
            <li> I used Nizoral for over 15 years, from my teen years up until my early 30s.  </li>
            <li> Modern day Costanza I felt like (not really that bad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have make a weekly trip to my beautician, only to have my scalp revert to its normal consistancy 3 to 4 days later (flakey and</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;ve lost hair in the front now, and the back is starting to get better slowly</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks of use about every 3 days, it became less effective, with flaking and itching starting in the afternoon -- but the flakes were smaller and the itching less intense than with other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> The only way I can actually verify this is to read both labels, so when I do buy the new product I&#x27;ll try to post the result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine was particularly bad in a inch and a half diameter area at the crown of my head, just the perfect place to scratch and spread it.</li>
            <li> so I just decided that I must have had some fungul issue or something other than real hairloss.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient is an antifungal compound so those of you saying it works have a fungal infection on your scalp (really).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 years old, and in the last year I&#x27;ve increasingly started getting 2 bald spots, one in the back, and one in the front(middle).</li>
            <li> /&gt;He used it almost daily at first and now he is down to 2 times a week to control</li>
            <li> First, let me start off by giving a little background.</li>
            <li> I had a major problem several months ago with seborreic dermatitis in my scalp...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this in the past for about $20-25 for two 7-ounce bottles, but it seems to go out of stock or become rare and the price shoots up to around $60-80 for two bottles, which is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price was a little expensive but it is a hard to find item right now, the shipping was quick and I was pleased with my product.</li>
            <li> bottle might seem small, but you only need a tiny amount to shampoo your hair, and since you only use it once a week after the first month, it really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Its been very hard to fine Nizoral in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Frequent washes will cause the hair to become brittle, breakf off, and dry out.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s odd is that I can find no mention on Google or elsewhere about a new shortage.  </li>
            <li> The effects of the medication in the shampoo is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I do not suggest that you use this product on a daily basis because it will dry your hair out and make it feel brittle.  </li>
            <li> Makes my scalp dry which is the last thing I needed from this product.</li>
            <li> I initially tried this 5 or 6 years ago to control my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> After a while, it was very apparent that this was not only more expensive than my other shampoo (H&amp;S Intensive Treatment w/Selenium Sulfide), but it didn&#x27;t even work half as well.</li>
            <li> I will continue using Nizoral for a long time or til I don&#x27;t need it anymore.    </li>
            <li> My hair is long wavy and color treated, and it makes it look like I just walked out of the salon.  </li>
            <li> Ketoconazole has long been shown to be ineffective against skin/scalp issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me start this off with the fact that I have been trying to get control of my minor dandruff for almost 20 years.  </li>
            <li> I went many weeks without wearing dark colors &amp; wondering what was wrong.  </li>
            <li> If you have curly hair, dry scalp, thick hair that grows fast and itches, man does this stuff work.</li>
            <li> Wish the bottle was a little bigger but no big deal.</li>
            <li> You do have to keep using it fairly regularly, though, as other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He was also very careful as to not scratch is head when out in public too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Downside is that it can dry your hair out, and your scalp used too often.</li>
            <li> Also, watch out for dry air.</li>
            <li> I attempted to internet-diagnose my dry, flaky, itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Nizoral is what my dermatologist recommends for flaky, dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> i had alot dandfuff and itch dry head.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena T-Gel (coal tar) and salicylic acid are WAY TOO HARSH and should only be used as a last resort, or to treat scalp psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dandruff for years, and the only solution to keep it under control is ketoconazole, the active ingredient in Nizoral shampoo.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind paying $10 for a single bottle</li>
            <li> so every lil&#x27;  flake shows!&lt;br /&gt;He had to wash his hair every morning before school to just to try to wash the loose flakes out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> : My hair loss has definitely grinded down to a halt at this point.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still only half this price.</li>
            <li> At least, for the last 10 years, I&#x27;ve been using it daily with 3-5 min application before rinsing.  </li>
            <li> and behold, after a few weeks of using Nizoral - my hair came back!</li>
            <li> I heard about this shampoo a while ago from a hairstylist but it was prescription only so on a whim, a few weeks ago, I googled it after reading a story on AOL that it was rated #1 by doctors for help with healing severe dandruff issues.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed how well this shampoo worked, not only as a shampoo but as an everyday wash.</li>
            <li> Anyone else having trouble finding Nizoral locally?</li>
            <li> Not only was I wrong with my skepticism, I was wonderfully surprised on how well the product worked and the vast difference in texture and scent versus the prescription brand.</li>
            <li> It was rough on my color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> , it does not really work for my scalp and</li>
            <li> And if you have flaky eyelashes, it gets rid of the dandruff there, too, but you need to be a bit careful as the shampoo can</li>
            <li> Makes absolutely no sense to me.</li>
            <li> Its really been awful for many years now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell of the product is a little different (coconut), but other than that its going well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wash my hair a lot, it gets dried out and as its really long, it takes forever to dry</li>
            <li> but I make them use plain water just the same.</li>
            <li> It is not strong enough to save all your hair if you&#x27;re destined to go bald</li>
            <li> My scalp was such a problem that even when the barber would spray my hair with anything other than plain water, my scalp would begin itching within the hour.</li>
            <li> I am dirty no matter how I clean myself every</li>
            <li> Other dandruff products didn&#x27;t work for me, but Nizoral works.</li>
            <li> I found that some other shampoos and conditioners can aggravate my dandruff, so I use nizoral every other wash.</li>
            <li> and I have tried all the other store brand dandruff shampoos and they did nothing.  </li>
            <li> Nizoral and Neutrogena and other shampoos do not work for recalcitrant, stubborn dandruff cases.  </li>
            <li> &quot; my hair almost daily to not look flakey, no more.  </li>
            <li> , now i have to search for other product for hair loss.</li>
            <li> Hair plugs were out of the question, both due to cost and the time off involved.</li>
            <li> Our son has extremely</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just use other dandruff shampoos and make do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> My daughter was suffering from severe hair loss due to dandruff.</li>
            <li> This product may seem a little expensive, but for me, it is worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li> make do with other products while I wait for the price to come down.</li>
            <li> Well when my scalp is acting up again I was about to buy two more, but I was shocked and furious of the shampoo comany discontinue it to be sold in a pharmacy, and whats worse is that they gouge the price to $200.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick and curly that it dries out my scalp constantly, no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t wear my hair down anymore.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dinging it down to a three-star product rather than a five-star.</li>
            <li> One of the other reviewers mentions why it is different than the other treatments over the counter and for me at least, it hit the nail on the head!</li>
            <li> Rinse with cold water right away if it happens.</li>
            <li> This cut my dandruff down by about 75% from it&#x27;s previous level.  </li>
            <li> It creates a thick lather with only a little bit.  </li>
            <li> I was attracted to this because the pharmacist told me that they often prescribe the main ingredient (only in 2%, not 1%) to patients with bad dandruff and also because my other shampoo was too chemical-y.</li>
            <li> It came less than three days.</li>
            <li> but I do notice that I lose less hair when compared to head and shoulders.</li>
            <li> (I make it last), but I won&#x27;t pay a ridiculous $40 per bottle.</li>
            <li> But why pay this amount  when you can get it at Walgreens or Drugstore.com for much much less.</li>
            <li> Hair fall decreased considerably and we could see that the fungal growth on the scalp disintegrate in a few weeks time.</li>
            <li> I started out by using it as directed, which is twice a week, and in less than two weeks the itching was all but gone, and</li>
            <li> Both coal tar and salicylic acid made my hair extremely rough, tough, and dry.</li>
            <li> I found this little gem.  </li>
            <li> since a little girl.</li>
            <li> Scabs, peeling and the unpleasant scalp smell that comes with this medical condition do not return shortly after shampooing like it did with the other products.</li>
            <li> I have dark, very thick and long hair</li>
            <li> gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and used it a few times a week for about two months.  </li>
            <li> After a few treatments, my dandruff is gone again for a few weeks/months.  </li>
            <li> Growing my hair out was asking for trouble.  </li>
            <li> I returned it unused because I found it to be heavily fragranced.</li>
            <li> So I tried it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> then let it sit for a few minutes while I shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> Without this shampoo, my hair and scalp are in trouble.  </li>
            <li> I find that almost any shampoo (even non-dandruff shampoos) will prevent dandruff for a few days.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it offers some relief.  </li>
            <li> I can go a few days without seeing hair on my pillow.</li>
            <li> was hesitant and didn&#x27;t want to waste my money on a twenty dollar shampoo...</li>
            <li> Extremely common during the wet winters in the northwest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not strong smelling nor drying to the skin.</li>
            <li> Some antidandruff shampoo smells pretty bad, but not this one.</li>
            <li> I know that some people buy it to help slow down hair loss and its too soon to tell for me (two weeks)</li>
            <li> I still have some hair there, but very little.</li>
            <li> My other shampoo does not work on my scalp now!!!</li>
            <li> : My scalp is less oily and less itchy, but I still have some thin hairs that are falling into the sink every morning.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter (African-American) suffered terribly from a very itchy scalp and thick scaly patches of dandruff.  </li>
            <li> but it works without excessive drying.</li>
            <li> I had tried tar shampoos in the past and they just weren&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> 2.22.09-I am not sure what happened, but I am now getting flakes around the perimiter of my face again (on my scalp).</li>
            <li> I had used it for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> I usually out it on</li>
            <li> Not sure if you have to let it sit but works for me.</li>
            <li> On the non-Nizoral days I usually use the Ginger shampoo from The Body Shop.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what happened over the past 6 months:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more problems with that,</li>
            <li> Also,the suds from the shampoo also treated other areas like inside and behind ears where eczema and seborrhea were also visible.     </li>
            <li> It has really increased the volume of my hair and gotten rid of all the nasty flakes that can be left over from hair products.</li>
            <li> Several months ago my supply ran out and I went looking...and was appalled to see how a $15.00 asking price was now over $150 for the same 7 oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m amazed -- hard to believe that after all these years the solution came from a Canadian product.  </li>
            <li> Also, my hair are hardly falling anymore.</li>
            <li> I can hardly believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least in those two areas on my frontal hairline where it has begun to recede.</li>
            <li> At least this will never be a problem with my children.  </li>
            <li> I use it at least once a week.</li>
            <li> scaley)....I was prescribed this shampoo by a rude doctor over 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> Late years without prescriptions.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that suffers from seborrhea dermatitis.</li>
            <li> But,the coal tar stopped working in my late 20&#x27;s and the Clinical Strength H&amp;S and worked ever since.&lt;br /&gt;Btw</li>
            <li> predatory sellers on Amazon seem to be common these days.</li>
            <li> So I am forced to use an alternative.</li>
            <li> and I mean it.</li>
            <li> I mean nothing worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had very bad dandruff for over four years, as a result of dry skin than came on suddenly.  </li>
            <li> , I was already losing my hair and seriously freaking out.</li>
            <li> It was much less expensive ordering through Amazon than a store front.</li>
            <li> Then it comes back as bad as ever.  </li>
            <li> Rogaine was expensive and messy.</li>
            <li> Other stuf that they have is just not good and stinks.  </li>
            <li> too bad it&#x27;s harder to find than it used to be.</li>
            <li> Sweat/humidity seems to make this worse.      </li>
            <li> It just seemed to be getting worse and worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d kept my hair buzzed because that seemed to help fend off the itch that would crop up after a day or 2 (that annoying itch that you knew was related to flakes and irritation).  </li>
            <li> My head does not itch, but a moderately annoying amount of tiny flakes would be produced each day.  </li>
            <li> Each passing day, I see fewer and fewer thin hairs in the sink.</li>
            <li> also plays football every fall and his dandruff gets even worse then.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo approximately for $30 for two bottles a year ago.  </li>
            <li> have to say that I cannot stand these silly \\&quot;baldness-cure\\&quot; shampoos out there, which pitch a bunch of BS.</li>
            <li> Zinc pyrithione (Head &amp; Shoulders) is nearly useless.</li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> Weird.  </li>
            <li> Upon learning there was an OTC version, I was elated and skeptical that it would work as well as the prescription strength.</li>
            <li> I heard it recommended to help in hair thickening and growth, and it is completely useless for that.  </li>
            <li> Nizoral has become increasingly difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Nizoral is way too expensive, but they can charge what they want, because it works and the others don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> But then in the past 6 months I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore anywhere! :(</li>
            <li> I had a terribly itchy scalp as well as bad dandruff my entire life.</li>
            <li> But, I got it because the woman cutting my hair suggested it might work to restore some hair growth.  </li>
            <li> Impossible to find in stores and expensive everywhere!</li>
            <li> If that doesn&#x27;t work, you can see a dermatologist and get cicloprox shampoo (very expensive -</li>
            <li> and I mean extremely, horrible itching and flaking of the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Trying to find this in a store is almost impossible, why?</li>
            <li> I was so incredibly frustrated by wasting my money, time &amp; hope on things that just didn&#x27;t get RID of the flakes.</li>
            <li> I was frustrated</li>
            <li> like painful zits on my scalp.</li>
            <li> but i see now that they have gone up like crazy!</li>
            <li> This is so annoying.</li>
            <li> but it is very expensive here!</li>
            <li> My scalp itched all of the time and my itching would create sores, whiche turned to scabs and that combined with the severe dandruff was very unpleasant</li>
            <li> I had very bad flake problem and people think about me</li>
            <li> It burns something awful!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Head &amp; Shoulders, Neutrogena T-Gel, neem oil, diet changes, you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it.  After nearly 20 years of dandruff, I found Nizoral after reading about it on Reddit.  Now my dandruff is gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and used it a few times a week for about two months.  Now I only use it when I feel my sculp is getting itchy or if I am seeing flakes.  After a few treatments, my dandruff is gone again for a few weeks/months.  It is not a cure-all but it has given me so much relief.  It is well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> This review is for 2% - prescription strength Nizoral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 17, I was already losing my hair and seriously freaking out. I went to a hair doctor to try and get minoxidil. He told me that before he would write me a prescription, I needed to clear up some dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low and behold, after a few weeks of using Nizoral - my hair came back! At least in those two areas on my frontal hairline where it has begun to recede. I was kind of amazed. The internet was not a source of proper information back then so I just decided that I must have had some fungul issue or something other than real hairloss. In truth, the active ingredient in Nizoral was responsible which you can read more about throughout the net.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stuck with the 2% Nizoral to this day and while I eventually go on Propecia and my hair was thinning a bit, this shampoo was essential in keeping my skin and hair looking great. You can actually feel it tingle when you leave it on for 5 minutes, and it does penetrate. Can&#x27;t speak to the 1% formula and I wouldn&#x27;t both with it. Just get the regular strength version from your doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also helped my skin and agree with others that it makes a great cleanser for a whole assortment of issues, including dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside is that it can dry your hair out, and your scalp used too often. Get another hair/scalp moisturizer and use it in conjunction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I cannot stand these silly \\&quot;baldness-cure\\&quot; shampoos out there, which pitch a bunch of BS. These stuff actually does work and blocks DHT. It is not strong enough to save all your hair if you&#x27;re destined to go bald but I am grateful to the researchers who came up with this formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Keep it out of your eyes and I mean it. It burns something awful! Rinse with cold water right away if it happens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been researching and trying many items.  I was home in Canada and found this product and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  It works as the box describes - give it 3 weeks til desired results.&lt;br /&gt;I kept tabs on any itching - showered with the product when I felt symptoms begin.  Changed my pillow case frequently so the &#x27;fungus&#x27; that causes dundruff had no hiding place.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 5 weeks now and I&#x27;m amazed -- hard to believe that after all these years the solution came from a Canadian product.  Even works on my eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I have had an itcy/flaky scalp my entire adult life.  I believe my proper diagnosis is &#x27;seborrheic dermatitis&#x27;, but the bottom line is that my scalp itches, is red in the itchy spots, and those places flake off.  Sweat/humidity seems to make this worse.      I have tried all the major dandruff shampoo cures:  pyrithione zinc (Head and Shoulders), coal tar (T/gel), salicilic acid (Dermarest) and ketoconazole (Nizoral).  I have even experimented with using these shampoos in different combinations.  Nizoral is by far the best single treatment for me.  I normally use it every 2-3 days, but anytime I get itchy more often (usually the result of working out or anything that makes me sweat) I use Nizoral and I&#x27;m fine.      For me, the absolute best treatment seems to be lathering with coal tar (T/Gel), rinsing, then using Nizoral.  I do this probably 25% of the time.  Otherwise, I just use Nizoral.</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all for me for flaking or itching.  I will need to try another product.</li>
            <li> I heard about this shampoo a while ago from a hairstylist but it was prescription only so on a whim, a few weeks ago, I googled it after reading a story on AOL that it was rated #1 by doctors for help with healing severe dandruff issues.  My 15 year old daughter (African-American) suffered terribly from a very itchy scalp and thick scaly patches of dandruff.  No other shampoos seem to relieve the itching or clear up the patches.  It just seemed to be getting worse and worse. After using this product ONE time her hair no longer itches and she has no traces of dandruff.  It&#x27;s like she never suffered from it at all.  This is truly amazing since I could wash her hair on a Sunday and by Tuesday she had thick patches and severe itching.  We are back to washing her hair every two weeks and the added benefit of this shampoo is that it smells GREAT!  This was the best investment I could have made on her behalf.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo after researching acne cures. I was amazed how well this shampoo worked, not only as a shampoo but as an everyday wash. I now have been acne clear for almost a year. The best part is there is no discomfort like with other soaps.</li>
            <li> It came less than three days. After i used twice,dandruff and itch are all gone!</li>
            <li> Does a great job of preventing dandruff and can make hair feel/appear thicker.  I do not suggest that you use this product on a daily basis because it will dry your hair out and make it feel brittle.  I have been able to use it once every 2-3 days with good results.  I highly suggest that you use conditioner after using this product.</li>
            <li> This product is as good as it&#x27;s advertisements make it out to be. I followed the instructions and saw a reduction of flakes and itchyness after only 2 weeks. Other dandruff products didn&#x27;t work for me, but Nizoral works. I will continue using Nizoral for a long time or til I don&#x27;t need it anymore.    EDITED 03/30/2010    I think people who are finding this product doesn&#x27;t work for them are not massaging Nizoral into there scalp enough. When I use it I try to be very thorough. I use all my fingers and my thumbs and work from my hairline massaging with my finger tips in circles. I found that some other shampoos and conditioners can aggravate my dandruff, so I use nizoral every other wash. Also, watch out for dry air.</li>
            <li> I saw many good reviews about this product, but the truth is that it doesn&#x27;t work. THis product is just like head and shoulders but more expensive. Would not recommend to anybody, unless you like to trow away your money.</li>
            <li> This is shampoo was intended for fungal infections of the scalp causing flaking, however, it is rumored to stop hair shedding.  WELL IT DOES! My hair is long wavy and color treated, and it makes it look like I just walked out of the salon.  I use it for hair loss. I give it 10 stars!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis and dandruff. Here are the results:    I tried both Nizoral/Ketoconazole 1% (OTC) &amp; Nizoral/Ketoconazole 2% (Prescription). Both did not appear to be effective (also, I did not notice much of difference between 1% and 2%). The BENEFITS of Nizoral/Ketoconazole is that it is relatively mild, can be used frequently, does not have a strong fragrance or odor, and does not affect the texture or quality of your hair. The two important DRAWBACKS are the price and the fact that, in my experience, it is ineffective in treating seborrhoeic dermatitis (it doesn&#x27;t appear to do anything more than a regular shampoo).    Neutrogena T-Gel (coal tar) and salicylic acid are WAY TOO HARSH and should only be used as a last resort, or to treat scalp psoriasis. You can type \\&quot;Seborrheic Dermatitis Versus Psoriasis\\&quot; into Google to read the difference between the two (Quickly: scalp psoriasis is the less-common, more-painful condition; its scales often have minor bleeding when scarped off manually). Both coal tar and salicylic acid made my hair extremely rough, tough, and dry. All the conditioner in the world made no difference. I had to wait for new hair to grow and get a haircut to get the my original relatively soft hair hair back.    Zinc pyrithione (Head &amp; Shoulders) is nearly useless. It is popular because it is cheap and was the first widely available treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis.    RECOMMENDATION: I recommend Selenium Sulfide 1% (sold as \\&quot;Selsun Blue\\&quot; or \\&quot;Head and Shoulders Intensive Treatment\\&quot; in the Dark-Blue bottle) because it is EFFECTIVE and reasonably priced. I found Selenium Sulfide 1% to be the most effective in treating seborrhoeic dermatitis. It is not as mild as Nizoral/Ketoconazole but it works without excessive drying. On the whole, perople&#x27;s experience are that Selenium Sulfide 1% and Nizoral/Ketoconazole 1% are the best treatments (if the latter works for you).</li>
            <li> One of the better shampoo&#x27;s on the market. Its more pricey than others but works better</li>
            <li> Though I think you get the point that this stuff works when nothing else does I&#x27;ll still chyme in.    I&#x27;m almost 40 and have had scalp issues since I was 12 (earliest I can remember).    Neutrogena - no    Seltzen Blue - no  Head and Shoulders - no (though the Troy Polamalu commercials are funny - even to a Browns fan)    I&#x27;d kept my hair buzzed because that seemed to help fend off the itch that would crop up after a day or 2 (that annoying itch that you knew was related to flakes and irritation).  Growing my hair out was asking for trouble.  I am in sales so there is no avoiding the judgmental eyes of the world.    Doctor prescribed it (2% version), I use it once a week or so, and all is well.  I mix it in with other products safely (i.e. conditioner cuz it doesn&#x27;t attempt to touch that area obviously). I once ran out of it and quickly reverted back so called me hooked.  I know it made the difference.    My hair is grown out, I&#x27;m never annoyed by that itch on the back of my head just above the hair line and where that swirly thing is.  I only wish I had discovered this 20 years ago.  At least this will never be a problem with my children.  Just buy it.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with my head itching almost all of the time, and my wife recommended that I try the Nizoral. It works fantastic. I had tried tar shampoos in the past and they just weren&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> I returned it unused because I found it to be heavily fragranced. I therefore can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness, but I wanted to alert others who may be sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> This is a good dandruff shampoo.  But, I got it because the woman cutting my hair suggested it might work to restore some hair growth.  Surprise, it actually is after only 2 weeks.  I&#x27;ll be interested to see what it does long-term or if I&#x27;ve reached the limit of what it can do.  It creates a thick lather with only a little bit.  Definitely no flakes either.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with a flaky, scaly, oily scalp for several years. I tried herbal rinses, oils, etc. to no avail. I was so incredibly frustrated by wasting my money, time &amp; hope on things that just didn&#x27;t get RID of the flakes. Then I tried Nizoral, and I was cautiously optimistic. I had read the reviews on here, and I really didn&#x27;t have anything to lose (except flakes, hopefully). I actually PRAYED for something to give me much needed relief from the constant flaking &amp; itching. Well, I can honestly say after 1.5 months of using this every 3-4 days, my hair is *almost* completely flake free! Praise the Lord! This product may seem a little expensive, but for me, it is worth its weight in gold. Honestly, this is the best product on the market for people with seborrheic dermatitis (which is what I believe I have). I HIGHLY recommend it! UPDATE: 2.22.09-I am not sure what happened, but I am now getting flakes around the perimiter of my face again (on my scalp). I am using this weekly. The flakes are only around the edges of my face, and nowhere else. Weird. This is so annoying.</li>
            <li> I was attracted to this because the pharmacist told me that they often prescribe the main ingredient (only in 2%, not 1%) to patients with bad dandruff and also because my other shampoo was too chemical-y. So I tried it for a few weeks. After a while, it was very apparent that this was not only more expensive than my other shampoo (H&amp;S Intensive Treatment w/Selenium Sulfide), but it didn&#x27;t even work half as well. Do NOT buy this product if your stubborn dandruff is the dry kind! My other shampoo does not work on my scalp now!!! The best product I&#x27;ve used so far is Selsun Blue Naturals w/3%Salicylic Acid. I&#x27;m going to try DHS tar and DHS zinc and I&#x27;ll try to give an update. BUT whatever you do, DO NOT use this product!    Edit: I did try the DHS stuff. Same deal. It doesn&#x27;t work. HOWEVER, I have found something that works for me (YAY)! Anyway, it is Giovanni Tea Tree Triple Treat Shampoo. I love it! I&#x27;ve written a review there (albeit, it isn&#x27;t very detailed). I do realize (unlike some people obviously) that a single product won&#x27;t work for everyone, but I recommend this highly if you&#x27;re still on your quest to a healthy scalp!</li>
            <li> I had used it for the past 10 years. Amazon sales two 7 oz for $21 with free shipping that was the lower price I could find. This shampoo work for me. Try it for a month you will love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best solution I&#x27;ve found for dandruff.  It&#x27;s a bit spendy, but completely controlls flaking.  After using it every day for probably 2 weeks or so, I can make do with using this 2-3 times per week and then using a regular shampoo on the other days, but it is a nice enough product that you can use every day if you can afford it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is well known among people having problem with either dandruff or thinning hairs. Look it up on Google.com.</li>
            <li> I buy this stuff from store because it was the ONLY thing that would work! But then in the past 6 months I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore anywhere! :( So I started using Garnier Dandruff Shampoo and it worked very well for me too. But then they discontinued that! And when I found it on Amazon I was SO excited so I bought the biggest bottles they had in a set of 4 for $40!! I got it in the mail and it DOES NOT WORK AT ALL. So i&#x27;m wondering if this Nizerol is the same in stores. Does anyone know for sure if this one from Amazon really works???</li>
            <li> This shampoo not only smells good, it works on dandruff.  Only one that has worked on me and I can tolerate the smell.  Some antidandruff shampoo smells pretty bad, but not this one.</li>
            <li> It starts to work on the first use. However, if you are washing your hair once every three days it takes about four weeks to completely get rid of the flakes.</li>
            <li> The opening page represented it as 2% Ketoconazole and when I received the product it was on 1%. I felt the information was misrepresented in the add for the item.  You should be very clear so a customer can be sure as to what type [product you are selling.</li>
            <li> It is a really good product to remove dandruff when I first use it!   However, After 1 to 2 month, the dandruff comes back again.</li>
            <li> I Love using Nizoral.I use it at least once a week.It is better than any other dandruff shampoo out there.This shampoo has a nice scent too.</li>
            <li> After the first wash, I noticed my hair was full of color and shine. The smell of the product is a little different (coconut), but other than that its going well.  I know that some people buy it to help slow down hair loss and its too soon to tell for me (two weeks) but I do notice that I lose less hair when compared to head and shoulders. The best thing for me to tell you is to give it a try. Good Luck!</li>
            <li> This is the only dandruff shampoo that has worked for me. I have to use it every day for a couple of weeks, but it does work.  As a side note, this seems to have some conditioners in it. Good for when my hair is long, not as good when it is short.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked like a charm. After years of trying to fight off seborrheic dermatitis with T-GEL, Sulfur 8, head and shoulders etc, I cannot say enough complementary things about this product. Not only did the product have a light, pleasant scent, but it was also moisturizing and left hair feeling soft unlike aforementioned products. The effects of the medication in the shampoo is long lasting. Scabs, peeling and the unpleasant scalp smell that comes with this medical condition do not return shortly after shampooing like it did with the other products. Also,the suds from the shampoo also treated other areas like inside and behind ears where eczema and seborrhea were also visible.     In summary, inexpensive, pleasant smelling,moisturizing, effective medication. I am stocking up. Give it a try, it worked for us. 2 THUMBS UP!</li>
            <li> I have dark, very thick and long hair and I have tried all the other store brand dandruff shampoos and they did nothing.  My scalp got to the point where I couldn&#x27;t even brush my hair without creating a snowstorm.  I was frustrated and I couldn&#x27;t wear my hair down anymore.  My scalp itched all of the time and my itching would create sores, whiche turned to scabs and that combined with the severe dandruff was very unpleasant and I thought there was no solution.  I saw Nizoral on the store shelf and gave it a shot because I had tried everything else and my scalp is really thanking me.  After two weeks my scalp is clear, no flakes, no itching, no greasy look to my hair the day after it is washed.  I use it in conjuction with my Paul Mitchell shampoo and conditioner and my hair and scalp look and feel amazing.  I am so relieved I found this.</li>
            <li> I have great beautiful hair except that during season changes I get itchy and smelly scalp.  I tried T-Sal, Head &amp; Shoulders, Selsum Blue, vinegar, etc..nothing has worked but this product.  had to use it for about a month to take full effect but your hair always feels soft, manageable, and smell great; even on the first shampoo.</li>
            <li> Happy to see this item is once again available. Best option for controlling dandruff, and as a face wash for seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has ever worked for me! Its great to find something that doesn&#x27;t require a prescription!</li>
            <li> This product does not work.  I saw a quack dermatologist who had me on it for years, even before it was over-the-counter (I think the prescription version still exits, it&#x27;s only like 1 or 2% more ketoconazole.) Nizoral and Neutrogena and other shampoos do not work for recalcitrant, stubborn dandruff cases.  Ketoconazole has long been shown to be ineffective against skin/scalp issues.&lt;br /&gt;If you have dandruff, you need to treat it with 2% sulfur (you can buy the sulfur gel on here) and also VO5 hot oil treatments once a month. Then, use Selsun Blue. If that doesn&#x27;t work, you can see a dermatologist and get cicloprox shampoo (very expensive - either be wealthy or have insurance cuz it&#x27;s $120 per bottle) and antibiotics.  I used Nizoral for over 15 years, from my teen years up until my early 30s.  It never, ever stopped the flaking.  The only thing it was really good for, remotely, was for my scalp.  It didn&#x27;t itch with Nizoral but did with pretty much any other regular shampoo.  But at 15 bucks or more per bottle, it really was a waste of money and never did what it was designed to do.</li>
            <li> First, let me start off by giving a little background. I&#x27;m 25 years old, and in the last year I&#x27;ve increasingly started getting 2 bald spots, one in the back, and one in the front(middle). I still have some hair there, but very little. I&#x27;ve been receiving comments from people left and right about how much hair I&#x27;ve lost in the last 2 years. Oh yeah, and I&#x27;ve gained about 30 pounds. Modern day Costanza I felt like (not really that bad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways,I&#x27;m also using this product with Rogaine as well. I&#x27;ve been using both for about 3 weeks now. Obviously not enough time for the Rogaine to act. It has really increased the volume of my hair and gotten rid of all the nasty flakes that can be left over from hair products. You can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;ve lost hair in the front now, and the back is starting to get better slowly but surely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I feel so much more confident just because I think the Nizoral is what really helped volumize my hair. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> The price was a little expensive but it is a hard to find item right now, the shipping was quick and I was pleased with my product.</li>
            <li> My dandruff is completely gone using this product from just couple of applications, way better H&amp;S. Also, my hair are hardly falling anymore. This stuff is really good</li>
            <li> Perfect for my son&#x27;s dandruff.  I used to find at the store but they discontinued carrying it.  Other stuf that they have is just not good and stinks.  This is perfect, works well!</li>
            <li> this shampoo made my dandruff go away. I had tried everything and nothing worked. This is the only shampoo that worked. I have been using it for 2 years now.</li>
            <li> Is there again a shortage of this product in the USA?  I have been able to find it pretty easily since the supply issue was resolved nearly a year ago, but am completely unable to find any in stores (Rite Aid, Duane Read, CVS, Walgreens etc.) the last 6-8 weeks or so.  I&#x27;m in New York, so you would think if anyone had it, it would be available here, but there seems to be none anywhere (I&#x27;ve tried 12+ pharmacies in 3 boroughs).  I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s another shortage or production outage occurring.  The price of this stuff here on Amazon also confirms that something is amiss: if people would readily find this at local stiores for its usual price ($12-16), sellers would never be able to charge $22-25 plus shipping for the same product on Amazon.  So some people in the supply chain obviously know something is up and are jacking up the price.  What&#x27;s odd is that I can find no mention on Google or elsewhere about a new shortage.  Weird.  Anyone else having trouble finding Nizoral locally?</li>
            <li> I go between this and T-Gel. Seems to do the job and is worth buying if you need it. I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nizoral is the only shampoo that helps my psoriasis. I was glad to find it on line. I have recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shampoo but not worth this price. 7oz is $15.99 and 4oz is $9.99. Even if you got the prescription strength and paid out of pocket in the pharmacy it&#x27;s still only half this price.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the good reviews here and I think Amazon has a decent price on it as well. I&#x27;ve tried almost everything out there so far and nothing worked, even tried the \\&quot;Home remedy\\&quot; vinegar, which at first helped but after awhile didn&#x27;t for some reason, oh and the smell and burning wasn&#x27;t fun either,,lol. I use this 3 times a week and so far so good. I notice some flakes here and there but nothing like before. The smell is decent and there is no burning, I usually out it on then let it sit for a few minutes while I shave in the shower. Not sure if you have to let it sit but works for me. Wish the bottle was a little bigger but no big deal. Try it what else do you have to lose?Niz</li>
            <li> Let me start this off with the fact that I have been trying to get control of my minor dandruff for almost 20 years.  My head does not itch, but a moderately annoying amount of tiny flakes would be produced each day.  I have tried everything over the years to get control of my flakes.  Tiny amounts on my shoulder or the back of my neck, on my pillow when I woke up in the morning, it was something I was very selfconscious about and embarrassed.  Being a guy though, I rarely go to the doctor, and really how many guys would go to the doctor to talk about such a small problem.  So I tried everything, every shampoo in the supermarket isle, I changed hair gels 20 times, stopped using hair gels all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found this little gem.  Literally after 3 weeks of use, zero flakes, not one.  I used to get them on the front sides of my head and would have to \\&quot;clean\\&quot; my hair almost daily to not look flakey, no more.  I can wake up next to my g/f and not be embarassed that theres flakes all over the pillow, its great!  If you feel like youve tried everything and the tiny flakes just wont go away, give this a shot.  One of the other reviewers mentions why it is different than the other treatments over the counter and for me at least, it hit the nail on the head!</li>
            <li> I attempted to internet-diagnose my dry, flaky, itchy scalp. I believe it may be Seborrheic Dermatitis. I read that this product worked well for others that had similar issues, so I gave it a try. I used this product twice a week. After just two weeks, my problems were completely gone.</li>
            <li> Works wonders! Nothing ever worked for my hair. It&#x27;s so thick and curly that it dries out my scalp constantly, no matter what I do. I&#x27;ve tried so many products but nothing works like this one.</li>
            <li> Just like many of you this product was a life saver. I am an HR professional so speaking with colleagues and employees is a constant gravy train . I have dealt with dermatitis for 10-15 years and could not determine a fix. My African American beautician had me thinking for years that I didn&#x27;t drink enough water. She would say, if you did drink more H20 you will not be living with this embarrasing problem. I have make a weekly trip to my beautician, only to have my scalp revert to its normal consistancy 3 to 4 days later (flakey and scaley)....I was prescribed this shampoo by a rude doctor over 2 years ago. I left it at the pharmancy becuase she suggested I use it daily. Afican American women do NOT wash their hair daily..... Weekly or bi-weekly at most. Frequent washes will cause the hair to become brittle, breakf off, and dry out. After being at the end of my rope, I decided to buy it (much cheaper) at Walmart instead of my providers pharmacy. One bottle has lasted me five months.....life saver.... I am a believer.</li>
            <li> In general Nizoral AntiDandruff shows positive effects after two days use. But this one has shown no effect at all. I have stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I got 99 problems but scalp itch ain&#x27;t one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have some kind of scalp infection or something-- itchy sores and scabs-- like painful zits on my scalp. Nizoral keeps it suppressed better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have tried every dandruff shampoo on the market.  This is the only one that really controls itching and flaking.  It also minimizes hair loss which is becoming more important as I age--sadly!  My daughter uses it too, and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product is suddenly off the shelves at every store in town, but I was relieved to find it on-line, as it is the only treatment for seb-derm I have ever found that is in the least effective.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a week now and I cannot believe how amazing my scalp and hair feel! I had a terribly itchy scalp as well as bad dandruff my entire life. I had tried every product I could get my hands on, and nothing worked. My scalp is itch free and the dandruff is completely GONE!! Amazing!!</li>
            <li> Nizoral is what my dermatologist recommends for flaky, dry scalp.  It was much less expensive ordering through Amazon than a store front.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using NIZORAL since 1990 in Switzerland, then Canada, then the USA.  Old times with prescriptions.  Late years without prescriptions.  Frequency has been different.  At least, for the last 10 years, I&#x27;ve been using it daily with 3-5 min application before rinsing.  Yes ....DAILY. it&#x27;s a great product has always took care of my dandruff and NEVER caused any hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;I read from Wikipedia the following: \\&quot;Although ketoconazole may be useful as a hair loss treatment, the shampoo is currently only FDA-approved for the treatment of dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp\\&quot;</li>
            <li> beats all other shampoo for treating  dandruff....cost a little more  but it really works...have been using this product for about 10 years.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the only thing that worked for my husband.  He&#x27;s had dandruff as long as I can remember and we have tried many different shampoos.  I finally bought this after researching it on Amazon through reviews (Thanks Amazon!!).  You do have to keep using it fairly regularly, though, as other reviewers have mentioned. But, def. worth the money for us.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo. Initially prescribed by my doctor but I have continued to use it for 10 years.</li>
            <li> Its been very hard to fine Nizoral in stores anymore. If you have dandruff this will change your life. Only need to use once a week.</li>
            <li> Cant wait for this product to go back to normal production (Per the CSR from Nizoral) and be available at your local resellers.</li>
            <li> Just thought I should mention that you can now pick up the 7oz bottles at WallyWorld again.  Without this shampoo, my hair and scalp are in trouble.  When J&amp;J had the shortage, I was under the assumption it was discontinued!  Not so!</li>
            <li> This cut my dandruff down by about 75% from it&#x27;s previous level.  It didn&#x27;t go away entirely, but I&#x27;m fairly impressed with the results.  I used it about 3 times per week.  It certainly worked better than anything else.</li>
            <li> Bought this shampoo as recommended by my dermatologists and love it but it is very expensive here! I used to buy them for $20 but i see now that they have gone up like crazy!</li>
            <li> Impossible to find in stores and expensive everywhere! Works like a dream. Hoping that it is available everywhere very soon.</li>
            <li> I had very bad flake problem and people think about me I am dirty no matter how I clean myself every day.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many antiflakes product and all of them failed. This is the only savier for my flake problem.&lt;br /&gt;Only this product work for my flake case.</li>
            <li> Our pediatrician recommended this shampoo for my teenage son after he had tried many of the regular dandruff shampoos with no relief.  It has worked great and every other day use does the trick!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the prescription 2% Nizoral for years. Upon learning there was an OTC version, I was elated and skeptical that it would work as well as the prescription strength. Not only was I wrong with my skepticism, I was wonderfully surprised on how well the product worked and the vast difference in texture and scent versus the prescription brand. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that suffers from seborrhea dermatitis. I use it daily and haven&#x27;t had one problem with my dermatitis since.</li>
            <li> This serves OK as a dandruff shampoo, but is way too pricey.  I heard it recommended to help in hair thickening and growth, and it is completely useless for that.  I would avoid.  if you need dandruff shampoo, just use head and shoulders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nizoral 1% for about 8 months.  I&#x27;ve had very bad dandruff for over four years, as a result of dry skin than came on suddenly.  I find that almost any shampoo (even non-dandruff shampoos) will prevent dandruff for a few days.  Then it comes back as bad as ever.  Nizoral is the most effective shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  It isn&#x27;t a cure for me, as it has seemingly been for others here.  It started out great, nearly eliminating the flaking and itching.  After a couple of weeks of use about every 3 days, it became less effective, with flaking and itching starting in the afternoon -- but the flakes were smaller and the itching less intense than with other shampoos.  After eight months, it is still good, but I get flakes and itching every day.  It&#x27;s expensive, but it offers some relief.  On the non-Nizoral days I usually use the Ginger shampoo from The Body Shop.</li>
            <li> This neither helped nor hurt my scalp condition.  It was rough on my color treated hair.  It was recommended by a doctor, but just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> from the first week of using i felt the change.&lt;br /&gt;Now after 3 weeks it kills 90% of my dandruff rate. i didn&#x27;t believe, it works like magic.&lt;br /&gt;but it didn&#x27;t stop my hair loss as i supposed, now i have to search for other product for hair loss.</li>
            <li> Actually, I have only used the 2% version of this product, also available here on Amazon.  After suffering for ten years with misdiagnosis from a variety of doctors, it appears my scalp is getting well.  I did some research of my own and learned dandruff is sometimes caused by a fungus growth.  Mine was particularly bad in a inch and a half diameter area at the crown of my head, just the perfect place to scratch and spread it. The doctors froze the skin with liquid nitrogen.  Two patches were removed via surgery.  It always came back.  I wash my hair every day. Nothing worked until I used this product.  It has taken about 10 months to make a big difference with my problem, but it seems to never quite cure it.  Six months prior, I asked my doctor for a prescription shampoo to kill fungal infections.  The prescription version has the same color and consistency as Nizoral. After two months of marginal improvement using the prescription version, I decided to switch to Nizoral. I noticed better results almost immediately.  I don&#x27;t know what the difference is, but the Nizoral brand just works better.  The prescription version I have is also 2%.  Anyway, I am a believer.  I use it daily. First I shampoo and rinse my hair with ordinary shampoo. That way I don&#x27;t need to use nearly as much Nizoral. I apply Nizoral to the main areas I want to manage and leave it on while I finish my shower. Then about five minutes later, I rinse the Nizoral out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of you guys, I have had a receding hairline and thinning hair on the frontal and parietal areas of my scalp since my mid-20s. After coming to this realization and rapidly panicking over the fate of my ever-shinier forehead, I began researching ways to abate the march of baldness over my dome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Propecia, despite its effectiveness, required doctor&#x27;s office visits and involved possible sexual side effects. Rogaine was expensive and messy. Hair plugs were out of the question, both due to cost and the time off involved. So I researched alternative treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were rumors all over the internet that Nizoral regrows hair. I decided to give it a shot. It&#x27;s easy enough, just shampoo every day as you normally would. Nothing to it. Here&#x27;s what happened over the past 6 months:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MONTH 1: My scalp is less oily and less itchy, but I still have some thin hairs that are falling into the sink every morning. I think I can see a bit more scalp every day.&lt;br /&gt;MONTH 2: My first breakthrough. Each passing day, I see fewer and fewer thin hairs in the sink. I have a habit of counting every day...&lt;br /&gt;MONTH 3: My hair just feels thicker. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily look fuller, but at least I don&#x27;t see more scalp each morning in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;MONTH 4: My hair loss has definitely grinded down to a halt at this point. I can pull on my hair like I did in my youth, and not end up with a fist full of fine hairs. It gives me a ton more confidence.&lt;br /&gt;MONTH 5: I may be hallucinating, but I think my hair starts to look fuller. I can definitely run my hands through my hair without shedding anything anymore. I can go a few days without seeing hair on my pillow. This is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;MONTH 6: At this point, I wish I had taken a before picture 6 months ago, because my hair is noticeably thicker and fuller. I can hardly believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really thought I was hallucinating, but these results were shown in a couple of clinical trials as well. There&#x27;s some summaries and photos at Baldinghelp.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I regret I did not start shampooing with Nizoral when I turned 20. This should be a necessity for all men with a history of male pattern baldness!some summaries and photos at Baldinghelp.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I regret I did not start shampooing with Nizoral when I turned 20. This should be a necessity for all men with a history of male pattern baldness!</li>
            <li> Our son has extremely and I mean extremely, horrible itching and flaking of the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I too have had severe scalp flaking ever since my teens. Back then I used Denorex and sometimes the ones with coal tar. But,the coal tar stopped working in my late 20&#x27;s and the Clinical Strength H&amp;S and worked ever since.&lt;br /&gt;Btw, the regular dandruff shampoos does not even faze our scalps!!!!&lt;br /&gt;So with all that said, I figured the strong psoriasis/dermatitis shampoos would work for my son too.&lt;br /&gt;But nothing and I mean nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;He has gorgeous long silky blackened/brown hair.....so every lil&#x27;  flake shows!&lt;br /&gt;He had to wash his hair every morning before school to just to try to wash the loose flakes out.&lt;br /&gt;He was also very careful as to not scratch is head when out in public too. He started having this severe stuff about 3 years ago(he is now 13yrs) Its really been awful for many years now.&lt;br /&gt;He also plays football every fall and his dandruff gets even worse then.&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant and didn&#x27;t want to waste my money on a twenty dollar shampoo...but I am so happy to say he finally is FLAKE FREE!&lt;br /&gt;He used it almost daily at first and now he is down to 2 times a week to control it.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot even express how happy his daddy and I are to have found this!!&lt;br /&gt;Its literally a godsend for him.&lt;br /&gt;(Now, it does not really work for my scalp and it started flaking again when I only used it. I now use it for my thinning hair and I can see a bit more growth. But, I only use it 2 times a week and I had to go back to the stinky H&amp;S Clinical( I have to use a very strong pleasant fragrant conditioner just to over ride the yucky medicinal scent)&lt;br /&gt;But, this stuff smell fabulous! not too girlie or manly...just a perfect soft scent.</li>
            <li> UPDATE got the KETAZON product from Thailand and it&#x27;s IDENTICAL to this for a very good price. Just don&#x27;t expect quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works like advertised, you have to keep using it or the effect will wear off. Once a week seems to be about right, but every other week might work too. Works far better than the competition but it&#x27;s worth the steep price if it&#x27;s effective. 4 stars because the price is so high. The active ingredient is an antifungal compound so those of you saying it works have a fungal infection on your scalp (really). Extremely common during the wet winters in the northwest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Looking again since I&#x27;m close to running out. This seller is ripping people off more than just about anything I have seen on Amazon. When it disappeared I&#x27;m sure they jacked up the price to prey on people who who don&#x27;t know any better. I have no idea why it went away, but the product is exactly the same: Nizoral Shampoo Ketoconazole 2% A-d Anti-dandruff and Itchy Scalp (200ml) [[ASIN:B00BGRGNR0 Nizoral Shampoo Ketoconazole 2% A-d Anti-dandruff and Itchy Scalp (200ml)]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s about the price of this one when I bought it the first time last fall. I am fairly certain that the new product is identical to this one, my guess is they had found some side effects that made it necessary to reformulate it and release it in different packaging. The only way I can actually verify this is to read both labels, so when I do buy the new product I&#x27;ll try to post the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW predatory sellers on Amazon seem to be common these days. If it were any other site I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;d make the sellers conform to reasonable pricing or kick them off.</li>
            <li> Nizoral is a very versatile product.&lt;br /&gt;While it is an excelllent product for dealing with persistant dandruff, it is also very useful for handling skin problems elsewhere on the body.&lt;br /&gt;I have a persistant fungal/staff problem on my chest that this works well in controlling.&lt;br /&gt;It is not strong smelling nor drying to the skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo approximately for $30 for two bottles a year ago.  Well when my scalp is acting up again I was about to buy two more, but I was shocked and furious of the shampoo comany discontinue it to be sold in a pharmacy, and whats worse is that they gouge the price to $200.  No way I will pay premium price for a bottle of shampoo.  So I am forced to use an alternative.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about nine months straight, and I have found it to be very, very good in helping rid me of dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had problems with dandruff for years, and have tried a variety of products (H&amp;S, Selsun Blue, T-Gel), and they&#x27;ve been moderately successful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nizoral has done the best, because my dandruff apparently is a reaction to the yeast/fungus that is on my skin to which I am allergic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and used it frequently at first to get rid of the dandruff/yeast, and tapered off to using it about once a week, between my other shampoos. (I shampoo my hair daily.) For the most part my dandruff is either gone or so minor that it no longer shows. (It&#x27;s also great for shampooing eyebrows and beards/mustaches if you have a problem with dandruff there as well. And if you have flaky eyelashes, it gets rid of the dandruff there, too, but you need to be a bit careful as the shampoo can sting.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with the product is the uncertainty of the purchase price. I&#x27;ve purchased this in the past for about $20-25 for two 7-ounce bottles, but it seems to go out of stock or become rare and the price shoots up to around $60-80 for two bottles, which is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make do with other products while I wait for the price to come down. I don&#x27;t mind paying $10 for a single bottle (I make it last), but I won&#x27;t pay a ridiculous $40 per bottle. I&#x27;ll just use other dandruff shampoos and make do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For that reason alone I&#x27;m dinging it down to a three-star product rather than a five-star.</li>
            <li> Nizoral has become increasingly difficult to find in stores. Is that because it competes too successfully against the other brands? Nizoral is way too expensive, but they can charge what they want, because it works and the others don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Of the many, MANY dandruff shampoos I had tried, the only one that worked well for me was Nizoral. I was more than a bit frantic, then, when McNeill pulled it from the US retail market for over a year. Sure, with a doctor&#x27;s prescription you could get the 2% \\&quot;prescription strength\\&quot;, but it cost more. I eventually discovered UK sellers on Amazon offering the UK retail version (which is the 2% strength) at reasonable prices, and I have been using that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now the US 1% version is back, and Amazon has it for a decent price for the 7-ounce bottle (less than a 4-ounce 2% bottle cost me from the UK.)  Most dandruff shampoos on the US market use pyrithone zinc as the active ingredient. A couple use coal tar or salycilic acid, which can be good for some conditions, but not what I have.  Nizoral is the only one with ketaconazole, and the one that works for me. Note that the instructions suggest that, once you have your dandruff under control, you should use the Nizoral only once or twice a week. I do this, and it seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dandruff for years, and the only solution to keep it under control is ketoconazole, the active ingredient in Nizoral shampoo. After a 4-6 week treatment, the dandruff goes away for several months, up to one year, when it comes back and I need another 4-6 week treatment.&lt;br /&gt;However, I can keep it away indefinitely if I use Nizoral about once a month, following a 4-6 week treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Not ideal, I know, I&#x27;m hooked for life. But Nizoral has the best results, I&#x27;ve used numerous other shampoos and none of them had even temporary results.&lt;br /&gt;I just hope Nizoral will be around for the rest of my life and there won&#x27;t be another shortage!</li>
            <li> Makes my scalp dry which is the last thing I needed from this product. Why would a shampoo for dandruff use sulphate as  ingredient that&#x27;s known to make scalp super dry??... causing dandruff? Makes absolutely no sense to me. I&#x27;ve resolved to using this product on my most affected dandruff spot only to continue to test until finished &amp; use a moisturizing milk shampoo on the rest of scalp.</li>
            <li> i had alot dandfuff and itch dry head. since a little girl. my hair is now more stronger and healthy and NO MORE Dandruff&lt;br /&gt; it worth every penny. thank-you</li>
            <li> I find this product by Nizoral for $43.I was happy that I made a good deal by they never actually deliver the product and after 3 weeks they gave back my money instead of Shampoo!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this product in stores.  This is my husband&#x27;s favorite dandruff shampoo so I was happy to find it online.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  Works like a charm, and I&#x27;ve tried many others.  But why pay this amount  when you can get it at Walgreens or Drugstore.com for much much less.</li>
            <li> works fine for its intended purpose. too bad it&#x27;s harder to find than it used to be. Hope it will sell in Europe some day...</li>
            <li> This kept my hair dandruff free for no more then 8 hours at a time... and if I used it more then twice a week I&#x27;d get rashes from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I bought this originally on amazon for $25... why is it priced so high now?</li>
            <li> To whomever the price gouger is--this is available for a third the price from stocks made in Belgium and sold in the U.S. from other online retailers.  That&#x27;s all you need to put into google.  ;)</li>
            <li> My daughter was suffering from severe hair loss due to dandruff. Though the doctor suggested a number of anti-dandruff treatments nothing seemed to work on her. Me and my wife were very concerned and wanted to try out alternatives. Luckily while browsing one day my wife came across the Nizoral Antidandruff shampoo on Amazon. Since Nizoral is a reputed brand we did not have any issues in letting our daughter try this out. We were amazed at the results. Hair fall decreased considerably and we could see that the fungal growth on the scalp disintegrate in a few weeks time. I am sure that after a few more weeks of using this product, my daughter will get complete relief.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nizoral for a number of years now. I had a dandruff problem since my teens and have tried just about everything available up to the point of discovering this product. I started out by using it as directed, which is twice a week, and in less than two weeks the itching was all but gone, and two weeks later the dandruff was also gone. I then switched to the once a week schedule, and have had no problems since. My scalp was such a problem that even when the barber would spray my hair with anything other than plain water, my scalp would begin itching within the hour. No more problems with that, but I make them use plain water just the same. If you have a scalp problem that just will not go away no matter what you&#x27;ve tried, you really need to try Nizoral. A 7 oz. bottle might seem small, but you only need a tiny amount to shampoo your hair, and since you only use it once a week after the first month, it really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I had a major problem several months ago with seborreic dermatitis in my scalp...severe flaking &amp; itching.  I went many weeks without wearing dark colors &amp; wondering what was wrong.  I finally went to a dermatologist who diagnosed the problem.  He prescribed a steroid shampoo to use for 2 weeks, but after that, my pharmacist recommended Nizoral (over the counter) shampoo.  This shampoo is wonderful!!  I use it 2 times per week, alternating with Selsun Blue (or a store brand) and I haven&#x27;t had any problems in over 6 months.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I ordered Nizoral combined with 5% minoxidil to help with thinning hair. I am currently 6 weeks in to these products and I am more than happy with the results. I use the Nizoral once every 3 days and look forward to using it each time - I feel as if my scalp can breath - very refreshing!</li>
            <li> I used to use this shampoo for five years and I really loved it. After the shortage I tried different shampoos. For now I can say &amp;#34;Selsun Blue Dandruff Shampoo - Medicated&amp;#34; worked also pretty good for me if you are looking for a replacement. I am writing this review because I was so freaked out after this shampoo disappeared from the market 6 months ago and I searched a lot through the web and every where to find a good replacement.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wash my hair a lot, it gets dried out and as its really long, it takes forever to dry so washing it is a big production. After a few days though, my scalp would get really itchy and I had some dandruff issues, and i noticed if i tried to shower without washing my hair, the steam would still get at my scalp and make it itchy, even if I had washed it the day before. I&#x27;ve had no problems after using this stuff. I used it every time I showered for a week or so, and now I use it maybe once a week using regular cheap shampoo every other time. I can let it get as greasy as I want with no other unpleasantness!</li>
            <li> Result is good, my daughter&#x27;s flaky scalp is now much better.  Have to use this shampoo every other day to make it effective.  Otherwise, the flakes comes back with a vengeance.  Nice on hair, makes it shiny and easy to comb.  Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Trying to find this in a store is almost impossible, why? cause it works. If you have curly hair, dry scalp, thick hair that grows fast and itches, man does this stuff work.</li>
            <li> It really works! Buy it, use it, you&#x27;ll love the results!&lt;br /&gt;What should I say? They want me to write more words! :)</li>
            <li> I initially tried this 5 or 6 years ago to control my dry scalp. I found that it made my hair feel thicker too, not a bad plus! Since then I&#x27;ve found out that many suggest Nizoral&#x27;s chemical makeup helps with hair loss...again, not a bad plus! When I noticed my local drug stores were no longer carrying the product a year or two ago I decided to buy several bottles online. Several months ago my supply ran out and I went looking...and was appalled to see how a $15.00 asking price was now over $150 for the same 7 oz bottle.  I have a friend in England who can get it a lot cheaper, but the cost is still well above $15. Like many others who like and used this product, I&#x27;m done, will look for other alternatives.</li>
