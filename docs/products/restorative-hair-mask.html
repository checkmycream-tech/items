            <li>My hair felt soft and smelled great too!</li>
            <li>but my hair is very fine</li>
            <li>I love love love this product!</li>

            <li>I AM IN LOVE WITH IT.</li>
            <li>I mix the hair oil with shea butter to twist my hair and love the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products and none of them worked.</li>
            <li>Then I combed my hair to make sure it was evenly applied.</li>
            <li>When I rinsed it out my hair was in much better condition then the week before when I started using it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My hair is also shiny and feels super soft, and the product smells great!</li>
            <li>Ii is not the first time that I used and love it!</li>
            <li>Its wonderful and makes hair extremely manageable and silky.</li>
            <li>Above all, the Argan Magic hair mask worked amazingly.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li>Although I have only used this product once, it seems to be a good buy.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Argan Magic not expecting much.</li>
            <li>so it gets damaged pretty easily.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has made a tremendous difference.  </li>
            <li>This is the absolute BEST that I have found, and I have tried many different brands over the years at both mid and high end.</li>
            <li>It is kind of a pain to have to shampoo, then towel dry, THEN apply the mask, but it is way worth it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t do it right the first time because I just slathered it on without leaving it on for 15 mins.</li>
            <li>I recommend this over most hair mask because it&#x27;s works just as great as the expensive hair mask.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft, smooth and detangled.</li>
            <li>When I first tried it, it didn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
            <li>I have been trying various hair conditioners for sometime now and accidentally came across Argan Magic.</li>
            <li>A bit of research identified the probable culprit as exactly that.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that&#x27;s changed in my hair care is the addition of the Argan Magic Restorative Hair Mask.  </li>
            <li>Definitely will be getting more</li>
            <li>If you blow dry or use a straightening iron after use, hair looks super smooth.</li>
            <li>so my hair needed some TLC, certainly gor it with htis product.</li>
            <li>This really hydrates the hair.</li>
            <li>Really helps the shine come through.  </li>
            <li>Untangles my daughter&#x27;s very curly hair, and conditions very well.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, the dosages are much lower than in the beginning, so the problem should take care of itself, once I no longer have to take this stuff, so the question became what might help, in the meantime.  </li>
            <li>This product is the real deal.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally dry and this leaves my hair softer, much healthier looking and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>But now I am glad I took a chance with this product because I didn&#x27;t think it actually would work, but it did and I&#x27;m definitely using this in my hair care routine.</li>
            <li>Recently, I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair a lot with most recently getting my hair bleached and becoming blonde which obviously damaged my hair.</li>
            <li>It actually worked in the first time of use!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very moisturizing and not harsh at all.</li>
            <li>I shampoo then put on a generous amount and leave it on under a shower cap for about 10-15 minutes, rinse with the warm water, then at the end of my shower, rinse it with cold water which keeps my hair looking shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>When I finally had a change to have that much time it worked!</li>
            <li>I bought this hair mask hoping that it will smooth out my hair a little.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely hooked and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It works like a regular conditioner that normally costs about $4 a bottle.</li>
            <li>but the Bedhead one was not as moisturizing and thick as I would have liked and Wen is extremely pricey.</li>
            <li>If I use a different conditioner than this and then straighten with a flat iron, it looks nowhere near as silky and soft as when I use this one.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I washed my hair,towel dried it and applied the conditioner.</li>

            <li> , I went through a lot of where my hair started to get very weak, looked damaged and even though I used Organic coconut oil, which helped a little but took weeks to see a difference in my hair to actually looking healthy and feeling soft, also I had to trim my ends just</li>
            <li> so I could actually not have to deal with that part of my damaged, split, &amp; dry ends.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s long</li>
            <li> .. seems like a regular conditioner,  not really a mask..</li>
            <li> I have medium length dry hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even leave it on the full 10 minutes and the damage in my hair is not only visibly reduced, but I can barely feel the rough areas that were suffering so badly.</li>
            <li> I am half white, half asian.</li>
            <li> A few days later  I used it again</li>
            <li> I actually first purchased on a fluke at a drugstore after purchasing an expensive salon brand that did not help my hair at all.</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve researched, people usually use these products on African hair</li>
            <li> I found this at a discount store (TJ Maxx) and decided to give it a try the other day.</li>
            <li> but lately I&#x27;ve been using a lot of African hair products on my hair</li>
            <li> Not for black women with relaxers.</li>
            <li> I have used Bedhead Dumb Blonde Reconstructor and Wen, they both worked well</li>
            <li> The mask is a bit heavy</li>
            <li> My hair no longer looks like straw--very dead straw.  </li>
            <li> Its a waste of money, mine is just sitting in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> After years of abusing my hair with coloring,perms etc it had lost its luster and was dead.</li>
            <li> Instead, it&#x27;s regained its shine and softness in a matter of three weeks, using this conditioner twice a week, followed by my usual leave-in conditioners.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for years with very little damage, so when it started splitting, breaking, and losing all its shine and manageability a few months ago, I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was going on until my stylist suggested that it might be the results of medications I was prescribed for some serious health issues.  </li>
            <li> After having my hair severely damaged by a stylist over a year ago, I&#x27;ve been trying in vain to combat the sad remnants of my hair.</li>
            <li> its very thin consistency and doesn&#x27;t feel moisturizing or like it&#x27;s penetrating the hair shaft at all.</li>
            <li> Horrible shampoo.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not for black women with relaxers. Your hair will feel like you washed it with dish washing liquid.  I would give it zero stars if I could.</li>
            <li> LOVE this! I actually first purchased on a fluke at a drugstore after purchasing an expensive salon brand that did not help my hair at all. I love to get highlights, change colors, straighten my curls, etc. so my hair definitely needs a quality conditioner to restore it. This is the absolute BEST that I have found, and I have tried many different brands over the years at both mid and high end. My hair is naturally dry and this leaves my hair softer, much healthier looking and easy to work with. If I use a different conditioner than this and then straighten with a flat iron, it looks nowhere near as silky and soft as when I use this one. Also, the scent is nice, not over powering at all.</li>
            <li> Simply a wonderful product.  A must have. It leaves my hair so soft, smooth and detangled.</li>
            <li> So I tried this product today, and I got to say, I AM IN LOVE WITH IT. It actually worked in the first time of use! I cannot believe it but I&#x27;m impressed. To tell you about my hair type, I actually been one who has bleached their hair for about 1yr, I went through a lot of where my hair started to get very weak, looked damaged and even though I used Organic coconut oil, which helped a little but took weeks to see a difference in my hair to actually looking healthy and feeling soft, also I had to trim my ends just so I could actually not have to deal with that part of my damaged, split, &amp; dry ends. But now I am glad I took a chance with this product because I didn&#x27;t think it actually would work, but it did and I&#x27;m definitely using this in my hair care routine. A MUST HAVE!! (And it smells GREAT!)</li>
            <li> I have medium length dry hair. I bought this hair mask hoping that it will smooth out my hair a little.  I followed instructions on bottle and used in on my hair twice this week.  Both times I didn&#x27;t see any difference.  It works like a regular conditioner that normally costs about $4 a bottle.</li>
            <li> Ii is not the first time that I used and love it! This really hydrates the hair. I use after washing my hair and than rinse it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend, especially if your hair is color treated or permed.  Really helps the shine come through.  It is a good product and this was a very good price for the size.</li>
            <li> Although I have only used this product once, it seems to be a good buy.  The mask is a bit heavy but I still like it.</li>
            <li> I have seen this product at discount stores multiple times and decided to look up the reviews. The reviews on this product seem good so I went ahead and bought it at Marshalls for I believe was $7.99. From what I&#x27;ve researched, people usually use these products on African hair but lately I&#x27;ve been using a lot of African hair products on my hair and I love them! They&#x27;re very moisturizing and not harsh at all. I am half white, half asian. I have a lot of hair but my hair is very fine and it&#x27;s long so it gets damaged pretty easily. Recently, I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair a lot with most recently getting my hair bleached and becoming blonde which obviously damaged my hair. I also use purple shampoo to keep the brassiness away which can also be drying. I have used Bedhead Dumb Blonde Reconstructor and Wen, they both worked well but the Bedhead one was not as moisturizing and thick as I would have liked and Wen is extremely pricey. Above all, the Argan Magic hair mask worked amazingly. I shampoo then put on a generous amount and leave it on under a shower cap for about 10-15 minutes, rinse with the warm water, then at the end of my shower, rinse it with cold water which keeps my hair looking shiny and smooth. After my shower and I&#x27;ve towel-dried my hair so it&#x27;s still damp, I follow it up with applying Organix Nourishing Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum which makes it even softer and helps with breakage.  It also smells great, I can&#x27;t stop smelling my hair! I&#x27;m definitely hooked and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Horrible shampoo.  Left red welts on my daughter&#x27;s scalp.  Didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li> Got this at tj maxx.. Did not notIce any difference in my hair.. seems like a regular conditioner,  not really a mask..its very thin consistency and doesn&#x27;t feel moisturizing or like it&#x27;s penetrating the hair shaft at all. A couple of stars for smelling good though :)</li>
            <li> When I first tried it, it didn&#x27;t seem to work. I didn&#x27;t do it right the first time because I just slathered it on without leaving it on for 15 mins. When I finally had a change to have that much time it worked! This is an amazing product and will continue to buy this product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Untangles my daughter&#x27;s very curly hair, and conditions very well.</li>
            <li> I have been trying various hair conditioners for sometime now and accidentally came across Argan Magic. Its wonderful and makes hair extremely manageable and silky. If you blow dry or use a straightening iron after use, hair looks super smooth. Also reduces frizz.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a change in my hair it felt the same. Its a waste of money, mine is just sitting in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> Bought at TJMaxx, it left my hair silky and shiny. I have a japanese straightening perm and have been in the pool a lot so my hair needed some TLC, certainly gor it with htis product.</li>
            <li> Its works so great and its so underpriced.  I recommend this over most hair mask because it&#x27;s works just as great as the expensive hair mask. It&#x27;s works just like they say it does.</li>
            <li> great seller, great product</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a year and it has done WONDERS for my hair.  I mix the hair oil with shea butter to twist my hair and love the results.</li>
            <li> This product is the real deal. After years of abusing my hair with coloring,perms etc it had lost its luster and was dead.I&#x27;ve tried many products and none of them worked.I ordered Argan Magic not expecting much.The first time I used it I washed my hair,towel dried it and applied the conditioner.Then I combed my hair to make sure it was evenly applied.I left it on for 6 hours and when I rinsed it out I could see a big improvement.My hair felt soft and smelled great too! A few days later  I used it again and I left it on even longer-8hours.Four days later I did something I never did before in my life,I left it on all day and through the night.When I rinsed it out my hair was in much better condition then the week before when I started using it. I love love love this product!</li>
            <li> I love it. Definitely will be getting more</li>
