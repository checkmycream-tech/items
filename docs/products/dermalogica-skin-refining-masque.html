            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin too much and is gentle.  </li>
            <li>and it helps keep my skin clear and glowing.</li>

            <li>I like this mask so far, I just need to train myself not to constantly picking on my face.</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re not using it often because you&#x27;re busy (or whatever the case may be), I&#x27;d recommend shaking it for a few seconds to keep the liquid from separating from the clay.</li>
            <li> after I wash my face, let it dry while I brush my teeth, then wash off</li>
            <li> Just need to add moisturizer afterward since it does tend to dry you out a bit by pulling out all the junk from your pores using clay.</li>
            <li> With the use of this mask, the pre-cleanse, toner, and active moist my face is finally clearing up and staying under control.  </li>
            <li> I use this mask about every other day as recommended and it zaps my zits away.  </li>
            <li> I use the Active Moist moisturizer afterwards as it hydrates without making me all oily.</li>
            <li> I have been having trouble with adult acne for the past few years and</li>
            <li> It seems not good enough for the price.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause my sensitive skin to get red or angry, either!</li>
            <li> I bitched a little about having to use something so often, but I do this  </li>
            <li> Even though I should be past the stage of breakouts, I use this about once a week</li>
            <li> And because I buy on Amazon it is actually not that bad</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot, just a thin layer on your face after you wash it.</li>
            <li> Somewhat disappointed as this stuff is not cheap</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not as bad as I thought.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this mask so far, I just need to train myself not to constantly picking on my face.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I am prone to blackheads so at the suggestion of my esthetician I use this stuff once every three days. You don&#x27;t need a lot, just a thin layer on your face after you wash it. This way it dries quickly. I bitched a little about having to use something so often, but I do this  after I wash my face, let it dry while I brush my teeth, then wash off so it&#x27;s not as bad as I thought. Lasts pretty long too when you don&#x27;t over do it like most people (including myself) usually do with masques. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has helped a lot with my blackheads and reduced the size of my pores. Great stuff and I highly recommend it. I use the Active Moist moisturizer afterwards as it hydrates without making me all oily. After all the skin products I have tried from Chanel, to Clinique, to Neutrogena, and Oil of Olay, this is by far my favorite stuff. And because I buy on Amazon it is actually not that bad $$ wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the face wash I use dermalogica anti-bac skin wash. As for wrinkles around my eyes and my stressed out forehead wrinkles I now use ROC Retinol Correxion DEEP WRINKLE Daily Moisturizer</li>
            <li> I have been having trouble with adult acne for the past few years and I LOVE Dermalogica!  Their products are gentle yet effective.  I use this mask about every other day as recommended and it zaps my zits away.  With the use of this mask, the pre-cleanse, toner, and active moist my face is finally clearing up and staying under control.  The mask works really great for applying to pimples when they first start to show up to minimize/kill breakouts.</li>
            <li> This masque makes my skin feel really good. It seems to (temporarily) make my skin feel really fresh and tight. I&#x27;d recommend this masque.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend use for men also-- my face is smoother after a few uses and combined with a skin-care plan, it is a great addition.  If you&#x27;re not using it often because you&#x27;re busy (or whatever the case may be), I&#x27;d recommend shaking it for a few seconds to keep the liquid from separating from the clay.</li>
            <li> it was fab i really luv this produck and the senstive skin line i luv everything thing there in their product line</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  I have very sensitive skin - and many products cause me to break out.  After using this masque, my blackheads are visibly cleared and my pores are smaller.  Even though I should be past the stage of breakouts, I use this about once a week and it helps keep my skin clear and glowing.</li>
            <li> Good product, I would buy it again if necessary.</li>
            <li> Made my skin even more oily.</li>
            <li> This refining masque is the best i have ever bought. Can&#x27;t live w/ out it, honestly! I have really oily skin and this products makes my skin feel very clean.</li>

            <li> REALLY helps with pores and keeping them clean.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin too much and is gentle.  Very happy with all Dermalogica products.</li>
            <li> I love this masque. I use it 2x a week and then for spot treatment. I also use my Mia scrubber with the Dermalogica exfoliator to take off this mask to really get a scrubbed, fresh face.</li>
            <li> but honestly, I like my drugstore green-tea masque much better.  It seems not good enough for the price.  The cleanser is much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken me years to find something to work for my skin no this works great. I use it just once a week along with the face wash and moisturizer.</li>
