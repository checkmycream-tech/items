            <li>happy with the product thanks!</li>
            <li>Cool item got here at a good time</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>Love not needing to buy batteries.</li>
            <li>The bits didn&#x27;t even fit into the drill!</li>
            <li>Glad I could return it.</li>
            <li>It does not have to much power but its a great starter drill.</li>
            <li>But better than the Walmart battery one.</li>
            <li>it didnt work but it was cute</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>When this product works, okay.</li>
            <li>Mine is mostly used at home.</li>
            <li>but for the price its OK.</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>Great price, easy to use, work really well.</li>
            <li>pretty good for the price.  </li>
            <li>Love love love makes diy full sets a breeze.</li>
            <li>For the same price as a battery operated nail drill, this outlet set does a very good job as a filing and buffing tool.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to purchase this due to the reviews however the product works great!</li>
            <li>At first I thought this machine was going to be cheap and flimsy based on the fact that I sent under 15 dollars, but it is amazing.</li>
            <li>This little drill works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>Nice cute little manicure nail drill very strong easy to use love it.</li>
            <li>The speed settings are great, the only downside is that the plug comes out sometimes while filing.</li>
            <li>Overall its great for the price.</li>
            <li>you get what you pay for it&#x27;s crapthird time using it and it stopped working had to go buy a cord from Radio Shack to fit it now</li>
            <li>And so far so good.</li>
            <li>product arrived as displayed... came with everything described,  was really excited until i plugged it in to use</li>
            <li>I love it, it certainly gets the job done.</li>
            <li>But the color was much darker than the picture but its ok.</li>
            <li>However the drill bits wear very easily and need to be replaced frequently.</li>
            <li>this product gets very hot when using for longer periods of time.</li>
            <li>Overall very good for personal use.</li>
            <li>For the price its good quality nail tool and its pink</li>
            <li>Its durable and packs a powerful punch.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t even worth the $8,sorry but do not buy this</li>
            <li>And the price is so worth it.</li>
            <li>it came right on time</li>
            <li>Spend a little more and buy a better brand</li>
            <li>Spend the extra money and get something better.</li>
            <li>Stopped working the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>its very goo quality and as strong as professional nail salon filers.</li>
            <li>Came earlier than expected and works great.</li>
            <li>good product the only thing the cord is short</li>
            <li>Its cheap and when you use it for too long it gets super heated.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it would even be strong enough for real nails.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast</li>
            <li>Not too fast but sturdy.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it that much</li>
            <li>I was getting too much skin around my toes and my toes were to straight across.  </li>
            <li>but they were still growing too straight and trying to become ingrown.  </li>
            <li>My real issue is it broke in 2 months.</li>
            <li>However it is very powerful and definitely gets the job done.</li>
            <li>This product is more decent than I had expected it to be.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it for professional use though as it might not be powerful enough to use on multilple clients a day.</li>
            <li>It was a little tricky to get the bit in at first but figured it out quickly.</li>
            <li>Iota okay heats up a lot thought and the Hard work to put the tools in</li>
            <li>Use it 2 times very weak,no power with third use just felt apart</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it about 10 times and my nails come out looking professional.</li>
            <li>yes, this does need frequent &amp;#34;cool down&amp;#34; periods, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>but my drill whole wasn&#x27;t big enough for the tools to go in there</li>
            <li>Works good, but when you press down to use one of the attachments, it will either slow down considerably or just stop altogether.</li>
            <li>It only rotates one way (which is fine for one hand, but can awkward for the other), and that&#x27;s fine.</li>

            <li> At first putting the drill bits in was a bit confusing because the instructions that comes with it states one thing but online tells you the correct way to insert the drill bits.  </li>
            <li> Its not a professional drill like the ones in the nail salon</li>
            <li> Definitely not a professional one ..</li>
            <li> I am not a professional but have worn acrylic nails for years.  </li>
            <li> Plug continually falls out and when it does stay in will only work when upside down.</li>
            <li> I wanted it just to file and shape my nails as I have some hand problems, but this is not much help.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not strong enough to drill gel polish off of acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> A lil weak but worth the money your not supposed to press hard on your nail anyway</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> After only 3 uses in 3 months this thing had went wonky on me.</li>
            <li> a little morebut  </li>
            <li> THE PIECES DO NOT FIT IN THE DRILL...</li>
            <li> What a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I use it on my virgin nails and also on acrylic without any trouble.</li>
            <li> The bits for the drill does not fit.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Unless I&#x27;m being lazy, I&#x27;ll probably never go to the nail salon again.</li>
            <li> so that sucks.</li>
            <li> It actually sucks.</li>
            <li> Thanks for selling a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve gotten ones that were so weak they would hardly work.</li>
            <li> The base will overheat if kept going for a long time, which is unlikely to happen if it&#x27;s for personal use.</li>
            <li> Only bad thing is it over heats.</li>
            <li> I returned this item because it was of poor quality.  </li>
            <li> It was difficult to put together to use.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> I tried cutting and fling</li>
            <li> Vert disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worked on 2 nails and crapped out on me :(</li>
            <li> Piece of crap broke after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed !</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!</li>
            <li> This product was terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> For the price its good quality nail tool and its pink</li>
            <li> shipping was fast but I wish it would have say you cannot charge it. It must be plugged in to work at the sametime</li>
            <li> Will never buy again great shipping but my drill whole wasn&#x27;t big enough for the tools to go in there don&#x27;t buy it&#x27;s a waist of money</li>
            <li> We used it once and now it does not work at all. Very disappointed !</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this. Not too fast but sturdy. Love not needing to buy batteries.</li>
            <li> Love it! Unless I&#x27;m being lazy, I&#x27;ll probably never go to the nail salon again. It works great!</li>
            <li> This product is more decent than I had expected it to be. However it is very powerful and definitely gets the job done. However the drill bits wear very easily and need to be replaced frequently. Also be away this product gets very hot when using for longer periods of time. I recommend doing a couple of nails then taking a couple minutes break before proceeding.</li>
            <li> It works amazing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Used one time and motor went out</li>
            <li> THE PIECES DO NOT FIT IN THE DRILL... VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!! Also drill only worked once</li>
            <li> Vert disappointed. Use it 2 times very weak,no power with third use just felt apart&lt;br /&gt;I dont recommended for any type of nails</li>
            <li> Nice cute little manicure nail drill very strong easy to use love it.</li>
            <li> good product the only thing the cord is short so yo have to be close to the wall.</li>
            <li> Works good, but when you press down to use one of the attachments, it will either slow down considerably or just stop altogether.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for....</li>
            <li> The bits didn&#x27;t even fit into the drill! What a waste of time. Glad I could return it. Spend the extra money and get something better.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it that much but it seems to do the job</li>
            <li> This is the perfect first tome drill. It does not have to much power but its a great starter drill. Im very pleased with Mine</li>
            <li> I wrote a review glorifying this product and now a week later it just stopped working !! you get what u pay for</li>
            <li> Great drill. Works like the nail salon drills.</li>
            <li> Just got it today. And so far so good. I did my husbands nails lol and it&#x27;s awesome. Only bad thing is it over heats. and when it does it stops! so that sucks. But better than the Walmart battery one.</li>
            <li> Great price, easy to use, work really well.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this machine was going to be cheap and flimsy based on the fact that I sent under 15 dollars, but it is amazing. Its durable and packs a powerful punch. I&#x27;ve used it about 10 times and my nails come out looking professional. I&#x27;m so happy I purchased it. Shipping was great received the product in 2 days and it was packaged amazingly. I&#x27;d defiantly recommend this drill for anyone that&#x27;s into keeping their nails of Fleek</li>
            <li> I use this when I do my own acrylic nails and it worked great. It was a little tricky to get the bit in at first but figured it out quickly.</li>
            <li> product arrived as displayed... came with everything described,  was really excited until i plugged it in to use and it wouldn&#x27;t work. i even tried using every outlet i had in the house with the same result. Very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> it didnt work but it was cute</li>
            <li> Piece of crap broke after 3 uses. Save your money and your dignity.</li>
            <li> This product was terrible.</li>
            <li> I love it!  I just did a great pedicure.  I have tiny feet and have never could seem to shape my toes well.  I was getting too much skin around my toes and my toes were to straight across.  I tried cutting and fling but they were still growing too straight and trying to become ingrown.  I used this and all the extra skin is gone and the toes are shaped.  I really love it.</li>
            <li> When this product works, okay. It only rotates one way (which is fine for one hand, but can awkward for the other), and that&#x27;s fine. My real issue is it broke in 2 months.</li>
            <li> Great service!!! Its not a professional drill like the ones in the nail salon but it works great for that price.</li>
            <li> It does not work properly, it goes off within 1 min, don&#x27;t even worth the $8,sorry but do not buy this is a waiste of money....</li>
            <li> Great product that I recommend.</li>
            <li> For the same price as a battery operated nail drill, this outlet set does a very good job as a filing and buffing tool. There are no foot pedals to fuss with as the power function and the speed adjustments are controlled by the same switch. Overall very good for personal use. I would not recommend it for professional use though as it might not be powerful enough to use on multilple clients a day. The base will overheat if kept going for a long time, which is unlikely to happen if it&#x27;s for personal use.</li>
            <li> Worked on 2 nails and crapped out on me :( Ordering a different one..</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected and works great. But the color was much darker than the picture but its ok.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to put together to use. I wanted it just to file and shape my nails as I have some hand problems, but this is not much help.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Can&#x27;t go wrong here. Works so well</li>
            <li> Iota okay heats up a lot thought and the Hard work to put the tools in</li>
            <li> Stopped working the first time I used it. Spend a little more and buy a better brand</li>
            <li> I returned this item because it was of poor quality.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this due to the reviews however the product works great! its very goo quality and as strong as professional nail salon filers. I use it on my virgin nails and also on acrylic without any trouble. Honest seller, I will recommend this product.</li>
            <li> pretty good for the price.  yes, this does need frequent &amp;#34;cool down&amp;#34; periods, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This works amazingly! In the past I&#x27;ve gotten ones that were so weak they would hardly work. This one is perfect. And the price is so worth it.</li>
            <li> The drill came on time but it&#x27;s not strong enough to drill gel polish off of acrylic nails. It actually sucks. I don&#x27;t think it would even be strong enough for real nails.</li>
            <li> I love it, it certainly gets the job done. Mine is mostly used at home. The speed settings are great, the only downside is that the plug comes out sometimes while filing. Overall its great for the price.</li>
            <li> like it to touch up between appointments</li>
            <li> This drilling set is definitely what you paid for. Its cheap and when you use it for too long it gets super heated. Also the tips dont work. they dont file that great.. but for the price its OK. Definitely not a professional one .. at home use only is recommended.</li>
            <li> The bits for the drill does not fit. Waste of my money. Thanks for selling a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Cool item got here at a good time wish there was a guide and info for replacement pieces like the nail file heads ...?</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! Only reason I said 4 stars and not 5 is the sanding bit was bent and unusable.   ************UPDATE*********** After only 3 uses in 3 months this thing had went wonky on me. Plug continually falls out and when it does stay in will only work when upside down.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for it&#x27;s crapthird time using it and it stopped working had to go buy a cord from Radio Shack to fit it now I can&#x27;t seem to change the speed you&#x27;re better off buying a nice $40 one so you won&#x27;t have to buy the cord cuz then that&#x27;s about what you dish outactually a little morebut  since then I have been using it to do my mother&#x27;s and my nails acrylic and it kind of works</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! It&#x27;s does the job!</li>
            <li> happy with the product thanks!</li>
            <li> It works but it unscrews a lot</li>
            <li> A lil weak but worth the money your not supposed to press hard on your nail anyway it&#x27;s good for beginners</li>
            <li> love it came right on time</li>
            <li> I am not a professional but have worn acrylic nails for years.  By watching my manicurist I felt as though I could do it myself. This little drill works wonderfully.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work as well as it does but it is amazing.  At first putting the drill bits in was a bit confusing because the instructions that comes with it states one thing but online tells you the correct way to insert the drill bits.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love love love makes diy full sets a breeze.</li>
