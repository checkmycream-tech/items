            <li> this brush helps curl my hair when i blow dry it out. love it.</li>
            <li> WHERE I WAS WHEN THIS INVENTED !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it takes me 20 min to do my wavy hair perfectly ( previously 40 min)</li>
            <li> Love this brush it is a boar brush and it works wonderfully</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended thus brush. Works great, leaves hair very smooth, especially if you use it with an ionic hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Looked like a professional blow out</li>
            <li> Love this brush, I have tried many in the past.</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome.  Had similar brushes &amp; didn&#x27;t think there would be much difference but I was wrong, they make such a difference!  Make straightening my hair so easy.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, it helps with a great blowout. I plan to buy more in different sizes.  Buy it</li>
            <li> Works great without tangling in your hair.  The thermal feature keeps the curl longer.  I keep one in the camper and one at home.</li>
            <li> Excellent Hair brush just the perfect size for shoulder length hair. Straightens hair quickly. My professional hairdresser uses it on me!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!  After waiting 10 days for the product to finally arrive (beyond the estimated ship date), I opened the envelope to find the brush with a big dent on one side.  I have no idea why they would ship an item like this in an envelope instead of a box.  Now I have to waste my time returning it.  Then I will just head to a store to buy a similar brush.  Wish I would have done that in the first place instead of ordering online.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in addition to the 370 (1 1/2 inch) that I have been using for years.  I have tried many other types of round brushes and they just don&#x27;t compare to the Technique brushes.</li>
            <li> The brush pictured is not the brush I got.  I received a non ionic boar bristle brush.  It&#x27;s a nice brush but not what I wanted or ordered!  Also not a concave brush.  :(</li>
            <li> Awful do not buy. I went to a beauty store and bought a real Cricket it looks nothing like the one I purchased. I bought this brush and they sent a different one.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever...a must have!</li>
            <li> Item as described and shipped on time</li>
            <li> These are the BEST brushes ever. Have used this brand now for close to 15 years. Makes your hair super smooth.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair. It&#x27;s light weight and easy to move through my hair. You&#x27;ll love it too especially like the red handle.</li>
            <li> Perfect, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Best brush on the market.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! It glides through the hair and does not get tangled around the brush like other brushes. Drying time is reduced by 50%. Highly recommend for all hair types but especially those who want to straighten curly hair!!!</li>
            <li> Really Helps with Static, is lightweight and easy to maneuver. Glad I chose this one. Arrived well packaged and on time.</li>
            <li> Does a great job and gets really hot so your hair dries quicker! Love it!,</li>
            <li> This brush is great on my hair.  I am easily able to lift and dry my hair with the use of this brush: designed to fit well in your hand.  It was much less expensive through this site than through the salon.  I bought one for my daughter too.</li>
            <li> Pulls on my hair too much and leaves my hair staticy every time.</li>
            <li> The rubber on the handle caught my hair and it hurt!</li>
