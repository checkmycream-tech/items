I too was reluctant when I first purchased the dryer as it is heavier than most models, the nozzle is wider than most models, and without the extender looks like a travel dryer you&#x27;d get in a hotel room.  But nothing polishes my hair like this dryer.  I have medium wavy hair and my hair tends to hold moisture.  This dryer dries my hair easily in 15-20 min.
