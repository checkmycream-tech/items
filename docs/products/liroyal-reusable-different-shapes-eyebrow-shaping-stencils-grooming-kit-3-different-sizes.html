            <li>Love the templates!</li>
            <li>it makes my eyebrows look pretty and perfect nice..</li>
            <li>so like I said grow your own eyebrows in and pluck them to a style u like your better off trust me on that!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>they really help me draw my eyebrows perfect</li>
            <li>you get a variety of shapes which is nice.</li>
            <li>ELF has a nice kit as does NYX...</li>
            <li>they have 4 nice shape and size configurations so you can use what fits your face.</li>
            <li>but someone without eyebrows sure it would do good</li>
            <li>And it seems the best way to get it to draw is to draw straight on instead of an angle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s some kind of instructions or something on them, but I can&#x27;t make it out ...</li>
            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>Good &amp; sturdy, great for shaping, non sticky(good for people who likes to apply makeup first before there brows) .</li>
            <li>I guess if you&#x27;re trying out to be a clown or if you have a super huge head these will be perfect for you...</li>
            <li>These are very cool!</li>
            <li>it is very easy to use and durable  </li>
            <li>These ones are okay, they kind of work like the ELF ones.</li>
            <li>Great for the right faceâ˜ºðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>I mostly just use them to the B section and fill in the rest on my own to give an more defined arch shape.</li>
            <li>amazing product and easy to use.</li>
            <li>These are huge!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m getting better every day</li>
            <li>so maybe I won&#x27;t need them forever anyway :)&lt;</li>
            <li>NICE FIT OVER EYEBROW.</li>
            <li>Suggestion is to research and/or ask a skilled person who does the eyebrows for the additional tools to assist with perfecting the eyebrows or research online before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not too sure on how to use them</li>
            <li>to better help you understand the product</li>
            <li>they came and i love them..</li>
            <li>All 3 of my girls love them.</li>
            <li>This product is okay</li>
            <li>Omg i love these.</li>
            <li>I finally found the Perfect match for my eyebrows...</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my eyes brows look.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>SO MUCH BETTER</li>
            <li>especially that i like everything perfect..</li>
            <li>i love it..</li>
            <li>I only have 7 words for this wonderful product: &amp;#34;where</li>
            <li>The stencils are ok</li>
            <li>I absolutely love them, they always come before the estimated shipping date as well.</li>
            <li>Would buy from the seller again love how the shaping stencils work on my eyebrow love how they look</li>
            <li>**:)</li>
            <li>love it works</li>
            <li>This helps me a lot to make sure my eyebrows have the correct size to them.</li>
            <li>&#x27;Not quite sure about these things.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>Thicker &#x3D; lasts or thinner ones and buy more often.  </li>
            <li>OKAY</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty good bt</li>
            <li>Nice to have in your make up case very sturdy and nice variety of style</li>
            <li>Its a cool thought and assistance  to those interesting in attempting to have the perfect eyebrow similar to browing by the professionals.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to hold and really does help apply product to the eyebrows leaving them nice and neat!</li>
            <li>i was a perfect fit :) much more than i expected all tho</li>
            <li>They were cheap and seem to be okay.</li>
            <li>However, there are other tools needed to assist with creating the perfect eyebrows, which does not come with this product.</li>
            <li>Easy for guidance on trimming eyebrows too.</li>
            <li>easy to follow and mine</li>
            <li>so I was very excited about finding a stencil that was just right!</li>
            <li>Very easily lost, shapes dont look that different, good idea if i could see markings on stencil.</li>
            <li>if u can hold the stencil still, it works fine.</li>
            <li>Cheap easy to use and works fantastic</li>
            <li>These things seem way too huge for my face.</li>
            <li>I bought these months ago and have not used them at all because they&#x27;re obnoxiously huge (like 1.5x longer than I can imagine anyone wanting their brows).</li>
            <li>but still theyd have to be drawn in huge in order to take the shape.</li>
            <li>You should get them if you&#x27;re looking for something cheap.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really fit my eyebrow shape but think it would prob work well for someone else.</li>
            <li>None of them fit my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy I only paid $.90 for them.</li>
            <li>They were cheap</li>
            <li>This stencil is cheap.  </li>
            <li>will not mention brand name start with A. so far so good</li>
            <li>came out great, thanks, fast shipping time too.</li>
            <li>With 4 kids my patients are low to make sure my eyebrows look good</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery!!!</li>
            <li>good product for larger faces, and sturdy material pretty shapes and was shipped nicely.</li>
            <li>When I first got the package, the smallest one was on top of the sealed package</li>
            <li>but so worth the money and wait!</li>
            <li>love these and recommend them to anyone who wants to shape their eye brows themselves!</li>
            <li>and I was excited to use it</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>2/5 stars mostly because it&#x27;s so much work to keep on face and make both brown outlines even.....</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Still not bad for $1 and some change.</li>
            <li>They where not bad at all.</li>
            <li>It took me a minute to get my eyebrow to fit right.</li>
            <li>product was quick and easy and very inexpensive!</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend for someone who struggles making perfect equal eyebrows (like me)</li>
            <li>They are very flexible and easy to hold and bend on your eyebrow.</li>
            <li>Way too big for my use...even the smallest one is HUGE!!</li>
            <li>these can&#x27;t even be modified in any way so that i could make use of these...better off making your own out of colored paper or some other semi-hard material that can be easily cut to shape.</li>
            <li>However, the stencil itself is huge; the whole piece and the eyebrow shape.</li>
            <li>but the product was worth the price</li>
            <li>definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>The indicators on the stencils will help anyone find their &#x27;golden ration&#x27;.</li>
            <li>but it was WELL worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I blend the tail and front parts out for a more natural look.</li>
            <li>Worth the price, I think.</li>
            <li>This product is ok easpecially for such cheap price.</li>
            <li>Therefore, it worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I wish there was some sort of adhesive, and they were a bit more flexible, but for the price they work okay -- and they arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>but maybe I&#x27;m just using them right</li>
            <li>but I find that the brows on the stencil are very large.  </li>
            <li>I liked the idea of having different options; however, they are all for very thing eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The contour of the lines are appropriate, however the material it is made from is smooth on one side and &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; on the other.</li>
            <li>Reading the other reviews, I expected these to be planetary in size, but they are actually pretty damn perfect.</li>
            <li>took a while to get but it came from china they are ok but the length is too short</li>
            <li>I love the idea of these eyebrow stencils, but the ones I purchased were WAY too big for my face.</li>
            <li>I gave them away the first time</li>
            <li>time adhesive for fitting purposes only for color aaplication.</li>
            <li>Overall, its good with a small piece of tape at the top for symmetry.  </li>
            <li>Arched my own with these, less trips to the salon</li>
            <li>Alittle hard to use but otherwise good product.</li>
            <li>She can&#x27;t stop talking about how much she loves it.</li>
            <li>but they seem very helpful.</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s face is different and but one of these will certainly fit everyone.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>this is really ridiculous!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>These stencils don&#x27;t really look like the picture.</li>
            <li>For someone who can&#x27;t draw eyebrows, these work really well</li>
            <li>as soon as i got these in the mail i tried it out and it works really well</li>
            <li>i just learned to overfill then go back and clean it up</li>
            <li>purchased this product at full price for personal use*</li>
            <li>Live and learn!</li>
            <li>Really not that easy to use as one might think</li>
            <li>Instant symmetry, and you&#x27;ll love how it drastically improves your overall look.</li>
            <li>So I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>i must say i wish a little more instuctions</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s kind of hard to hold</li>
            <li>I got these because naturally my brows do not have much shape to them</li>
            <li>Helped me to make my eyebrow by myself but it is not like a professional doing, but it really helps.</li>
            <li>I have a normal size face/head</li>
            <li>not sure if i will be able to most if not all of them are way way way too big for my face... and my brows that i have are similar in shape to three of them</li>
            <li>I think I paid less than a dollar for this and the shipping was free (took a long time, but hey, it was free).</li>
            <li>not the right size for a real human face</li>
            <li>The picture is what you get,  should&#x27;ve analyzed it a little better as far as the arch.</li>
            <li>Good idea in theory but these stencils only work if your eyebrows aren&#x27;t that thick.</li>
            <li>2 of them look pretty similar</li>
            <li>and they wanted $20 for the same exact</li>
            <li>These took a long time to come but they were worth the wait.</li>
            <li>They are hard to use, I guess if given time and practice it may get better, but for now hard to get the hang of it, but they were so cheap it was worth trying.</li>
            <li>I bought for my 14 year old and she loves the product.</li>
            <li>My old one was taped together in two places</li>
            <li>They come in the most common shapes of eyebrows in a variety of sizes.</li>
            <li>I like that it brings a variety of natural looking stencils.</li>
            <li>so far.</li>
            <li>i can use these, but you really would only need to have one in the shape you like...</li>
            <li>when i received these stencils i was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>my eyebrows look professional</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s enough that I&#x27;m not sure I want to use it in a hurry without more practice.</li>
            <li>I would def recommend these to those who draw on there eye brows or who are like me and shape there natural brow to wear bare or even if you grow your brow in and want to change the arch of your brow!</li>
            <li>You will save so much money in the long run!</li>
            <li>Overall i would recommend this for someone who is new to doing their eyebrows</li>
            <li>They are made of thick, reusable plastic that bends easily to the shape of your forehead.</li>
            <li>and they came with no other instructions.</li>
            <li>it is and ok product very confusing to use needs to come with some sort of instructions</li>
            <li>/&gt;The seller was fast and got them befor expected considering they came from overseas</li>
            <li>Honestly they&#x27;re useless.</li>
            <li>They are a little to thick for my taste but each to their own.</li>
            <li>cheaply made...very hard to actually do your eyebrow makeup with these things..</li>
            <li>not a good fit for everyone.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s pretty good, but the slightly stiff plastic can make it a little difficult to align on your brows.  </li>
            <li>but others will love if they prefer a slight arch and if there head shape is small ( diamond shape, long face) or if you just like short eye brows.</li>

            <li> There&#x27;s some kind of instructions or something on them, but I can&#x27;t make it out ...</li>
            <li> Nice</li>
            <li> Good &amp; sturdy, great for shaping, non sticky(good for people who likes to apply makeup first before there brows) .</li>
            <li> I guess if you&#x27;re trying out to be a clown or if you have a super huge head these will be perfect for you...</li>
            <li> These are very cool!</li>
            <li> it is very easy to use and durable  </li>
            <li> These ones are okay, they kind of work like the ELF ones.</li>
            <li> Great for the right faceâ˜ºðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I mostly just use them to the B section and fill in the rest on my own to give an more defined arch shape.</li>
            <li> amazing product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> These are huge!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m getting better every day</li>
            <li> so maybe I won&#x27;t need them forever anyway :)&lt;</li>
            <li> NICE FIT OVER EYEBROW.</li>
            <li> Suggestion is to research and/or ask a skilled person who does the eyebrows for the additional tools to assist with perfecting the eyebrows or research online before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not too sure on how to use them</li>
            <li> to better help you understand the product</li>
            <li> they came and i love them..</li>
            <li> All 3 of my girls love them.</li>

            <li> especially that i like everything perfect..</li>
            <li> i love it..</li>
            <li> I only have 7 words for this wonderful product: &amp;#34;where</li>
            <li> The stencils are ok</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them, they always come before the estimated shipping date as well.</li>
            <li> Would buy from the seller again love how the shaping stencils work on my eyebrow love how they look</li>
            <li> **:)</li>
            <li> love it works</li>
            <li> This helps me a lot to make sure my eyebrows have the correct size to them.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Not quite sure about these things.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> Thicker &#x3D; lasts or thinner ones and buy more often.  </li>
            <li> OKAY</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty good bt</li>
            <li> Nice to have in your make up case very sturdy and nice variety of style</li>
            <li> Its a cool thought and assistance  to those interesting in attempting to have the perfect eyebrow similar to browing by the professionals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to hold and really does help apply product to the eyebrows leaving them nice and neat!</li>
            <li> i was a perfect fit :) much more than i expected all tho</li>
            <li> They were cheap and seem to be okay.</li>
            <li> However, there are other tools needed to assist with creating the perfect eyebrows, which does not come with this product.</li>
            <li> Easy for guidance on trimming eyebrows too.</li>
            <li> easy to follow and mine</li>
            <li> so I was very excited about finding a stencil that was just right!</li>
            <li> Very easily lost, shapes dont look that different, good idea if i could see markings on stencil.</li>
            <li> if u can hold the stencil still, it works fine.</li>
            <li> Cheap easy to use and works fantastic</li>
            <li> These things seem way too huge for my face.</li>
            <li> I bought these months ago and have not used them at all because they&#x27;re obnoxiously huge (like 1.5x longer than I can imagine anyone wanting their brows).</li>
            <li> but still theyd have to be drawn in huge in order to take the shape.</li>
            <li> You should get them if you&#x27;re looking for something cheap.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really fit my eyebrow shape but think it would prob work well for someone else.</li>
            <li> None of them fit my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy I only paid $.90 for them.</li>
            <li> They were cheap</li>
            <li> This stencil is cheap.  </li>
            <li> will not mention brand name start with A. so far so good</li>
            <li> came out great, thanks, fast shipping time too.</li>
            <li> With 4 kids my patients are low to make sure my eyebrows look good</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery!!!</li>
            <li> good product for larger faces, and sturdy material pretty shapes and was shipped nicely.</li>
            <li> When I first got the package, the smallest one was on top of the sealed package</li>
            <li> but so worth the money and wait!</li>
            <li> love these and recommend them to anyone who wants to shape their eye brows themselves!</li>
            <li> and I was excited to use it</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> 2/5 stars mostly because it&#x27;s so much work to keep on face and make both brown outlines even.....</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Still not bad for $1 and some change.</li>
            <li> They where not bad at all.</li>
            <li> It took me a minute to get my eyebrow to fit right.</li>
            <li> product was quick and easy and very inexpensive!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for someone who struggles making perfect equal eyebrows (like me)</li>
            <li> They are very flexible and easy to hold and bend on your eyebrow.</li>
            <li> Way too big for my use...even the smallest one is HUGE!!</li>
            <li> these can&#x27;t even be modified in any way so that i could make use of these...better off making your own out of colored paper or some other semi-hard material that can be easily cut to shape.</li>
            <li> However, the stencil itself is huge; the whole piece and the eyebrow shape.</li>
            <li> but the product was worth the price</li>
            <li> definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> The indicators on the stencils will help anyone find their &#x27;golden ration&#x27;.</li>
            <li> but it was WELL worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I blend the tail and front parts out for a more natural look.</li>
            <li> Worth the price, I think.</li>
            <li> This product is ok easpecially for such cheap price.</li>
            <li> Therefore, it worth a try.  </li>
            <li> I wish there was some sort of adhesive, and they were a bit more flexible, but for the price they work okay -- and they arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> but maybe I&#x27;m just using them right</li>
            <li> but I find that the brows on the stencil are very large.  </li>
            <li> I liked the idea of having different options; however, they are all for very thing eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The contour of the lines are appropriate, however the material it is made from is smooth on one side and &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; on the other.</li>
            <li> Reading the other reviews, I expected these to be planetary in size, but they are actually pretty damn perfect.</li>
            <li> took a while to get but it came from china they are ok but the length is too short</li>
            <li> I love the idea of these eyebrow stencils, but the ones I purchased were WAY too big for my face.</li>
            <li> I gave them away the first time</li>
            <li> time adhesive for fitting purposes only for color aaplication.</li>
            <li> Overall, its good with a small piece of tape at the top for symmetry.  </li>
            <li> Arched my own with these, less trips to the salon</li>
            <li> Alittle hard to use but otherwise good product.</li>
            <li> She can&#x27;t stop talking about how much she loves it.</li>
            <li> but they seem very helpful.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s face is different and but one of these will certainly fit everyone.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast</li>
            <li> this is really ridiculous!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> These stencils don&#x27;t really look like the picture.</li>
            <li> For someone who can&#x27;t draw eyebrows, these work really well</li>
            <li> as soon as i got these in the mail i tried it out and it works really well</li>
            <li> i just learned to overfill then go back and clean it up</li>
            <li> purchased this product at full price for personal use*</li>
            <li> Live and learn!</li>
            <li> Really not that easy to use as one might think</li>
            <li> Instant symmetry, and you&#x27;ll love how it drastically improves your overall look.</li>
            <li> So I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> i must say i wish a little more instuctions</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s kind of hard to hold</li>
            <li> I got these because naturally my brows do not have much shape to them</li>
            <li> Helped me to make my eyebrow by myself but it is not like a professional doing, but it really helps.</li>
            <li> I have a normal size face/head</li>
            <li> not sure if i will be able to most if not all of them are way way way too big for my face... and my brows that i have are similar in shape to three of them</li>
            <li> I think I paid less than a dollar for this and the shipping was free (took a long time, but hey, it was free).</li>
            <li> not the right size for a real human face</li>
            <li> The picture is what you get,  should&#x27;ve analyzed it a little better as far as the arch.</li>
            <li> Good idea in theory but these stencils only work if your eyebrows aren&#x27;t that thick.</li>
            <li> 2 of them look pretty similar</li>
            <li> and they wanted $20 for the same exact</li>
            <li> These took a long time to come but they were worth the wait.</li>
            <li> They are hard to use, I guess if given time and practice it may get better, but for now hard to get the hang of it, but they were so cheap it was worth trying.</li>
            <li> I bought for my 14 year old and she loves the product.</li>
            <li> My old one was taped together in two places</li>
            <li> They come in the most common shapes of eyebrows in a variety of sizes.</li>
            <li> I like that it brings a variety of natural looking stencils.</li>
            <li> so far.</li>
            <li> i can use these, but you really would only need to have one in the shape you like...</li>
            <li> when i received these stencils i was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> my eyebrows look professional</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s enough that I&#x27;m not sure I want to use it in a hurry without more practice.</li>
            <li> I would def recommend these to those who draw on there eye brows or who are like me and shape there natural brow to wear bare or even if you grow your brow in and want to change the arch of your brow!</li>
            <li> You will save so much money in the long run!</li>
            <li> Overall i would recommend this for someone who is new to doing their eyebrows</li>
            <li> They are made of thick, reusable plastic that bends easily to the shape of your forehead.</li>
            <li> and they came with no other instructions.</li>
            <li> it is and ok product very confusing to use needs to come with some sort of instructions</li>
            <li> /&gt;The seller was fast and got them befor expected considering they came from overseas</li>
            <li> Honestly they&#x27;re useless.</li>
            <li> They are a little to thick for my taste but each to their own.</li>
            <li> cheaply made...very hard to actually do your eyebrow makeup with these things..</li>
            <li> not a good fit for everyone.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s pretty good, but the slightly stiff plastic can make it a little difficult to align on your brows.  </li>
            <li> but others will love if they prefer a slight arch and if there head shape is small ( diamond shape, long face) or if you just like short eye brows.</li>
            <li> I only opted towards one of the stencils due to the fact that the others ones were too thin or didnt  fit the shape of my natural eyebrow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought them initially because my eyebrows completely fell out three times due to chemotherapy.  </li>
            <li> It is ok, it works but very stiff and hard to use with one hand</li>
            <li> I was looking for that for a long time and finally find here.</li>
            <li> The only downside is, it&#x27;s too big and wide for my medium square face.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re not marked</li>
            <li> They came earlier than expected I found the size that fits my eyebrows and even gave one to my mom.</li>
            <li> it took me a long time to get around to using this b/c</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d think it would be fairly obvious what you are suppose to do, but I&#x27;m just curious about what all the writing (type) and stuff is on them.</li>
            <li> These just plain old don&#x27;t make sense</li>
            <li> My only PERSONAL complaint is that the eyebrow stencils don&#x27;t have enough of an arch for my liking &amp; it&#x27;s to short for my brow structure/ face.</li>
            <li> and then trying to line up the other eyebrow the same!</li>
            <li> Very minor annoyances,</li>
            <li> And i ended up using c1/2 because my eyebrows are kind of thick with a weird arch already.</li>
            <li> , i really needed them smh, not good.</li>
            <li> but it was not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> And I got them in the mail a few weeks sooner than they actually supposed to been there...</li>
            <li> these things have no real way of staying on while you draw, so they come out looking choppy and crooked.....</li>
            <li> Got to me weeks before expected but they aren&#x27;t small enough for my face</li>
            <li> all the stencils are too long and too thick not made for American women&#x27;s eyebrows</li>
            <li> and I thought they were all going to be small (and made just for the Asian market),</li>
            <li> Ehhh, for the price of these other ones I never got,  </li>
            <li> my eyebrows dont grow and ones shorter then the other</li>
            <li> should have read other reviews before I ordered it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I could complain about is that the one is too small.</li>
            <li> I wish they have several sizes so people with small face could use it.</li>
            <li> This product is difficult to use and it also doesn&#x27;t hold very steady.</li>
            <li> Also, hard to use it to actually pencil in brows.</li>
            <li> hard to hold and apply eyebrow product at the same time.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long they will hold up</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth aggravating myself.</li>
            <li> Aw don&#x27;t know what to say but not worth it</li>
            <li> Because it is thick, it lasts a really long time, so decide on the trade off.  </li>
            <li> but it got a little messy..</li>
            <li> I found that it was just to much trouble to use these each day</li>
            <li> Flimsy and the holes are cut unevenly.</li>
            <li> The stencils (the hole, not the plastic) were a bit too thin for my liking but whatever, it was only a dollar.</li>
            <li> i wrote a comment a few weeks ago about my Eyebrow shaping stencils not coming in the mail..</li>
            <li> i just wish they had the bx part in the front of the brow instead of round because everyone wears box</li>
            <li> waste of time and the 80 cents.</li>
            <li> I BELIVE ITS A WASTE OF MONEY,</li>
            <li> so I guess my 80 cents went to waste</li>
            <li> Also, it is hard for me to have an idea of how to place it on one side so that when I turn it around and try to do the other eyebrow, it would be symmetrical.</li>
            <li> But would definitely recommend for someone  who has small and thin eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I have been buying these for the past few years.</li>
            <li> would have been a 5star review if they didnt have such poor shipping!</li>
            <li> I HAVE A LAZY EYE</li>
            <li> I have a small face</li>
            <li> If the title is supposed to say &amp;#34;Perfect&amp;#34;, somehow I cannot get past &amp;#34;Pefect.&amp;#34; Don&#x27;t they proofread?</li>
            <li> money wasted on this trash!</li>
            <li> im not very good at doing my eye brows but</li>
            <li> too hard to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to handle.</li>
            <li> this product is so hard could not even bend</li>
            <li> HARD TO HOLD IN PLACE.</li>
            <li> The shape wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for,they were too round and thin.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s hard to keep on your face.</li>
            <li> Just a little difficult to use with a brow pencil</li>
            <li> but I found the stencils a little difficult to use?</li>
            <li> Just bad overall.</li>
            <li> It was uneven and unrealistic.</li>
            <li> But I am not good at using it.</li>
            <li> I mean it would work well if you like thin brows.</li>
            <li> All I can say about this product is that it sucks!</li>
            <li> At least I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune on them!</li>
            <li> still did not get them after all these months, really not happy about that</li>
            <li> work but to thin to trace on</li>
            <li> I prefer thin for self application.</li>
            <li> Check your eyebrows from a 3/4 front view with two mirrors and you&#x27;ll be shocked how uneven and asymmetrical they are when you see them &amp;#34;in reverse&amp;#34; in the mirrors.  </li>
            <li> So i was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> they are difficult to use</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> It was difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Difficult to make both brows even.</li>
            <li> (I think it&#x27;s absurd to pay to have it done).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work out.  </li>
            <li> there are no instructions on how to use it and its just horrible .. came with four little plastic stencils .</li>
            <li> To bad for them....</li>
            <li> Painful</li>
            <li> These things sucked i was disappointed</li>
            <li> very awkward to use....</li>
            <li> Awful product...</li>

            <li> NICE FIT OVER EYEBROW.</li>
            <li> I love these they&#x27;re perfect!!</li>
            <li> Not bad. Just a little difficult to use with a brow pencil but the product was worth the price</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend. She can&#x27;t stop talking about how much she loves it. So I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have overplucked eyebrows but I find that the brows on the stencil are very large.  Also, hard to use it to actually pencil in brows.</li>
            <li> Worked good and it helps</li>
            <li> Flimsy and the holes are cut unevenly. Also took forever to get here. Just bad overall.</li>
            <li> Its a cool thought and assistance  to those interesting in attempting to have the perfect eyebrow similar to browing by the professionals. However, there are other tools needed to assist with creating the perfect eyebrows, which does not come with this product. Suggestion is to research and/or ask a skilled person who does the eyebrows for the additional tools to assist with perfecting the eyebrows or research online before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product is good and can be used to practice...</li>
            <li> still did not get them after all these months, really not happy about that, i really needed them smh, not good.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work, I ended up doing my brows freehand.</li>
            <li> not too sure on how to use them but they seem very helpful.</li>
            <li> where can you  find product like this for $2.00&lt;br /&gt;I have different brand I had paid for $5.00 this one works much better than the expensive  one.&lt;br /&gt;I will not mention brand name start with A. so far so good</li>
            <li> it is and ok product very confusing to use needs to come with some sort of instructions to better help you understand the product</li>
            <li> Nice to have in your make up case very sturdy and nice variety of style I would def recommend these to those who draw on there eye brows or who are like me and shape there natural brow to wear bare or even if you grow your brow in and want to change the arch of your brow!</li>
            <li> These ones are okay, they kind of work like the ELF ones. You should get them if you&#x27;re looking for something cheap.</li>
            <li> The stencils (the hole, not the plastic) were a bit too thin for my liking but whatever, it was only a dollar. I mean it would work well if you like thin brows.</li>
            <li> I did not like thses. The shapes were off and the sizes were unmatched. It was uneven and unrealistic. Painful</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty good bt they&#x27;re not marked n 2 of them look pretty similar so I don&#x27;t remember which one I used before. Also it&#x27;s kind of hard to hold n stencil your eyebrows</li>
            <li> i wrote a comment a few weeks ago about my Eyebrow shaping stencils not coming in the mail.. but when i check the reason was becausae  the delivery date was for 01/21/14..they came and i love them.. they really help me draw my eyebrows perfect</li>
            <li> used it on myself and my sister and we both loved the result</li>
            <li> I bought for my 14 year old and she loves the product. She uses all the time.  Easy for guidance on trimming eyebrows too.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received these I bought another set.  You tend to use only one and I didn&#x27;t want to have to search again, like I did for these.  They had one stencil with a longer arch than I have found elsewhere.  My old one was taped together in two places so I was very excited about finding a stencil that was just right!</li>
            <li> All 3 of my girls love them. They work! The stencils shape them the way they want. We would definitely recommend the eyebrow stencils.</li>
            <li> I like that these stencils have all the guidelines on them as to where an eyebrow should begin and end (outside of eye, etc.).  They are made of thick, reusable plastic that bends easily to the shape of your forehead. When I first got the package, the smallest one was on top of the sealed package and I thought they were all going to be small (and made just for the Asian market), but I was wrong.  There ARE large-sized stencils included!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They did take a while to arrive because they came from another country, but at the price I paid for them, I can&#x27;t complain about the wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought them initially because my eyebrows completely fell out three times due to chemotherapy.  I soon realized I looked sillier with drawn-on brows than no brows at all.  I now use these with a brow marking pen to fill in the brow lashes that haven&#x27;t grown back yet.</li>
            <li> Gave me direction on how to go with it</li>
            <li> This product is okay but I have difficulty making eyebrows at same height.  It takes some practice since I do not have any eyebrows at all.</li>
            <li> Omg i love these. I use the thinnest one bc i have like no eyebrows. The shape comes out perfect. They are very flexible and easy to hold and bend on your eyebrow. They come in the most common shapes of eyebrows in a variety of sizes. How can you not get these for 2$? They shop from china so they took like two weeks but so worth the money and wait!</li>
            <li> I thought that with the &amp;#34;scale&amp;#34; markings on the stencils these would help to apply symmetric brows but maybe I&#x27;m just using them right but I found the stencils a little difficult to use?</li>
            <li> Good idea in theory but these stencils only work if your eyebrows aren&#x27;t that thick.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use with airbrush makeup but doesn&#x27;t work well.  Might work with eyebrow pencil but I rather doubt it.</li>
            <li> i just wish they had the bx part in the front of the brow instead of round because everyone wears box</li>
            <li> product was quick and easy and very inexpensive! you get a variety of shapes which is nice. definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> I finally found the Perfect match for my eyebrows... I like that it brings a variety of natural looking stencils.</li>
            <li> The plastic is not flexible enough to put on your face and trace</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I love how it makes my eyes brows look. It came on time which I&#x27;m happy about. Love it</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s face is different and but one of these will certainly fit everyone. The indicators on the stencils will help anyone find their &#x27;golden ration&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I ever get them I can give you a review. ELF has a nice kit as does NYX...Ehhh, for the price of these other ones I never got,  it&#x27;s not worth aggravating myself. They may count on that &amp; are possibly raking in the $ for nothing. LOL...Oh, I forgot to mention that I placed this order on November 15 so it&#x27;s. been a month...so far.</li>
            <li> Everything is made in China these days.  They worked as described. No instructions on how to use. Had to figure it out for myself</li>
            <li> Shipped fast but it was not what I had expected. It was difficult to use. Difficult to make both brows even.</li>
            <li> didnt work as I thought.</li>
            <li> I think I paid less than a dollar for this and the shipping was free (took a long time, but hey, it was free). Didn&#x27;t really fit my eyebrow shape but think it would prob work well for someone else.</li>
            <li> these make eyebrow shaping a snap. they have 4 nice shape and size configurations so you can use what fits your face. easy to follow and mine came out great, thanks, fast shipping time too.</li>
            <li> i can use these, but you really would only need to have one in the shape you like...&lt;br /&gt;other than the abundance of shapes i love them :D they are just perfect for anyone wanting to have perfect brows.</li>
            <li> I totally forgot that i even ordered these things until when i got them TODAY this is really ridiculous!!&lt;br /&gt;I odered this back in november on the 20th, They gave me an estimate date of December 17th to January 6th i just got these today on the 27th!!!&lt;br /&gt;This would have been a 5star review if they didnt have such poor shipping! To bad for them....</li>
            <li> Alittle hard to use but otherwise good product.</li>
            <li> I got these because naturally my brows do not have much shape to them so I have to shape them myself (I think it&#x27;s absurd to pay to have it done). So I decided to buy these to help with it.&lt;br /&gt;You get all four shown in the picture. What I did was place it where I wanted my brow to be and shaded the open area with a white eye liner pencil. Then I removed the stencil and tweezed out all the hairs that were not shaded white. Voila! Perfectly shaped brows, done yourself.&lt;br /&gt;I also use these when I fill in my eyebrows because then I don&#x27;t end up getting any product on the skin around my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;I love these and recommend them to anyone who wants to shape their eye brows themselves! You will save so much money in the long run!</li>
            <li> these things have no real way of staying on while you draw, so they come out looking choppy and crooked..... boo!!</li>
            <li> I like this product its just that as you begin to fill in your eyebrows sometimes the stencil moves and you have to re-position it. And i ended up using c1/2 because my eyebrows are kind of thick with a weird arch already. But would definitely recommend for someone  who has small and thin eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Took a bit to ship because they came from Hong Kong but it was WELL worth the wait. I went to local beauty supply stores such as Ulta in the U.S. and they wanted $20 for the same exact thing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are awesome and make my brows look great. They also help with tweezing so you can tell where the strays are!</li>
            <li> I HAVE A LAZY EYE AND THIS MAKE IT SO MUCH BETTER SO MY EYEBROWS ARE THE SAME THANK YOU SO MUCH</li>
            <li> when i received these stencils i was pleasantly surprised. I only opted towards one of the stencils due to the fact that the others ones were too thin or didnt  fit the shape of my natural eyebrow. my eyebrows dont grow and ones shorter then the other so i use these to even out the sizes and shape</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to handle. I mean, it&#x27;s hard to keep on your face. An adhesive needs to be applied.</li>
            <li> Very nice eyebrow stencil. Good &amp; sturdy, great for shaping, non sticky(good for people who likes to apply makeup first before there brows) . Received tracking number upon shipment. Came before estimated date. My only PERSONAL complaint is that the eyebrow stencils don&#x27;t have enough of an arch for my liking &amp; it&#x27;s to short for my brow structure/ face. I ended up giving these stencils to my aunt, she loves them. The picture is what you get,  should&#x27;ve analyzed it a little better as far as the arch. Not for me but others will love if they prefer a slight arch and if there head shape is small ( diamond shape, long face) or if you just like short eye brows. If you like the Aaliyah or Beyonce eyebrow look, this stencil pack is not for you. Great for the right faceâ˜ºðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> The best ones I have bought! These took a long time to come but they were worth the wait. These are sturdy and the easiest to use that I have found. Just used yesterday.</li>
            <li> like everbody elses review, I didnt recieve them either. waste of time and the 80 cents. should have read other reviews before I ordered it.</li>
            <li> it makes my eyebrows look pretty and perfect nice..especially that i like everything perfect..my eyebrows look professional done i love it..</li>
            <li> They were ok&lt;br /&gt;They work but to thin to trace on</li>
            <li> These stencils don&#x27;t really look like the picture. None of them fit my eyebrows. So i was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> These just plain old don&#x27;t make sense</li>
            <li> These are great for a brow guide. If you plan to just slap them on and move along, these probably aren&#x27;t for you. I blend the tail and front parts out for a more natural look. Worth the price, I think.</li>
            <li> 2/5 stars mostly because it&#x27;s so much work to keep on face and make both brown outlines even..... But hey still usable :p probably should have gone with the hand held</li>
            <li> Awesome price for these.</li>
            <li> I thought that you use this to cut your eyebrows in the shap mold.but I see its for people who don&#x27;t have eyebrows. So didn&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li> Aw don&#x27;t know what to say but not worth it all the stencils are too long and too thick not made for American women&#x27;s eyebrows so like I said grow your own eyebrows in and pluck them to a style u like your better off trust me on that!</li>
            <li> To start off, I&#x27;m not using these to pluck with. I draw on my brows. These work perfectly for this. The shapes are great. The only thing I could complain about is that the one is too small. But all in all a great buy.</li>
            <li> These things seem way too huge for my face. I have a normal size face/head but these cover from the front of my eyebrow all the way to the side of my head.</li>
            <li> took a while to get but it came from china they are ok but the length is too short</li>
            <li> With 4 kids my patients are low to make sure my eyebrows look good&lt;br /&gt;These stencils  are great you put them against your face and shade&lt;br /&gt;Them in and bam they look even and nice,highly recommend them&lt;br /&gt;The seller was fast and got them befor expected considering they came from overseas</li>
            <li> this product is so hard could not even bend so i could pencil my brows need to be moreflexible on face.</li>
            <li> For someone who can&#x27;t draw eyebrows, these work really well</li>
            <li> I thought it was something else I have eye brows so don&#x27;t work for me but someone without eyebrows sure it would do good</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of having different options; however, they are all for very thing eyebrows. Also, it is hard for me to have an idea of how to place it on one side so that when I turn it around and try to do the other eyebrow, it would be symmetrical. I prefer to use pencils, but I think this product works best with powder.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, I don&#x27;t see the point of it.  I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Got to me weeks before expected but they aren&#x27;t small enough for my face</li>
            <li> The contour of the lines are appropriate, however the material it is made from is smooth on one side and &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; on the other. This complicates cleaning the product when being used with airbrush make up or even pencil liners.</li>
            <li> This product is difficult to use and it also doesn&#x27;t hold very steady. They are a little to thick for my taste but each to their own.</li>
            <li> Used it on my best friend, and it helps out a lot</li>
            <li> I only have 7 words for this wonderful product: &amp;#34;where have you been all my life?!</li>
            <li> After some maneuvering, these did the trick. However, the stencil itself is huge; the whole piece and the eyebrow shape. It took me a minute to get my eyebrow to fit right. But, with some patience, the job got done.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of these eyebrow stencils, but the ones I purchased were WAY too big for my face. I&#x27;m really happy I only paid $.90 for them.</li>
            <li> there are no instructions on how to use it and its just horrible .. came with four little plastic stencils .</li>
            <li> These are a great addition to my make up bag!! I&#x27;ve never used them before and would very likely purchase additional stencils. Very easy to use!</li>
            <li> Very nice styles. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I was looking for that for a long time and finally find here. Helped me to make my eyebrow by myself but it is not like a professional doing, but it really helps.</li>
            <li> I DONT LIKE THEM MAYBE I AM NOT USED TO USING STENCIL THAT I BELIVE ITS A WASTE OF MONEY, WHO KNOWS MAYBE WITH PRACTICE. I WILL LEARN TO LIKE THEM</li>
            <li> Check your eyebrows from a 3/4 front view with two mirrors and you&#x27;ll be shocked how uneven and asymmetrical they are when you see them &amp;#34;in reverse&amp;#34; in the mirrors.  Even them up  with the stencil shape here of your preference-- just hold it to the brow and brush powdered shadow on, then wipe off/flip over/apply the stencil to opposite eyebrow.  Instant symmetry, and you&#x27;ll love how it drastically improves your overall look.</li>
            <li> very awkward to use....you have to  try to hold them in place with one hand while using an eyebrow pencil with the other.&lt;br /&gt;they came from China, via their post so it took a while to receive them...BUT they were 89 cents....so not a problem!</li>
            <li> All I can say about this product is that it sucks! Took forever to get here and I was excited to use it but when I did I realized it was junk!</li>
            <li> The stencils are ok but it got a little messy..when using a pencil the eyebrow comes out smaller the actuall stencil. They were cheap so you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Love the templates! They came earlier than expected I found the size that fits my eyebrows and even gave one to my mom. It&#x27;s really easy to hold and really does help apply product to the eyebrows leaving them nice and neat! Definitely recommend for someone who struggles making perfect equal eyebrows (like me)</li>
            <li> They work wonderful, great shapes for eyebrows</li>
            <li> Loved these. I have been buying these for the past few years. I absolutely love them, they always come before the estimated shipping date as well.</li>
            <li> I bought these months ago and have not used them at all because they&#x27;re obnoxiously huge (like 1.5x longer than I can imagine anyone wanting their brows). I only gave an extra star because they&#x27;re under $2 and delivery was on time.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as great as you would think.</li>
            <li> it took me a long time to get around to using this b/c I kept forgetting I had it.  I guess it&#x27;s pretty good, but the slightly stiff plastic can make it a little difficult to align on your brows.  And it seems the best way to get it to draw is to draw straight on instead of an angle.  Otherwise your just drawing into the edges (if you&#x27;re using a pencil).  Very minor annoyances, but it&#x27;s enough that I&#x27;m not sure I want to use it in a hurry without more practice.</li>
            <li> I loved it! amazing product and easy to use. Im buying them again! I would recommend for beginners. You can trace, Then pluck out the untraced remaining .</li>
            <li> Would buy from the seller again love how the shaping stencils work on my eyebrow love how they look and it help me save money I give them 5*****:)</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this product 0 stars because I never got them ..so I guess my 80 cents went to waste</li>
            <li> love it works well im not very good at doing my eye brows but as soon as i got these in the mail i tried it out and it works really well</li>
            <li> Awful product...cheaply made...very hard to actually do your eyebrow makeup with these things..I gave them away I disliked them so much.</li>
            <li> None of the designs worked for me or my brow line. Live and learn! At least I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune on them!</li>
            <li> great product, exactly as stated, am very happy with it is very easy to use and durable  great shippper..thank you</li>
            <li> I have not used this yet as I cannot figure out how to.  The instructions are in Chinese.  Good price, but I can&#x27;t figure it out!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product. But I am not good at using it. It keeps moving when using it. Still recommend!</li>
            <li> not sure if i will be able to most if not all of them are way way way too big for my face... and my brows that i have are similar in shape to three of them but still theyd have to be drawn in huge in order to take the shape. good product for larger faces, and sturdy material pretty shapes and was shipped nicely.</li>
            <li> This product is ok easpecially for such cheap price. The only downside is, it&#x27;s too big and wide for my medium square face. I wish they have several sizes so people with small face could use it.</li>
            <li> This helps me a lot to make sure my eyebrows have the correct size to them. It also helps when I need to fill them in too.</li>
            <li> Honestly they&#x27;re useless.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Not quite sure about these things. There&#x27;s some kind of instructions or something on them, but I can&#x27;t make it out ... and they came with no other instructions. Yes, yes, I know ... you&#x27;d think it would be fairly obvious what you are suppose to do, but I&#x27;m just curious about what all the writing (type) and stuff is on them.</li>
            <li> i love it i was a perfect fit :) much more than i expected all tho i must say i wish a little more instuctions</li>
            <li> It is ok, it works but very stiff and hard to use with one hand but when I used both when I did my nieces eyebrows it worked great.  Because it is thick, it lasts a really long time, so decide on the trade off.  Thicker &#x3D; lasts or thinner ones and buy more often.  I prefer thin for self application.</li>
            <li> I guess if you&#x27;re trying out to be a clown or if you have a super huge head these will be perfect for you...Way too big for my use...even the smallest one is HUGE!! these can&#x27;t even be modified in any way so that i could make use of these...better off making your own out of colored paper or some other semi-hard material that can be easily cut to shape. If i could give no stars, i would!</li>
            <li> not the right size for a real human face</li>
            <li> I have a small face and I want to find the Korean style eye brow.  This stencil is cheap.  Therefore, it worth a try.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work out.  It may work for someone else.  Just  not me...</li>
            <li> Reading the other reviews, I expected these to be planetary in size, but they are actually pretty damn perfect. I wish there was some sort of adhesive, and they were a bit more flexible, but for the price they work okay -- and they arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery!!! I love this helps to get eyebrows looking perfect. Overall i would recommend this for someone who is new to doing their eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;Reordered. I gave them away the first time but then I started doing my eyebrows again so I needed these again. I mostly just use them to the B section and fill in the rest on my own to give an more defined arch shape. Still not bad for $1 and some change.</li>
            <li> They are hard to use, I guess if given time and practice it may get better, but for now hard to get the hang of it, but they were so cheap it was worth trying.</li>
            <li> These are very cool! Worth it!</li>
            <li> Cheap easy to use and works fantastic</li>
            <li> Very easily lost, shapes dont look that different, good idea if i could see markings on stencil.</li>
            <li> This product is to big for ur eyebrows</li>
            <li> I gave these shapers a 4.They are nice,however it would help us ladies and gents if they attached for a short time....time adhesive for fitting purposes only for color aaplication. Overall, its good with a small piece of tape at the top for symmetry.  MS. VEE RN</li>
            <li> OKAY BUT TOO FLIMSY. HARD TO HOLD IN PLACE.</li>
            <li> These are huge! Way to big for my face.</li>
            <li> They where not bad at all. I&#x27;m happy i order them.</li>
            <li> Got these for my mother she loved them.</li>
            <li> not a good fit for everyone. they don&#x27;t the frame my brows at all</li>
            <li> These are great eyebrow shapers.. And I got them in the mail a few weeks sooner than they actually supposed to been there...</li>
            <li> The eyebrow stencil is for Asia person ...and am not from there so my eyebrows are different.</li>
            <li> Really not that easy to use as one might think</li>
            <li> The shape wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for,they were too round and thin.</li>
            <li> Arched my own with these, less trips to the salon</li>
            <li> If the title is supposed to say &amp;#34;Perfect&amp;#34;, somehow I cannot get past &amp;#34;Pefect.&amp;#34; Don&#x27;t they proofread? Not buying it.</li>
            <li> These things sucked i was disappointed</li>
            <li> Nice but the instructions are in Chinese.</li>
            <li> lots for the price but none worked for my shape. Sister uses them and loves them</li>
            <li> I did not like them at all!!</li>
            <li> money wasted on this trash!</li>
            <li> if u can hold the stencil still, it works fine. i just learned to overfill then go back and clean it up</li>
            <li> way too big for my eyebrows and face. hard to hold and apply eyebrow product at the same time. I&#x27;d rather just freehand it.</li>
