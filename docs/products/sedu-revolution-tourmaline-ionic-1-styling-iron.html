            <li>Now all it&#x27;s good for is making snappy noises in my cat&#x27;s face to annoy</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t get to the roots of the hair really good like the CHI did</li>
            <li>It seem to have good reviews</li>
            <li>Perfect, smooth, shiny hair.</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s good while it works.  </li>
            <li>listen y&#x27;all: PAY FOR GOOD HAIR PRODUCTS.  </li>
            <li>it was good while it lasted.</li>
            <li>This hair straightener is really wonderful - right up until the moment that it stops working!</li>
            <li>Love love love!!!!  </li>
            <li>Very pleased also I have a sister who is a model</li>
            <li>It looks more attractive sitting on my counter.  </li>
            <li>It has been the best iron worth its price that I have ever purchased</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, this \\&quot;iconic styling iron\\&quot; SOLVES THAT PROBLEM!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>it for years and love it!</li>
            <li>The temperature control is great and heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>Amazing - I love it!</li>
            <li>My hair is so healthy and versatile now that I feel lucky to have found the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>This thing makes my hair look great, quick!  </li>
            <li>Very nice, high end straightener at a good price!</li>
            <li>this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>By the way, Sedu is amazing quality.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing...</li>
            <li>It works amazing.</li>
            <li>I bought my iron thru Ulta for they have an amazing return policy.</li>
            <li>Sedu iron is amazing and along with the Argan oil</li>
            <li>it makes may hair look and feel amazing.</li>
            <li>The 450 degree setting was amazing.</li>
            <li>Sedu is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>The iron came with a nice heat pad to lay the iron on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s barely warm.</li>
            <li>The Sedu is perfect for those that have curly course hair, leaves hair straight and does not leave the hair smelling burned.</li>
            <li>AND ARE MORE CONCERNED WITH POLICIES RATHER THAN A GOOD CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to set the temperature to the highest degrees to get a perfect strand of straight hair with one or two passes.</li>
            <li>I liked it while it lasted.</li>
            <li>It is the best I have ever used, and it makes me feel great to do a better job at straightening my hair than a professional.  </li>
            <li>but I realized spending more on a good quality straightener</li>
            <li>however it literally takes 20 minutes to warm up and another 20 minutes to straighten.  </li>
            <li>buy yourself something nice that you will cherish for years to come.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned many Chi&#x27;s (a good straightener</li>
            <li>It can also create very nice curls (as long as you know how to do it lol!)</li>
            <li>Best flat iron I&#x27;ve EVER own!</li>
            <li>I did see one who condemned the correct product, then purchased it again after trying it in a store, and the new one was awesome like it should be.  </li>
            <li>Was also very easy to curl with this styling iron.  </li>
            <li>Use to have a chi till it quit working on me and the Sedu is for sure way better!</li>
            <li>I would recommend the Sedu Revolution to anyone looking for a good flat iron that will not damage their hair and leave them looking flawless.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far the best iron I ever used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I shopped around a lot and Amazon by far had the best price.</li>
            <li>I love it, love it, love it!  </li>
            <li>Great iron, heats up fast, smooths my hair, no complaints!  </li>
            <li>Plus it arrived at my house quickly!!</li>
            <li>It works fine, it just wasn&#x27;t spectacular.</li>
            <li>I would spend $30 more and get the sedu package with the serum and heat resistant case.</li>
            <li>I love the sedu straightener&#x27;s and am always satisfied with my results after using their products.</li>
            <li>Needs better warranty for price</li>
            <li>I love my Sedu straightener.</li>
            <li>I love this straightener.</li>
            <li>Love, love.  </li>
            <li>The Sedu seems to be OK</li>
            <li>The product is OK  but be carefu lwho you buy it form.</li>
            <li>So  that is all the product seems to be OK.</li>
            <li>and I must say, I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been curling (more like beachy waves)</li>
            <li>I could not be happier!! :)</li>
            <li>Love this straightener.</li>
            <li>I am impressed - the thing I did differently in selecting this iron (as opposed to priuor purchases)</li>
            <li>was making sure I purchased one compatible with my hair type.</li>
            <li>I was deciding between this one and the CHI because those are the two I hear the most about.  </li>
            <li>this one I think may be even better.  </li>
            <li>If I could give more stars I would.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I WAS ABLE TO USE IT UNTIL JUNE</li>
            <li>It was delivered in sufficient time, and I love this straightner.</li>
            <li>and it just overall wonderful.</li>
            <li>Works great and my hair stays straight all day.</li>
            <li>Please see sedu website for more information on authorized dealers</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I was pleased with the results, but it was a hassle doing my hair at times.</li>
            <li>Im sure the serum helped with the ultra sleek results.</li>
            <li>if they&#x27;re authentic, I got mine from Bed</li>
            <li>, I began to wonder if there was a better alternative.  </li>
            <li>and I love the results.</li>
            <li>I love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Initally I was in love.</li>
            <li>Just to be sure</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>The top and bottom irons also looked like they were separating.</li>
            <li>When spending over $100 on a product, I expect a lot more.</li>
            <li>It is so smooth!  </li>
            <li>I did all my research and couldn&#x27;t find anything better.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>is always better.</li>
            <li>straightner(s) I would have to go through it more than once</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>if you care about your locks and you only want the best for them, splurge.  </li>
            <li>but like this better.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to curl with it</li>
            <li>So many layers.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and so they heat up better.</li>
            <li>Much better than the one picked up at a discount store.  </li>
            <li>I returned it to the store where it was purchased and was able to receive another one as a replacement.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this iron for a couple months now and I am more in love with my Sedu than before.</li>
            <li>I do like that with the rolled edges, it&#x27;s easier to add a bit of curl to my hair which I wasn&#x27;t able to before.</li>
            <li>I love my Sedu straightener.</li>
            <li>I did have a 2 year warranty, so I will be able to get a replacement.  </li>
            <li>I love that the heat is adjustable.  </li>
            <li>The best flat iron I have ever had.</li>
            <li>The best flat iron I have ever come across on.</li>
            <li>The best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>It was the best decision I could have made regarding a flat iron.</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Without a doubt the best flat irons I have ever owned!!</li>
            <li>te best flat iron ever!!!!</li>
            <li>worth the cost!!</li>
            <li>The plates leave my fine hair very smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I bought so many hair products which easily cost around 500$ over a course of two months (no lie) .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure all you ladies are familiar with accidentally touching your hair too soon after the iron&#x27;s been on it and burning yourself just from that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most advanced for keeping moisture in your hair</li>
            <li>it is a good investment, heats up fast, has diff temperatures, slides easily...</li>
            <li>I know I am doing something right when I have hairdressers asking me what kind of products and appliances I use in my hair.  </li>
            <li>this iron straightens my hair easily.  </li>
            <li>The cord has a swivel rotation so you can move the iron easily without getting all tangled up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it was an easy return, no hassels.</li>
            <li>From what I have experienced, and also heard from many reviews, this product probably has an internal wiring problem.</li>
            <li>The plates also move a bit, making it easy to create volume.  </li>
            <li>I could feel a tug on my hair as I pulled it through, and I had to pull it through more times than I did with the old one, and the results weren&#x27;t as good</li>
            <li>It works just as amazing as my first Sedu tourmaline iron.  </li>
            <li>I had really liked using the dryer - fast results!</li>
            <li>Also does a great job curling the hair Love this flat iron ditching my chi!</li>
            <li>I like that it is light weight and has a swivel cord that does not tangle easily.</li>
            <li>Chi does a wonderful job, but my last iron just didn&#x27;t get as hot as I would&#x27;ve preferred.  </li>
            <li>, then I straighten using a fine tooth comb in front of the iron.  </li>
            <li>The temp dial is just a turn knob, which is fine</li>
            <li>have a friend that recommended this straighter, she has really fine hair</li>
            <li>It straightened it just fine.</li>
            <li>Tourmaline makes my hair super shiny!</li>
            <li>It straightens my hair quickly while making it look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>This product is reliable, fast heating, light and handy.</li>
            <li>but it was huge and pulled my hair.</li>
            <li>A couple weeks ago it stopped working all the time I had to move the cord to get the light to turn on and start heating</li>
            <li>I have been getting by with cheap straighteners from CVS/Target/etc for years</li>
            <li>The sedu  flows smoothly thru hair without pulling.</li>
            <li>i have really curly hair and this iron is amazing.</li>
            <li>The iron felt lightweight in my hand and smoothly went over my hair.</li>
            <li>I use it with Chi heat protection spray and that keeps my hair smooth and glossy.</li>
            <li>Light flickers and does not curl or straighten hair in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>No difference than cheap products</li>
            <li>I will never buy cheap straighteners again.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s smooth</li>
            <li>It glides smoothly and never &#x27;catches&#x27; in my hair.  </li>
            <li>You never hear a crackling sound like with cheaper straighteners.  </li>
            <li>After wandering around for a bit and doing some exploring, my hair was just as silky smooth and fuzz-free as it was when I finished straightening it.  </li>
            <li>The plates are as smooth as glass, and never any snagging.</li>
            <li>The Sedu Revolution is extremely light in weight, it doesn&#x27;t feel like your holding it.</li>
            <li>In case your wondering it makes a great birthday present.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Bought two sedu irons and the first one got a 3 star, this one however gets a 5 star because it is super amazing.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive this, and it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This is my first flat styling iron, and it has been really easy to use &amp; does a very good job.</li>
            <li>the unit is working properly it does a very nice job of straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li>I kept reading great reviews about this flat iron, so maybe it was the seller.</li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron.</li>
            <li>The packaging is beautiful, its sleek, sexy, and the iron itself is heavy duty.</li>
            <li>I almost use it everyday and my hair looks so beautiful and healthy.  </li>
            <li>original - nothing compares to the sedu revolution.  </li>
            <li>After many years of using a Chi, I am  very pleased with the performance of the Sedu flat iron.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American and do my best to keep my hair really healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the buy!</li>
            <li>Also the \\&quot;unique curved</li>
            <li>, I got this product within 1-2 weeks , so was pretty satisfied there as well.</li>
            <li>I originally wrote this review in September 2011, I still have the Sedu now</li>
            <li>bellow is my original review...   </li>
            <li>First day after using it, I didn&#x27;t realize it was going to rain and was saddened since my hair was for sure going to frizz up.  </li>
            <li>It will leave you hair silky smooth and full of shine.  </li>
            <li>I love it better than my old Chi and the Paul Mitchel Iron.  </li>
            <li>product itslef is really good, heats up in short amount of time and leaves my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- SUPER smooth plates.</li>
            <li>Not anyone&#x27;s fault but my own, so i&#x27;d suggest buying something to place your straightener on, kind of like a placemat, but made of metal or some other non-flammable material.</li>
            <li>It is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying to find a good straightener that doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and is quick and really gets my hair pin straight.  </li>
            <li>This styling iron is  one of the best less breakage then other ones I have used before price is good for the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to pull it right through as slowly or as quickly as you like.  </li>
            <li>and I was very happy with its performance for the first few months.  </li>
            <li>there was a mix up with my order and this seller was more than accommodating and very helpful.</li>
            <li>I have thick wavy hair and this straightener works great!  </li>
            <li>I initially bought it after reading good reviews for it online.  </li>
            <li>I had my last one (Infra) for about 8 years and loved it...</li>
            <li>Same holds good for this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it, it heats up fast</li>
            <li>I love it so much, thAT I ended up purchasing another 1\\&quot; for my daughter and a 1.5\\&quot; for myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very good flat iron, love the black plates, hair runs through it very smoothly.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;This model came in a high quality super cool box with a free tiny mini version of it, in it&#x27;s own super nice box.  </li>
            <li>I used my new sedu flat iron on my hair for the first time today and i am genuinely impressed.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this flat iron to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a great tool and who wants to get their money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>I loved this flat iron but they need to work on the wiring.</li>
            <li>But after having hair nightmares , I knew I had to spend it on some really good quality product and this Sedu flat iron</li>
            <li>, I think you need to invest in good thermal protection products irrespective of whatever flat iron you purchase.</li>
            <li>I love my new straightner!</li>
            <li>quickly.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and does not pull at my hair.</li>
            <li>It heats quickly.  </li>
            <li>heats up quickly, well-made product.  </li>
            <li>, this Sedu iron made my hair look super shiny</li>
            <li>Until now, I have been loyal to the Chi brand.  </li>
            <li>Iron heats up quickly, has temperature adjustments and does not damage my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick too.</li>
            <li>and so do I we needed something that wasn’t going to damage our hair so much and this had been a great purchase, I definitely recommend it</li>
            <li>it leave my hair soft shinny and does not damage me hair, love it so much!!!</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price, Superr smooth, doesnt pull, im</li>
            <li>Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever bought (until it broke 4 months later</li>
            <li>It locks out the humidity even in hot humid climates, leaving my hair looking silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>This flat iron also glides over my hair effortlessly, which is great because I&#x27;ve become used to styling tools snagging on my hair (resulting in very unwanted split ends).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I decided to try something new since the latest CHIs don&#x27;t have a temperature</li>
            <li>I learned that it was very important to comb first, but once I started using the iron correctly I consistently got stellar results.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and heats up really fast.</li>
            <li>Some of them get really hot and are able to make my tresses soft and smooth, but ALL of them managed to catch or snag my hair in the process.  </li>
            <li>I was searching for a new iron, I didn&#x27;t want to be cheap and buy a budget one at the local store, even though some of them may give you good results.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine, relatively straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Still searching for a good first \\&quot;go-to flat iron\\&quot; though.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair silky smooth and you only have to go over it once or twice to get a straight amazing look.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and heat up real fast.  </li>
            <li>You can adjust the heat setting and the flashing light indicator lets you know when it&#x27;s ready</li>
            <li>I do love the Sedu, i have owned several, it heats up great and fast and you only have to run it through your hair once, but after a couple years the cord shorts out</li>
            <li>I think this is totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was leery of the prices but in the end it was worth it.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>However, my old sedu iron left my hair gorgeously shiny and smooth,</li>
            <li>Your hair will be soft, shiny, and frizz free for DAYS (until you wash it of course)!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>worth it.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I eventually decided to buy it along with the Sedu Argan Oil Anti-Frizz Polishing Treatment and all I can say is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The money is well worth it, if I had an accident and</li>
            <li>It was definitly worth the money.</li>
            <li>worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I felt it was worth noting the &#x27;authorized&#x27; seller part.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>the CHI is nice and all, but only has one heat setting, which can fry your hair.</li>
            <li>It was worth the price.</li>
            <li>One last thing I&#x27;ve really liked about this product: there is a light indicator that tell you when the iron is hot and ready to use.</li>
            <li>It took the curl right out.</li>
            <li>While they responded to my request right away, all they would do is replace the product</li>
            <li>I love this hair iron just not enough to have paid full price for them (got it on groupon).</li>
            <li>It was very soft, shiney and all those wonderful things for someone with thick hair.</li>
            <li>I was thinking in getting the new InStyler but decided after seeing it at a local beauty supply store, I realized that it was not the best fit for me, especially how I normally style my hair (very into the 40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Chi, Global Keratin, Sedu Ionic Ceramic Pro, and this Sedu Revolution Tourmaline is by far the best flat iron in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I had the larger sedu straightener prior to this one which was great when i had longer hair</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and lets you know when its ready with a change of lights.</li>
            <li>Heats up super fast.</li>
            <li>promised, gave it a few more months to make sure the product isn&#x27;t faulty and doesn&#x27;t stop over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My plates were old and I loved the iron, but wanted to try something different!</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean - I just use a wet towel and wipe the plates clean and they look brand new</li>
            <li>but then i cut it off to right above my shoulders and this iron does a lot better with that.</li>
            <li>This is a decent iron, nothing special.</li>
            <li>my opinion if you&#x27;re going to be spending this kind of money on this type of product they should be able to work for 2 years before showing signs of failure.</li>
            <li>I liked the Sedu Revolution iron when I first received it nine months ago - it looked nice, and seemed to do a decent job of straightening my hair, although the results didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very fast and doesn&#x27;t Damaged my hair like my chi straightener</li>
            <li>Excited about trying something new, I wanted to give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to have that seemed to pull more of my hair out than actually straighten it.</li>
            <li>I had the possibility next to my orders of being refunded if I have got a better price which I did</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been noticing for months that it was not getting as hot as it once did.</li>
            <li>First, I bought it at a fraction of the price with a coupon.</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair just as shiny and smooth as my old Sedu did.</li>
            <li>I thought that I had damaged my hair from years of straightening and the iron was not to blame, but I tried a friend&#x27;s CHI and it left my hair shiny and smooth leading me to confirm that it&#x27;s the straightener I&#x27;ve been using and not my hair!</li>
            <li>I love this straightener if simply glided through my 4A afro hair leaving me with a sleep straightened do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had more complements on my hair in the last month than ever before.</li>
            <li>I had Hot Tools before this and a Chi before that.</li>
            <li>It was lightener than my old one and felt cheap - still hopeful, I tried using it and immediately knew something was up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first \\&quot;salon quality\\&quot; hair straightener.  </li>
            <li>And if I thought my old straighteners got hot and made my hair shiny and smooth, they&#x27;ve got nothing on this styling</li>
            <li>was exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On top of that, the straightened hair does not last, it keeps getting curlier and</li>
            <li>I noticed that my hair does not get frizzy in humid or hot weather.</li>
            <li>, first impression is</li>
            <li>When my sister requested a styling iron as a holiday gift, I searched many different products.</li>
            <li>But then.....about 3 weeks after I purchased it I started notcicing that it didn&#x27;t seem to be getting as hot as it had in the beginning.</li>
            <li>This straightener is really smooth and leaves hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>I had my first Sedu straightener for 10 years before the cord stopped working.</li>
            <li>I guess she was just making her own life harder by not having the Sedu Revolution straightener and wielding a CHI turbo instead.  </li>
            <li>I was also able to get close enough to my roots to know</li>
            <li>B002NBF8SI Hot Off The Press Thermal Protection Spray By Paul Mitchell for Unisex]].&lt;br</li>
            <li>It straightens on the first try..</li>
            <li>I go to school, have gym, then go to lacrosse practice, and my hair still seems to somehow be straight after my day!</li>
            <li>You will thank me for this review later:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since November 2011, and it works just as well as when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s less comfortable in my hand and takes up more space when traveling)&lt;br</li>
            <li>MY last flat iron was a bespoke that last 6 years working perfect...</li>
            <li>Amazing since I normally have problems with this when using flat irons.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can quickly and easily achieve straight, silky results that last and make the frizz look like I just got a perm.</li>
            <li>So my recommmendation is to bit the bullet and buy the sedu flat iron your hair will love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay flat iron</li>
            <li>As with any flat iron, should be used sparingly, once or twice a week at most.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>The swivel cord is a nice length, longer than any other straightener I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Normally I would spray my hair with heat protected product before using a flat iron, I would be happy with the results until the day got hot and humid which turn my hair back to frizz.</li>
            <li>the price is cheaper, but it is definitely the original sedu iron!</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>Loved this iron for the past three years, then one of the plates stopped getting hot.</li>
            <li>Love this one as much as the last.</li>
            <li>The Sedu flat iron IS THE BEST of all flat irons...new to the flat iron arena, but the \\&quot;chi\\&quot; was nothing like this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast, easy to use, and professional grade - I will never go back to the cheap irons again.</li>
            <li>I only wish they were a bit longer or thicker, other than that they are great.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it becoming wavy or frizzy hours later.  </li>
            <li>I flat iron my hair everyday and that&#x27;s an incredible lifespan for a hair iron.</li>
            <li>Using it as a curling Iron-I can add soft curls, wave&#x27;s, flips or full on curls with this iron.</li>
            <li>After my last flat iron gave out (we had three good years)</li>
            <li>Plus she said that she had the same Sedu flat iron and loved it.</li>
            <li>flat iron straightens my hair unbelievably quickly and leaves it silky smooth and very soft!  </li>
            <li>This iron makes my hair super shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It gets to be hot and ready very fast&lt;</li>
            <li>I also love the waves I can make and the fact that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry or damaged the day after.</li>
            <li>In own words &amp;#34;way past their warranty!&amp;#34; Bottom line here is that I could have gone to bed bath and beyond and purchased this item with the 20% off coupon &amp; it would still be under warranty, and I would have only paid about $10 more.</li>
            <li>I made sure to stick with the same brand when purchasing a new one though.</li>
            <li>but I am able to wear my hair down because it&#x27;s incredably soft, flowing, silky, shiny, smooth, and I can run my fingers in my hair without it getting caught on all of the split ends that never seem to get straightened</li>
            <li>I have lots of super fine hair that gets destroyed with any other iron but this one.  </li>
            <li>this is the first flat iron i have found that glides smoothly without pinching.  </li>
            <li>I could pretty much let my hair air-dry for the most part and use the straightener instead of having to blow-dry the roots around a round brush to make sure its not going to have any lumpies on the back of my head.  </li>
            <li>That was fine with me since I already had several of them.</li>
            <li>The Sedu had very high ratings.</li>
            <li>Very high quality product.</li>
            <li>With my Conair, I would see how much it was damaging my hair even with the heat protected product; my hair would contain so many split ends and become very dry.</li>
            <li>I can also easily curl my hair with this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I should have gotten more than1&amp;#34;, i got ir rather quickly, feels like a sturdy flat iron, that will last.</li>
            <li>I bought this 1\\&quot; straight barrel</li>
            <li>and they would get my hair to be &#x27;straight&#x27; but not pin straight</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and cools&lt;br /&gt;off</li>
            <li>Now, as of yesterday morning, the whole thing is officially kaput.</li>
            <li>The adjustable heat settings are convenient and it heats up fairly fast.  </li>
            <li>It has multiple heat settings that go up over 400 degrees, and there&#x27;s a blue/orange light that tells you when the iron&#x27;s heated up.</li>
            <li>and it stays straight for a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>There is so much you can do with them, curls, straighten your hair, flipping the ends etc...</li>
            <li>which didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>and I can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>edges\\&quot; really have allowed me to experiment with using it to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so fortunate that I always start in the back so that I can hide the damage.  </li>
            <li>straight or even close to bone straight.  </li>
            <li>It arrived surprisingly fast after I put in the order.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wet/Dry Tourmaline Iron for about 3 years to turn my frizzy hair to somewhat straight</li>
            <li>I have very stubborn hair and at times it would not hold a curl because my hair would not hold it.</li>
            <li>Fast Heat up</li>
            <li>Instead of waiting 5 minutes or so for an iron to heat up fast</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to iron my hair often; the Sedu product really keeps its word.</li>
            <li>My hair is so straight and shiny.</li>
            <li>Moreover, it stayed straight all the way until i completed my whole head.</li>
            <li>We were even going to a beach town where it was really windy and drizzly.  </li>
            <li>It used to take me 20 minutes to straighten my whole head of hair with the cheaper irons, I&#x27;m done and out the door in 10 minutes with the Sedu.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always watched how much I spend when it comes to straighteners</li>
            <li>and my hair wouldn&#x27;t stay straight all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming a real Sedu would provide.  </li>
            <li>Very upsetting since Sedu will not acknowledge the purchase and replace since it was bought on amazon and without an authenticity guarantee.  </li>
            <li>I was going to buy the Sultra, but it seemed too much like the others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My hair remains straight</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>my hair didn&#x27;t get as straight</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to even doubt these are genuine Sedu and not fakes</li>
            <li>and I couldn´t get the straight look....</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed</li>
            <li>that was most certainly not my case</li>
            <li>So I actually opened the iron up and could see the little part that wore to the point where two parts stopped touching by a millimeter causing the electricity to not be able to make a complete circuit consistently.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair as well and the rounded edges make it easy for hair bend styles, flips or curls.</li>
            <li>But honestly, if I had the choice, I would choose a different flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I have super curly (ringlet) hair that is a couple inches past my shoulders, and love to straighten with my new straightner!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t straighten my hair any better than any other brand.</li>
            <li>I have also tried the paris hilton curling straightener brush thing which was pointless and loud if kind of fun.    </li>
            <li>and it wa snot honoured by seller , other than that, is an OK product.</li>
            <li>But one day, after about 14 months of normal usage, IT CAUGHT ON FIRE IN MY HAND!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to the original.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think the plate quality is better with Sedu but due to ergonomics and the size, I opted for the Babyliss.</li>
            <li>(Note, a different iron then my original).</li>
            <li>Peace of mind that an authorized retailer will exchange/give you your money back is worth the $10!</li>
            <li>The older version was much straighter.</li>
            <li>I had it set to 340, which was fine, but then I actually ended up lowering it just a little more</li>
            <li>Loved it, but the only down side was the cord got so tangled.</li>
            <li>this is an update to my past review of this product where I rave about how amazing it is..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally prone to frizzy hair, but this helps keep it flat and smooth</li>
            <li>This is great because I have very processed hair that has been breaking mid shaft lately.</li>
            <li>(red when not blue good to go) and only takes like one minute to heat up!</li>
            <li>i had an iso before this and paid alot more for it and this one way out-performs the iso and costs less.</li>
            <li>I cannot speak to the longevity of this product, because I have owned it less than one month, but in terms of performance, I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>I owned the older version 1</li>
            <li>I spent the whole day at Disneyland in 80 degree weather and my hair was shinny and still had smooth look.  </li>
            <li>My older sister has one, and went to college</li>
            <li>I guess what you&#x27;re paying for is clever marketing in this case.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, six months later, one of the plates stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s a standard plug too and not a big bulky one.</li>
            <li>I purchased this flat iron on another website because they had a special offer that made it a lower price than Amazon.  </li>
            <li>However, other than moisture present in the air (which isn&#x27;t too likely as I live in Arizona), my hair stays great, and it is sleekand</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>High quality unit.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel that I am damaging my hair no matter how high I adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li>So I decided to shell out a little more money for this Sedu iron</li>
            <li>wow, I have very wavy hair, and after using this hair iron</li>
            <li>I have had it a few months and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I was using it like normal and then as I was gliding through my hair it literally burned my hair off.</li>
            <li>I had been trying for years to figure out a way to be able to do my hair at home and achieve close to a salon look but could never get my hair straight with the usual beauty supply store brands.</li>
            <li>This iron is also fairly heavy compared to most irons.</li>
            <li>today when i picked it up to use it, after i finally got it to heat up, it started sparking where the flat iron connects to the cable, gave a HUGE spark, right near my hair, which almost burned me and completely stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used Chi or Babyliss but read reviews that this was the new professionals pick...</li>
            <li>My new Sedu is like a dream, my hair doesn&#x27;t tug and pull and break as I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li>and it was time for a new flatiron.</li>
            <li>I bought a new BabyLiss</li>
            <li>I ordered this product new from amazon and what I received was a used hair iron.</li>
            <li>so I purchased a new one.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this 1\\&quot; Ionic straightener and it has stopped working after only 3 weeks of light use.</li>
            <li>My old Sedu, made my hair bone straight, soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It does not get my hair straight like Asian or Indian straight hair</li>
            <li>It does not pull your har and gives a smooth sleek look without continuous strokes and that to me is a big deal when in a hurry or just simply not wanting heat damage.</li>
            <li>I expected more, especially for this price.</li>
            <li>(I loved that hair iron so much and it lasted me a couple of years until some idiot at the company office told me it should work fine in South Korea when I was moved there...</li>
            <li>it just wasn&#x27;t getting hot enough to do that anymore.</li>
            <li>the first lasted about 2 years with daily use.</li>
            <li>Stopped getting hot enough.</li>
            <li>After 6 months only one plate was hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many irons in the past and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>The GHD and Sedu are the exact same thing to me.</li>
            <li>This iron worked decently at first but broke after only 3 months.</li>
            <li>and this is good secondary type of flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have extreamly thick hard to manage hair and this straightner get my hair straight with the option to do a flip at the bottom :) Much better than the Chi</li>
            <li>My hair is natural and its been gettin harder and harder to find a good straightener to straighten my coarse hair, but this iron worked miracles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply amazing, and with the porisity products there were very little short hair breakage in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I have a Gold n Hot Flat Iron that I got back in 2002 or 2003 and that thing gets extremely hot (has no temp.</li>
            <li>and I can tell my hair likes it so much better than the other flat iron.</li>
            <li>My old one didn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li>At the time it was my first flat iron</li>
            <li>I will say I was a bit hesitant at first; but, this flat iron works wonders for my kinky-curly hair type.</li>
            <li>The other stayed cool.</li>
            <li>it normally takes me an hour of flat ironing and blow drying to make my hair straight.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this flat iron is a dream come true.</li>
            <li>Tourmaline ceramic plates produces far infra-red heat to release  negative ions which reduces static and helps seal the cuticle to make your hair smoother and shiner.  </li>
            <li>i received old one</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t wow me.  </li>
            <li>After washing my hair, it does not feel soft until I run this iron over</li>
            <li>The one I had before this lasted for nearly 6 years.</li>
            <li>I used the iron this morning just to see if I would really get the results that I had read in several blogs/web store fronts/consumer reviews.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that it leaves my hair shinier than my old Chi ever did.  </li>
            <li>Definitely not a waste of money.</li>
            <li>WHICH WAS 4 1/2 MONTHS, IT THEN STOPPED HEATING COMPLETELY.</li>
            <li>nothing compared to my old straightener.</li>
            <li>on/off switch very touchy......can be turned off suddenly</li>
            <li>Ionic Styling Iron has been a whole different animal.  </li>
            <li>Sedu offers a 2 year warranty but not on counterfeit products.</li>
            <li>Although this iron is  pricier than both my old ones, it is def.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised how well my hair holds a curl after using this Iron.  </li>
            <li>This iron made my hair too soft believe it or not.</li>
            <li>-I straightened one side with the sedu revolution and one side with my 1 1/2 inch Sedu backup that is over 6 years old.</li>
            <li>a professional and</li>
            <li>- I recommend starting on the lower settings until you see how much heat you need.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months now, and I gotta say, my hair looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>I tried the HSI Professional</li>
            <li>So far I don&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li>and it is natural, and</li>
            <li>After 4 months, it stopped completely.</li>
            <li>My hair frequently snags on the plates, and often smells burned after I have straightened it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money and the warranty stands when purchasing through here where some does not when sold through second or third party vendors.</li>
            <li>I used the Blue Magic brand of hair grease (green colored one) for the oil to help straighten her hair.</li>
            <li>needless to say, that hair iron was not meant for the voltage of that country, despite what the company told me, and thus my beloved hair iron was ruined).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get compliments from random strangers on the street about my hair, which I think is a good indicator of the quality.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I broke it when using it in Europe, so I opted for a couple cheaper brands to see what else was out there (even though I LOVED my Sedu).</li>
            <li>For those of you who are expecting the same results, please note that I always blow dry my hair straight first (this helps with volume)</li>
            <li>You may also have noticed that other reviewers boast that their hair stays straight under very humid conditions.  </li>
            <li>The gsm&#x27;s and the chi&#x27;s look like they die all too quickly these days (1 year on average in the reviews).  </li>
            <li>I bought the 1\\&quot; because a beautican told me that the smaller flat iron have more concentrated heat as opposed to the larger flat irons</li>
            <li>The section that I decided to flat iron was perfectly straight.</li>
            <li>I returned this flat iron it did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for natural / coarse hair.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected, leaves my hair silky soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>only problem I had with this older model was with its swivel style cord attatched at the unit.  </li>
            <li>it straightens my hair on the first stroke, not having to constantly go over the same piece of hair 5 times and does not snag any hairs at all.</li>
            <li>Amazon did not want to take it back at first because of health concerns with personal care products.</li>
            <li>I have thick, course hair that is color treated and highlighted - I needed an iron that was strong and yet gentle enough to use on my damaged hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out or damage my hair, it heats up and cools down quickly, and it works fast to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>This one leaves my hair shiny and straight all day long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;From the very beginning, I realized it took a long time to heat up.</li>
            <li>As a grad student surviving on a pitiful stipend, flat irons that cost $100+ are a pretty big investment for me,</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews and considering price i expected higher quality.  </li>
            <li>Having said this, I have been straightening my hair with flat irons for the past twelve or more years.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately the Sedu I received takes forever to warm up and even when I have the heat on the very highest setting, I still have to run the iron over the same spot 3 or 4 times to get the look</li>
            <li>: I have Asian hair; very coarse, thin (volume wise), and layered ALL over.</li>
            <li>As an example, when my hair is straight, it falls exactly half-way down my back; whereas, when it is curly, it sits just below my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>Also, I do believe that this new Sedu iron has a higher heat setting than my previous Sedu iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After doing a 40 minute Insanity workout--during which, sweat steadily runs down my face--my hair stayed completely straight, save for the 1/2\\&quot; inch area closest to my scalp.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Of course, even though using tourmaline ceramic plates can protect hair from high heat damage and breakage, I always use a heat protection spray before flat ironing my hair -  </li>
            <li>My hair tends to be very frizzy and dry</li>
            <li>I am African American and have very thick/coarse hair.</li>
            <li>It is red while it heats up, then changes to blue when it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li>Luckily I unplugged it everyday</li>
            <li>and I also have a lot of hair where I would normally pay high price at the Salon because it takes stylist longer than usual to do my hair because there&#x27;s so much of it.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this flat iron!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this works fine for fine or thin hair but for my thick hair I have to take really small sections to get the desired result, even on the highest setting and it takes forever.  </li>
            <li>I have thick course hair and while the Chi straightened fine</li>
            <li>After reading multiple reviews online I check out the high end irons at a local beauty supply store</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really wondering how long the replacement iron will really last (another 9 months?)</li>
            <li>With the heat setting turned all the way up to 450, I can close the iron and wrap my bare hand around the straightening</li>
            <li>The Sedu Revolution barely made it 13 months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy or puffy or rough.</li>
            <li>It actually makes it look soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I only straighten my natural curly 4c hair once every 6 months.</li>
            <li>I am mixed race: African-American, Native American and White, and I have very curly hair with frizz in some places.  </li>
            <li>It does get hot, but that&#x27;s much needed since my hair is so thick.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work any better than my Chi... which is not great.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed when using the Sedu was that I didn&#x27;t have to clamp down to keep the hair in the iron.</li>
            <li>I can only assume that the positive reviews come from people with fine hair (I have coarse, thick, curly hair) and from those who have not owned the iron very long.</li>
            <li>It is a professional-quality styling tool and more expensive than some other products; however, the price is worth it for the quality.</li>
            <li>You still have to pull locks of hair through a few times, so its not necessarily faster than other straighteners, but it just straight-up works better (no pun intended).  </li>
            <li>This seller on the other hand did not know much about the product either.</li>
            <li>Having burnt out my old Chi flat iron I switched to this Sedu.  </li>
            <li>Doing flips and curls is hard because the barrel is wide on top and bottom and it also snags your hair.</li>
            <li>I am African American with natural 4b, 4c Hair ( i think)</li>
            <li>can get a little hot at the tips when trying to hold plates together......</li>
            <li>other than the minor inconveniances stated above, it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Also, sont get discouraged by its small plate size, I have long thick south asian hair and this flat iron works great on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li>I am an AA female with fine, frizz-pone texlaxed hair, and not good at styling and straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>It does not leave my hair dry, but soft.</li>
            <li>My hair only stays straight for about an hour after I straighten it on average.  </li>
            <li>Although I just got this iron three weeks ago, I know that my old Sedu lasted three years and is STILL WORKING, so I hope this will last just as long.</li>
            <li>I did have the two year warranty and spent my money shipping it back and received a new iron or refurbished one in a matter of weeks</li>

            <li> Couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t get to the roots of the hair really good like the CHI did</li>

            <li> Love love love!!!!  </li>

            <li> HOWEVER, this \\&quot;iconic styling iron\\&quot; SOLVES THAT PROBLEM!</li>

            <li> This thing makes my hair look great, quick!  </li>
            <li> Very nice, high end straightener at a good price!</li>
            <li> this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> By the way, Sedu is amazing quality.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing...</li>
            <li> It works amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought my iron thru Ulta for they have an amazing return policy.</li>
            <li> Sedu iron is amazing and along with the Argan oil</li>
            <li> it makes may hair look and feel amazing.</li>
            <li> The 450 degree setting was amazing.</li>
            <li> Sedu is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> The iron came with a nice heat pad to lay the iron on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s barely warm.</li>
            <li> The Sedu is perfect for those that have curly course hair, leaves hair straight and does not leave the hair smelling burned.</li>
            <li> AND ARE MORE CONCERNED WITH POLICIES RATHER THAN A GOOD CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to set the temperature to the highest degrees to get a perfect strand of straight hair with one or two passes.</li>
            <li> I liked it while it lasted.</li>
            <li> It is the best I have ever used, and it makes me feel great to do a better job at straightening my hair than a professional.  </li>
            <li> but I realized spending more on a good quality straightener</li>
            <li> however it literally takes 20 minutes to warm up and another 20 minutes to straighten.  </li>
            <li> buy yourself something nice that you will cherish for years to come.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many Chi&#x27;s (a good straightener</li>
            <li> It can also create very nice curls (as long as you know how to do it lol!)</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve EVER own!</li>
            <li> I did see one who condemned the correct product, then purchased it again after trying it in a store, and the new one was awesome like it should be.  </li>
            <li> Was also very easy to curl with this styling iron.  </li>
            <li> Use to have a chi till it quit working on me and the Sedu is for sure way better!</li>
            <li> I would recommend the Sedu Revolution to anyone looking for a good flat iron that will not damage their hair and leave them looking flawless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far the best iron I ever used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I shopped around a lot and Amazon by far had the best price.</li>
            <li> I love it, love it, love it!  </li>
            <li> Great iron, heats up fast, smooths my hair, no complaints!  </li>
            <li> Plus it arrived at my house quickly!!</li>
            <li> It works fine, it just wasn&#x27;t spectacular.</li>
            <li> I would spend $30 more and get the sedu package with the serum and heat resistant case.</li>
            <li> I love the sedu straightener&#x27;s and am always satisfied with my results after using their products.</li>
            <li> Needs better warranty for price</li>
            <li> I love my Sedu straightener.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener.</li>
            <li> Love, love.  </li>
            <li> The Sedu seems to be OK</li>
            <li> The product is OK  but be carefu lwho you buy it form.</li>
            <li> So  that is all the product seems to be OK.</li>
            <li> and I must say, I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been curling (more like beachy waves)</li>
            <li> I could not be happier!! :)</li>
            <li> Love this straightener.</li>
            <li> I am impressed - the thing I did differently in selecting this iron (as opposed to priuor purchases)</li>
            <li> was making sure I purchased one compatible with my hair type.</li>
            <li> I was deciding between this one and the CHI because those are the two I hear the most about.  </li>
            <li> this one I think may be even better.  </li>
            <li> If I could give more stars I would.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> I WAS ABLE TO USE IT UNTIL JUNE</li>
            <li> It was delivered in sufficient time, and I love this straightner.</li>
            <li> and it just overall wonderful.</li>
            <li> Works great and my hair stays straight all day.</li>
            <li> Please see sedu website for more information on authorized dealers</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and I was pleased with the results, but it was a hassle doing my hair at times.</li>
            <li> Im sure the serum helped with the ultra sleek results.</li>
            <li> if they&#x27;re authentic, I got mine from Bed</li>
            <li> , I began to wonder if there was a better alternative.  </li>
            <li> and I love the results.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Initally I was in love.</li>
            <li> Just to be sure</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> The top and bottom irons also looked like they were separating.</li>
            <li> When spending over $100 on a product, I expect a lot more.</li>
            <li> It is so smooth!  </li>
            <li> I did all my research and couldn&#x27;t find anything better.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> is always better.</li>
            <li> straightner(s) I would have to go through it more than once</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> if you care about your locks and you only want the best for them, splurge.  </li>
            <li> but like this better.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to curl with it</li>
            <li> So many layers.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and so they heat up better.</li>
            <li> Much better than the one picked up at a discount store.  </li>
            <li> I returned it to the store where it was purchased and was able to receive another one as a replacement.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this iron for a couple months now and I am more in love with my Sedu than before.</li>
            <li> I do like that with the rolled edges, it&#x27;s easier to add a bit of curl to my hair which I wasn&#x27;t able to before.</li>
            <li> I love my Sedu straightener.</li>
            <li> I did have a 2 year warranty, so I will be able to get a replacement.  </li>
            <li> I love that the heat is adjustable.  </li>
            <li> The best flat iron I have ever had.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron I have ever come across on.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> It was the best decision I could have made regarding a flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt the best flat irons I have ever owned!!</li>
            <li> te best flat iron ever!!!!</li>
            <li> worth the cost!!</li>
            <li> The plates leave my fine hair very smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I bought so many hair products which easily cost around 500$ over a course of two months (no lie) .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure all you ladies are familiar with accidentally touching your hair too soon after the iron&#x27;s been on it and burning yourself just from that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most advanced for keeping moisture in your hair</li>
            <li> it is a good investment, heats up fast, has diff temperatures, slides easily...</li>
            <li> I know I am doing something right when I have hairdressers asking me what kind of products and appliances I use in my hair.  </li>
            <li> this iron straightens my hair easily.  </li>
            <li> The cord has a swivel rotation so you can move the iron easily without getting all tangled up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it was an easy return, no hassels.</li>
            <li> From what I have experienced, and also heard from many reviews, this product probably has an internal wiring problem.</li>
            <li> The plates also move a bit, making it easy to create volume.  </li>
            <li> I could feel a tug on my hair as I pulled it through, and I had to pull it through more times than I did with the old one, and the results weren&#x27;t as good</li>
            <li> It works just as amazing as my first Sedu tourmaline iron.  </li>
            <li> I had really liked using the dryer - fast results!</li>
            <li> Also does a great job curling the hair Love this flat iron ditching my chi!</li>
            <li> I like that it is light weight and has a swivel cord that does not tangle easily.</li>
            <li> Chi does a wonderful job, but my last iron just didn&#x27;t get as hot as I would&#x27;ve preferred.  </li>
            <li> , then I straighten using a fine tooth comb in front of the iron.  </li>
            <li> The temp dial is just a turn knob, which is fine</li>
            <li> have a friend that recommended this straighter, she has really fine hair</li>
            <li> It straightened it just fine.</li>
            <li> Tourmaline makes my hair super shiny!</li>
            <li> It straightens my hair quickly while making it look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> This product is reliable, fast heating, light and handy.</li>
            <li> but it was huge and pulled my hair.</li>
            <li> A couple weeks ago it stopped working all the time I had to move the cord to get the light to turn on and start heating</li>
            <li> I have been getting by with cheap straighteners from CVS/Target/etc for years</li>
            <li> The sedu  flows smoothly thru hair without pulling.</li>
            <li> i have really curly hair and this iron is amazing.</li>
            <li> The iron felt lightweight in my hand and smoothly went over my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it with Chi heat protection spray and that keeps my hair smooth and glossy.</li>
            <li> Light flickers and does not curl or straighten hair in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> No difference than cheap products</li>
            <li> I will never buy cheap straighteners again.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s smooth</li>
            <li> It glides smoothly and never &#x27;catches&#x27; in my hair.  </li>
            <li> You never hear a crackling sound like with cheaper straighteners.  </li>
            <li> After wandering around for a bit and doing some exploring, my hair was just as silky smooth and fuzz-free as it was when I finished straightening it.  </li>
            <li> The plates are as smooth as glass, and never any snagging.</li>
            <li> The Sedu Revolution is extremely light in weight, it doesn&#x27;t feel like your holding it.</li>
            <li> In case your wondering it makes a great birthday present.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> Bought two sedu irons and the first one got a 3 star, this one however gets a 5 star because it is super amazing.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this, and it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is my first flat styling iron, and it has been really easy to use &amp; does a very good job.</li>
            <li> the unit is working properly it does a very nice job of straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li> I kept reading great reviews about this flat iron, so maybe it was the seller.</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron.</li>
            <li> The packaging is beautiful, its sleek, sexy, and the iron itself is heavy duty.</li>
            <li> I almost use it everyday and my hair looks so beautiful and healthy.  </li>
            <li> original - nothing compares to the sedu revolution.  </li>
            <li> After many years of using a Chi, I am  very pleased with the performance of the Sedu flat iron.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and do my best to keep my hair really healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Also the \\&quot;unique curved</li>
            <li> , I got this product within 1-2 weeks , so was pretty satisfied there as well.</li>
            <li> I originally wrote this review in September 2011, I still have the Sedu now</li>
            <li> bellow is my original review...   </li>
            <li> First day after using it, I didn&#x27;t realize it was going to rain and was saddened since my hair was for sure going to frizz up.  </li>
            <li> It will leave you hair silky smooth and full of shine.  </li>
            <li> I love it better than my old Chi and the Paul Mitchel Iron.  </li>
            <li> product itslef is really good, heats up in short amount of time and leaves my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- SUPER smooth plates.</li>
            <li> Not anyone&#x27;s fault but my own, so i&#x27;d suggest buying something to place your straightener on, kind of like a placemat, but made of metal or some other non-flammable material.</li>
            <li> It is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a good straightener that doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and is quick and really gets my hair pin straight.  </li>
            <li> This styling iron is  one of the best less breakage then other ones I have used before price is good for the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to pull it right through as slowly or as quickly as you like.  </li>
            <li> and I was very happy with its performance for the first few months.  </li>
            <li> there was a mix up with my order and this seller was more than accommodating and very helpful.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and this straightener works great!  </li>
            <li> I initially bought it after reading good reviews for it online.  </li>
            <li> I had my last one (Infra) for about 8 years and loved it...</li>
            <li> Same holds good for this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it, it heats up fast</li>
            <li> I love it so much, thAT I ended up purchasing another 1\\&quot; for my daughter and a 1.5\\&quot; for myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very good flat iron, love the black plates, hair runs through it very smoothly.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;This model came in a high quality super cool box with a free tiny mini version of it, in it&#x27;s own super nice box.  </li>
            <li> I used my new sedu flat iron on my hair for the first time today and i am genuinely impressed.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this flat iron to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a great tool and who wants to get their money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> I loved this flat iron but they need to work on the wiring.</li>
            <li> But after having hair nightmares , I knew I had to spend it on some really good quality product and this Sedu flat iron</li>
            <li> , I think you need to invest in good thermal protection products irrespective of whatever flat iron you purchase.</li>
            <li> I love my new straightner!</li>
            <li> quickly.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and does not pull at my hair.</li>
            <li> It heats quickly.  </li>
            <li> heats up quickly, well-made product.  </li>
            <li> , this Sedu iron made my hair look super shiny</li>
            <li> Until now, I have been loyal to the Chi brand.  </li>
            <li> Iron heats up quickly, has temperature adjustments and does not damage my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick too.</li>
            <li> and so do I we needed something that wasn’t going to damage our hair so much and this had been a great purchase, I definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> it leave my hair soft shinny and does not damage me hair, love it so much!!!</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price, Superr smooth, doesnt pull, im</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever bought (until it broke 4 months later</li>
            <li> It locks out the humidity even in hot humid climates, leaving my hair looking silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> This flat iron also glides over my hair effortlessly, which is great because I&#x27;ve become used to styling tools snagging on my hair (resulting in very unwanted split ends).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I decided to try something new since the latest CHIs don&#x27;t have a temperature</li>
            <li> I learned that it was very important to comb first, but once I started using the iron correctly I consistently got stellar results.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and heats up really fast.</li>
            <li> Some of them get really hot and are able to make my tresses soft and smooth, but ALL of them managed to catch or snag my hair in the process.  </li>
            <li> I was searching for a new iron, I didn&#x27;t want to be cheap and buy a budget one at the local store, even though some of them may give you good results.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine, relatively straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Still searching for a good first \\&quot;go-to flat iron\\&quot; though.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky smooth and you only have to go over it once or twice to get a straight amazing look.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and heat up real fast.  </li>
            <li> You can adjust the heat setting and the flashing light indicator lets you know when it&#x27;s ready</li>
            <li> I do love the Sedu, i have owned several, it heats up great and fast and you only have to run it through your hair once, but after a couple years the cord shorts out</li>
            <li> I think this is totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was leery of the prices but in the end it was worth it.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> However, my old sedu iron left my hair gorgeously shiny and smooth,</li>
            <li> Your hair will be soft, shiny, and frizz free for DAYS (until you wash it of course)!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> worth it.</li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I eventually decided to buy it along with the Sedu Argan Oil Anti-Frizz Polishing Treatment and all I can say is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The money is well worth it, if I had an accident and</li>
            <li> It was definitly worth the money.</li>
            <li> worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I felt it was worth noting the &#x27;authorized&#x27; seller part.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> the CHI is nice and all, but only has one heat setting, which can fry your hair.</li>
            <li> It was worth the price.</li>
            <li> One last thing I&#x27;ve really liked about this product: there is a light indicator that tell you when the iron is hot and ready to use.</li>
            <li> It took the curl right out.</li>
            <li> While they responded to my request right away, all they would do is replace the product</li>
            <li> I love this hair iron just not enough to have paid full price for them (got it on groupon).</li>
            <li> It was very soft, shiney and all those wonderful things for someone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> I was thinking in getting the new InStyler but decided after seeing it at a local beauty supply store, I realized that it was not the best fit for me, especially how I normally style my hair (very into the 40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Chi, Global Keratin, Sedu Ionic Ceramic Pro, and this Sedu Revolution Tourmaline is by far the best flat iron in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I had the larger sedu straightener prior to this one which was great when i had longer hair</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and lets you know when its ready with a change of lights.</li>
            <li> Heats up super fast.</li>
            <li> promised, gave it a few more months to make sure the product isn&#x27;t faulty and doesn&#x27;t stop over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My plates were old and I loved the iron, but wanted to try something different!</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean - I just use a wet towel and wipe the plates clean and they look brand new</li>
            <li> but then i cut it off to right above my shoulders and this iron does a lot better with that.</li>
            <li> This is a decent iron, nothing special.</li>
            <li> my opinion if you&#x27;re going to be spending this kind of money on this type of product they should be able to work for 2 years before showing signs of failure.</li>
            <li> I liked the Sedu Revolution iron when I first received it nine months ago - it looked nice, and seemed to do a decent job of straightening my hair, although the results didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> It heats up very fast and doesn&#x27;t Damaged my hair like my chi straightener</li>
            <li> Excited about trying something new, I wanted to give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to have that seemed to pull more of my hair out than actually straighten it.</li>
            <li> I had the possibility next to my orders of being refunded if I have got a better price which I did</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been noticing for months that it was not getting as hot as it once did.</li>
            <li> First, I bought it at a fraction of the price with a coupon.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair just as shiny and smooth as my old Sedu did.</li>
            <li> I thought that I had damaged my hair from years of straightening and the iron was not to blame, but I tried a friend&#x27;s CHI and it left my hair shiny and smooth leading me to confirm that it&#x27;s the straightener I&#x27;ve been using and not my hair!</li>
            <li> I love this straightener if simply glided through my 4A afro hair leaving me with a sleep straightened do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had more complements on my hair in the last month than ever before.</li>
            <li> I had Hot Tools before this and a Chi before that.</li>
            <li> It was lightener than my old one and felt cheap - still hopeful, I tried using it and immediately knew something was up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first \\&quot;salon quality\\&quot; hair straightener.  </li>
            <li> And if I thought my old straighteners got hot and made my hair shiny and smooth, they&#x27;ve got nothing on this styling</li>
            <li> was exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On top of that, the straightened hair does not last, it keeps getting curlier and</li>
            <li> I noticed that my hair does not get frizzy in humid or hot weather.</li>
            <li> , first impression is</li>
            <li> When my sister requested a styling iron as a holiday gift, I searched many different products.</li>
            <li> But then.....about 3 weeks after I purchased it I started notcicing that it didn&#x27;t seem to be getting as hot as it had in the beginning.</li>
            <li> This straightener is really smooth and leaves hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> I had my first Sedu straightener for 10 years before the cord stopped working.</li>
            <li> I guess she was just making her own life harder by not having the Sedu Revolution straightener and wielding a CHI turbo instead.  </li>
            <li> I was also able to get close enough to my roots to know</li>
            <li> B002NBF8SI Hot Off The Press Thermal Protection Spray By Paul Mitchell for Unisex]].&lt;br</li>
            <li> It straightens on the first try..</li>
            <li> I go to school, have gym, then go to lacrosse practice, and my hair still seems to somehow be straight after my day!</li>
            <li> You will thank me for this review later:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since November 2011, and it works just as well as when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s less comfortable in my hand and takes up more space when traveling)&lt;br</li>
            <li> MY last flat iron was a bespoke that last 6 years working perfect...</li>
            <li> Amazing since I normally have problems with this when using flat irons.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can quickly and easily achieve straight, silky results that last and make the frizz look like I just got a perm.</li>
            <li> So my recommmendation is to bit the bullet and buy the sedu flat iron your hair will love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay flat iron</li>
            <li> As with any flat iron, should be used sparingly, once or twice a week at most.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> The swivel cord is a nice length, longer than any other straightener I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Normally I would spray my hair with heat protected product before using a flat iron, I would be happy with the results until the day got hot and humid which turn my hair back to frizz.</li>
            <li> the price is cheaper, but it is definitely the original sedu iron!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> Loved this iron for the past three years, then one of the plates stopped getting hot.</li>
            <li> Love this one as much as the last.</li>
            <li> The Sedu flat iron IS THE BEST of all flat irons...new to the flat iron arena, but the \\&quot;chi\\&quot; was nothing like this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast, easy to use, and professional grade - I will never go back to the cheap irons again.</li>
            <li> I only wish they were a bit longer or thicker, other than that they are great.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it becoming wavy or frizzy hours later.  </li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair everyday and that&#x27;s an incredible lifespan for a hair iron.</li>
            <li> Using it as a curling Iron-I can add soft curls, wave&#x27;s, flips or full on curls with this iron.</li>
            <li> After my last flat iron gave out (we had three good years)</li>
            <li> Plus she said that she had the same Sedu flat iron and loved it.</li>
            <li> flat iron straightens my hair unbelievably quickly and leaves it silky smooth and very soft!  </li>
            <li> This iron makes my hair super shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> It gets to be hot and ready very fast&lt;</li>
            <li> I also love the waves I can make and the fact that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry or damaged the day after.</li>
            <li> In own words &amp;#34;way past their warranty!&amp;#34; Bottom line here is that I could have gone to bed bath and beyond and purchased this item with the 20% off coupon &amp; it would still be under warranty, and I would have only paid about $10 more.</li>
            <li> I made sure to stick with the same brand when purchasing a new one though.</li>
            <li> but I am able to wear my hair down because it&#x27;s incredably soft, flowing, silky, shiny, smooth, and I can run my fingers in my hair without it getting caught on all of the split ends that never seem to get straightened</li>
            <li> I have lots of super fine hair that gets destroyed with any other iron but this one.  </li>
            <li> this is the first flat iron i have found that glides smoothly without pinching.  </li>
            <li> I could pretty much let my hair air-dry for the most part and use the straightener instead of having to blow-dry the roots around a round brush to make sure its not going to have any lumpies on the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> That was fine with me since I already had several of them.</li>
            <li> The Sedu had very high ratings.</li>
            <li> Very high quality product.</li>
            <li> With my Conair, I would see how much it was damaging my hair even with the heat protected product; my hair would contain so many split ends and become very dry.</li>
            <li> I can also easily curl my hair with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I should have gotten more than1&amp;#34;, i got ir rather quickly, feels like a sturdy flat iron, that will last.</li>
            <li> I bought this 1\\&quot; straight barrel</li>
            <li> and they would get my hair to be &#x27;straight&#x27; but not pin straight</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and cools&lt;br /&gt;off</li>
            <li> Now, as of yesterday morning, the whole thing is officially kaput.</li>
            <li> The adjustable heat settings are convenient and it heats up fairly fast.  </li>
            <li> It has multiple heat settings that go up over 400 degrees, and there&#x27;s a blue/orange light that tells you when the iron&#x27;s heated up.</li>
            <li> and it stays straight for a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> There is so much you can do with them, curls, straighten your hair, flipping the ends etc...</li>
            <li> which didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> and I can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li> edges\\&quot; really have allowed me to experiment with using it to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so fortunate that I always start in the back so that I can hide the damage.  </li>
            <li> straight or even close to bone straight.  </li>
            <li> It arrived surprisingly fast after I put in the order.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wet/Dry Tourmaline Iron for about 3 years to turn my frizzy hair to somewhat straight</li>
            <li> I have very stubborn hair and at times it would not hold a curl because my hair would not hold it.</li>
            <li> Fast Heat up</li>
            <li> Instead of waiting 5 minutes or so for an iron to heat up fast</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to iron my hair often; the Sedu product really keeps its word.</li>
            <li> My hair is so straight and shiny.</li>
            <li> Moreover, it stayed straight all the way until i completed my whole head.</li>
            <li> We were even going to a beach town where it was really windy and drizzly.  </li>
            <li> It used to take me 20 minutes to straighten my whole head of hair with the cheaper irons, I&#x27;m done and out the door in 10 minutes with the Sedu.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always watched how much I spend when it comes to straighteners</li>
            <li> and my hair wouldn&#x27;t stay straight all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming a real Sedu would provide.  </li>
            <li> Very upsetting since Sedu will not acknowledge the purchase and replace since it was bought on amazon and without an authenticity guarantee.  </li>
            <li> I was going to buy the Sultra, but it seemed too much like the others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My hair remains straight</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> my hair didn&#x27;t get as straight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to even doubt these are genuine Sedu and not fakes</li>
            <li> and I couldn´t get the straight look....</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed</li>
            <li> that was most certainly not my case</li>
            <li> So I actually opened the iron up and could see the little part that wore to the point where two parts stopped touching by a millimeter causing the electricity to not be able to make a complete circuit consistently.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair as well and the rounded edges make it easy for hair bend styles, flips or curls.</li>
            <li> But honestly, if I had the choice, I would choose a different flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have super curly (ringlet) hair that is a couple inches past my shoulders, and love to straighten with my new straightner!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t straighten my hair any better than any other brand.</li>
            <li> I have also tried the paris hilton curling straightener brush thing which was pointless and loud if kind of fun.    </li>
            <li> and it wa snot honoured by seller , other than that, is an OK product.</li>
            <li> But one day, after about 14 months of normal usage, IT CAUGHT ON FIRE IN MY HAND!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to the original.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think the plate quality is better with Sedu but due to ergonomics and the size, I opted for the Babyliss.</li>
            <li> (Note, a different iron then my original).</li>
            <li> Peace of mind that an authorized retailer will exchange/give you your money back is worth the $10!</li>
            <li> The older version was much straighter.</li>
            <li> I had it set to 340, which was fine, but then I actually ended up lowering it just a little more</li>
            <li> Loved it, but the only down side was the cord got so tangled.</li>
            <li> this is an update to my past review of this product where I rave about how amazing it is..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally prone to frizzy hair, but this helps keep it flat and smooth</li>
            <li> This is great because I have very processed hair that has been breaking mid shaft lately.</li>
            <li> (red when not blue good to go) and only takes like one minute to heat up!</li>
            <li> i had an iso before this and paid alot more for it and this one way out-performs the iso and costs less.</li>
            <li> I cannot speak to the longevity of this product, because I have owned it less than one month, but in terms of performance, I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I owned the older version 1</li>
            <li> I spent the whole day at Disneyland in 80 degree weather and my hair was shinny and still had smooth look.  </li>
            <li> My older sister has one, and went to college</li>
            <li> I guess what you&#x27;re paying for is clever marketing in this case.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, six months later, one of the plates stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s a standard plug too and not a big bulky one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron on another website because they had a special offer that made it a lower price than Amazon.  </li>
            <li> However, other than moisture present in the air (which isn&#x27;t too likely as I live in Arizona), my hair stays great, and it is sleekand</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> High quality unit.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel that I am damaging my hair no matter how high I adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li> So I decided to shell out a little more money for this Sedu iron</li>
            <li> wow, I have very wavy hair, and after using this hair iron</li>
            <li> I have had it a few months and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I was using it like normal and then as I was gliding through my hair it literally burned my hair off.</li>
            <li> I had been trying for years to figure out a way to be able to do my hair at home and achieve close to a salon look but could never get my hair straight with the usual beauty supply store brands.</li>
            <li> This iron is also fairly heavy compared to most irons.</li>
            <li> today when i picked it up to use it, after i finally got it to heat up, it started sparking where the flat iron connects to the cable, gave a HUGE spark, right near my hair, which almost burned me and completely stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Chi or Babyliss but read reviews that this was the new professionals pick...</li>
            <li> My new Sedu is like a dream, my hair doesn&#x27;t tug and pull and break as I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> and it was time for a new flatiron.</li>
            <li> I bought a new BabyLiss</li>
            <li> I ordered this product new from amazon and what I received was a used hair iron.</li>
            <li> so I purchased a new one.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this 1\\&quot; Ionic straightener and it has stopped working after only 3 weeks of light use.</li>
            <li> My old Sedu, made my hair bone straight, soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It does not get my hair straight like Asian or Indian straight hair</li>
            <li> It does not pull your har and gives a smooth sleek look without continuous strokes and that to me is a big deal when in a hurry or just simply not wanting heat damage.</li>
            <li> I expected more, especially for this price.</li>
            <li> (I loved that hair iron so much and it lasted me a couple of years until some idiot at the company office told me it should work fine in South Korea when I was moved there...</li>
            <li> it just wasn&#x27;t getting hot enough to do that anymore.</li>
            <li> the first lasted about 2 years with daily use.</li>
            <li> Stopped getting hot enough.</li>
            <li> After 6 months only one plate was hot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many irons in the past and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> The GHD and Sedu are the exact same thing to me.</li>
            <li> This iron worked decently at first but broke after only 3 months.</li>
            <li> and this is good secondary type of flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have extreamly thick hard to manage hair and this straightner get my hair straight with the option to do a flip at the bottom :) Much better than the Chi</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and its been gettin harder and harder to find a good straightener to straighten my coarse hair, but this iron worked miracles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply amazing, and with the porisity products there were very little short hair breakage in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I have a Gold n Hot Flat Iron that I got back in 2002 or 2003 and that thing gets extremely hot (has no temp.</li>
            <li> and I can tell my hair likes it so much better than the other flat iron.</li>
            <li> My old one didn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li> At the time it was my first flat iron</li>
            <li> I will say I was a bit hesitant at first; but, this flat iron works wonders for my kinky-curly hair type.</li>
            <li> The other stayed cool.</li>
            <li> it normally takes me an hour of flat ironing and blow drying to make my hair straight.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this flat iron is a dream come true.</li>
            <li> Tourmaline ceramic plates produces far infra-red heat to release  negative ions which reduces static and helps seal the cuticle to make your hair smoother and shiner.  </li>
            <li> i received old one</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t wow me.  </li>
            <li> After washing my hair, it does not feel soft until I run this iron over</li>
            <li> The one I had before this lasted for nearly 6 years.</li>
            <li> I used the iron this morning just to see if I would really get the results that I had read in several blogs/web store fronts/consumer reviews.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that it leaves my hair shinier than my old Chi ever did.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not a waste of money.</li>
            <li> WHICH WAS 4 1/2 MONTHS, IT THEN STOPPED HEATING COMPLETELY.</li>
            <li> nothing compared to my old straightener.</li>
            <li> on/off switch very touchy......can be turned off suddenly</li>
            <li> Ionic Styling Iron has been a whole different animal.  </li>
            <li> Sedu offers a 2 year warranty but not on counterfeit products.</li>
            <li> Although this iron is  pricier than both my old ones, it is def.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how well my hair holds a curl after using this Iron.  </li>
            <li> This iron made my hair too soft believe it or not.</li>
            <li> -I straightened one side with the sedu revolution and one side with my 1 1/2 inch Sedu backup that is over 6 years old.</li>
            <li> a professional and</li>
            <li> - I recommend starting on the lower settings until you see how much heat you need.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months now, and I gotta say, my hair looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> I tried the HSI Professional</li>
            <li> So far I don&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li> and it is natural, and</li>
            <li> After 4 months, it stopped completely.</li>
            <li> My hair frequently snags on the plates, and often smells burned after I have straightened it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money and the warranty stands when purchasing through here where some does not when sold through second or third party vendors.</li>
            <li> I used the Blue Magic brand of hair grease (green colored one) for the oil to help straighten her hair.</li>
            <li> needless to say, that hair iron was not meant for the voltage of that country, despite what the company told me, and thus my beloved hair iron was ruined).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get compliments from random strangers on the street about my hair, which I think is a good indicator of the quality.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I broke it when using it in Europe, so I opted for a couple cheaper brands to see what else was out there (even though I LOVED my Sedu).</li>
            <li> For those of you who are expecting the same results, please note that I always blow dry my hair straight first (this helps with volume)</li>
            <li> You may also have noticed that other reviewers boast that their hair stays straight under very humid conditions.  </li>
            <li> The gsm&#x27;s and the chi&#x27;s look like they die all too quickly these days (1 year on average in the reviews).  </li>
            <li> I bought the 1\\&quot; because a beautican told me that the smaller flat iron have more concentrated heat as opposed to the larger flat irons</li>
            <li> The section that I decided to flat iron was perfectly straight.</li>
            <li> I returned this flat iron it did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for natural / coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected, leaves my hair silky soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> only problem I had with this older model was with its swivel style cord attatched at the unit.  </li>
            <li> it straightens my hair on the first stroke, not having to constantly go over the same piece of hair 5 times and does not snag any hairs at all.</li>
            <li> Amazon did not want to take it back at first because of health concerns with personal care products.</li>
            <li> I have thick, course hair that is color treated and highlighted - I needed an iron that was strong and yet gentle enough to use on my damaged hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out or damage my hair, it heats up and cools down quickly, and it works fast to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> This one leaves my hair shiny and straight all day long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;From the very beginning, I realized it took a long time to heat up.</li>
            <li> As a grad student surviving on a pitiful stipend, flat irons that cost $100+ are a pretty big investment for me,</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews and considering price i expected higher quality.  </li>
            <li> Having said this, I have been straightening my hair with flat irons for the past twelve or more years.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the Sedu I received takes forever to warm up and even when I have the heat on the very highest setting, I still have to run the iron over the same spot 3 or 4 times to get the look</li>
            <li> : I have Asian hair; very coarse, thin (volume wise), and layered ALL over.</li>
            <li> As an example, when my hair is straight, it falls exactly half-way down my back; whereas, when it is curly, it sits just below my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> Also, I do believe that this new Sedu iron has a higher heat setting than my previous Sedu iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After doing a 40 minute Insanity workout--during which, sweat steadily runs down my face--my hair stayed completely straight, save for the 1/2\\&quot; inch area closest to my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Of course, even though using tourmaline ceramic plates can protect hair from high heat damage and breakage, I always use a heat protection spray before flat ironing my hair -  </li>
            <li> My hair tends to be very frizzy and dry</li>
            <li> I am African American and have very thick/coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It is red while it heats up, then changes to blue when it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li> Luckily I unplugged it everyday</li>
            <li> and I also have a lot of hair where I would normally pay high price at the Salon because it takes stylist longer than usual to do my hair because there&#x27;s so much of it.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this works fine for fine or thin hair but for my thick hair I have to take really small sections to get the desired result, even on the highest setting and it takes forever.  </li>
            <li> I have thick course hair and while the Chi straightened fine</li>
            <li> After reading multiple reviews online I check out the high end irons at a local beauty supply store</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really wondering how long the replacement iron will really last (another 9 months?)</li>
            <li> With the heat setting turned all the way up to 450, I can close the iron and wrap my bare hand around the straightening</li>
            <li> The Sedu Revolution barely made it 13 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy or puffy or rough.</li>
            <li> It actually makes it look soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I only straighten my natural curly 4c hair once every 6 months.</li>
            <li> I am mixed race: African-American, Native American and White, and I have very curly hair with frizz in some places.  </li>
            <li> It does get hot, but that&#x27;s much needed since my hair is so thick.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work any better than my Chi... which is not great.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed when using the Sedu was that I didn&#x27;t have to clamp down to keep the hair in the iron.</li>
            <li> I can only assume that the positive reviews come from people with fine hair (I have coarse, thick, curly hair) and from those who have not owned the iron very long.</li>
            <li> It is a professional-quality styling tool and more expensive than some other products; however, the price is worth it for the quality.</li>
            <li> You still have to pull locks of hair through a few times, so its not necessarily faster than other straighteners, but it just straight-up works better (no pun intended).  </li>
            <li> This seller on the other hand did not know much about the product either.</li>
            <li> Having burnt out my old Chi flat iron I switched to this Sedu.  </li>
            <li> Doing flips and curls is hard because the barrel is wide on top and bottom and it also snags your hair.</li>
            <li> I am African American with natural 4b, 4c Hair ( i think)</li>
            <li> can get a little hot at the tips when trying to hold plates together......</li>
            <li> other than the minor inconveniances stated above, it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Also, sont get discouraged by its small plate size, I have long thick south asian hair and this flat iron works great on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li> I am an AA female with fine, frizz-pone texlaxed hair, and not good at styling and straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> It does not leave my hair dry, but soft.</li>
            <li> My hair only stays straight for about an hour after I straighten it on average.  </li>
            <li> Although I just got this iron three weeks ago, I know that my old Sedu lasted three years and is STILL WORKING, so I hope this will last just as long.</li>
            <li> I did have the two year warranty and spent my money shipping it back and received a new iron or refurbished one in a matter of weeks</li>
            <li> Under normal daily conditions; however, my hair does not even become slightly frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many flat irons in the past - usually the $30-$50 ones from conair or Remington...</li>
            <li> One day I used the flat iron as I always had with the same hair products that I always use, in my house with the same electricity, and it burned my hair off--yes--</li>
            <li> The plates were not nearly as hot as my old one, my hair didn&#x27;t straighten and frizzed immediately after use (and I was still in my air conditioned apartment).</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell the difference between my croc flat iron and sedu.</li>
            <li> After extensive research on flat irons I decided to order it.</li>
            <li> you are wondering if you should spend this much on a flat iron, remember you have 30-days money back guarantee if purchased through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> My last flat iron was a Sedu that I&#x27;ve had for 5+ years.</li>
            <li> I had my last Sedu flat iron for three years.</li>
            <li> and when it does inevitably break, I won&#x27;t be purchasing a Sedu flat iron again.</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair (about 2 inches below my collar bone) and my hair is usually pretty straight, with a weird flip here and there.</li>
            <li> This is from an Afro-American female with a very coarse long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cna&#x27;t say enough good things about this iron except that you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about spending so much money on a flat iron.</li>
            <li> My hair felt inredible dry, split and damaged to the point that I had about 100 or so tiny tiny hairs all over the sink, floor, my clothes, my neck--EVERYWHERE, every time I combed my hair.     </li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re African American or have really dry hair that never seems to get moisture</li>
            <li> When I bought the iron, I got a travel-sized flatiron as well, which I don&#x27;t use much except on my bangs and small details.  </li>
            <li> 1/2\\&quot; paddle shaped Sedu tourmaline flat iron for 5 years.  </li>
            <li> with this flat iron?  </li>
            <li> I had already bought a flat iron from Sally&#x27;s about 7 months or so ago and it cost 29.99$ I believe.</li>
            <li> it never lays flat.</li>
            <li> The plates on this iron are curved on the sides, so you can create a flip at the end of your hair, or even use this as a curling iron (plenty of videos online if you google how to curl you hair with a flat iron).</li>
            <li> I ordered this flat iron after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> and then I use the Sedu flat iron...</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I BOUGHT MY FLAT IRON</li>
            <li> The iron snacked my hair couple of times unlike Sedu Ionic Ceramic flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> flat felt lot lighter.&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li> wish this company and others would make a flat iron for my type of hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really flat and shiny</li>
            <li> this flat iron did everything.</li>
            <li> The flat iron I received looked used.</li>
            <li> After years of owning a CHI flat iron, I received this one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> After using the Sedu brand of flat irons</li>
            <li> flat iron will glide over your hair like silk.  </li>
            <li> Long story short...</li>
            <li> I chase my flat brush with the iron</li>
            <li> I have had and tried almost every flat iron out there</li>
            <li> I read reviews about this flat iron and found out that it was a brand and flat iron that is used among Hollywood Runway Stylist.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t last long cord broke</li>
            <li> I received this flat iron as a birthday gift in 2011</li>
            <li> the flat iron stopped heating up, both sides.  </li>
            <li> However I would warn on purchasing this flat iron,</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no deference with this or $20 flat iron.</li>
            <li> I doesn´t heat as it is supposed so it doesn´t leave your hair really flat.</li>
            <li> In any case, I had the warranty and sent for a new iron after which I was sent a refurbished one; the iron looked slightly used and had some minor scratches.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have had this flat iron years ago!</li>
            <li> However, it leaves my hair feeling coarse, dry and looking fried.  </li>
            <li> There is not a temperature setting and it left my hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I also would be forced to straighten my roots with a blow-dryer really well before hand since it would simply not work on my roots.  </li>
            <li> I went and bought myself another brand, T3 Single Pass which lasted me 8 years prior  to the Sedu.  </li>
            <li> Also, one thing I know is that if you coil the cord around the iron, that could lead to damage in the cord; I just loosely coil my cord and place it next to the hair iron in my bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> The iron smooths my hair quite well, although it took some time for me to understand the proper techniques that go along with the use of ANY flatiron: pull at a moderate speed in smaller sections so that the plates can make contact with the hair all the way down without snags.  </li>
            <li> I have very unresponsive, thick, thick, thick caucasian hair, and with the correct heat setting I am able to achieve the look I want.  </li>
            <li> After trying several different flat irons (including 2 Crocs that both quit working, each after less than 3 months), I decided to try this flat iron at a friend&#x27;s recommendation.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this over any other flat iron out there.</li>
            <li> and I thought for a long time it was some product they were putting in my hair, but using the Sedu just proved to me that it is the quality of the straighteners they use in salons.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of spending so much money on a straightener that obviously isn&#x27;t built to last.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it doesn&#x27;t take long to straighten it.  </li>
            <li> I hope the Sedu iron continues giving my hair the shine and the healthier look for as long as I have it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was curious if others had this same problem.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Caucasian and have thin wavy hair - I was looking forward to removing the frizz and having a pin straight professional look for work with minimal prep time</li>
            <li> for this price I expected it to last forever</li>
            <li> long plates)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> My hair still looks thick (too thick) straight rather than lustful close to bone straight or bone</li>
            <li> I have always used a CHI and have owned five of them over the last 8 years due to them shorting out.</li>
            <li> When closed, the two irons did not meet and lay flat</li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other brand.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is not what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Allow me to preface this review by providing a brief description of my hair type and previous flat iron experience.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Comes with a VERY long swivel cord which prevents from tangling.  </li>
            <li> no blow dry.  </li>
            <li> Normally Amazon&#x27;s prices can&#x27;t be beat, but sometimes doing some online searching you can score some bargains if discount codes are being offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Latina and have thick and long hair.  </li>
            <li> but it definately does not live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li> My hair does not feel dry and fried when I&#x27;m done like other flat irons because of the tourmaline.</li>
            <li> The plates are only 3&amp;#34; long so it covers less hair than the Babyliss (which have 5&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The sedu flat iron glides over my hair, doesn&#x27;t snag (which my other did a lot of)</li>
            <li> You will not regret your purchase and you will end up giving or throwing away your other flat irons.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this claim, but it is actually true.  </li>
            <li> Ive used the chi, cortex, ionika, and other flat irons and the sedu has them all beat!!</li>
            <li> ALSO it stood up to the blazing hot summers and my ridiculous sweating!</li>
            <li> just a slight bump of the switch by accident and the next thing you know</li>
            <li> you can get something that performs a similar function for less money at target, but it just won&#x27;t do it as well.</li>
            <li> I was using a Titanium straightener from Sally&#x27;s before and it left the ends \\&quot;crimpy\\&quot; which you mainly wouldn&#x27;t notice until you were up close, and after several hours it would develop a &#x27;shoulder wave&#x27;, and look silly</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair straight for DAYS without trying very hard.  </li>
            <li> $150+ iron had me thinking very hard whether or not to spend that much money on a hair iron.  </li>
            <li> , your flat iron is off and cooled down......</li>
            <li> Some people say after 6 months that their flat iron broke down</li>
            <li> In compare to my old Remington flat iron , this is not good at all.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several Sedu flat irons in the past.</li>
            <li> the InStyler I feel was very limited to what type of styles you wanted.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical but after my first pass of a 1 inch section of my hair I was sold!</li>
            <li> And there were times when I would curl it, and it just felt like I was frying my hair with the previous flat</li>
            <li> I learned my lesson the hard way when I left it on the highest setting for 12 hours and created a yellow burn mark on my marble countertop...</li>
            <li> I only had trouble with the seller Beauty and fragance because  </li>
            <li> Last night when I got it, I decided to go over a few pieces of curled hair (not wavy) to see how it would do.</li>
            <li> The on and off switch plate broke, only after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I have owned the Pink Sedu Revolution for over five years and have never been faced with a defect or problem.  </li>
            <li> And once it did, it cooled off after just a few seconds of use and had to heat back up again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this much trouble with a different brand before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It quit working after using only a few months.  </li>
            <li> I tried different products on my wet hair, dried it and then used the iron.</li>
            <li> The controls are on the inside and are kind of annoying to use/access</li>
            <li> My hair styling time has been cut in half, I have really long thick hair (mid back)</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY frizzy, poofy hair that has been damaged by bleaching so its&#x27; VERY DRY.</li>
            <li> This one has quite a few upgrades from my previous iron including: a swivel cord, rolled edges, and they moved the location of the on/off switch and temperature controls from the outside of the grip portion of the handle to the interior where you&#x27;re less likely to change the temperature settings accidently.</li>
            <li> However, the only complaint I had with it was that because the edges of the plates were flat, I could not curl my hair with it.</li>
            <li> go to an authorized retailer when purchasing products such as a flat irons that commonly break or has problems.</li>
            <li> So to my knowledge about a few months of heat usage from my flat iron which was once a week.</li>
            <li> I have less split ends and does not have the dry feeling-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed after using this iron for two months that I have less split ends and that my hair does not feel dry.</li>
            <li> It shows very little signs of use on the outside.</li>
            <li> My less expensive flat iron straightened by hair but never gave it any real sheen.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I see any difference between using this and any other brand.  </li>
            <li> Due to the cut of my hair (layers throughout)</li>
            <li> And reading all these other reviews, it looks like Sedu is notorious for this issue.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely think and curly hair.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was pretty shaken up and thankful that my hair didn&#x27;t catch on fire</li>
            <li> My wrist got tire of holding it due to its weight.  </li>
            <li> Usually with other straighteners my hair would begin reverting back before i was even done.</li>
            <li> and i didnt have to go over each strand 5 times like with other irons.</li>
            <li> The one of the plates stopped working, and the other wouldn&#x27;t heat all the way through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine at Neimans.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps they got a fake on the first try.  </li>
            <li> with my other</li>
            <li> (however, I will admit that I don&#x27;t use any oil or other products on my hair, so that may be why).</li>
            <li> i have this iron, and i&#x27;ve owned and used lots of other irons.</li>
            <li> review is based on MY hair and may differ for other types of hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This package was cheaper than I found it on other websites, but it does not include the heat resistanct storage pouch.  </li>
            <li> as other posts have mentioned, I too believe there is a wiring problem with these irons.</li>
            <li> I had my other one for about 5 years.</li>
            <li> A little bit expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> American, half caucasion), and my hair is not \\&quot;nappy\\&quot; or \\&quot;wiry\\&quot;; however, I do have very tight ringlets.</li>
            <li> However, after a few uses I noticed that my hair looked fried, and felt dry after using it.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, thick, and slightly wavy and this flat iron straightens it like a champ.  </li>
            <li> So for the past three years, I&#x27;ve had the flat ceramic iron by Sedu.</li>
            <li> It works beautifully, no burning my hair like some flat irons have done in the past, and no issues with the flat iron actually working.</li>
            <li> I am of Asian descent, and my hair isn&#x27;t all that too hard to control.</li>
            <li> This is for my black sistahs with natural hair who are skeptical about the purchase of this flat iron.</li>
            <li> My only complaint...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not worth it.  </li>
            <li> (It would fall straight until my shoulders then wave out to like a 90 degree angle and go around my shoulders, totally silly looking).  </li>
            <li> Not that long after purchase, the plates stop working, usually one at a time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (yeah, I&#x27;m a slow learner), and I&#x27;ve decided that it will be my last one.</li>
            <li> and I have wavy, thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked how this flat iron is less damaging to my hair as compared to other hot tools I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> but since I live in the humid south and have really thick, uncooperative hair, I&#x27;ve always been willing to (painfully) hand over the cash.</li>
            <li> , otherwise i fear it may have burnned my house down.  </li>
            <li> --I never wear my hair down beause</li>
            <li> flat irons are expensive, so I spent a month doing my research, and I finally settled on the Sedu Revolution.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe I wasted my time with those other irons.</li>
            <li> my hair a lot lately, and was using a 1 1/4 inch flat iron previously.</li>
            <li> I bought this product less then 6 Months ago.  </li>
            <li> have purchased from sedu previously and have not had any problems.</li>
            <li> I bought this product slightly used.</li>
            <li> Previously, I&#x27;d always bought high-end drugstore / Target models.  </li>
            <li> Styling time cut in half-</li>
            <li> I spend less money on hair products because all I use is the Sedu iron and the Sedu Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> Plus my straightening time was cut in half</li>
            <li> I am mulatto (half Af.</li>
            <li> The Revolution heats up to 450 degrees in less than 30 seconds, and straightens my hair with one pass--generally I had to go through two to three times with my Chi.  </li>
            <li> returned this item, it stopped working after less than 10 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I paid $160 with 20% off for it, the company will hear from me if it breaks in 1 year or less.</li>
            <li> I will probably use it every 2 weeks or less.</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron because my previous Sedu which I had for about 7 years stopped working.</li>
            <li> My GHD would go through thicker sections and took about half the time.  </li>
            <li> but the price of this straightening iron is too high for it to fail.</li>
            <li> Usually I would not straight my hair for a week</li>
            <li> i have long, thick hair that hits under my chest.  </li>
            <li> So I finally read on a forum that an expensive flat iron made a world of difference.</li>
            <li> I post this review in an effort to allow other consumers to choose another product and not have a similar or worse experience with this company.</li>
            <li> Overall this is what you should be doing with hair irons because wrapping them (especially tightly) around the device could cause strain and damage to the wiring.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but I may get one for myself.</li>
            <li> It also came with a little heat proof bag for the mini, a silver heat glove thing, hair product samples and some styling clips.  </li>
            <li> ( all you need is a little ofit).  </li>
            <li> The pivot end is not protected from pinching skin (one side of the handle is shorter than the other and extends past the pivot, so when you open/close the plates</li>
            <li> I feel that I can finally start growing my hair longer without trimming every week because of the horrible damage left from the other flat iron (which dried while it was wet by the way), but I never used it on wet hair -- thank goodness.    </li>
            <li> The screw was missing.  </li>
            <li> When it eventually burnt out (as all straighteners do after a few years)</li>
            <li> This product broke after just a few months.</li>
            <li> This iron is heavy.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> Time wasted for the price.  </li>
            <li> and I had to go over it a few times.</li>
            <li> I have read all the people reviews on either on Amazon or Folica.com , they were both not bad but for me it was disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it makes it impossible for you to keep it hot, maybe that&#x27;s how the company keeps me buying them.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick long hair like me get the bigger inch flatiron, but I was not impressed at all with the the GHD or the Sedu.</li>
            <li> Obviously, in the past 7 years, there&#x27;s been a few advancements in the hair iron game.</li>
            <li> The iron goes up to 450 degrees (which is the setting I usually had to use for my thick, course hair on other irons)</li>
            <li> medium length, coarse, thick, dirty blonde with highlights</li>
            <li> Once upon a time, accidentally getting a fingertip or an earlobe anywhere near one of those plates was enough to make me say very dirty words.</li>
            <li> As a disclaimer, I have wavy hair that&#x27;s not super thick and am Asian/Jewish mix with semi-thick hair.  </li>
            <li> For the people that had bad experiences, I really believe that they purchased a counterfeit item.</li>
            <li> I can only assume that something went wrong with the heating element.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bought mine through amazon tho because I&#x27;m not really sure</li>
            <li> they usually worked well for about a week</li>
            <li> got my Sedu after some exhaustive research to replace another hair iron (from a small company that no longer makes hair irons) that was blown</li>
            <li> br /&gt;- 1&amp;#34; plates &amp;#34;float&amp;#34; and can be pushed in, as though there are small springs underneath the plate.</li>
            <li> Not sure what that&#x27;s for..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed I&#x27;ll have to throw this away despite being willing to pay for a replacement part - company</li>
            <li> The iron broke in 4 months, unfortunately, though the iron was new, the warranty would not be honored (even if honored, replacement takes 4-6 weeks), i.e., this is extremely poor quality product...</li>
            <li> After checking the other 1-star reviews here, I believe that I am not alone with a broken iron.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely obsessed with this flat iron!</li>
            <li> However after about 6 months of use (I have short hair and only use it to straighten my bangs and the fringe hair at the base of my neck)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the people who have complained of the iron dying on them within a year have been doing this, but it could be a factor if they are.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Slowly over the years the power would cut off as I turned my wrist.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy/curly hair and</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> Amazon will come through and send me a new one that straightens my hair.  :(</li>
            <li> This NEW model has a swivel base so that will allow the cord to not get all coiled up.</li>
            <li> Sparks shot out of the base of the dryer, melted the wire, and it short circuited.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair.</li>
            <li> The holder that the iron sits in was broken and cracked and there was a lot of debris on the irons.</li>
            <li> so it did a poor job of straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> Then I bought this Sedu Revolution and the Babyliss Pro Ultra Thin to compare them..</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t gotten through half of it after 2 months use, which is shocking because I have long hair</li>
            <li> While this was annoying, it still worked so long as I was patient and went over each strand of hair twice with the still-hot side facing out.</li>
            <li> for other options. :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually do reviews, but feel inclined to do so based on a very scary experience with Sedu&#x27;s 6000 hair dryer.</li>
            <li> No more Sedu products ever!!!</li>
            <li> It eventually failed.  </li>
            <li> so I sadly trashed it, and searched Sedu &amp; Chi.  </li>
            <li> No electric glitch fail yet.</li>
            <li> I was getting weird curls here and there.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any snags or weird kinks either.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this was pass the time window to return the product to Amazon, so I contacted Exceon, the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> Even on its highest setting the results are mediocre.</li>
            <li> Gross, disgusting!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, two days ago, the plates stopped heating up, and the iron is now useless.  </li>
            <li> The worst flat iron I ever had.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and not so wavy</li>
            <li> dry and horrible split ends.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want a replacement, I&#x27;m afraid to use it again.  </li>
            <li> I have somewhat wavy hair, but nothing crazy.</li>
            <li> setting like the Sedu), and snags my hair like crazy.</li>
            <li> (check Sedu&#x27;s website and warning about fake irons: [...])...</li>
            <li> Ceoinmakn sold me a piece of crap and Sedu says it is an unauthorized company selling fake Sedus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Bad and Beyond and used my coupon</li>
            <li> Just hoping it lasts as others had relayed some bad experiences with longevity.</li>
            <li> Frustrated</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I am disappointed with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> DANGEROUS!!!!</li>
            <li> The CHI also damaged my hair terribly, leaving it looking</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been horrible.</li>
            <li> I have \\&quot;stubbornly\\&quot; curly hair, and it&#x27;s always just a miserable experience to straighten my hair.  </li>

            <li> This works great, however I prefer the wider sedu. It leaves my hair straight for the day, but I will have to run it back through the next morning, still being just a few passes. I would spend $30 more and get the sedu package with the serum and heat resistant case.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron I have ever had. I almost use it everyday and my hair looks so beautiful and healthy.  I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I bought this product less then 6 Months ago.  A couple weeks ago it stopped working all the time I had to move the cord to get the light to turn on and start heating up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEN today when i picked it up to use it, after i finally got it to heat up, it started sparking where the flat iron connects to the cable, gave a HUGE spark, right near my hair, which almost burned me and completely stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely dissatisfied with this product!!!  Luckily I unplugged it everyday, otherwise i fear it may have burnned my house down.  PLEASE DO NOT BUY!!!!  DANGEROUS!!!!</li>
            <li> i received old one and i got nervous if will stop working for a while because all girls said their iron stop working after  6 month also it didn t come with any guaranti,</li>
            <li> I purchased this product through Activus Sports.  The iron broke within one month of receiving it.  The iron comes with a two-year warranty so I sent it in to be replaced.  After waiting two months for the iron to be repaired I received that iron back with a denial notice stating Activus Sports is not an authorized seller of the iron.  I tried to contact Activus Sports about returning this product and did not hear anything from them.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my daughter.  She loves it and when she visited recently she let me try it.  I loved it.  Keeps your hair shining and last for days.  My hair tends to be very frizzy and dry but I used this product and it lasted.  A little pricey, but I may get one for myself.</li>
            <li> Bought two sedu irons and the first one got a 3 star, this one however gets a 5 star because it is super amazing. Leaves hair silky smooth and you only have to go over it once or twice to get a straight amazing look. Very pleased also I have a sister who is a model and she knows good hair tools and was totally impressed. Going to buy her this for her birthday!</li>
            <li> Update.  Ceoinmakn sold me a piece of crap and Sedu says it is an unauthorized company selling fake Sedus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased from sedu previously and have not had any problems. I love the sedu straightener&#x27;s and am always satisfied with my results after using their products. I recently purchased this 1\\&quot; Ionic straightener and it has stopped working after only 3 weeks of light use. I have tried returning the defected product to the seller but they refuse to answer my e-mails. I am truly dissapointed with the customer service - or lack thereof.</li>
            <li> I do love the Sedu, i have owned several, it heats up great and fast and you only have to run it through your hair once, but after a couple years the cord shorts out and it makes it impossible for you to keep it hot, maybe that&#x27;s how the company keeps me buying them.  Needs better warranty for price</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I see any difference between using this and any other brand.  It didn&#x27;t wow me.  It didn&#x27;t straighten my hair any better than any other brand. It works fine, it just wasn&#x27;t spectacular.</li>
            <li> I love my Sedu straightener. I have had it about a month now and I love it! I have extreamly thick hard to manage hair and this straightner get my hair straight with the option to do a flip at the bottom :) Much better than the Chi I used to have that seemed to pull more of my hair out than actually straighten it. I give the Sedu a double thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> I love this straightener. It is exactly what I expected, leaves my hair silky soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I owned the older version 1 1/2\\&quot; paddle shaped Sedu tourmaline flat iron for 5 years.  I paid like $150 bucks for it from folic.com.  I used  it daily and it never damaged my hair.  I have lots of super fine hair that gets destroyed with any other iron but this one.  I did not use any heat protective product in my hair, ever.  After washing my hair, it does not feel soft until I run this iron over it.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had with this older model was with its swivel style cord attatched at the unit.  It eventually failed.  Slowly over the years the power would cut off as I turned my wrist.  So I actually opened the iron up and could see the little part that wore to the point where two parts stopped touching by a millimeter causing the electricity to not be able to make a complete circuit consistently.  I could not fix this problem.  so I sadly trashed it, and searched Sedu &amp; Chi.  I bought this 1\\&quot; straight barrel Sedu version over a year ago from folicas website for  a $125 \\&quot;deal\\&quot;.  I can do open-end ringlets in my hair with this model.  It looks more attractive sitting on my counter.  It works just as amazing as my first Sedu tourmaline iron.  It&#x27;s swivel cord is a sturdier/better design so I hope it lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model came in a high quality super cool box with a free tiny mini version of it, in it&#x27;s own super nice box.  It also came with a little heat proof bag for the mini, a silver heat glove thing, hair product samples and some styling clips.  The iron came with a nice heat pad to lay the iron on.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  This thing makes my hair look great, quick!  My hair is damaged by everything BUT this product.  High quality unit.  Love, love.  No electric glitch fail yet.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a good straightener that doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and is quick and really gets my hair pin straight.  As a disclaimer, I have wavy hair that&#x27;s not super thick and am Asian/Jewish mix with semi-thick hair.  I have been getting by with cheap straighteners from CVS/Target/etc for years and they would get my hair to be &#x27;straight&#x27; but not pin straight and they always take forever to get any effect and I give up after doing the front pieces of my hair that misbehave.    I have also tried the paris hilton curling straightener brush thing which was pointless and loud if kind of fun.    The sedu reviews were so good, even compared to the chi, that I just had to give this a try.  I am always so impressed with how the salon gets my hair perfectly pin straight and I thought for a long time it was some product they were putting in my hair, but using the Sedu just proved to me that it is the quality of the straighteners they use in salons.    I think this is totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> see the title of this review?  enough said.  i have used a chi, a ghD, a sedu original - nothing compares to the sedu revolution.  i have long, thick hair that hits under my chest.  it normally takes me an hour of flat ironing and blow drying to make my hair straight.  with this flat iron?  i kid you not, under 15 minutes.  no blow dry.  i couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> After many years of using a Chi, I am  very pleased with the performance of the Sedu flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;. I have thick course hair and while the Chi straightened fine it would always catch&lt;br /&gt;strands of hair.  The sedu  flows smoothly thru hair without pulling. Heats up fast and cools&lt;br /&gt;off quickly.</li>
            <li> best straightener I have ever had!! i have really curly hair and this iron is amazing. will buy it over and over again. worth the cost!!</li>
            <li> The Sedu seems to be OK I only had trouble with the seller Beauty and fragance because  I had the possibility next to my orders of being refunded if I have got a better price which I did and it wa snot honoured by seller , other than that, is an OK product. I still did not used it only tried it for some minutes to  see if it worked and this was taken by seller as used item. Oh well. The product is OK  but be carefu lwho you buy it form. This seller on the other hand did not know much about the product either. So  that is all the product seems to be OK.</li>
            <li> As a grad student surviving on a pitiful stipend, flat irons that cost $100+ are a pretty big investment for me, but since I live in the humid south and have really thick, uncooperative hair, I&#x27;ve always been willing to (painfully) hand over the cash. I bought the Sedu Revolution with some leftover birthday money I had last year (in May 2011), and now (mid June 2012) it is totally burned out. I&#x27;ve been noticing for months that it was not getting as hot as it once did. I&#x27;m sure all you ladies are familiar with accidentally touching your hair too soon after the iron&#x27;s been on it and burning yourself just from that. I stopped having to worry about hair-burns, I believe, sometime around Christmas-- it just wasn&#x27;t getting hot enough to do that anymore. Then about a month ago, one of the plates just stopped heating altogether. While this was annoying, it still worked so long as I was patient and went over each strand of hair twice with the still-hot side facing out. Now, as of yesterday morning, the whole thing is officially kaput. With the heat setting turned all the way up to 450, I can close the iron and wrap my bare hand around the straightening plates-- it&#x27;s barely warm. Once upon a time, accidentally getting a fingertip or an earlobe anywhere near one of those plates was enough to make me say very dirty words. Now all it&#x27;s good for is making snappy noises in my cat&#x27;s face to annoy her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to the Chi. The one I had before this lasted for nearly 6 years. The Sedu Revolution barely made it 13 months. Boo.</li>
            <li> I had already bought a flat iron from Sally&#x27;s about 7 months or so ago and it cost 29.99$ I believe. At the time it was my first flat iron and I read the reviews which were about 8 reviews and they said it was great.     I&#x27;m African American and do my best to keep my hair really healthy. So to my knowledge about a few months of heat usage from my flat iron which was once a week. My hair felt inredible dry, split and damaged to the point that I had about 100 or so tiny tiny hairs all over the sink, floor, my clothes, my neck--EVERYWHERE, every time I combed my hair.     I bought so many hair products which easily cost around 500$ over a course of two months (no lie) . So I finally read on a forum that an expensive flat iron made a world of difference. So I bit the bullet and bought this Sedu iron (actually from Folica) because they had a sale on it. I bought that along with the porisity control shampoo and conditioner--OMG!!! The sedu flat iron glides over my hair, doesn&#x27;t snag (which my other did a lot of) and I can tell my hair likes it so much better than the other flat iron. It&#x27;s simply amazing, and with the porisity products there were very little short hair breakage in the bathroom. Not only that but I am able to wear my hair down because it&#x27;s incredably soft, flowing, silky, shiny, smooth, and I can run my fingers in my hair without it getting caught on all of the split ends that never seem to get straightened--I never wear my hair down beause it never lays flat. I can&#x27;t rave enough about this product.     I feel that I can finally start growing my hair longer without trimming every week because of the horrible damage left from the other flat iron (which dried while it was wet by the way), but I never used it on wet hair -- thank goodness.    So my recommmendation is to bit the bullet and buy the sedu flat iron your hair will love it. And if you&#x27;re African American or have really dry hair that never seems to get moisture I recommend the porisity control too.Good Luck!! :)</li>
            <li> got this iron from be_like_celebrity. the price is cheaper, but it is definitely the original sedu iron! there was a mix up with my order and this seller was more than accommodating and very helpful. FIVE STARS.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and this straightener works great!  It does get hot, but that&#x27;s much needed since my hair is so thick.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out or damage my hair, it heats up and cools down quickly, and it works fast to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far and I must say, I love it. First, I bought it at a fraction of the price with a coupon. I couldn&#x27;t pass up this deal after reading all the great reviews. I have medium length hair (about 2 inches below my collar bone) and my hair is usually pretty straight, with a weird flip here and there. I am of Asian descent, and my hair isn&#x27;t all that too hard to control. It curls when I need it to curl, and straightens when I straighten it. I&#x27;ve been curling (more like beachy waves) my hair a lot lately, and was using a 1 1/4 inch flat iron previously. Due to the cut of my hair (layers throughout) I was getting weird curls here and there. And there were times when I would curl it, and it just felt like I was frying my hair with the previous flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed when using the Sedu was that I didn&#x27;t have to clamp down to keep the hair in the iron. It stayed put. I didn&#x27;t get any snags or weird kinks either. I also noticed that I didn&#x27;t have to keep going over it, or have to readjust the curl that I made. The iron felt lightweight in my hand and smoothly went over my hair. Last night when I got it, I decided to go over a few pieces of curled hair (not wavy) to see how it would do. It took the curl right out. The section that I decided to flat iron was perfectly straight. I had it set to 340, which was fine, but then I actually ended up lowering it just a little more and it still worked perfectly for my hair. I would highly recommend this flat iron. It&#x27;s perfect sized and it does the job well. If you can find it for a sale price, I would definitely get it. It&#x27;s perfect for straightening or curling and making beachy waves. I could not be happier!! :)</li>
            <li> Love this straightener. Use to have a chi till it quit working on me and the Sedu is for sure way better!</li>
            <li> I was leery of the prices but in the end it was worth it. I used the iron this morning just to see if I would really get the results that I had read in several blogs/web store fronts/consumer reviews. I am impressed - the thing I did differently in selecting this iron (as opposed to priuor purchases) was making sure I purchased one compatible with my hair type. Great product and I highly recommend it for natural / coarse hair.</li>
            <li> this is an amazing product. I can definitely tell the difference between my croc flat iron and sedu.</li>
            <li> Having burnt out my old Chi flat iron I switched to this Sedu.  I have had it a few months and absolutely love it.  The adjustable heat settings are convenient and it heats up fairly fast.  My hair is long, thick, and slightly wavy and this flat iron straightens it like a champ.  I have also noticed that it leaves my hair shinier than my old Chi ever did.  It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron! My less expensive flat iron straightened by hair but never gave it any real sheen. This iron makes my hair super shiny and soft. It&#x27;s also the perfect size to straighten my edges and roots for a polished look. I will never use anything else! For the people that had bad experiences, I really believe that they purchased a counterfeit item. This iron rocks!</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is really wonderful - right up until the moment that it stops working! And it WILL stop working...probably just after the warranty expires! My 3rd Sedu straightener stopped working today (yeah, I&#x27;m a slow learner), and I&#x27;ve decided that it will be my last one. I had this one for a couple of years, but I only used it a handful of times each month. It shows very little signs of use on the outside. There an electrical defect with these straighteners, and one day they just stop working. I&#x27;m tired of spending so much money on a straightener that obviously isn&#x27;t built to last. If you still decide to buy it, you were warned!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t get to the roots of the hair really good like the CHI did but my hair is DEFINITELY healthier than it was with the CHI! I have ethnic hair and this is good secondary type of flat iron. Still searching for a good first \\&quot;go-to flat iron\\&quot; though.</li>
            <li> So for the past three years, I&#x27;ve had the flat ceramic iron by Sedu. I have EXTREMELY frizzy, poofy hair that has been damaged by bleaching so its&#x27; VERY DRY. However, my old sedu iron left my hair gorgeously shiny and smooth, no frizz at all. ALSO it stood up to the blazing hot summers and my ridiculous sweating! However, the only complaint I had with it was that because the edges of the plates were flat, I could not curl my hair with it. HOWEVER, this \\&quot;iconic styling iron\\&quot; SOLVES THAT PROBLEM! The plates on this iron are curved on the sides, so you can create a flip at the end of your hair, or even use this as a curling iron (plenty of videos online if you google how to curl you hair with a flat iron). This leaves my hair just as shiny and smooth as my old Sedu did. By the way, Sedu is amazing quality. Although I just got this iron three weeks ago, I know that my old Sedu lasted three years and is STILL WORKING, so I hope this will last just as long. This is THE PERFECT iron! It has multiple heat settings that go up over 400 degrees, and there&#x27;s a blue/orange light that tells you when the iron&#x27;s heated up. GET THIS IRON! I bought it off of Folica, but figured I&#x27;d write a review here because people need to know about this iron and how amazing it is! Your hair will be soft, shiny, and frizz free for DAYS (until you wash it of course)!</li>
            <li> Love it! I have wavy frizzy hair and it  straightens it and it stays straight for a couple of days.  So gladi bought it!</li>
            <li> The on and off switch plate broke, only after a few uses.  The screw was missing.  Iron will not even turn on.  I have since returned the product.</li>
            <li> I have owned the Pink Sedu Revolution for over five years and have never been faced with a defect or problem.  I have very unresponsive, thick, thick, thick caucasian hair, and with the correct heat setting I am able to achieve the look I want.  The iron smooths my hair quite well, although it took some time for me to understand the proper techniques that go along with the use of ANY flatiron: pull at a moderate speed in smaller sections so that the plates can make contact with the hair all the way down without snags.  I learned that it was very important to comb first, but once I started using the iron correctly I consistently got stellar results.  When I bought the iron, I got a travel-sized flatiron as well, which I don&#x27;t use much except on my bangs and small details.  Sedu is top-notch and much better than the Chi(s) I once swore by.  Ditch your Chi, Paul Mitchell, or whatever else and switch to Sedu.  Your hair will thank you.</li>
            <li> this is an update to my past review of this product where I rave about how amazing it is..well..its NOT.  about 8 months of use, one of the plates stopped working.  I keep my hair products, tools, make up etc neatly on my vanity so its not like I banged this iron around.  And reading all these other reviews, it looks like Sedu is notorious for this issue.  In any case, I had the warranty and sent for a new iron after which I was sent a refurbished one; the iron looked slightly used and had some minor scratches.  After 4 months of use one of the plates stopped working again.  Frustrated I went and bought myself another brand, T3 Single Pass which lasted me 8 years prior  to the Sedu.  No more Sedu products ever!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this iron for quite sometime now and I have to say that I am disappointed with the purchase. I initially bought it after reading good reviews for it online.  However, it leaves my hair feeling coarse, dry and looking fried.  If I adjust to a lower temperature, it doesn&#x27;t get the curls out.  I thought that I had damaged my hair from years of straightening and the iron was not to blame, but I tried a friend&#x27;s CHI and it left my hair shiny and smooth leading me to confirm that it&#x27;s the straightener I&#x27;ve been using and not my hair!</li>
            <li> I would give this product 5 stars BUT it stopped working a year after I purchased it. The plates just stopped heating up. I could&#x27;ve sent it back but you need to have the receipt for proof of purchase. Who honestly keeps their receipt?! Definitely not me! So basically I&#x27;m out of luck. I loved this flat iron but they need to work on the wiring.</li>
            <li> The Sedu flat iron IS THE BEST of all flat irons...new to the flat iron arena, but the \\&quot;chi\\&quot; was nothing like this one. This is an   AWESOME tool!</li>
            <li> I love this hair iron just not enough to have paid full price for them (got it on groupon). There is so much you can do with them, curls, straighten your hair, flipping the ends etc...it is a good investment, heats up fast, has diff temperatures, slides easily... I only wish they were a bit longer or thicker, other than that they are great.</li>
            <li> I had the larger sedu straightener prior to this one which was great when i had longer hair but then i cut it off to right above my shoulders and this iron does a lot better with that. It heats up quickly and does not pull at my hair. I use it with Chi heat protection spray and that keeps my hair smooth and glossy. My last iron ended up breaking because the wiring in the cord got messed up. It would only stay on if i had it in the same position..which didn&#x27;t really work. I made sure to stick with the same brand when purchasing a new one though. I recommend this to people with short to medium hair and go for the larger one if you have longer hair.</li>
            <li> The Sedu is perfect for those that have curly course hair, leaves hair straight and does not leave the hair smelling burned. It is easy to use, and heats up really fast.</li>
            <li> I ordered this flat iron after reading the reviews. It works just as everyone say&#x27;s. I am African American and have very thick/coarse hair. I was skeptical but after my first pass of a 1 inch section of my hair I was sold! Works like a charm and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I wish I would have had this flat iron years ago!</li>
            <li> I love this iron!! I was deciding between this one and the CHI because those are the two I hear the most about.  I had my last one (Infra) for about 8 years and loved it...this one I think may be even better.  It keeps my hair straight for DAYS without trying very hard.  I cna&#x27;t say enough good things about this iron except that you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> If I could give more stars I would. The best flat iron I have ever come across on. The best one out there. Well worth the money</li>
            <li> I have course, curly red hair.  this is the first flat iron i have found that glides smoothly without pinching.  It heats quickly.  It only takes on e to two passes, even on my kinkiest spots. Love love love!!!!  This is my second I have purchased.  the first lasted about 2 years with daily use.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve EVER own! Definitely not a waste of money. I will say I was a bit hesitant at first; but, this flat iron works wonders for my kinky-curly hair type. When I straighten my hair I use the Barber Italy 3800 Ionic Blow Dryer and I also put Chi Thermal Polishing Spray in my hair as well and then I use the Sedu flat iron...using these products together give my hair the &amp;#34;salon/professional&amp;#34; look I&#x27;ve wanted! It&#x27;s worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I love this straightener if simply glided through my 4A afro hair leaving me with a sleep straightened do. Also does a great job curling the hair Love this flat iron ditching my chi!</li>
            <li> After trying several different flat irons (including 2 Crocs that both quit working, each after less than 3 months), I decided to try this flat iron at a friend&#x27;s recommendation.  I love it, love it, love it!  It works beautifully, no burning my hair like some flat irons have done in the past, and no issues with the flat iron actually working.</li>
            <li> This styling iron is  one of the best less breakage then other ones I have used before price is good for the product.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used.  My hairstylist recommended it and I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Chi or Babyliss but read reviews that this was the new professionals pick... and it&#x27;s awesome. It&#x27;s the most advanced for keeping moisture in your hair and I can really tell the difference. My only complaint... the blades are too short. It would have been nicer if they were about an inch longer so you could do larger pieces of hair.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever bought (until it broke 4 months later and they wouldn&#x27;t honor the warranty, keep reading) . I have extremely think and curly hair. I have always used a CHI and have owned five of them over the last 8 years due to them shorting out. The CHI also damaged my hair terribly, leaving it looking dry and horrible split ends. My new Sedu is like a dream, my hair doesn&#x27;t tug and pull and break as I&#x27;m using it. It locks out the humidity even in hot humid climates, leaving my hair looking silky and smooth. I&#x27;ve had more complements on my hair in the last month than ever before. I would recommend the Sedu Revolution to anyone looking for a good flat iron that will not damage their hair and leave them looking flawless. HOWEVER, I BOUGHT MY FLAT IRON THE END OF FEBRUARY. I WAS ABLE TO USE IT UNTIL JUNE WHICH WAS 4 1/2 MONTHS, IT THEN STOPPED HEATING COMPLETELY. IT WAS SUPPOSIDLY COVERED UNDER WARRANTY FOR TWO YEARS, HOWEVER WHEN I RETURNED IT TO SEDU THEY WOULD NOT HONOR MY WARRANTY BECAUSE I BOUGHT IT ON AMAZON. THEY DO NOT STAND BEGIND THEIR PRODUCT AND ARE MORE CONCERNED WITH POLICIES RATHER THAN A GOOD CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. For that, I will never purchase another SEDU product again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product slightly used. It was the best decision I could have made regarding a flat iron. It was delivered in sufficient time, and I love this straightner. I had Hot Tools before this and a Chi before that. This one leaves my hair shiny and straight all day long. I would definitely recommend this over any other flat iron out there.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this straightener two years prior from another seller. When it eventually burnt out (as all straighteners do after a few years) I purchased what I thought was a replacement from Amazon. THIS WAS NOT THE SAME ITEM as what I had purchased before. It was lightener than my old one and felt cheap - still hopeful, I tried using it and immediately knew something was up. The plates were not nearly as hot as my old one, my hair didn&#x27;t straighten and frizzed immediately after use (and I was still in my air conditioned apartment). Do not be fooled by this deal - buy from somewhere else - I will be returning this item today.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing... nothing compared to my old straightener. My old one didn&#x27;t get hot enough so it left my hair looking puffy and would constantly snag some hairs when straightening. This Sedu exceeded my expectations- it straightens my hair on the first stroke, not having to constantly go over the same piece of hair 5 times and does not snag any hairs at all. It can also create very nice curls (as long as you know how to do it lol!) and it just overall wonderful. The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; option- you have to manually shut it off. I learned my lesson the hard way when I left it on the highest setting for 12 hours and created a yellow burn mark on my marble countertop... Not anyone&#x27;s fault but my own, so i&#x27;d suggest buying something to place your straightener on, kind of like a placemat, but made of metal or some other non-flammable material.</li>
            <li> very good flat iron, love the black plates, hair runs through it very smoothly.....can get a little hot at the tips when trying to hold plates together......on/off switch very touchy......can be turned off suddenly w/just a slight bump of the switch by accident and the next thing you know, your flat iron is off and cooled down......heats up quickly, well-made product.  other than the minor inconveniances stated above, it is well worth the money.  i had an iso before this and paid alot more for it and this one way out-performs the iso and costs less.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer:  I have a lot of fine, relatively straight hair.  If you have a different hair texture, your experience may differ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first \\&quot;salon quality\\&quot; hair straightener.  Previously, I&#x27;d always bought high-end drugstore / Target models.  Some of them get really hot and are able to make my tresses soft and smooth, but ALL of them managed to catch or snag my hair in the process.  Ouch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sedu Revolution Tourmaline Ionic Styling Iron has been a whole different animal.  I have yet to snag my hair with it.  Also the \\&quot;unique curved edges\\&quot; really have allowed me to experiment with using it to curl my hair.  So far, so good.  And if I thought my old straighteners got hot and made my hair shiny and smooth, they&#x27;ve got nothing on this styling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY thing that makes me nervous is that it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic shutoff.  It has a physical switch to turn on and off, so I do worry about remembering to turn it off or unplug it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this product!</li>
            <li> Works great and my hair stays straight all day. I&#x27;m normally prone to frizzy hair, but this helps keep it flat and smooth</li>
            <li> This product broke after just a few months. Stopped getting hot enough. Then stopped heating all together. Sedu offers a 2 year warranty but not on counterfeit products. Please see sedu website for more information on authorized dealers</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product twice and have been very happy with it. It heats up quickly and lets you know when its ready with a change of lights. I like that it is light weight and has a swivel cord that does not tangle easily. The two prong plug is convenient for when I travel. The plates leave my fine hair very smooth and silky. I don&#x27;t need to set the temperature to the highest degrees to get a perfect strand of straight hair with one or two passes. This is great because I have very processed hair that has been breaking mid shaft lately. It really doesn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy or puffy or rough. It actually makes it look soft and shiny. It works amazing. I have never had any issues with it. Both irons have lasted years now, even though I wrap up the cord around it and travel with it every where. It has been the best iron worth its price that I have ever purchased And I would purchase another in the future.</li>
            <li> Very good quality! I was very excited to receive this, and it was worth every penny. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Chi for years, but purchased the Sedu based a recommendation from a friend.  I love it!  I have thick, wavy/curly hair and this iron straightens my hair easily.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually do reviews, but feel inclined to do so based on a very scary experience with Sedu&#x27;s 6000 hair dryer. I had really liked using the dryer - fast results! But one day, after about 14 months of normal usage, IT CAUGHT ON FIRE IN MY HAND! Sparks shot out of the base of the dryer, melted the wire, and it short circuited. Needless to say, I was pretty shaken up and thankful that my hair didn&#x27;t catch on fire (it did burn my hand a bit). Furthermore, even though I had a 2-yr warranty, the company refused to issue me a refund. It&#x27;s been horrible. I post this review in an effort to allow other consumers to choose another product and not have a similar or worse experience with this company.</li>
            <li> I was recommended to try this Iron and I am glad I did. I love it better than my old Chi and the Paul Mitchel Iron.  I have long hair and it doesn&#x27;t take long to straighten it.  I can also curl my hair with no problem.  Although this iron is  pricier than both my old ones, it is def. worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought my iron thru Ulta for they have an amazing return policy. I initially had the Chi G2 and I only used it three times over a yr period cause I only straighten my natural curly 4c hair once every 6 months. So on my third attempt, the Chi G2 settings were fluctuating, I instantly returned the defective product for this Sedu iron and OMG, this Sedu iron made my hair look super shiny like I just got a perm, lol. Anyway I&#x27;m posting this as a happy customer, I will edit this post after having it for one year and see how it performs mechanically, hopefully my star ratings won&#x27;t decrease.</li>
            <li> Woks great.&lt;br /&gt;Had it for years and love it!</li>
            <li> I liked it while it lasted. I had mine for about two years before one plate died. I&#x27;ll probably take it apart and try to fix it but the price of this straightening iron is too high for it to fail. I will not be purchasing another one.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about spending so much money on a flat iron. But after having hair nightmares , I knew I had to spend it on some really good quality product and this Sedu flat iron was exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;The product itslef is really good, heats up in short amount of time and leaves my hair silky smooth. Also, sont get discouraged by its small plate size, I have long thick south asian hair and this flat iron works great on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the damage to hair , I think you need to invest in good thermal protection products irrespective of whatever flat iron you purchase. Same holds good for this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About shipping , I got this product within 1-2 weeks , so was pretty satisfied there as well.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews and considering price i expected higher quality.  Light flickers and does not curl or straighten hair in a timely manner. No difference than cheap products</li>
            <li> I owned a Sedu iron for five years before it finally stopped working.  I am mixed race: African-American, Native American and White, and I have very curly hair with frizz in some places.  My old Sedu, made my hair bone straight, soft and shiny.  So I bought this product.  It never really worked like the old one.  I could feel a tug on my hair as I pulled it through, and I had to pull it through more times than I did with the old one, and the results weren&#x27;t as good--the hair was always a bit frizzy.  I lived with this for about five weeks and followed up with a curling iron to get a sleek look.  One day I used the flat iron as I always had with the same hair products that I always use, in my house with the same electricity, and it burned my hair off--yes--I lost a chunk of hair.  I&#x27;m so fortunate that I always start in the back so that I can hide the damage.  I can only assume that something went wrong with the heating element.  Unfortunately, this was pass the time window to return the product to Amazon, so I contacted Exceon, the manufacturer.  While they responded to my request right away, all they would do is replace the product and I would be charged for shipping both ways.  I don&#x27;t want a replacement, I&#x27;m afraid to use it again.  But even if I did want a replacement, I&#x27;ve already paid for shipping, so now I have to pay for shipping both ways?  It&#x27;s just not worth it.  I&#x27;m going to throw it away and buy another brand.</li>
            <li> I should have gotten more than1&amp;#34;, i got ir rather quickly, feels like a sturdy flat iron, that will last.</li>
            <li> it glides over my hair!  it has great settings, it heats in seconds and it works so well!  I love it</li>
            <li> This is from an Afro-American female with a very coarse long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Has a swivel cord&lt;br /&gt;2. It gets to be hot and ready very fast&lt;br /&gt;3.  It feels sturdy&lt;br /&gt;4.  Has choice of different temperatures&lt;br /&gt;5.  It is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve tried so far.  I&#x27;ve tried Chi, Global Keratin, Sedu Ionic Ceramic Pro, and this Sedu Revolution Tourmaline is by far the best flat iron in my opinion.  It gets my hair straighten the best, although it still does NOT get my hair bone straight or even close to bone straight.  My hair still looks thick (too thick) straight rather than lustful close to bone straight or bone straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.  It does not get my hair straight like Asian or Indian straight hair&lt;br /&gt;2.  My hair gets thicker and thicker after I flattened my hair.  On top of that, the straightened hair does not last, it keeps getting curlier and curlier.&lt;br /&gt;3  The iron snacked my hair couple of times unlike Sedu Ionic Ceramic flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;4. This iron is heavy.  My wrist got tire of holding it due to its weight.  Sedu Ionic Ceramic flat felt lot lighter.&lt;br /&gt;5.  My arm got pinched by the swivel cord on the tale side of the iron.&lt;br /&gt;6.  It arrived surprisingly fast after I put in the order.&lt;br /&gt;6.  Over priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish this company and others would make a flat iron for my type of hair. And once the hair has been straightened it needs to stay that way.</li>
            <li> Update.... I originally wrote this review in September 2011, I still have the Sedu now (today is February 2 2016) and it still works great as they day I got it. I&#x27;m shocked how this flat iron is less damaging to my hair as compared to other hot tools I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ve owned this Sedu  for almost 5 years. Sedu is beyond the best of the best and way worth the price  ..bellow is my original review...   This is one of the very best hair Irons I&#x27;ve ever used, well worth the money. I use to use a Conair Conair 2&amp;#34; Wet/Dry Tourmaline Iron for about 3 years to turn my frizzy hair to somewhat straight and I was pleased with the results, but it was a hassle doing my hair at times. Normally I would spray my hair with heat protected product before using a flat iron, I would be happy with the results until the day got hot and humid which turn my hair back to frizz. Very frustrating.  When my Conair iron broke after I accidently dropped it. I was searching for a new iron, I didn&#x27;t want to be cheap and buy a budget one at the local store, even though some of them may give you good results. I was thinking in getting the new InStyler but decided after seeing it at a local beauty supply store, I realized that it was not the best fit for me, especially how I normally style my hair (very into the 40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s) the InStyler I feel was very limited to what type of styles you wanted.  After reading multiple reviews online I check out the high end irons at a local beauty supply store and I stopped and checked the Sedu 1&amp;#34; iron. I read the description and cringe at the price... $150+ iron had me thinking very hard whether or not to spend that much money on a hair iron.  I eventually decided to buy it along with the Sedu Argan Oil Anti-Frizz Polishing Treatment and all I can say is well worth the money.  The Pros.  1. Styling time cut in half- My hair styling time has been cut in half, I have really long thick hair (mid back) and I also have a lot of hair where I would normally pay high price at the Salon because it takes stylist longer than usual to do my hair because there&#x27;s so much of it.  2. Using it as a curling Iron-I can add soft curls, wave&#x27;s, flips or full on curls with this iron. I have very stubborn hair and at times it would not hold a curl because my hair would not hold it. I&#x27;m surprised how well my hair holds a curl after using this Iron.  3. I have less split ends and does not have the dry feeling- I&#x27;ve noticed after using this iron for two months that I have less split ends and that my hair does not feel dry. With my Conair, I would see how much it was damaging my hair even with the heat protected product; my hair would contain so many split ends and become very dry. Usually I would not straight my hair for a week so I can give my hair a break before using the iron again. With the Sedu iron I feel that I don&#x27;t have to do that.  4. Healthier hair and Shine- My hair looks and feels healthier and it&#x27;s shiny. I hope the Sedu iron continues giving my hair the shine and the healthier look for as long as I have it.  5. Goodbye to Frizz-  Sedu iron is amazing and along with the Argan oil it makes may hair look and feel amazing. I never used the Argan oil, but using the Argan oil before straitening it with the Sedu Iron I noticed that my hair does not get frizzy in humid or hot weather. I spent the whole day at Disneyland in 80 degree weather and my hair was shinny and still had smooth look.  6. Fast Heat up time- Instead of waiting 5 minutes or so for an iron to heat up fast I notice that with the Sedu Iron with the Temperature set to the highest takes a min (may vary) for it heat up.  I do not have any complaints for the Sedu iron. It&#x27;s by far the best iron I ever used. I spend less money on hair products because all I use is the Sedu iron and the Sedu Argan Oil. I bought the 1 ounce bottle of the Argan Oil and I haven&#x27;t gotten through half of it after 2 months use, which is shocking because I have long hair ( all you need is a little ofit).  I don&#x27;t have to iron my hair often; the Sedu product really keeps its word. The money is well worth it, if I had an accident and it I manage to break this iron, I wouldn&#x27;t think twice and buy this iron again.</li>
            <li> This is for my black sistahs with natural hair who are skeptical about the purchase of this flat iron. I used my new sedu flat iron on my hair for the first time today and i am genuinely impressed. My hair is natural and its been gettin harder and harder to find a good straightener to straighten my coarse hair, but this iron worked miracles. My hair is so straight and shiny. Moreover, it stayed straight all the way until i completed my whole head. Usually with other straighteners my hair would begin reverting back before i was even done. Ive used the chi, cortex, ionika, and other flat irons and the sedu has them all beat!! It was definitly worth the money. Plus my straightening time was cut in half and i didnt have to go over each strand 5 times like with other irons. Just once or twice was enough. I used it in conjunction with the sedu argan oil anti-frizz serum. Im sure the serum helped with the ultra sleek results. For naturals this combination works perfectly!!</li>
            <li> This hair iron is awesome! I didn&#x27;t bought mine through amazon tho because I&#x27;m not really sure if they&#x27;re authentic, I got mine from Bed Bad and Beyond and used my coupon, first impression is wow, I have very wavy hair, and after using this hair iron it&#x27;s really flat and shiny like I went to get my hair done at salon.  worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Worked well when I received it. After 6 months only one plate was hot. The other stayed cool.</li>
            <li> When my sister requested a styling iron as a holiday gift, I searched many different products. The Sedu had very high ratings. It is a professional-quality styling tool and more expensive than some other products; however, the price is worth it for the quality. The iron does not &amp;#34;fry&amp;#34; hair and is well designed. My sister loves it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron. It&#x27;s by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Allow me to preface this review by providing a brief description of my hair type and previous flat iron experience.  I am mulatto (half Af. American, half caucasion), and my hair is not \\&quot;nappy\\&quot; or \\&quot;wiry\\&quot;; however, I do have very tight ringlets. As an example, when my hair is straight, it falls exactly half-way down my back; whereas, when it is curly, it sits just below my shoulders.  Having said this, I have been straightening my hair with flat irons for the past twelve or more years.  Until now, I have been loyal to the Chi brand.  After my last flat iron gave out (we had three good years), I began to wonder if there was a better alternative.  Chi does a wonderful job, but my last iron just didn&#x27;t get as hot as I would&#x27;ve preferred.  Additionally, my hair would regularly get caught around the outsides of the plates (neither were issues that I had with earlier model Chi straighteners).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good flat irons are expensive, so I spent a month doing my research, and I finally settled on the Sedu Revolution.  I could not be happier with my decision.  The Revolution heats up to 450 degrees in less than 30 seconds, and straightens my hair with one pass--generally I had to go through two to three times with my Chi.  For those of you who are expecting the same results, please note that I always blow dry my hair straight first (this helps with volume), then I straighten using a fine tooth comb in front of the iron.  You may also have noticed that other reviewers boast that their hair stays straight under very humid conditions.  I was skeptical of this claim, but it is actually true.  After doing a 40 minute Insanity workout--during which, sweat steadily runs down my face--my hair stayed completely straight, save for the 1/2\\&quot; inch area closest to my scalp.  Under normal daily conditions; however, my hair does not even become slightly frizzy.  I cannot speak to the longevity of this product, because I have owned it less than one month, but in terms of performance, I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> In compare to my old Remington flat iron , this is not good at all. I have read all the people reviews on either on Amazon or Folica.com , they were both not bad but for me it was disappointed. I returned it.</li>
            <li> This iron made my hair too soft believe it or not. I have thin hair. I tried different products on my wet hair, dried it and then used the iron. My hair lost some of the body. It was very soft, shiney and all those wonderful things for someone with thick hair. However, I tried a cooler setting and it worked better.&lt;br /&gt;Then, I tried to return it for a different iron. Well here is where the big problem began. Amazon DOES NOT RETURN THIS item if the box has been opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyers BEWARE of the return policy at Amazon!!! This is a beauty supply item. Read the return policy.</li>
            <li> Its a wonderful product. I bought it because it was used in the hairstyling class I took in NY and I love the results. My teacher also  showed us also how to curly the hair with this product.</li>
            <li> I am African American with natural 4b, 4c Hair ( i think) This is the best flat iron i&#x27;ve ever used. It straightens my hair with just one swipe. My hair does not feel dry and fried when I&#x27;m done like other flat irons because of the tourmaline. My hair feels silky and looks shinny. I love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several Sedu flat irons in the past. I use it everyday and I have wavy, thick, coarse hair. They usually last about 2-3 years. When my current Sedu started losing it&#x27;s heating element, I looked on line and saw this &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; version of the Sedu. It seem to have good reviews so I purchased it. Initally I was in love. The 450 degree setting was amazing. I no longer needed a curling iron for lift becuase this flat iron did everything. Perfect, smooth, shiny hair. It was great!! But then.....about 3 weeks after I purchased it I started notcicing that it didn&#x27;t seem to be getting as hot as it had in the beginning. It was taking forever to straighten my hair and it would frizz after about an hour. Just to be sure -I straightened one side with the sedu revolution and one side with my 1 1/2 inch Sedu backup that is over 6 years old. The older version was much straighter. Probably a defect but at over 100 dollars I&#x27;m going back to the original.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Iron heats up quickly, has temperature adjustments and does not damage my hair.  Love it.  Highly recommend it.  Just hoping it lasts as others had relayed some bad experiences with longevity.</li>
            <li> This straightener is really smooth and leaves hair feeling soft.  Was also very easy to curl with this styling iron.  Sedu is an amazing product.  I will never buy cheap straighteners again.  You want amazing hair get this product!!!</li>
            <li> I love it, it heats up fast, it&#x27;s smooth and I don&#x27;t feel that I am damaging my hair no matter how high I adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li> After extensive research on flat irons I decided to order it. It&#x27;s an okay flat iron but I&#x27;ve had others that made my hair look shiner and sleek.</li>
            <li> The flat iron I received looked used. The holder that the iron sits in was broken and cracked and there was a lot of debris on the irons. When closed, the two irons did not meet and lay flat so it did a poor job of straightening my hair. The top and bottom irons also looked like they were separating. I kept reading great reviews about this flat iron, so maybe it was the seller. Either way, I am returning it. It didn&#x27;t work any better than my Chi... which is not great.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price, Superr smooth, doesnt pull, im a professional and my clients love it too!! I would highly recommend this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I had this product for 1 month and it fried out! I took care of it just as I should and it still went out. I was using it like normal and then as I was gliding through my hair it literally burned my hair off. I took it off my hair and there was a chunk of my burned hair on one of the plates. I did not have the temp too high-320 degrees and this still happened. When spending over $100 on a product, I expect a lot more. Especially after only 1 month. This will be going back and I will purchase another brand. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s good while it works.  The one of the plates stopped working, and the other wouldn&#x27;t heat all the way through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine at Neimans.  Sedu&#x27;s warranty online says they only replace if purchased through an &#x27;authorized&#x27; dealer.  I had the receipt and box.  Received a replacement within 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was curious if others had this same problem.  I felt it was worth noting the &#x27;authorized&#x27; seller part.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat wavy hair, but nothing crazy. After years of owning a CHI flat iron, I received this one for Christmas. Excited about trying something new, I wanted to give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the very beginning, I realized it took a long time to heat up. And once it did, it cooled off after just a few seconds of use and had to heat back up again. Even on its highest setting the results are mediocre. I would never purchase another Sedu product. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I had my first Sedu straightener for 10 years before the cord stopped working. This one is even nicer quality, heats up in seconds, and I know it will last years! Best out there for sure!</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron. I am an AA female with fine, frizz-pone texlaxed hair, and not good at styling and straightening my hair. I had been trying for years to figure out a way to be able to do my hair at home and achieve close to a salon look but could never get my hair straight with the usual beauty supply store brands. I can quickly and easily achieve straight, silky results that last and make the frizz look like I just got a perm. Heats up super fast. It is expensive but a better quality than what you get at the lower price points. As with any flat iron, should be used sparingly, once or twice a week at most.</li>
            <li> Came to us used. Gross, disgusting! Amazon did not want to take it back at first because of health concerns with personal care products. We had to explain it was used before we even opened the package.</li>
            <li> I have \\&quot;stubbornly\\&quot; curly hair, and it&#x27;s always just a miserable experience to straighten my hair.  My last stylist who cut my hair couldn&#x27;t get all the frizz out, even after a deep conditioning treatment.  I guess she was just making her own life harder by not having the Sedu Revolution straightener and wielding a CHI turbo instead.  This straightener is *awesome*.  I was using a Titanium straightener from Sally&#x27;s before and it left the ends \\&quot;crimpy\\&quot; which you mainly wouldn&#x27;t notice until you were up close, and after several hours it would develop a &#x27;shoulder wave&#x27;, and look silly (It would fall straight until my shoulders then wave out to like a 90 degree angle and go around my shoulders, totally silly looking).  I also would be forced to straighten my roots with a blow-dryer really well before hand since it would simply not work on my roots.  I no longer have any of these problems.  It glides smoothly and never &#x27;catches&#x27; in my hair.  It&#x27;s easy to pull it right through as slowly or as quickly as you like.  You never hear a crackling sound like with cheaper straighteners.  It is so smooth!  You still have to pull locks of hair through a few times, so its not necessarily faster than other straighteners, but it just straight-up works better (no pun intended).  I was also able to get close enough to my roots to know I could pretty much let my hair air-dry for the most part and use the straightener instead of having to blow-dry the roots around a round brush to make sure its not going to have any lumpies on the back of my head.  First day after using it, I didn&#x27;t realize it was going to rain and was saddened since my hair was for sure going to frizz up.  We were even going to a beach town where it was really windy and drizzly.  After wandering around for a bit and doing some exploring, my hair was just as silky smooth and fuzz-free as it was when I finished straightening it.  Even after sleeping on it overnight I didn&#x27;t need any touch-ups the next morning.  All in all,this is a great straightener.  I did all my research and couldn&#x27;t find anything better.  The gsm&#x27;s and the chi&#x27;s look like they die all too quickly these days (1 year on average in the reviews).  The only negative reviews I found on this product were people who were actually reviewing the wrong products, lol, such as the travel version or the larger-plated regular Sedu.  I did see one who condemned the correct product, then purchased it again after trying it in a store, and the new one was awesome like it should be.  Perhaps they got a fake on the first try.  I can&#x27;t imagine going back after using this straightener.  It is the best I have ever used, and it makes me feel great to do a better job at straightening my hair than a professional.  :)  I hope everyone else has as great of an experience as I did.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron on another website because they had a special offer that made it a lower price than Amazon.  Normally Amazon&#x27;s prices can&#x27;t be beat, but sometimes doing some online searching you can score some bargains if discount codes are being offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Latina and have thick and long hair.  After using the Sedu brand of flat irons I will never go back to any other brand.  I love it so much, thAT I ended up purchasing another 1\\&quot; for my daughter and a 1.5\\&quot; for myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron will glide over your hair like silk.  It will leave you hair silky smooth and full of shine.  Tourmaline ceramic plates produces far infra-red heat to release  negative ions which reduces static and helps seal the cuticle to make your hair smoother and shiner.  I know I am doing something right when I have hairdressers asking me what kind of products and appliances I use in my hair.  Of course, even though using tourmaline ceramic plates can protect hair from high heat damage and breakage, I always use a heat protection spray before flat ironing my hair -  I prefer [[ASIN:B002NBF8SI Hot Off The Press Thermal Protection Spray By Paul Mitchell for Unisex]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a VERY long swivel cord which prevents from tangling.  It is lightweight and heat up real fast.  Very easy to clean - I just use a wet towel and wipe the plates clean and they look brand new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wondering if you should spend this much on a flat iron, remember you have 30-days money back guarantee if purchased through Amazon.  You will not regret your purchase and you will end up giving or throwing away your other flat irons.  Sedu will change the your life and your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two-year warranty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many flat irons in the past - usually the $30-$50 ones from conair or Remington... they usually worked well for about a week and then were done. I have thick, course hair that is color treated and highlighted - I needed an iron that was strong and yet gentle enough to use on my damaged hair. So I decided to shell out a little more money for this Sedu iron and I can&#x27;t believe I wasted my time with those other irons. The packaging is beautiful, its sleek, sexy, and the iron itself is heavy duty. The iron goes up to 450 degrees (which is the setting I usually had to use for my thick, course hair on other irons) but I ended up finding that 360 degrees works perfectly for me on the Sedu. The temp dial is just a turn knob, which is fine - I recommend starting on the lower settings until you see how much heat you need. The cord has a swivel rotation so you can move the iron easily without getting all tangled up. It used to take me 20 minutes to straighten my whole head of hair with the cheaper irons, I&#x27;m done and out the door in 10 minutes with the Sedu. You can curl your hair with this iron, there&#x27;s plenty of videos on Youtube to show you how to do so. Overall, this flat iron is a dream come true. It&#x27;s fast, easy to use, and professional grade - I will never go back to the cheap irons again.</li>
            <li> I love my new straightner! (: I&#x27;ve always watched how much I spend when it comes to straighteners but I realized spending more on a good quality straightener is always better. It straightens on the first try..with my other straightner(s) I would have to go through it more than once and my hair wouldn&#x27;t stay straight all day. It also makes my hair look shinier and healthier.</li>
            <li> Does not work on my hair.  If I had saved the packaging I would return it.</li>
            <li> Updated review: 7/31/13&lt;br /&gt;Still working great. Been over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated review: 3/25/13&lt;br /&gt;As promised, gave it a few more months to make sure the product isn&#x27;t faulty and doesn&#x27;t stop over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still working great and is serving me well. However, I will put in a disclaimer: I don&#x27;t use it every day. About 1-2 times a week. Also, one thing I know is that if you coil the cord around the iron, that could lead to damage in the cord; I just loosely coil my cord and place it next to the hair iron in my bathroom drawer. Overall this is what you should be doing with hair irons because wrapping them (especially tightly) around the device could cause strain and damage to the wiring. I don&#x27;t know if the people who have complained of the iron dying on them within a year have been doing this, but it could be a factor if they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review: 11/24/12&lt;br /&gt;Purchased: 7/6/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my Sedu after some exhaustive research to replace another hair iron (from a small company that no longer makes hair irons) that was blown (I loved that hair iron so much and it lasted me a couple of years until some idiot at the company office told me it should work fine in South Korea when I was moved there... needless to say, that hair iron was not meant for the voltage of that country, despite what the company told me, and thus my beloved hair iron was ruined).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months now, and I gotta say, my hair looks fantastic. I get compliments from random strangers on the street about my hair, which I think is a good indicator of the quality. However, a lot of reviewers commented on how their hair maintained its shape/form/no frizz even with sweat and humidity, but that was most certainly not my case (however, I will admit that I don&#x27;t use any oil or other products on my hair, so that may be why). However, other than moisture present in the air (which isn&#x27;t too likely as I live in Arizona), my hair stays great, and it is sleekand shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard about iron not working after some time, and I guess I will update this after the year or so mark to report on whether mine is still working or not.</li>
            <li> The plates are as smooth as glass, and never any snagging. Well worth the price. Had to buy a second one for my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> Great iron, heats up fast, smooths my hair, no complaints!  I&#x27;ve had many irons in the past and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the Sedu I received takes forever to warm up and even when I have the heat on the very highest setting, I still have to run the iron over the same spot 3 or 4 times to get the look I&#x27;m assuming a real Sedu would provide.  I&#x27;m Caucasian and have thin wavy hair - I was looking forward to removing the frizz and having a pin straight professional look for work with minimal prep time however it literally takes 20 minutes to warm up and another 20 minutes to straighten.  Time wasted for the price.  Very upsetting since Sedu will not acknowledge the purchase and replace since it was bought on amazon and without an authenticity guarantee.  Am hopeful the seller and/or Amazon will come through and send me a new one that straightens my hair.  :(</li>
            <li> Great hair straightner! My older sister has one, and went to college so I had to get one for myself! I have super curly (ringlet) hair that is a couple inches past my shoulders, and love to straighten with my new straightner! It takes me about 30-40 minutes to thoroughly straighten all of my hair. I go to school, have gym, then go to lacrosse practice, and my hair still seems to somehow be straight after my day!</li>
            <li> Hair type: medium length, coarse, thick, dirty blonde with highlights&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the BabyLiss 1 1/4 in. for 6 years and it was time for a new flatiron. My plates were old and I loved the iron, but wanted to try something different! So I bought the GHD for $185 at Sephora. It sucked. Took forever to iron hair and there was no temp setting. Then I bought the Sedu flatiron from Ultra for $160.00. It sucked too. There is not a temperature setting and it left my hair dry and brittle. The GHD and Sedu are the exact same thing to me. If you have thick long hair like me get the bigger inch flatiron, but I was not impressed at all with the the GHD or the Sedu. I was going to buy the Sultra, but it seemed too much like the others. Long story short...I bought a new BabyLiss and I LOVE it. It does not leave my hair dry, but soft. It&#x27;s quick too. I chase my flat brush with the iron and it takes 10 minutes!!! The plates are longer and wider and it only cost $135 from Ulta. Do yourself a favor...save time and money and buy a BabyLiss now! You will thank me for this review later:)</li>
            <li> I ordered this product new from amazon and what I received was a used hair iron. The box was damaged, there were scuffs all over the iron and the CD it came with was so scratched that it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> listen y&#x27;all: PAY FOR GOOD HAIR PRODUCTS.  i know it hurts! you can get something that performs a similar function for less money at target, but it just won&#x27;t do it as well. i have this iron, and i&#x27;ve owned and used lots of other irons. this one is rad.  the CHI is nice and all, but only has one heat setting, which can fry your hair. if you care about your locks and you only want the best for them, splurge.  buy yourself something nice that you will cherish for years to come.  you (probably) deserve it.</li>
            <li> Great at the beginning but it just worked for a year. I used it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;Look for other options. :(</li>
            <li> This product is reliable, fast heating, light and handy. A little bit expensive but worth it. Go get one for yourself.</li>
            <li> I have had and tried almost every flat iron out there and this is the best one! It does not pull your har and gives a smooth sleek look without continuous strokes and that to me is a big deal when in a hurry or just simply not wanting heat damage. I use Bedheads after party smoothing lotion (use sparingly) and it gives a great shine. You can adjust the heat setting and the flashing light indicator lets you know when it&#x27;s ready (red when not blue good to go) and only takes like one minute to heat up! Feels sturdy and the plates are positioned to where it feels like a cushion so it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair, hence my earlier statement. It&#x27;s worth the money and the warranty stands when purchasing through here where some does not when sold through second or third party vendors. I&#x27;d highly recommend! Hope this helps. I have long hair as well and the rounded edges make it easy for hair bend styles, flips or curls.</li>
            <li> I have always used a chi but like this better. I haven&#x27;t been able to curl with it but it is great for straightening.</li>
            <li> Very nice, high end straightener at a good price!</li>
            <li> it was good while it lasted. the plates stopped heating after 2 years. for this price I expected it to last forever</li>
            <li> This flat iron is not what I expected for the price. Doing flips and curls is hard because the barrel is wide on top and bottom and it also snags your hair. This iron is also fairly heavy compared to most irons.</li>
            <li> Amazing - I love it! It use to take me 30-60 minutes for me to straighten my hair but with the Sedu it only takes 15. I also love the waves I can make and the fact that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry or damaged the day after.</li>
            <li> This is a decent iron, nothing special. I expected more, especially for this price. I guess what you&#x27;re paying for is clever marketing in this case. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> have a friend that recommended this straighter, she has really fine hair and so do I we needed something that wasn’t going to damage our hair so much and this had been a great purchase, I definitely recommend it and I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> returned this item, it stopped working after less than 10 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it was an easy return, no hassels. otherwise product was as described.</li>
            <li> My last flat iron was a Sedu that I&#x27;ve had for 5+ years. Unfortunately I broke it when using it in Europe, so I opted for a couple cheaper brands to see what else was out there (even though I LOVED my Sedu). I tried the HSI Professional but it was huge and pulled my hair. Then I bought this Sedu Revolution and the Babyliss Pro Ultra Thin to compare them.. ultimately, I&#x27;m keeping the Babyliss and returning the Sedu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have Asian hair; very coarse, thin (volume wise), and layered ALL over. So many layers.&lt;br /&gt;This review is based on MY hair and may differ for other types of hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Adjustable temperature dial that shows intervals of temps&lt;br /&gt;- Heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;- 1&amp;#34; plates &amp;#34;float&amp;#34; and can be pushed in, as though there are small springs underneath the plate. Not sure what that&#x27;s for..&lt;br /&gt;- SUPER smooth plates. It didn&#x27;t catch my hair or pull it at all! Amazing since I normally have problems with this when using flat irons.&lt;br /&gt;- Tourmaline makes my hair super shiny! It&#x27;s a big difference compared to when I use ceramic-only plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- No auto shutoff&lt;br /&gt;- The controls are on the inside and are kind of annoying to use/access&lt;br /&gt;- My last Sedu came with a protective heat sleeve and this one did not&lt;br /&gt;- The plates are only 3&amp;#34; long so it covers less hair than the Babyliss (which have 5&amp;#34; long plates)&lt;br /&gt;- Wider than I&#x27;d prefer (it&#x27;s less comfortable in my hand and takes up more space when traveling)&lt;br /&gt;- The pivot end is not protected from pinching skin (one side of the handle is shorter than the other and extends past the pivot, so when you open/close the plates there&#x27;s a risk of pinching your skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think the plate quality is better with Sedu but due to ergonomics and the size, I opted for the Babyliss.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely obsessed with this flat iron! I had a CHI for about 8 years until it finally died on me and I decided to try something new since the latest CHIs don&#x27;t have a temperature control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron straightens my hair unbelievably quickly and leaves it silky smooth and very soft!  My hair remains straight and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it becoming wavy or frizzy hours later.  I have extremely thick, wavy hair and it probably takes me about 10 minutes now to straighten my hair! This flat iron also glides over my hair effortlessly, which is great because I&#x27;ve become used to styling tools snagging on my hair (resulting in very unwanted split ends).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I read reviews about this flat iron and found out that it was a brand and flat iron that is used among Hollywood Runway Stylist. So far I don&#x27;t regret buying it. I used it on my daughter hair and it is natural, and kinky like, no relaxer. It straightened it just fine. I used the Blue Magic brand of hair grease (green colored one) for the oil to help straighten her hair. I have a Mizani relaxer and used the Sedu on my hair at a temperature of 300-330 degrees. It did not burn it. I only went over it once maybe twice at this setting. I noticed for me when I had the temperature around 240 degrees my hair didn&#x27;t get as straight and I had to go over it a few times. I used the CHI Silk Infusion as the oil for helping to straighten my hair. The Sedu Revolution is extremely light in weight, it doesn&#x27;t feel like your holding it. It did not snag my hair at all. I have a Gold n Hot Flat Iron that I got back in 2002 or 2003 and that thing gets extremely hot (has no temp. setting like the Sedu), and snags my hair like crazy. I like the fact that I can curl my hair with this Sedu also. I bought the 1\\&quot; because a beautican told me that the smaller flat iron have more concentrated heat as opposed to the larger flat irons and so they heat up better. Plus she said that she had the same Sedu flat iron and loved it. Some people say after 6 months that their flat iron broke down, obviously I don&#x27;t know but hope mines doesn&#x27;t do that. I paid $160 with 20% off for it, the company will hear from me if it breaks in 1 year or less. I will probably use it every 2 weeks or less. Don&#x27;t want to put alot of heat in my hair. I plan to buy the Sedu Clipless Curling Iron, will write review when I do.</li>
            <li> The iron broke in 4 months, unfortunately, though the iron was new, the warranty would not be honored (even if honored, replacement takes 4-6 weeks), i.e., this is extremely poor quality product...</li>
            <li> She loves it and that is all that matters.  Much better than the one picked up at a discount store.  As the saying goes if she&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy.  In case your wondering it makes a great birthday present.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t last long cord broke</li>
            <li> Loved this iron for the past three years, then one of the plates stopped getting hot. Called customer service and they can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t help or offer replacement parts since it only has a two year warranty. I&#x27;m disappointed I&#x27;ll have to throw this away despite being willing to pay for a replacement part - company just doesn&#x27;t offer any.</li>
            <li> From what I have experienced, and also heard from many reviews, this product probably has an internal wiring problem. Not that long after purchase, the plates stop working, usually one at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased my device about a year, ago and six months later one of the plates stopped heating up. I did have the two year warranty and spent my money shipping it back and received a new iron or refurbished one in a matter of weeks (Note, a different iron then my original). Sure enough, six months later, one of the plates stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion if you&#x27;re going to be spending this kind of money on this type of product they should be able to work for 2 years before showing signs of failure. I&#x27;ve never had this much trouble with a different brand before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Sedu, I say it like it is.</li>
            <li> This iron worked decently at first but broke after only 3 months. I didn&#x27;t drop it or do anything differently, it just stopped working one day. It is way too much money to spend on an item that only lasts a few months. The return policy says you can only return within 1 month which is unreasonable.</li>
            <li> This is my first flat styling iron, and it has been really easy to use &amp; does a very good job. My daughter also thinks it is the best styling iron she has used.</li>
            <li> Great product, as always from Sedu.  This package was cheaper than I found it on other websites, but it does not include the heat resistanct storage pouch.  That was fine with me since I already had several of them.</li>
            <li> It quit working after using only a few months.  I was very disappointed.  It worked well up until the day it quit.</li>
            <li> I received this flat iron as a birthday gift in 2011 and I was very happy with its performance for the first few months.  However after about 6 months of use (I have short hair and only use it to straighten my bangs and the fringe hair at the base of my neck) the flat iron stopped heating up, both sides.  I returned it to the store where it was purchased and was able to receive another one as a replacement.  I have been using this one for about 9 months now and one of the plates has stopped heating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the unit is working properly it does a very nice job of straightening my hair.  However I would warn on purchasing this flat iron, as other posts have mentioned, I too believe there is a wiring problem with these irons.</li>
            <li> The iron works great,when it works.    After 4 months, it stopped completely. I could not return through Amazon (return period over) and learned that the seller (in my case Harper&#x27;s Health, but probably all the Amazon sellers) was NOT an authorized seller. This means I could not send it back for replacement to the manufacturer.    After checking the other 1-star reviews here, I believe that I am not alone with a broken iron. I&#x27;m starting to even doubt these are genuine Sedu and not fakes (check Sedu&#x27;s website and warning about fake irons: [...])... I would buy only from a seller listed on their website.</li>
            <li> I bought this item a year ago, and have only used it 15-20 times. The plates only heati on one side &amp; this seller won&#x27;t do anything because.... In own words &amp;#34;way past their warranty!&amp;#34; Bottom line here is that I could have gone to bed bath and beyond and purchased this item with the 20% off coupon &amp; it would still be under warranty, and I would have only paid about $10 more. Do Not Purchase from this unauthorized dealer...go to an authorized retailer when purchasing products such as a flat irons that commonly break or has problems. Peace of mind that an authorized retailer will exchange/give you your money back is worth the $10! This item had to of been defective and this seller shouldn&#x27;t be selling this product!</li>
            <li> I returned this flat iron it did absolutely nothing for my hair. There&#x27;s no deference with this or $20 flat iron.</li>
            <li> The worst flat iron I ever had. I doesn´t heat as it is supposed so it doesn´t leave your hair really flat. My hair is very thin and not so wavy and I couldn´t get the straight look.... MY last flat iron was a bespoke that last 6 years working perfect... Very dissapointed</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron because my previous Sedu which I had for about 7 years stopped working. I flat iron my hair everyday and that&#x27;s an incredible lifespan for a hair iron. That&#x27;s the reason I decided to purchase another Sedu iron. Obviously, in the past 7 years, there&#x27;s been a few advancements in the hair iron game. This one has quite a few upgrades from my previous iron including: a swivel cord, rolled edges, and they moved the location of the on/off switch and temperature controls from the outside of the grip portion of the handle to the interior where you&#x27;re less likely to change the temperature settings accidently. Also, I do believe that this new Sedu iron has a higher heat setting than my previous Sedu iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this iron for a couple months now and I am more in love with my Sedu than before. I do like that with the rolled edges, it&#x27;s easier to add a bit of curl to my hair which I wasn&#x27;t able to before. Hopefully this one lasts me another 7 years!</li>
            <li> Sedu makes great products. I had my last Sedu flat iron for three years. Loved it, but the only down side was the cord got so tangled. This ended up being the reason it stopped working. This NEW model has a swivel base so that will allow the cord to not get all coiled up. It&#x27;s also the perfect size and is really easy to use. I love that it&#x27;s a standard plug too and not a big bulky one. I would recommend this flat iron to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a great tool and who wants to get their money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> te best flat iron ever!!!! it leave my hair soft shinny and does not damage me hair, love it so much!!!</li>
            <li> I love my Sedu straightener. It heats up very fast and doesn&#x27;t Damaged my hair like my chi straightener I am still a very happy customer.  My hair is so healthy and versatile now that I feel lucky to have found the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Sedu Revolution 7 years ago, and I&#x27;m so impressed with it&#x27;s performance! I absolutely love this flat iron. The temperature control is great and heats up very quickly. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the plates failing to heat. I&#x27;ve also noticed that the plates haven&#x27;t accumulated gunk. The swivel cord is a nice length, longer than any other straightener I&#x27;ve owned. One last thing I&#x27;ve really liked about this product: there is a light indicator that tell you when the iron is hot and ready to use. It is red while it heats up, then changes to blue when it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li> I liked the Sedu Revolution iron when I first received it nine months ago - it looked nice, and seemed to do a decent job of straightening my hair, although the results didn&#x27;t last long.  However, after a few uses I noticed that my hair looked fried, and felt dry after using it. I always use heat protection spray and only straighten once or twice a week.  My hair frequently snags on the plates, and often smells burned after I have straightened it.  My hair only stays straight for about an hour after I straighten it on average.  I had paid quite a lot for this iron, so I just continued to use it to straighten my bangs.  Unfortunately, two days ago, the plates stopped heating up, and the iron is now useless.  I did have a 2 year warranty, so I will be able to get a replacement.  But honestly, if I had the choice, I would choose a different flat iron.  For a $120 iron, you would think it would last a bit longer than 9 months.  I can only assume that the positive reviews come from people with fine hair (I have coarse, thick, curly hair) and from those who have not owned the iron very long. I&#x27;m really wondering how long the replacement iron will really last (another 9 months?) and when it does inevitably break, I won&#x27;t be purchasing a Sedu flat iron again.</li>
            <li> Wife bought it and loves it</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. It straightens my hair quickly while making it look shiny and healthy. I can also easily curl my hair with this flat iron. It was worth the price. I shopped around a lot and Amazon by far had the best price. Plus it arrived at my house quickly!!</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron. It is my 2nd one. I had my other one for about 5 years. One of the plates quit heating so I purchased a new one. Love this one as much as the last.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt the best flat irons I have ever owned!! Very high quality product. I would highly recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since November 2011, and it works just as well as when I first bought it.  I love that the heat is adjustable.  The plates have never snagged my hair. The plates also move a bit, making it easy to create volume.  I can&#x27;t think of any complaints about this.</li>
            <li> After reading some rave reviews I decided to purchase this straightener but it definately does not live up to the hype.  I&#x27;ve owned many Chi&#x27;s (a good straightener but they alwasy died after about 9-12 months) and a GHD (best dang straigtener on the market!).  I&#x27;m sure this works fine for fine or thin hair but for my thick hair I have to take really small sections to get the desired result, even on the highest setting and it takes forever.  My GHD would go through thicker sections and took about half the time.  Next time I will definately spend the extra money for another GHD.</li>
