            <li>just amazing my boyfriend loves it :)</li>
            <li>I love Versage&#x27;s perfume, but Versus im</li>
            <li>and I love my eau de toilette.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s refreshing.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very clean yet noticable and stays on well.</li>
            <li>Nice mild scent,but once sprayed</li>
            <li>It is my favorite parfume which has a mild and cool scent</li>
            <li>It has a distinctive perfume smell, unlike others which smell too light or just like clean laundry.</li>
            <li>the bottle is so pretty, happens to be my favorite color</li>
            <li>If you like to smell fresh and clean then this one is for you.</li>
            <li>but the citric scense doesnt vanish as quickly as she wanted..</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume because it had similar notes to  Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder&#x27;s White Linen, which is what my mother has been wearing since I could remember, but it also has a nice fresh, citrus like quality to it, which I really liked.</li>
            <li>Smelled mostly like alcohol, must have been old.</li>
            <li>(this is my 6th or 7th bottle)&lt;br /&gt;Great fresh smell, not heavy like most of perfumes.</li>
            <li>this parfume  its hands down the best , i get a lot of compliments , it stays on all day , my clothes smell even the next day !!</li>
            <li>, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li>Remarkable and fresh, last for long.</li>
            <li>you so much!</li>
            <li>I got a few sample gifts as well with a thank you card which was super kind from the seller.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>The scent was extremely loud and unrecognizable as the original product.</li>
            <li>This scent is pure heaven, spray it on, and you are enveloped with sweetness and lightness and you feel like an angel..</li>
            <li>This is now my mothers main scent, she loves it!</li>
            <li>This scent absolutely knocked my husband off his feet.</li>
            <li>If you like Chance by Channel, or Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder White Linen, I think you will enjoy this perfume also.</li>
            <li>I have been ordering this product for a whole.</li>
            <li>AND SHE REALLY LOVES IT</li>
            <li>Very chic.</li>
            <li>One of my favorites, it&#x27;s clean and can be worn day or night and last all day.</li>
            <li>can highly recommend this perfume and the seller.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite scent, but for some reason it does not last as long as the perfume I bought from Dillard&#x27;s some time ago.</li>
            <li>Once it was gone the fragance smelled pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>mild but yet long lasting , mainly for evening occasion.</li>
            <li>WOW....</li>
            <li>This fragrance has top notes of kumquat, star apple and lemon; middle notes of orange blossom, stephanotis and Centifolia rose, while a base notes are musk, patchouli and ambrette seed.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this in stores as a gift for my mother (she is in her late 40&#x27;s).</li>

            <li> it seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is so feminine and sexy, not to mention dangerous.</li>

            <li> this is not Versus perfume..,. I have been wearing this for 5 years and this one is fake... I compared it to another bottle and it smells nothing alike... I would like a REFUND</li>
            <li> Very good and timely delivery. mild but yet long lasting , mainly for evening occasion.</li>
            <li> This scent absolutely knocked my husband off his feet. This is so feminine and sexy, not to mention dangerous.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite parfume which has a mild and cool scent and I love it! I am gonna buy it again and again! And the price was perfect!</li>

            <li> Did not like the smell of this perfume, but the company that sold it was awesome.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this in stores as a gift for my mother (she is in her late 40&#x27;s). I was a little wary buying her a new perfume because smells are different for everyone and not everyone likes the same thing. I bought this perfume because it had similar notes to  Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder&#x27;s White Linen, which is what my mother has been wearing since I could remember, but it also has a nice fresh, citrus like quality to it, which I really liked. This is now my mothers main scent, she loves it! She tells me people are always complimenting her and asking her what she is wearing. When I went to visit recently I noticed she was wearing it and I&#x27;m seriously considering adding it to my collection. If you like Chance by Channel, or Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder White Linen, I think you will enjoy this perfume also.</li>
            <li> Did not smell at all like it smelled in stores. Smelled mostly like alcohol, must have been old. Gave it away.</li>
            <li> I love Versage&#x27;s perfume, but Versus im my opinion is the one. Remarkable and fresh, last for long. For where I go I&#x27;m always noticed</li>
            <li> Intoxicating. Makes girls ooh and ahh and men drool.</li>
            <li> Price and quality. I have been ordering this product for a whole. I recommend this to every one.the product arrived as promised. Excellent</li>
            <li> Nice mild scent,but once sprayed,it doesn&#x27;t last all that long.</li>
            <li> Bought for my mother as a gift and she liked it but the citric scense doesnt vanish as quickly as she wanted..</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother so she could try something different.  She didn&#x27;t like it as well as the yellow versace.</li>
            <li> I had tried a sample of this and absolutely LOVE! It&#x27;s very clean yet noticable and stays on well. good price too</li>
            <li> The perfume is good. We also got lots of other discount items with the perfume. Reducing 1/2 star for delivery confusions.</li>
            <li> Great parfume.I bought it as a gift to my sister, she loves it and get compliments all the time.It is not a strong smell, but stays long.</li>

            <li> My favorite perfume! I found it four or three years ago in a store and I am so happy Amazon has it! (this is my 6th or 7th bottle)&lt;br /&gt;Great fresh smell, not heavy like most of perfumes. I always get compliments about it even from strangers!&lt;br /&gt;I can highly recommend this perfume and the seller.&lt;br /&gt;Perfume came on time, carefully packed. I got a few sample gifts as well with a thank you card which was super kind from the seller.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>

            <li> My store stopped selling this fragance.  The price was $20 cheaper online, than I paid at the store.  I did detext a stronger alcohol smell. Once it was gone the fragance smelled pretty much the same.</li>

            <li> I love the smell of this perfume! I was worried that it would not last through the day, but it has proven me wrong. Even my bed has a nice remainder smell of the perfume :). It has a distinctive perfume smell, unlike others which smell too light or just like clean laundry. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this, do it! A little goes a long way, too.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend brought me this perfume a over a year ago and I wanted it again. He searched and said the stores stop selling it. I was disappointed and then decided to search Amazon cause they carry it all. I found it but it was the eau de toilette so I was spectacle in purchasing it. I went for it and I love my eau de toilette. Not only does it smell just like the perfume I once owned but the smell lasted long. Still smelled on my clothes the net day and that&#x27;s refreshing. A great purchase.</li>
            <li> this parfume  its hands down the best , i get a lot of compliments , it stays on all day , my clothes smell even the next day !! just amazing my boyfriend loves it :)</li>
            <li> I would definitely be repurchasing this. If you like to smell fresh and clean then this one is for you.</li>
            <li> Awesome fragrance and it seems to last a long time. This fragrance has top notes of kumquat, star apple and lemon; middle notes of orange blossom, stephanotis and Centifolia rose, while a base notes are musk, patchouli and ambrette seed. It&#x27;s has a beautiful floral scent and would be great for spring and summer</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this fragrance. Best for night wear. Very chic.</li>
