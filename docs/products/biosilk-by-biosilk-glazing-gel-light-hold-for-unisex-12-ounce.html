            <li>Very pleased with this and proud to be able to order on line since you can&#x27;t find around where I live.</li>
            <li>I also use the Biosilk Silk Therapy, so I figured with that oil, it might balance out but am not so sure now.</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>This is a product I love.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for many years.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser got me using this many years ago, and I always have a bottle on hand.  </li>
            <li>Glad to find such great prices for it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Love the way it fills on hair.</li>
            <li>The fragrance was still too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>It provides good hold for my fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>and it offers a good protective cover to your hair along with a lovely sheen.</li>
            <li>so it works on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fine.</li>
            <li>This is a nice gentle glaze.  </li>
            <li>This glazing gel is a lot thicker but the hold is light.  </li>
            <li>First time I tried it, the smell was overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and I would recommend this purchase without hesitation.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me</li>
            <li>and I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s better that way I&#x27;ll definitely come back with an update :-)</li>
            <li>Works exactly as I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>, it is just enough hold to keep it nice in Fl weather, I have natural curly hair, thank you</li>
            <li>If there is a similar product without a strong smell, please let me know.  </li>
            <li>Much lighter than gel.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Nothing to really rave about.</li>
            <li>It makes hair very shiny.</li>
            <li>grey/white coming in all over, so it is corser than regular dark hair, and it smells so good</li>
            <li>For my naturally curly hair, this is the first product I found that REALLLLLY works well without making my hair sticky or plasticy</li>
            <li>I receive compliments on my hair all the time and am able to fluff up my hair to show them how natural it is</li>
            <li>It makes my long thick hair more shiny and makes it more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for the past 17 years and still love it.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t hold exactly as the same as Matrix Vavoom glaze gel</li>
            <li>A little too light.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to find locally, so being able to order online and have it in just a couple of days is very helpful.</li>
            <li>Controls my curls and keeps them soft and touchable.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair naturally curly and shiny.  </li>
            <li>and it certainly doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair which is a plus, but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use it a little more by trying different ways, for example on wet hair.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years but now that I&#x27;m letting my hair grow out a little, am thinking it might be drying my hair out too much.  </li>

            <li> Much lighter than gel.  That&#x27;s what I like about it.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair, but helps keep the shape.</li>
            <li> Best thing for frizzy hair EVER!</li>
            <li> this gel is very thin so it works on my fine hair.  I use the product to protect my hair from heat styling.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> It is a great product.  I have been using it for quite a while.  I Can truly recommend it to anyone.</li>

            <li> I have used this product for the past 17 years and still love it. This Glazing Gel is getting harder and harder to find in hair salons.  Lucky for me there&#x27;s Amazon!  I&#x27;ve tried other hair gel products but they leave white flakes, weigh down my hair, or don&#x27;t hold. Biosilk Glazing Gel is perfect for my hair.  I receive compliments on my hair all the time and am able to fluff up my hair to show them how natural it is and it still looks the same.  Please don&#x27;t ever let this product go away.  There&#x27;s nothing on the market that makes my hair look as good.</li>
            <li> This gel is the best stuff I have found on the market, it works so well mix with the Biosilk Silk Therapy Hair Treatment to style your hair. Love it! .</li>
            <li> Nothing to really rave about. I&#x27;ve used it twice and it certainly doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair which is a plus, but it&#x27;s holding power isn&#x27;t that great. I&#x27;m going to use it a little more by trying different ways, for example on wet hair. If it&#x27;s better that way I&#x27;ll definitely come back with an update :-)</li>

            <li> I have used this for many years. This is a nice gentle glaze.  I would recommend this to friends and family!</li>
            <li> A little too light.  Medium hold is perfect.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser got me using this many years ago, and I always have a bottle on hand.  It makes my long thick hair more shiny and makes it more manageable.  Glad to find such great prices for it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in a gift package one year from jc Penney.  This product is the best for curly hair.  It&#x27;s not greasy, nor does it have the alcohol mousse can have.  It leaves your hair naturally curly and shiny.  Love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I used bio silk products awhile back.Very pleased with this and proud to be able to order on line since you can&#x27;t find around where I live. So proud to be able to get.Love the way it fills on hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this from another site for 13 bucks plus 5 dollars shipping.  Way less than the 30 or 40 dollars you find on Amazon.  I was using Matrix Vavoom Glazing gel which I can no longer find.  This glazing gel is a lot thicker but the hold is light.  It&#x27;s not as much a wet a look even when I tried again on wet hair.  But close enough.  My biggest complaint and why I gave it two stars is the smell.  It is the strongest smelling product I&#x27;ve ever used.  First time I tried it, the smell was overwhelming.  I had to wash it out after a few hours.  I decided to give it another try watered down.  The fragrance was still too overwhelming.  If there is a similar product without a strong smell, please let me know.  I&#x27;d buy it.  This doesn&#x27;t hold exactly as the same as Matrix Vavoom glaze gel but it&#x27;s closest I can find.  But I won&#x27;t use the rest of the bottle due to the smell.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for curly hair. It cuts down on frizz, encourages curl and keeps hair in place without being excessively crunchy or stiff. It makes hair very shiny. The only bad thing about the glaze is the unpleasant smell, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to linger on the hair once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> my hair dresser told me to use it, I have part grey/white coming in all over, so it is corser than regular dark hair, and it smells so good, it is just enough hold to keep it nice in Fl weather, I have natural curly hair, thank you</li>
            <li> Leaves a ton of residue on your hair.  If you touch your hair, it flakes off and also floats off in the air as if you had lint and/or dirt stuck to your hair.  That made it useless to me.  I can&#x27;t use a product that makes my hair look dirty and filthy.</li>
            <li> For my naturally curly hair, this is the first product I found that REALLLLLY works well without making my hair sticky or plasticy</li>
            <li> Works exactly as I was expecting.  Shipped fine.</li>
