            <li> I just received this in the mail today and I barely ordered it the other day.  I used it last night for the first time.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Crystals are to big. Wanted finer grade.</li>
            <li> I used them to make a scented bath salts.  They worked wonderfully</li>
            <li> I also mix it with epsom salts to encourage a healthier product. The only issue I have with this product is that I am constantly finding stones in the salts. THEY SAY it&#x27;s sorted by hand here in the USA, while that may be true, their quality control leaves a little to be desired. Other than that. Very nice.</li>

I heard about the Dead Sea and really wanted to visit and then found this stuff in amazon I can&#x27;t, I won&#x27;t live without it. Because of this I take a hot bath every night. It&#x27;s a great deal too.</li>
