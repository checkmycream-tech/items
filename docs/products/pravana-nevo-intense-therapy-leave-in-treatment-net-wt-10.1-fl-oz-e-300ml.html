            <li>This spray is amazing.  </li>
            <li>but this is the absolute best.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a pain to use</li>
            <li>and I have been buying it ever since, conditions hair nicely</li>
            <li>so it is very easily tangled.</li>
            <li>(my hair is very fine since my radiation, so this was a concern).</li>

            <li>Again I love this.</li>
            <li>You can never quite duplicate that silky, healthy, and alluring style that the stylist implemented (or I couldn&#x27;t).  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product and now that I know about it, I will never be without it.</li>

            <li>and I love the spray bottle.  </li>
            <li>but since I&#x27;m not licensed, I&#x27;m ok with this price on here.</li>
            <li>I love the Pravana line.</li>
            <li>I have used many conditioning products on my hair (Carols Daughter, Phyto, and many others)...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Hi!  love it...</li>
            <li>Sadly most of my product is in the garbage instead of waiting to be used on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this for my grand daughters hair and she and her mom love it.</li>
            <li>It makes her hair so much more manageable:)</li>
            <li>I thought it would be OK...</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I really love it and shared with my stepdaughter.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t get to spray the product into my hair, but the product itself is fantastic, makes my hair soft, and  smells wonderful!!!</li>
            <li>Love this on my super fine, tangle prone hair!!</li>
            <li>I first bought this product from my hair salon and it is the absolute best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The first day I used this product I loved it.</li>
            <li>It smells good and my hair is so much softer and shinier.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am happy!</li>
            <li>Easy to comb through.  </li>
            <li>smells with this product-just fresh, clean, silky healthy hair!</li>
            <li>Loyal customer!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, non-oily and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot deny how smooth, silky, and shiny my hair looks and feels after.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is fabulous</li>
            <li>It leaves hair smooth and manageable yet not oily at all.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair so smooth and de tangles it</li>
            <li>Works great on my long curly hair.</li>
            <li>Also the bottle is environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li>John Frieda Straight Fixation smoothing creme and my hair looks healthy, shiny, and smells absolutely heavenly!!!</li>
            <li>Call custom service and they made it right!</li>
            <li>We call it the &amp;#34;magic blue stuff&amp;#34; because it works so good in their hair as a detangler.</li>
            <li>I can finally look as good as I do after a visit to my stylist.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it does work very well.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty fine, and has been through bleaching, dying, and heat-styling</li>
            <li>and it smells so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling great and keeps the frizz down.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this product, not only my hair, but my scalp is in better condition!</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and manageable and the little fly aways are tamed!</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time, does a wonderful job of conditioning and detangling long hair without adding weight or grease.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>Get it right now.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Gets rid of the tangles and made my hair silky smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even have to use very much, just a couple of spritzes</li>
            <li>but then this conditioner arrived and within two days there was a huge difference in my hair and within a week it was soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>i really like it!</li>
            <li>and this item really helps!  </li>
            <li>It does reconstruct your hair back to its healthy self again.</li>
            <li>From battling dryness and static to protecting my color, I can&#x27;t say enough about Pravana Nevo!</li>
            <li>Makes even long hair easy to comb out!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not bad, but I prefer natural pure fragrances or none at all.</li>
            <li>This corrects every issue, and I just spray, with a little more product, and go!</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight bleached blonde hair with brown peekaboo&#x27;s (if that makes a difference).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still debating how much I like this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I was getting ready to cut it off</li>
            <li>this Pravana Nevo intense therapy leave-</li>
            <li>but I still love this leave in conditioner and really had no way to send something back that would have spilled completely as soon as it was turned sideways...</li>
            <li>Make my long hair easy to comb thru when wet and love the smell</li>
            <li>Also it smells fresh and lovely - no strong or perfume</li>
            <li>My hair tangles very easily, &amp; this is the only product I&#x27;ve ever found that actually works to detangle it.</li>
            <li>This product is very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down one bit</li>
            <li>The product itself leaves my hair feeling silky and healthy, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.</li>
            <li>It smells nice but not strong, leaves no residue, and definitely makes my hair soft, worth the price!</li>
            <li>I found nothing negative about this product at all...as a matter of fact it has become my favorite leave-in treatment!</li>
            <li>Great product but the sprayer was damaged in transit due to the fact that it was placed in a large box with very little packing material.</li>
            <li>My little granddaughters love it.  </li>
            <li>It is the only detangler worth using.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona, where the climate extremes wreak havoc on hair.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s as if my hair has been completely rejuvenated!</li>
            <li>when it first arrived, It was all mixed up</li>
            <li>I have noticed that if a little runs down on my face and I rub it in, that part of my face feels moisturized so this may also be good for your skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my frizzy, unruly hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I use this on my 6 and 2 year old girls hair to get knots out.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair that I treat frequently</li>
            <li>Leaves my fine, color-treated blonde hair in shiny, silky condition without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>Spritz this on out of the shower and my brash glides right thru, no more tangles or sound of the brush ripping through my hair!</li>
            <li>So I guess its a great product for damage and colored hair but not for bleached or really chemical treated hair :(</li>
            <li>Highly recommend Pravana products, especially for blondes who want to avoid brassiness.  </li>
            <li>Well, after 4 or so visits to my new stylist I finally asked her what she used.</li>
            <li>everything else; biodegradable bottle, great ingredients, worth the money paid, see immediate results, renewed love for (former) straw hair that I&#x27;ve tortured and killed slowly and painfully through the years by use of heat and inferior hair products, also it&#x27;s pretty&lt;</li>
            <li>Pravana Nevo lets me comb right through my curly hair when wet and leaves it shiny and soft when dry.  </li>
            <li>I get lots of compliments and when the occasional person decides to feel my hair they boast about how soft or silky it is.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the sprayer broke completely 3 days later.</li>
            <li>and it still felt pretty straw like when it dried.</li>
            <li>Pravana Nevo intense therapy leave-in treatment beats them all, hands down!</li>

            <li> I love this product and it does work very well.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty fine, and has been through bleaching, dying, and heat-styling</li>
            <li> and it smells so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling great and keeps the frizz down.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this product, not only my hair, but my scalp is in better condition!</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and manageable and the little fly aways are tamed!</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, does a wonderful job of conditioning and detangling long hair without adding weight or grease.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> Get it right now.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> Gets rid of the tangles and made my hair silky smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even have to use very much, just a couple of spritzes</li>
            <li> but then this conditioner arrived and within two days there was a huge difference in my hair and within a week it was soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> i really like it!</li>
            <li> and this item really helps!  </li>
            <li> It does reconstruct your hair back to its healthy self again.</li>
            <li> From battling dryness and static to protecting my color, I can&#x27;t say enough about Pravana Nevo!</li>
            <li> Makes even long hair easy to comb out!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not bad, but I prefer natural pure fragrances or none at all.</li>
            <li> This corrects every issue, and I just spray, with a little more product, and go!</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight bleached blonde hair with brown peekaboo&#x27;s (if that makes a difference).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still debating how much I like this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I was getting ready to cut it off</li>
            <li> this Pravana Nevo intense therapy leave-</li>
            <li> but I still love this leave in conditioner and really had no way to send something back that would have spilled completely as soon as it was turned sideways...</li>
            <li> Make my long hair easy to comb thru when wet and love the smell</li>
            <li> Also it smells fresh and lovely - no strong or perfume</li>
            <li> My hair tangles very easily, &amp; this is the only product I&#x27;ve ever found that actually works to detangle it.</li>
            <li> This product is very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down one bit</li>
            <li> The product itself leaves my hair feeling silky and healthy, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.</li>
            <li> It smells nice but not strong, leaves no residue, and definitely makes my hair soft, worth the price!</li>
            <li> I found nothing negative about this product at all...as a matter of fact it has become my favorite leave-in treatment!</li>
            <li> Great product but the sprayer was damaged in transit due to the fact that it was placed in a large box with very little packing material.</li>
            <li> My little granddaughters love it.  </li>
            <li> It is the only detangler worth using.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona, where the climate extremes wreak havoc on hair.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s as if my hair has been completely rejuvenated!</li>
            <li> when it first arrived, It was all mixed up</li>
            <li> I have noticed that if a little runs down on my face and I rub it in, that part of my face feels moisturized so this may also be good for your skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my frizzy, unruly hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I use this on my 6 and 2 year old girls hair to get knots out.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that I treat frequently</li>
            <li> Leaves my fine, color-treated blonde hair in shiny, silky condition without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> Spritz this on out of the shower and my brash glides right thru, no more tangles or sound of the brush ripping through my hair!</li>
            <li> So I guess its a great product for damage and colored hair but not for bleached or really chemical treated hair :(</li>
            <li> Highly recommend Pravana products, especially for blondes who want to avoid brassiness.  </li>
            <li> Well, after 4 or so visits to my new stylist I finally asked her what she used.</li>
            <li> everything else; biodegradable bottle, great ingredients, worth the money paid, see immediate results, renewed love for (former) straw hair that I&#x27;ve tortured and killed slowly and painfully through the years by use of heat and inferior hair products, also it&#x27;s pretty&lt;</li>
            <li> Pravana Nevo lets me comb right through my curly hair when wet and leaves it shiny and soft when dry.  </li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments and when the occasional person decides to feel my hair they boast about how soft or silky it is.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the sprayer broke completely 3 days later.</li>
            <li> and it still felt pretty straw like when it dried.</li>
            <li> Pravana Nevo intense therapy leave-in treatment beats them all, hands down!</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with the low price, but was disappointed that it took several weeks to ship.</li>
            <li> Hair is soft, not weighted down</li>
            <li> so when i put it on that part of my hair it feels a little bit dry, not soft like in the non-bleached normal hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is mid length, curly/frizzy, and very compromised due to radiation treatments from my cancer battle over the past year.</li>
            <li> This review was long overdue.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a LONG time.</li>
            <li> No overpowering fragrance and a bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The assistant helping me had silky Nd shiny long hair and said it&#x27;s what she uses.</li>
            <li> So far my hair feels heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product, just be careful with the spray nozzle.</li>
            <li> I only have to color again due to root growth.  </li>
            <li> No sulfates in any of these which is essential for me due to sulfate allergy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After washing my hair, I towel dry it, and saturate with this (spray, spray, spray).</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy, has dry ends and is frizzy.</li>
            <li> Got home, put some on my dry hair</li>
            <li> I also use it on dry hair as well.</li>
            <li> My hair was so dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, frizzy, color-treated hair and live in NY--</li>
            <li> It works on my dry skin too!</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on my hair while wet</li>
            <li> /&gt;You spray it on your wet hair and then comb through</li>
            <li> For the over-colored, over-dried, over-sunned head of hair, this leave-in conditioner allows a few days between actual washings hence saving the life of the color and dried/fried hair.</li>
            <li> I really feel like my hair would have all broken off.</li>
            <li> I also use Pravana&#x27;s Volumizing Shampoo (green bottle) and Color Ensure Conditioner (red bottle).  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that can tame her mane.</li>
            <li> I have just finished my bottle and am halfway into my other.</li>
            <li> Have used other detanglers</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s always been frizzy and out of control, with this my thick hair with curls has finally been tamed.</li>
            <li> It leaves it silky and nit weighed down.</li>
            <li> I leave it in and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> Does not weigh down hair.</li>
            <li> This product was wrapped but 1/2 of it leaked out through the spray bottle of bein packaged upside down.</li>
            <li> I can go from straw to silk in less than a week using it twice a day.  </li>
            <li> It helps to condition my hair without leaving it greasy or bogged down.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t added any other products to my usual shampoo/conditioner routine so...</li>
            <li> I have thin blonde dyed hair.</li>
            <li> All you need is a few spritz here and there  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because the sprayer was broken when I got it.</li>
            <li> so it is prone to being dried out and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely for unhealthy, thinned, bleached hair.</li>
            <li> brushes easier after just a few sprays</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that the bottle broke so quickly</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair and with this extremely cold winter my hair was in bad shape</li>
            <li> ) moisturizes and softens dry, thin hair</li>
            <li> No more tangled hair.</li>
            <li> But with a few sprites of this stuff it brushes through like a charm!</li>
            <li> You do not need to use much...on towel-dried hair just a few spritzes works wonders!</li>
            <li> Not sure about this yet.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it arrived half empty from poor packaging.</li>
            <li> I have very thick colored hair that requires a lot of moisture</li>
            <li> when I got the product the handle was broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used expensive salon brands and store brands</li>
            <li> This is a rather expensive product to be losing the majority of the bottle in shipping.</li>
            <li> and I was afraid it was not what I ordered,</li>
            <li> bad thing to say was that the bottle was leaking when I received it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the product. Prompt delivery</li>
            <li> This leave in treatment is great. Unfortunately, it arrived half empty from poor packaging.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It works great for all lengths of hair. I don&#x27;t like how it was shipped there was liquid all over the box. Other than that, I am happy! I have used this product for years.</li>
            <li> Love this on my super fine, tangle prone hair!! Spritz this on out of the shower and my brash glides right thru, no more tangles or sound of the brush ripping through my hair! It smells nice but not strong, leaves no residue, and definitely makes my hair soft, worth the price!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Works great on my long curly hair.</li>
            <li> Get it. Get it right now. What are you waiting for? Oh you want to hear why it&#x27;s FREAKIN&#x27; amazing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) It&#x27;s light, non-oily and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down&lt;br /&gt;b) moisturizes and softens dry, thin hair&lt;br /&gt;c) heat-protecting and leaves hair silky (I use it before straightening)&lt;br /&gt;d) smells wonderful, like a newborn baby space unicorn&lt;br /&gt;e) everything else; biodegradable bottle, great ingredients, worth the money paid, see immediate results, renewed love for (former) straw hair that I&#x27;ve tortured and killed slowly and painfully through the years by use of heat and inferior hair products, also it&#x27;s pretty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr - buy it</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff EVER!  I use it, my daughter uses it.  My little granddaughters love it.  We call it the &amp;#34;magic blue stuff&amp;#34; because it works so good in their hair as a detangler.</li>
            <li> Great hair product.&lt;br /&gt;Only bad thing to say was that the bottle was leaking when I received it.</li>
            <li> This leave in treatment has SAVED my hair. I have ways treated my hair well but it&#x27;s always been frizzy and out of control, with this my thick hair with curls has finally been tamed.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Great condition.</li>
            <li> I started using this product on my and my daughter&#x27;s hair 6 months ago. It is the only detangler worth using. It makes my frizzy, unruly hair soft and manageable. My daughter&#x27;s hair is changing from her Curly baby hair, to a thicker curlier version. This is the only product that can tame her mane. It leaves it silky and nit weighed down.</li>
            <li> best leave on conditioner every</li>
            <li> Makes even long hair easy to comb out!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I can tell a difference in the moisture level of my hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. My daughter use this product and she love it... No more tangled hair.</li>
            <li> Smells great; de-tangles great.</li>
            <li> Great detangler and good price!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff...if it needs to be known I&#x27;m African American and have a short bob cut.  Again I love this.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite go to products after I wash my hair!  I have been using for years!  I have thin blonde dyed hair.</li>
            <li> This review was long overdue. I have just finished my bottle and am halfway into my other. The bottle lasts a LONG time. All you need is a few spritz here and there  but I will admit, I saturate my hair in this (and yes, it&#x27;s a leave-in). I have fine, straight bleached blonde hair with brown peekaboo&#x27;s (if that makes a difference).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know how when you go to your hair stylist and, afterwards, your hair comes out looking beautiful? You can never quite duplicate that silky, healthy, and alluring style that the stylist implemented (or I couldn&#x27;t).  Well, after 4 or so visits to my new stylist I finally asked her what she used. It was this. So, I bought it right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my hair, I towel dry it, and saturate with this (spray, spray, spray). I then will blow-dry my hair, and use my hair straightener. I cannot deny how smooth, silky, and shiny my hair looks and feels after. I get lots of compliments and when the occasional person decides to feel my hair they boast about how soft or silky it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It smells SO GOOD! I have noticed that if a little runs down on my face and I rub it in, that part of my face feels moisturized so this may also be good for your skin. I have to do further research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product and now that I know about it, I will never be without it. I can finally look as good as I do after a visit to my stylist.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because the sprayer was broken when I got it. Had to put in a different bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! I leave it in and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. Makes my hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I use this on my 6 and 2 year old girls hair to get knots out. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING! Love it!</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my stylist. Awesome! Make my long hair easy to comb thru when wet and love the smell</li>
            <li> Pravana Nevo lets me comb right through my curly hair when wet and leaves it shiny and soft when dry.  I wish it were a larger bottle, so it would last longer, however.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every product on the market, and this is the best! I have thick, wavy, frizzy, color-treated hair and live in NY--so, the humidity goes through the roof! This corrects every issue, and I just spray, with a little more product, and go! Thank you, Pravana!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still debating how much I like this stuff. Everyone was raving about it so I bought it for my damaged hair. It smells amazing but didn&#x27;t work miracles on my hair. Maybe it&#x27;ll take using it longer to notice a change. I sprayed it on my hair while wet and it still felt pretty straw like when it dried. The next morning though it feels softer.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner that I have ever used!!  I&#x27;ve used expensive salon brands and store brands but this is the absolute best.  I have long fine hair and with this extremely cold winter my hair was in bad shape and I was getting ready to cut it off but then this conditioner arrived and within two days there was a huge difference in my hair and within a week it was soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You spray it on your wet hair and then comb through and it gets rid of any tangles from washing with no pulling or tugging.  You don&#x27;t even have to use very much, just a couple of spritzes and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep on using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Really love this product!!  Does not weigh down hair.</li>
            <li> We were introduced to this product by our family hairdresser of 20+ years. Provides a great base for styles of all variety</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! Was very pleased with the low price, but was disappointed that it took several weeks to ship.</li>
            <li> A friend told me she also used this for her skin issues. It works on my dry skin too! No overpowering fragrance and a bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that I treat frequently so it is prone to being dried out and frizzy.  This spray is amazing.  It helps to condition my hair without leaving it greasy or bogged down.  I can go from straw to silk in less than a week using it twice a day.  Loyal customer!</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty fine, and has been through bleaching, dying, and heat-styling so it is very easily tangled. Especially after I&#x27;ve towel-dried my hair after a shower. But with a few sprites of this stuff it brushes through like a charm! I absolutely love this stufd. And it smells very nice too!</li>
            <li> For the over-colored, over-dried, over-sunned head of hair, this leave-in conditioner allows a few days between actual washings hence saving the life of the color and dried/fried hair.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommends this. Best detangler ever. I cant wash my hair or go out of town without it! Love being able to purchase it from amazon.</li>
            <li> love this stuff, perfect for my hair and smells great. dawna</li>
            <li> Great seller fast ship.  Works well for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy, has dry ends and is frizzy. Went to a beauty supply store and this was recommended. The assistant helping me had silky Nd shiny long hair and said it&#x27;s what she uses. I was sold. Got home, put some on my dry hair and it&#x27;s as if my hair has been completely rejuvenated! I got it at the store for $17.50.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product to me and I love it!  It smells good and my hair is so much softer and shinier.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of the tangles and made my hair silky smooth and soft! Great purchase! Have used other detanglers but nothing compares to this! Winner!</li>
            <li> Helps protect my hair from heat and chlorine and it smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> Love this leave in conditioner.  The smell is great and I love the spray bottle.  The price is fair.  My friend is a hair stylist and she can get it for about $9 but since I&#x27;m not licensed, I&#x27;m ok with this price on here.</li>
            <li> I love the Pravana line. I have used many conditioning products on my hair (Carols Daughter, Phyto, and many others)...Pravana Nevo intense therapy leave-in treatment beats them all, hands down! My hair is mid length, curly/frizzy, and very compromised due to radiation treatments from my cancer battle over the past year. My hair is in terrible shape from the radiation, and if not for this Pravana Nevo intense therapy leave-in I really feel like my hair would have all broken off. This product truly has saved my hair! You do not need to use much...on towel-dried hair just a few spritzes works wonders! This product is very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down one bit (my hair is very fine since my radiation, so this was a concern). Since I&#x27;ve been using this product, not only my hair, but my scalp is in better condition! Also it smells fresh and lovely - no strong or perfume smells with this product-just fresh, clean, silky healthy hair! I found nothing negative about this product at all...as a matter of fact it has become my favorite leave-in treatment!</li>
            <li> when I got the product the handle was broken. and did not work!!!!!</li>
            <li> It moisturises my hair! i really like it! but i have part of my hair bleached so when i put it on that part of my hair it feels a little bit dry, not soft like in the non-bleached normal hair. So I guess its a great product for damage and colored hair but not for bleached or really chemical treated hair :(</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My hair tangles very easily, &amp; this is the only product I&#x27;ve ever found that actually works to detangle it.</li>
            <li> Buy this all the the time. Leaves hair feeling great and keeps the frizz down.</li>
            <li> The very best.  Hair is soft, not weighted down Fragrance is fabulous</li>
            <li> Not sure about this yet. Have not noticed &amp;#34;incredibly soft&amp;#34; hair like I read about. So far my hair feels heavy and greasy. Haven&#x27;t added any other products to my usual shampoo/conditioner routine so... I don&#x27;t know. I will continue to give it a chance and update.</li>
            <li> Love this spray! It lasts a long time, does a wonderful job of conditioning and detangling long hair without adding weight or grease.  I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Hi!  love it...when it first arrived, It was all mixed up and I was afraid it was not what I ordered, but, the next day it was \\&quot;separated\\&quot; like it is supposed to and I shook it up and used it on damp hair before heat styling and it is great!  Makes my blond, colored, over 50 hair look like it did when I was in my 20&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> I love this product and it does work very well. I ordered two of these bottles and both had leaked all in the packaging, all inside the box and even outside the box. This is a rather expensive product to be losing the majority of the bottle in shipping. I had read about this, but hoped it would be different with my delivery. Sadly most of my product is in the garbage instead of waiting to be used on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered again, my product had again leaked in the bag, box and everywhere in between. Call custom service and they made it right! This is an amazing product and I love using it! No tangles at all and it smells so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> This leave-in is amazing!  I have very thick colored hair that requires a lot of moisture and this item really helps!  My hair is soft and manageable and the little fly aways are tamed!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and good price.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I got this for my grand daughters hair and she and her mom love it. It makes her hair so much more manageable:) You just have to shake it up to mix before using it each time.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It smells awesome, which is just a bonus.The product itself leaves my hair feeling silky and healthy, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all. I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it&#x27;s definitely for unhealthy, thinned, bleached hair. It does reconstruct your hair back to its healthy self again. The smell is GODLY. Also the bottle is environmentally friendly. Worth every penny</li>
            <li> Great product but the sprayer was damaged in transit due to the fact that it was placed in a large box with very little packing material. I thought it would be OK...just leaked a tiny bit when using... but the sprayer broke completely 3 days later. I now have poured it into another container. It&#x27;s kind of a pain to use but I still love this leave in conditioner and really had no way to send something back that would have spilled completely as soon as it was turned sideways...and I would also then had no conditioner. It leaves hair smooth and manageable yet not oily at all.I would give it 5 stars if the packaging for delivery had been as good as the product.</li>
            <li> My favorite leave in treatment to date! Leaves my hair so smooth and de tangles it so well! Must have!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. Can&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li> This product was wrapped but 1/2 of it leaked out through the spray bottle of bein packaged upside down.</li>
            <li> this is a regular purchase for me, my hairdresser used it on me years ago and I have been buying it ever since, conditions hair nicely</li>
            <li> It does what I need it to do which makes me happy. I have long hair so need it every day</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product! I use it to comb out the tangpes in my daughters hair after bath time. I also use it on dry hair as well. It helps build strength in my hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and was shipped to ensure no leakage occurred.</li>
            <li> My stylist in SW CO turned me onto this product.  I really love it and shared with my stepdaughter.  I now replenish her supply whenever she&#x27;s low.  I am not a fragrance type of gal, and this has scent.  It&#x27;s really not bad, but I prefer natural pure fragrances or none at all.</li>
            <li> This is the best leave-in treatment out there!  I live in Arizona, where the climate extremes wreak havoc on hair.  This product has saved my hair year-round.  From battling dryness and static to protecting my color, I can&#x27;t say enough about Pravana Nevo!</li>
            <li> best detangler i have used for curly and wavey hair. brushes easier after just a few sprays</li>
            <li> I first bought this product from my hair salon and it is the absolute best product I have ever used. My hair was so dry and damaged. Frizzy. After only a few days of using this my hair is so soft and looks so alive. I will defiantly continue to use this stuff. LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> The first day I used this product I loved it. The second day I accidentally hit the spray nozzle on my shelf and it broke, so ever since then I have been shaking the bottle , pouring some into my hands, and putting it on my hair. I&#x27;m disappointed that the bottle broke so quickly and I don&#x27;t get to spray the product into my hair, but the product itself is fantastic, makes my hair soft, and  smells wonderful!!! I definitely recommend this product, just be careful with the spray nozzle. I use this with John Frieda Straight Fixation smoothing creme and my hair looks healthy, shiny, and smells absolutely heavenly!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves my fine, color-treated blonde hair in shiny, silky condition without weighing it down.  Easy to comb through.  No brassiness.  In fact, it helps prevent the color treatment from fading for weeks.  I only have to color again due to root growth.  I also use Pravana&#x27;s Volumizing Shampoo (green bottle) and Color Ensure Conditioner (red bottle).  My hair has body and is in great condition.  Highly recommend Pravana products, especially for blondes who want to avoid brassiness.  No sulfates in any of these which is essential for me due to sulfate allergy.</li>
