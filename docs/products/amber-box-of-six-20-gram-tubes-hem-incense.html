            <li>We love this amber incense.</li>
            <li>My partner and I love the fragance of this Amber incense.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what &amp;#34;amber&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;would</li>
            <li>It is split up in many packages.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this incense before, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have always enjoyed HEM brand incense</li>
            <li>I am greatly pleased and will continue to do business here.</li>
            <li>I love the HEM brand of incense.</li>
            <li>There are many types of incense I don&#x27;t really enjoy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my go to when I want something that isn&#x27;t really overwhelming, but that makes my home smell welcoming, clean and is a scent many seem to enjoy.</li>
            <li>it will easily become the dominant smell in the room, so use with care.</li>
            <li>Some are too strong or smoky.  </li>
            <li>Lovely, sweet, fragrance.</li>
            <li>Amber is simply the best of so many scents, particularly when HEM does it.</li>
            <li>Others may enjoy the strong scent.</li>
            <li>Many of my clients and friends enjoy the deep pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>if you are like me and enjoy a rich, strong scent that lingers on, this will not disappoint.</li>
            <li>Think of it this way, a light flowery scent with just a hint of citrus.  </li>
            <li>Nice soft scent.</li>
            <li>the price always seems to be right.</li>
            <li>It hits my nose pretty strong, not subtle at all, so isn&#x27;t well suited for my use with meditation.  </li>
            <li>Sweet, gently scented.</li>
            <li>Reminds me very much of the incense at Mass.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Like marigolds in a fall garden Amber is just an obvious choice that anyone can love.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it regularly.</li>
            <li>so I think it&#x27;s this particular manufacturer.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of high mass.</li>
            <li>Highly reccommended.</li>
            <li>and I have purchased more than a few boxes from this seller.</li>
            <li>I originally found this in a store in a small box for a higher price.</li>
            <li>this amber is intoxicating, both bitter and sweet at once.</li>
            <li>I use incense as aroma therapy and this is the first incense that has absolutely no aroma at all.  </li>
            <li>The Amber scent is ok but not great enough to buy again.</li>
            <li>I just purchased some Frankincense and Myrrh HEM incense from this seller not long ago.</li>
            <li>You can keep it fresh, and take a small box of 10 it with you, and give as gifts, and still have plenty left.</li>

            <li> Love it!  Great value and received quickly.  Excellent product and service!  Will order again (and again!)  Thanks!</li>
            <li> My partner and I love the fragance of this Amber incense. Great cleanser and iluminating vibe for every room. Excellent for angelic calling.</li>
            <li> this amber is intoxicating, both bitter and sweet at once. it will easily become the dominant smell in the room, so use with care. if you prefer a lighter scent, this is probably not for you. if you are like me and enjoy a rich, strong scent that lingers on, this will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Lovely, sweet, fragrance. Reminds me very much of the incense at Mass. I wasn&#x27;t sure what &amp;#34;amber&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;would smell like, but this is wonderful.</li>

            <li> The Amber scent is ok but not great enough to buy again. Had to burn several at a time to smell it in a room. Peace</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this incense before, and I love it. It&#x27;s one of the few amber incenses out there I do like. Long-burning and delicious.</li>

            <li> this incense has a mellow flavor with tangy under tones.  If you are looking for a sweet scent throughout, you may be disappointed.

            <li> Nice soft scent. hard to explain. Sweet, gently scented. I like this one. I will order again. Highly reccommended. Has a cake like scent. Try it. You&#x27;ll like it.</li>
