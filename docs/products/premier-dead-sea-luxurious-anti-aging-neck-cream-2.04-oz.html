            <li>I love this miracle cream.</li>
            <li>Your face looks &amp; feel more youthful.</li>
            <li>I was using Arbonne&#x27;s RE-9 Advanced Neck Cream before $85 and it didnt work as well as this one!</li>
            <li>Thankfully Amazon is wonderful enough to make returning easy.</li>
            <li>Nice because the skin absorbs it quickly.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for a great product!!!</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for a few weeks now and am thrilled at how great it makes my neck look!  </li>
            <li>I have tried other product lines but find Primier line to be the best.</li>
            <li>Do not see much changes, but all creams of this series pretty nice, strong smells and good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It has greatly reduced that dreaded turkey neck look leaving my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>SURE VIVO WILL BE MY GOOD OLD STAND-BY.  </li>
            <li>It may work but the smell is so strong and takes forever to wear off.</li>
            <li>The Premier Dead Sea Neck Cream is wonderful...</li>
            <li>All the Premier products are wonderful and Amazon offers them at great prices and ships them in just a few days!!!</li>
            <li>The original shipment came with what looked like an opened product.  </li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t think of their necks when hydrating their face, but it is important to do so and this product really works.</li>
            <li>The Premier Dead Sea Neck Cream is very good.  </li>
            <li>good product bit arrived open with some cream spilled out</li>
            <li>When I saw the items on line, I was thrilled and realized I could have made a grave error purchasing these products directly.</li>
            <li>This product is a true winner and I will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li>THINK THE VIVO INTENSE EYE CREAM WILL BE MY FAVORITE NECK CREAM</li>
            <li>In fact the box was full of cream that had leaked out.  </li>
            <li>I guess as I get older, I&#x27;m always looking for something that works better than ...</li>
            <li>Love how soft my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know if it will be effective because I can&#x27;t use it often enough</li>
            <li>I decided I am not having formaldehyde released and absorbed into my body and for that reason will not continue to use.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ordered the Anti-Aging Neck Cream.  </li>
            <li>Only way to make it better is to lower the price.</li>
            <li>Facial moisturizers $15 to $30 work much better.</li>
            <li>LIKE IT IS WORKING WHEN YOU FIRST PUT IT</li>
            <li>, I shouldn&#x27;t have switched in the first place.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m willing to cope with that in exchange for the results.</li>
            <li>First, the smell was overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I really think it works, and the price is definitely right.  </li>
            <li>Love these products and will continue to purchase as long as the price does not get out of hand.</li>
            <li>It comes in nice packaging, but when I opened the box the lid was NOT screwed on and cream was running down the sides of the jar.</li>
            <li>I still love the product too much to let that get in my way of purchasing it; especially at Amazon; because they offer it here at such a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>I certainly  would not purchase at mall for $200.00.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot of it either to get results.</li>
            <li>my neck is tighter and smoother already THANKS ..</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think that someone has opened the product and used it.</li>
            <li>I feel it really works well on my neck.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>this product is very pricey for a neck cream.</li>
            <li>It has so much fragrance</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The Dmdm Hydantoin really concerned me as it is a formaldehyde releaser.  </li>
            <li>I really like the feel of the cream on my skin</li>
            <li>Nice extra bonus for a miracle product such as this one.</li>
            <li>I have read others review about the extreme cost of this line in Nevada and women were thrilled to have found Dead Sea up and available on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>So twice before I&#x27;ve purchased this and had the foil not attached and a small cream leaking from the lid, but this is the first time that the lid wasn&#x27;t even screwed on all the way and a good portion of the cream is on the outside of the jar.</li>
            <li>I was so impressed with this cream, I ended up purchasing several of the Premier Dead Sea other products.  </li>
            <li>I love the whole line of Dead Sea Premier</li>
            <li>It is so highly perfumed</li>
            <li>I will continue to use n highly recommend it to all.</li>
            <li>Its good but not great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used select Dead Sea products for several years now and I love them for achieving the results they claim to achieve!</li>
            <li>I contacted them and a new shipment was sent to me.  </li>
            <li>I have stumbled upon a gold mine with this new line of product.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>but i was at least expecting a good lotion,skin still dry</li>
            <li>This is my first jar of this product and it&#x27;s too early to tell much about it other than that I like all the Premier products that I have tried.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years, the cream feels light on the face and makes my skin feel firm yet soft.  </li>
            <li>but it really smooths the neck area and gives it a much younger look.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft to the touch but firms the appearance.  </li>
            <li>were not all natural.  </li>
            <li>It does make your skin soft but has done nothing for firming the neck as yet.</li>
            <li>I, like many others, was approached at a mall and requested to try various Premier Dead Sea products.  </li>
            <li>and I kept the container, because it&#x27;s nice, thick, blue glass.</li>
            <li>I normally buy all natural products; but because I am really starting to see the effects of age</li>
            <li>I think the scent is lovely compared to some other skin products, Its a good makeup base.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the manufacturer of this line of cosmetics didn&#x27;t do a great job with the seals and a small amount seeps out around the corners.  </li>
            <li>Wow, a beauty product for aging that actually works!  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft after application and well into the next day.</li>
            <li>This neck cream is strong smelling and irritating to sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> My skin feels so soft after application and well into the next day.</li>
            <li> This neck cream is strong smelling and irritating to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Its a large jar and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will provide reviews on my other purchases in the near future.</li>
            <li> it is a little early to see long term use of any skincare line but</li>
            <li> The cover were not clear.  </li>
            <li> but now am taking a second look at alternative lines due to the cost.  </li>
            <li> Once at night and once in the morning), I noticed that there was a slight line starting to show.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews where other people said the same thing, and I have to admit both the other times I ordered this</li>
            <li> lovely fragrance, smoothes easily,and really does tighten the horrible bags hanging under the cheeks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it only on the neck, take it down a little farther and get rid of those bust stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I think I may try some of the other products based on my experience with this cream.</li>
            <li> i have used this and other products in this line for 2 years.</li>
            <li> Do like some of their other products.</li>
            <li> The cream is medium in thickness, not too heavy, but heavy enough to moisturize.</li>
            <li> The only negative side is the fragrance, it smells like bug spray.</li>
            <li> Another little trick that seems to help is to massage upwards.</li>
            <li> I have used the Premier Dead Sea products before.  </li>
            <li> Kudos to Premier Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> Used few months did nothing</li>
            <li> Then I decided to do research on the few ingredients that I knew</li>
            <li> Premier Dead Sea (Anti-Aging Cream)  is just that.....</li>
            <li> and it does improve the look and firm up my neck area.</li>
            <li> This bottle content was hard dried out, compared to previous purchases.  </li>
            <li> It lifts and firms that little saggy bit of skin just below the chin!  </li>
            <li> i am seeing very little improvement by using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I will ever know the benefits this cream may have because I can&#x27;t get past the smell.  </li>
            <li> Dead!  </li>
            <li> Too bad I had gone thru my 3rd bottle of kinerse by the time I found Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> And I have not been disappointed with any of them.  </li>
            <li> i have not been disappointed one time.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed...</li>

            <li> It works and works well and that is what matters.&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day and see good results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alizia Gur Schrager</li>
            <li> good product bit arrived open with some cream spilled out</li>
            <li> Wow, a beauty product for aging that actually works!  Love how soft my skin feels.  Wish there was an inexpensive bottle of this I could use all over my body!</li>
            <li> The Premier Dead Sea Neck Cream is very good.  The original shipment came with what looked like an opened product.  I contacted them and a new shipment was sent to me.  I will purchase their products in the future.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the quality of this product yet because the smell is overwhelming and obnoxious. It may work but the smell is so strong and takes forever to wear off. I don&#x27;t like to use it in the morning. It interferes with any fragrance I choose to wear that day. So I only use it at night. I don&#x27;t even know if it will be effective because I can&#x27;t use it often enough</li>
            <li> I have stumbled upon a gold mine with this new line of product.  Im a Sephora girl but now am taking a second look at alternative lines due to the cost.  I am a picky 50ish lady but also knows a good product when I stumbled on this.  The firming neck cream that I also purchased from this line is a WINNER!  Even tho it is a little early to see long term use of any skincare line but this stuff was like a neck lift!  Too bad I had gone thru my 3rd bottle of kinerse by the time I found Dead Sea. I have read others review about the extreme cost of this line in Nevada and women were thrilled to have found Dead Sea up and available on Amazon!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I had been trying to find a really good neck cream, when this one popped up on my search.  I am so glad I ordered it.  It has greatly reduced that dreaded turkey neck look leaving my skin soft and smooth.  You don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot of it either to get results. I was so impressed with this cream, I ended up purchasing several of the Premier Dead Sea other products.  And I have not been disappointed with any of them.  I will provide reviews on my other purchases in the near future.</li>
            <li> I have used the Premier Dead Sea products before.  This is the first time I have ordered the Anti-Aging Neck Cream.  I love this one too and will re-order.</li>
            <li> It looked like the product were opened before. The cover were not clear.  The picture and the product I got are different.</li>
            <li> Do not see much changes, but all creams of this series pretty nice, strong smells and good moisturizer. Try yourself.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews.  I really think it works, and the price is definitely right.  It is not going to make you look like you had surgery but it really smooths the neck area and gives it a much younger look. I think I may try some of the other products based on my experience with this cream.</li>
            <li> This is the best neck cream that I have used so far.  It did wonders on moisturizing; firming and smoothing my neck.  I Love It.  My only complaint is that the manufacturer of this line of cosmetics didn&#x27;t do a great job with the seals and a small amount seeps out around the corners.  I still love the product too much to let that get in my way of purchasing it; especially at Amazon; because they offer it here at such a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Makes my skin soft to the touch but firms the appearance.  I would buy this product again!!</li>
            <li> This is my first jar of this product and it&#x27;s too early to tell much about it other than that I like all the Premier products that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I, like many others, was approached at a mall and requested to try various Premier Dead Sea products.  I was thoroughly impressed with the results but could not comprehend the exorbitant price tag on the items and walked away.  When I saw the items on line, I was thrilled and realized I could have made a grave error purchasing these products directly. I was reluctant to review the product until I had used it for several weeks. The Premier Dead Sea Neck Cream is wonderful...lovely fragrance, smoothes easily,and really does tighten the horrible bags hanging under the cheeks. Don&#x27;t use it only on the neck, take it down a little farther and get rid of those bust stretch marks. Another little trick that seems to help is to massage upwards. This product is a true winner and I will continue to purchase it. Kudos to Premier Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE FEEL OF THIS CREAM, CAN&#x27;T SAY IT REDUCES TURKEY NECK BUT MY NECK IS DEFINITELY SOFTER</li>
            <li> It is just OK...nothing I would buy again</li>
            <li> i have used this and other products in this line for 2 years. i have not been disappointed one time. just buy it here!!!and save over 1/2 the price at the boths in the mall!!!</li>
            <li> Been using this for a year with good results. Feels good when I apply it. Only way to make it better is to lower the price.</li>
            <li> Great - Wonderful - This product is absolutely wonderful.  It tightens your skin and makes you look so much younger.  You get rid of that \\&quot;Turkey Neck!!!!\\&quot;  All the Premier products are wonderful and Amazon offers them at great prices and ships them in just a few days!!!</li>
            <li> I bought the neck cream three weeks ago and and started using it , it works so GOOD i love it my neck is tighter and smoother already THANKS ..</li>
            <li> Work very good. Still testing.</li>
            <li> I have used it as instructed and do not see a difference. It wonderful as a moistureizer. Don&#x27;t know if I would purchase again. I certainly  would not purchase at mall for $200.00.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product many times on Amazon.  Love these products and will continue to purchase as long as the price does not get out of hand.</li>
            <li> Really smells wonderful and leaves skin feeling silky.  Its a large jar and a little goes a long way. I use it daily.</li>
            <li> It was alot cheaper here then mall, so figured what the heck.Used few months did nothing but i was at least expecting a good lotion,skin still dry</li>
            <li> Exelent product,amazing results ,&lt;br /&gt;Amazon helps me find the best prices too ,I use many of their products!</li>
            <li> This neck cream is strong smelling and irritating to sensitive skin. Over rated. Facial moisturizers $15 to $30 work much better.</li>
            <li> This bottle content was hard dried out, compared to previous purchases.  Perhaps it was beyond the suggested sale date (not printed on bottle)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife as a refill because she told me that it actually works. She will continue to use this until it does not. C6</li>
            <li> I can not say enough positives about this product!  It lifts and firms that little saggy bit of skin just below the chin!  I use it every day.  I have tried other product lines but find Primier line to be the best.</li>
            <li> I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY LASTING IMPROVEMENT.  LOOKS LIKE IT IS WORKING WHEN YOU FIRST PUT IT ON SOMETIMES BUT ONCE YOU CLEANSE YOUR FACE OR AFTER THE DAY WEARS ON THE WRINKLES ARE BACK.  THINK THE VIVO INTENSE EYE CREAM WILL BE MY FAVORITE NECK CREAM IT IS WONDERFUL FOR THIS PURPOSE. SURE VIVO WILL BE MY GOOD OLD STAND-BY.  Changed my mind this is amazing I&#x27;m glad I continued to use it.  I always give a product a chance and boy am I glad I did this.  Bravo</li>
            <li> This neck cream made no difference whatsoever. I went back to Neutrogena, I shouldn&#x27;t have switched in the first place. I guess as I get older, I&#x27;m always looking for something that works better than ... Anyway, if you want to see the slightest difference on your neck, don&#x27;t try this. I started using the rest of the lotion on my arms and I kept the container, because it&#x27;s nice, thick, blue glass.</li>
            <li> As time goes on the years show on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any worsening, but I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement.&lt;br /&gt;The products smells really nice.</li>
            <li> I actually would give this product 5 stars if it was properly packaged. This is the third time I&#x27;ve purchased this cream and it&#x27;s the last. It comes in nice packaging, but when I opened the box the lid was NOT screwed on and cream was running down the sides of the jar. Yes, that&#x27;s right--$40 cream leaking all over the place! I&#x27;m returning. I&#x27;ve read other reviews where other people said the same thing, and I have to admit both the other times I ordered this it was opened, but I kept it. When you open the silver lid, there is a foil seal that has never been sealed when I&#x27;ve received the product. I&#x27;m assuming the seal cannot attach to the blue glass jar properly because of the cream. I really don&#x27;t think that someone has opened the product and used it. So twice before I&#x27;ve purchased this and had the foil not attached and a small cream leaking from the lid, but this is the first time that the lid wasn&#x27;t even screwed on all the way and a good portion of the cream is on the outside of the jar. NOT ACCEPTABLE! Not for any product, but especially not a $40 2 oz jar of cream. It came today and I&#x27;m returning it tomorrow. Thankfully Amazon is wonderful enough to make returning easy. Hope I don&#x27;t have to pay to ship it back.</li>
            <li> I feel it really works well on my neck.  A nice luxurious cream and does help in lifting/firming the skin under the neck area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I will ever know the benefits this cream may have because I can&#x27;t get past the smell.  It is so highly perfumed I can&#x27;t wear it as it fights with my daily fragrance.  I also received a jar that appeared to be open.  In fact the box was full of cream that had leaked out.  I did not bother to contact the seller.  Perhaps I should have and may do so.</li>
            <li> It really works. I&#x27;ve even had spots literally peel off. I will continue to use n highly recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Its good but not great</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years, the cream feels light on the face and makes my skin feel firm yet soft.  Still a satisfied customer .</li>
            <li> It came open like it was used no time to return a item that I need time is money! Product is good but would of been nice to get a full bottle!</li>
            <li> Been using the cream as directions indicate have not seen any changes in my neck skin area or improvements. Does smell great.</li>
            <li> Most people don&#x27;t think of their necks when hydrating their face, but it is important to do so and this product really works.</li>
            <li> Nice because the skin absorbs it quickly.</li>
            <li> this product is very pricey for a neck cream. i am seeing very little improvement by using it. i wold try L&#x27;oreal on my next purchase</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this works because I can&#x27;t use it.  It has so much fragrance, I got an instant migraine.</li>
            <li> es muy bueno, deja la piel sedosa y a la vez  con firmeza, para pieles delicadas y otras, es escelente</li>
            <li> My neck looks so much better.  I am having friends ask me if I have had a fac lift!  Wow!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years. It is terrific.</li>
            <li> I love this miracle cream. It makes your wrinkles feel &amp; look like they are gone. Your face looks &amp; feel more youthful. Thanks so much for a great product!!!</li>
            <li> I saw a big change in the elasticity and firmness of my neck! I use it on my chest too and my acne that I had disappeared. Nice extra bonus for a miracle product such as this one. I love the whole line of Dead Sea Premier it is the only product line that actually does what it says! The only negative side is the fragrance, it smells like bug spray. But I&#x27;m willing to cope with that in exchange for the results. The cream is medium in thickness, not too heavy, but heavy enough to moisturize. My skin feels so soft after application and well into the next day. I highly recommend it! I was using Arbonne&#x27;s RE-9 Advanced Neck Cream before $85 and it didnt work as well as this one!</li>
            <li> The cream is very smooth on skin and smells good.  However, after using it for almost a month, I have not seen any changes on the neck area.  I am going to finish the cream left but do not expect any improvement.</li>
            <li> This does nothing for your neck.  I have been using it for 5 weeks now and my neck look worsel!</li>
            <li> I had these extremely obvious horizontal lines on my neck that looks as if someone had cut off my head and reattached in two lines (the lines were very red and looked like they had \\&quot;stiches\\&quot; scars.  I have no idea what had happened).  I have been using this cream for a few weeks now and am thrilled at how great it makes my neck look!  The only reason I did not give it it five stars in that last night (I put it on twice a day.  Once at night and once in the morning), I noticed that there was a slight line starting to show.  I did not see it today, and my neck feels perfectly smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would STRONGLY suggest this cream!</li>
            <li> because I used only once.  To explain...I normally buy all natural products; but because I am really starting to see the effects of age, I decided to give it a try.  First, the smell was overpowering.  Then I decided to do research on the few ingredients that I knew were not all natural.  The Dmdm Hydantoin really concerned me as it is a formaldehyde releaser.  I decided I am not having formaldehyde released and absorbed into my body and for that reason will not continue to use.</li>
            <li> It does make your skin soft but has done nothing for firming the neck as yet. Probably won&#x27;t buy again. Do like some of their other products.</li>
            <li> doens&#x27;t work as well as terproline... I was disappointed...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used select Dead Sea products for several years now and I love them for achieving the results they claim to achieve!</li>
            <li> Very good neck cream.</li>
            <li> Premier Dead Sea (Anti-Aging Cream)  is just that.....Dead!  It does not seem to have any effect on the skin.  It smells good and goes on smooth but that is just about it.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller that there was a mistake in my order which they corrected immediately.  I really like the feel of the cream on my skin and it does improve the look and firm up my neck area. I think the scent is lovely compared to some other skin products, Its a good makeup base. Overall I am please I purchased this and would trust the seller for future orders.</li>
