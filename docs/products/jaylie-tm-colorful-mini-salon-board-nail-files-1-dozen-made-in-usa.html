    <ol>
            <li> Really great product..small enough to carry around.</li>
            <li> I got 2 of each variety, which I loved. There were more plain colors than patterned, but who cares-I&#x27;m filing my nails not wearing the things around! They&#x27;re small enough that they fit into my clutch purse and I can stash them around anywhere for emergency uses!</li>
            <li> Always looking for an emery board! These make it so easy to put in every bag I use. Very durable.</li>
            <li> Not the best nail file I&#x27;ve used but it does the trick. I purchased these to include in shower favors so quality doesn&#x27;t need to be fantastic. I would buy again to fulfill the same purpose.</li>
            <li> When they say mini - they are really tiny.  The size of a thumb. Photo is deceiving and $6.00 for this is way too much!</li>
            <li> I really like the mini board files (3.5&amp;#34; x .5&amp;#34;) vs. the extended length. I have short fingers so this is much more comfortable &amp; easier to manage/use. I also like the amount that I received. I shared them with my daughter &amp; 3 granddaughters &amp; they love &#x27;em.&lt;br /&gt;Price is nice as well.</li>
            <li> Gerat product, great service!!</li>
            <li> These were great. We put them along with Burt&#x27;s Bee lip balm and J cat Beauty Eternal Shine Lip Gloss in small boxes as baby shower gift for the attendees. We did not expect them to be so great. Not only were they beautiful different colors they actually have a substantial surface for filing. They work great.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for me</li>
            <li> These are so adorable! I am a Consultant for a nail wrap company and these are absolutely perfect for prizes for customers and hostesses! I love that I got 2 of each color, floral, Pink, blue, black, white &amp; brown. I can&#x27;t wait to put one in my next prize pack!!!!</li>
            <li> Not really fun colors. The photo has polka dot files, but I didn&#x27;t receive any. All were solid colors. I bought these for part of a prize package that I was assembling for a wedding shower. Oh well,.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 packs of these nail files to go with favors for a wedding shower. There were no polka-dot files, and I was somewhat disappointed with the colors I was given. The files were of fine quality, and I ended up keeping them, but I think it is misleading that that they are advertised as &amp;#34;colorful&amp;#34; when there are only 4 colors and no fun designs on any of them. Oh well, I guess that&#x27;s what I get for ordering them at he last minute.</li>
            <li> Prefect fit to my mini manicure set</li>
            <li> These are great for the gift bags I got them for also for purse, auto, night stand. I like the various grit and colors. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> great files - good size for purse, pocket, etc.</li>
            <li> according to the Advirtised picture they show bright colors and a cute designs ! When I recd my nail files they were solid color nail files mostly brown and blacks! Not pleased at all! I was told that they randomly select the designs and no particular design or color is guaranteed! I did not read any where as it states that! Not very good customer satisfaction !</li>
            <li> Item was as described.</li>
            <li> They were perfect for what I needed. There were a bunch of different colors but not designs. they were solid colors mostly but that was fine with me</li>
            <li> I love &amp;#34;Made in USA&amp;#34;. Great quality as expected. Price is also cheap too.</li>
            <li> love the purse/travel size!</li>
            <li> Good product--a bit smaller than I anticipated, but a good buy</li>
            <li> They are just what I needed for my favors for a baby shower thank you gift.</li>
            <li> These worked great... Perfect for the manicure bags we made for my daughters birthday! Fun colors and great price!</li>
            <li> These are perfect files for every situation. There are several different textures and the smaller size allows them to fit anywhere at home or in a purse. They last long even after many uses. I would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Thought these were bigger than what was received. These things are pretty tiny. I guess I should have read the description more carefully. No big deal there just nail files but I was expecting a regular size file not a mini version.</li>
