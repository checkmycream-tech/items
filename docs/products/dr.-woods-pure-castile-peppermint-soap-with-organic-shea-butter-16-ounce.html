            <li>I love the tingly sensation that it gives me and the crisp, clean feel that I have after use.</li>
            <li>but I do use this to clean around the house and clothes.  </li>
            <li>but I felt really clean after I used it.</li>
            <li>Meh, it&#x27;ll get you clean</li>

            <li>Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t enjoy this soap.</li>
            <li>I love the product but had to return because the peppermint oil in the soap burned my 6 year old nephew.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work worth a</li>
            <li>so I still need to use a shower gel with it which is actually costing me more money.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as the non organic soaps</li>
            <li>I really like the peppermint smell and the tingle,</li>
            <li>This works very well if I keep him bathed.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t sud as much and peppermint</li>
            <li>It is also very relaxing.</li>
            <li>In addition it doesn&#x27;t lather up very well</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s all natural oils and organic!</li>
            <li>Finally a body wash the whole family loves!</li>
            <li>This works so well as a facial cleanser combined with pure cocunut oil as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin soft too.</li>
            <li>It has the fresh mint feel, but doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like other castiles because it has the shea butter.</li>

            <li> not sure why it smells like this,</li>
            <li> I got hooked on the Dr. Bonner&#x27;s brand, I usually get from Target.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> No hint of peppermint.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, great scent. Love it and will purchase again and again. No harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> Dr. Woods is freaking fantastic.  It does everything Dr. Bronner&#x27;s magic soap does but for a fraction of the price and with the added bonus of shea butter.  However, if you order from Cosmetic Solutions, you should be aware that the great deal you think you are getting with a four-pack of 32 oz. bottles, is not real.  You will get only one 32 ounce bottle.  However, $8 for one giant bottle is still a killer price.</li>
            <li> I use this product as an body wash including hair and face.  It&#x27;s gentle and makes my skin feel soft and refreshed.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. It is nice on my skin and washes off easily.  I used the tea tree as well. I keep some at my children&#x27;s homes as well n</li>
            <li> Sorry can not stand the scent and I love Peppermint not sure why it smells like this, but I do use this to clean around the house and clothes.  As in using this for my skin and face I will pass.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This soap is \\&quot;must have\\&quot; for Florida summers.  And with the shea butter added, it&#x27;s just a bonus. Leaves you and your shower smelling good.</li>
            <li> I love it! It works for everything from body soap to cleaning soap to shampoo! It&#x27;s all natural oils and organic! You can not beat the price for this type of quality and healthy ingredients. I will buy this product again or another flavor again! Thank you for the quick shipping too!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love everything about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years and I love it!</li>
            <li> My favorite soap so far!!!</li>
            <li> Not as strong as the Dr.Bonners version. Dosent have that peppermint soap kick to it. I rather buy the Dr. Bonners version.</li>
            <li> YUMMY!! VERY POTENT!! AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> I received the product within 2 days after I&#x27;d ordered it. It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as the non organic soaps but I felt really clean after I used it. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it.</li>
            <li> This works so well as a facial cleanser combined with pure cocunut oil as a moisturizer. Helped reduce acne breakouts. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Works well. Just wish it smell a little more like peppermint</li>
            <li> This is a great body wash and shampoo that gives you a light minty refreshing energy. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Meh, it&#x27;ll get you clean but I didn&#x27;t like the smell. I bought it because it is a few dollars less than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s but I really didn&#x27;t enjoy this soap.</li>
            <li> This is our second time purchasing. It has the fresh mint feel, but doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like other castiles because it has the shea butter. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this to make homemade dog shampoo. But was rather disappointed that it didn&#x27;t suds very well, and seemed to leave a bit of residue which made the dog feel a little sticky. And left absolutely no fragrance of peppermint afterwards.</li>
            <li> I really like the peppermint smell and the tingle, cool feeling that I get when I use this as a bodywash. It makes your skin soft too.</li>
            <li> it smells so minty. i use it to wash my hair and body. this makes them both feel clean and fresh</li>
            <li> Excellent soap for the body and my clothes. Didn&#x27;t know how great it works in the washing machine.</li>
            <li> I got this to shampoo my dog (chiweenie) because of constant scatching, I suspect fleas. This works very well if I keep him bathed. Fleas hate the pepermint &amp; Copper is happy.</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful!  Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin as some other peppermint soaps are known to do. The price is not bad too!</li>
            <li> Finally a body wash the whole family loves! The soap is gentle, the peppermint smell is refreshing, the Shea butter is great for dry skin, and it leaves your skin tingly!</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Quick shipping.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Dr. Bonners. Doesn&#x27;t sud as much and peppermint smell is a little weak.</li>
            <li> I love the product but had to return because the peppermint oil in the soap burned my 6 year old nephew. Great for adults, hand soap, cleaner, etc.</li>
            <li> This soap is exceptional.  I love the tingly sensation that it gives me and the crisp, clean feel that I have after use.</li>
            <li> A completely refreshing soap, leaves the skin feeling tingly and the person feeling rejuvenated. Love the smell. Shea butter is a good addtion as it helps protect the skin from the drying effect of soap.</li>
            <li> I love it this stuff works great. I never had a product that makes me feel so clean. It smells great and it feels wonderful. I&#x27;ve used it as shampoo, facial wash and body wash. Definitely a great investment.</li>
            <li> Came quickly. Smells like peppermint love the tingle it leaves in the shower</li>
            <li> This product is great.</li>
            <li> I love the clean feeling without the dryness.It is also very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I use this soap to make my own home cleaning products. I mix it with baking soda to make a paste for cleaning my bath tub, and takes a lot of scrubbing, but it does the job. None of the other things I&#x27;ve tried-including Tilex, Lysol, Windex and bleach-have worked. I dilute it with water and add some essential oils to make a cleaner for my kitchen countertops. I do wish the scent was a little stronger ( like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s) because I love the smell of peppermint. Still, this is a great all-purpose, eco-friendly cleaning product</li>
            <li> The products smells wonderfully. However I purchased it to help with itchy skin and it has not helped that at all. In addition it doesn&#x27;t lather up very well so I still need to use a shower gel with it which is actually costing me more money.</li>
            <li> I just love this organic product, it cleans wonderfully and is a great spa experience</li>
            <li> Worst purchase ive ever had it doesn&#x27;t work for nothing</li>
            <li> Great products. Makes you feel clean.</li>
            <li> I got hooked on the Dr. Bonner&#x27;s brand, I usually get from Target. But the one I like is almost always sold out. I decided to do some research online to see if I could find the brand I like on line. While doing so, I came across this brand and decided to give it a try. Al thought I still like the Dr. Bronner brand, I like this one as well. I have allergies,asthma, and have to take medication. Because of this my skin is extra dry, so I have to be really careful about what I use on my skin. This product worked great, and did not irritate my skin at all. I plan to repurchase</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work worth a s***</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin moist and eczema at bay.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry and tight like Dr. Bronners peppermint soap. And its cheaper than Dr. Bronners! I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product. Long lasting. Refreshing smell. Use as body wash and shampoo if desired.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and it&#x27;s multiple uses.</li>
            <li> Very good im getting another one</li>
