    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The 111 Oster Clipper is excellent build quality.</li>
            <li>but it still does a great job at its intended purpose.</li>
            <li>and it still works great</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oster is great.</li>
            <li>Looks to me like they don&#x27;t do a good job of editing their product listings.</li>
            <li>I must admit that at first I was impressed.</li>
            <li>and I love the results!</li>
            <li>I thought that it was too good to be true</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never done more than oil the blades once in a while.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the clipper.  </li>
            <li>They were probably thinking that they had more to gain than lose by what they were doing.    </li>
            <li>Its well engineered and very easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li>I could not wait to get my clippers because I&#x27;d been working without them for a while (couple of weeks a long time when you were used to good clippers)... when they work good</li>
            <li>Overall: best set of clippers I have ever used, worth the price</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use</li>
            <li>choice for quality and easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I must admit, it is not as quick as the Oster 76 or has as many attachments</li>
            <li>I would recommend this item to anyone who is looking to buy a good professional hair clipper!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and maintain</li>
            <li>two stars because the ordering was easy and delivery was fairly quick for free</li>
            <li>, Blades come off quickly and easily       </li>
            <li>(Edited Nov 9, 2012 - below you&#x27;ll find my original review rated with 5-stars.</li>
            <li>For my birthday my son purchased the attachment combs, I am excited to try those with the clippers.</li>
            <li>I bought the Oster Professional Turbo 111 hair clipper about 2 years ago and I am very pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to stop and clean them during a haircut.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite model and brand of clippers!</li>
            <li>Overall a wise purchase.</li>
            <li>If you are used to the cheap mini clippers this is going to feel pretty hefty in your hand, but it never snags and I shave my head with it twice a week with no problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally bought it at the advertised price, then they want to force me to re-order at a much higher price??  </li>
            <li>Cons:  Price, costs as much as 5 of the cheap clippers       </li>
            <li>is i lil noisy and doesn&#x27;t seem to run as fast and smooth.</li>
            <li>Many blades and combs available for your specific need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Heavy, but nicely balanced and comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>The blades are solid and super easy to change.</li>
            <li>its still working well  cuts good  only wish it was a little  stronger  but satisfied</li>
            <li>I will use the 111 as a back up, and hope the 76 is a better clipper.</li>
            <li>the first pair I ever owned lasted about 10 years.</li>
            <li>merchandise.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to keep my ears open for a better clipper....</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, (and I&#x27;m trying to stay positive but my experience on Amazon is going to hell in a handbasket fast)</li>
            <li>Clipper uses a real electric motor, bearings, gears.</li>
            <li>they work really well.</li>
            <li>it must have become a Japanese product or some overseas quickly manufactured</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend this Clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy</li>
            <li>But unfortunately my new clippers broke two months ago for no reason.</li>
            <li>so I think I can part with $120 for a new one.</li>
            <li>Once you get used to the size, weight and strength compare to the cheap ones - you&#x27;ll never look back or regret the extra $$.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cut hair regularly and it has never failed me.</li>
            <li>I have ordered a new gear to replace the old, but have also ordered a Oster 76.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m looking to buy a new one rather than be left with half a buzzed haircut if they suddenly stop working - probably 3 hours before my own wedding or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would imagine that if you can get enough people to order an item and boost your bank account sufficiently at a certain time, you could collect a substantial amount of interest, and then return the customers&#x27; money.  </li>
            <li>And the motor slowed to a crawl before ceasing completely.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Oster Professional Turbo 111 clippers on Jan 26,2010 for $28.49 plus $10.26 shipping &amp; handling.  </li>
            <li>Obviously that was absolutely dishonesty because I am on Amazon today and guess what --- the item is posted again and selling for $112.00.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional hair cutter who has been using this brand of clippers for twenty year on my clients.</li>
            <li>I got this clipper just over a year ago to replace the old Oster clipper</li>
            <li>I really like the way this buzzer powers through hair with only one or two passes.</li>
            <li>All supplies - oil, blade, etc. come complete in box new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I figured I would write a review of the actual product rather than a particular seller.  </li>
            <li>Mid hair cut the motor started to chatter/buzz extremely loudly then started smelling like burning.</li>
            <li>I chose the 111 because I could use the same heads that I had for my old reliable.</li>
            <li>They are bigger than they look in the pic, they are professional grade.</li>
            <li>And as I searched Amazon for the clippers, I noticed the Turbo 111 had pretty rough reviews and felt it definitely deserved another 5 star out there.</li>
            <li>Beauty 4 Less should face legal action.  </li>
            <li>It has cut a LOT of hair of all different types, from black to blonde,from wooly to fine, and with a little lubrication now and then, keeps on going.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I imagine that it is good for their financial woes if they can get numerous folks ordering from their business at \\&quot;unbelievable\\&quot; prices and with abrupt notice they tell you you will be refunded or send the wrong item.  </li>
            <li>The unit is not to heavy, but large enough to cut your hairs.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The unit is not to heavy, but large enough to cut your hairs.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, my last set of Wahl clippers</li>
            <li> so we will see how long it lasts, it feels well made.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional hair dresser but have been cutting my family&#x27;s hair for 20 years or more.</li>
            <li> One of the things I really like is how well they perform on thick hair.</li>
            <li> I noticed that all the other reviewers are not actually reviewing the product and instead are reviewing one particular seller&#x27;s possibly shady business practices.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a few other reviews on this same and I was amazed at the similarity shown, even though these ads had been dated by 6 to 7 months prior to my own disappointment.  </li>
            <li> A few days later, the price was upped to $28 and change for the same model.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the stock blade is very thick and doesn&#x27;t shave the neck area closely, might look into a thinner blade, until then I will just use a razor to do clean up around the neckline.</li>
            <li> So apparently some of the bad reviews are justified and quality has degraded for Oster...who knows.</li>
            <li> The clippers are heavier than any pair I have ever used before and they are slightly awkward if you are trying to cut your own hair, but this is a small price to pay for the quality of the hair cut.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this clipper because I am in the military and cut my hair once a week</li>
            <li> Using the store bought clippers took at least twice as long for the same cut.</li>
            <li> When I did, they told me that \\&quot;due to the high demand for this item, they had exhausted their supply, and was refunding my payment in full.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with this clipper.</li>
            <li> Then on Jan 29, 2010, I received an email from Amazon telling me that I needed to go to the link for the seller (Beauty 4 Less).  </li>
            <li> so it leads to less skin irritation.    </li>
            <li> theae are becoming crap ...</li>
            <li> and I wanted a heavy duty clipper that wouldn&#x27;t get snagged or give me an uneven cut.  </li>
            <li> Heavy duty, almost never got snagged or pulled hair       </li>
            <li> A few weeks ago they were offering the Turbo 111 for $20 or so.</li>
            <li> Subtle cheap differences too bad.</li>
            <li> The clipper preformed to expectations, but then - in the middle of a haircut(with out warning)the plastic drive gear that transfers power to the head stripped out rendering the clipper useless.</li>
            <li> Does not come with a set of guide combs have to purchase seperately, only comes with one blade which cuts to about 1/8th of an inch        Heavy and slightly awkward    </li>
            <li> this pair could hardly turn on (a catch in the switch...still)</li>
            <li> You can imagine the disappointment when I received my shipment in the mail days later</li>
            <li> Some serious, grown up clippers.</li>
            <li> Sounds like a nasty scams that Amazon needs to be aware of and pull the plug.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the Turbo 111.</li>
            <li> FALSE ADVERTISING!</li>
            <li> Of course, I am very disappointed in what Amazon or Beauty 4 Less has done.</li>

            <li> (Edited Nov 9, 2012 - below you&#x27;ll find my original review rated with 5-stars. But unfortunately my new clippers broke two months ago for no reason. Mid hair cut the motor started to chatter/buzz extremely loudly then started smelling like burning. I shut it off, unplugged it. Retried it. And the motor slowed to a crawl before ceasing completely. So apparently some of the bad reviews are justified and quality has degraded for Oster...who knows. Either way I&#x27;m downgrading my rating to 2-stars and don&#x27;t plan to spend another $120 on this item.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Original review Feb 2012) I bought my Oster Turbo 111 in July 2003 and have used it to cut my hair every 4-6 days since the day it was delivered and it still works without ANY issue. I&#x27;ve bought several blade sizes and switch them in/out during every use and I&#x27;ve never done more than oil the blades once in a while. I have never used the motor grease/lubricant. After dropping the clippers countless times over the years, the case has finally cracked at the bottom and the cord is exposed and unsecure...so I&#x27;m looking to buy a new one rather than be left with half a buzzed haircut if they suddenly stop working - probably 3 hours before my own wedding or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about 8.5 years of saving myself a $12 SuperCut buzz every 6 days...and if I did my math right that&#x27;s about $6,205...so I think I can part with $120 for a new one. And as I searched Amazon for the clippers, I noticed the Turbo 111 had pretty rough reviews and felt it definitely deserved another 5 star out there. There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with this clipper. Once you get used to the size, weight and strength compare to the cheap ones - you&#x27;ll never look back or regret the extra $$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it...</li>
            <li> its still working well  cuts good  only wish it was a little  stronger  but satisfied</li>
            <li> I noticed a few other reviews on this same and I was amazed at the similarity shown, even though these ads had been dated by 6 to 7 months prior to my own disappointment.  Beauty 4 Less should face legal action.  I imagine that it is good for their financial woes if they can get numerous folks ordering from their business at \\&quot;unbelievable\\&quot; prices and with abrupt notice they tell you you will be refunded or send the wrong item.  It happened to me during the month of January 2010.  I ordered the Oster Professional Turbo 111 clippers on Jan 26,2010 for $28.49 plus $10.26 shipping &amp; handling.  The total was $38.75.  They gave me a delivery date between 1 and 4 Feb 10.  Then on Jan 29, 2010, I received an email from Amazon telling me that I needed to go to the link for the seller (Beauty 4 Less).  When I did, they told me that \\&quot;due to the high demand for this item, they had exhausted their supply, and was refunding my payment in full.\\&quot;  Obviously that was absolutely dishonesty because I am on Amazon today and guess what --- the item is posted again and selling for $112.00.  I would imagine that if you can get enough people to order an item and boost your bank account sufficiently at a certain time, you could collect a substantial amount of interest, and then return the customers&#x27; money.  Sounds like a nasty scams that Amazon needs to be aware of and pull the plug.  Maybe a law suit in just around the corner for these pirates.</li>
            <li> I purchased these clippers and my transaction went thru with no problems and I got an order confirmatin #.  Then, later in the day my order was mysteriously CANCELED.  No reason was given; I was sent an email telling me to re-order the product if I still wanted it.  I originally bought it at the advertised price, then they want to force me to re-order at a much higher price??  Of course I did NOT repurchase them--I don&#x27;t know if it was the seller (Beauty 4 You or Amazon), but I won&#x27;t bother ordering from them again.  FALSE ADVERTISING!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional hair cutter who has been using this brand of clippers for twenty year on my clients. This is by far my favorite model and brand of clippers!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the Turbo 111.</li>
            <li> I noticed that all the other reviewers are not actually reviewing the product and instead are reviewing one particular seller&#x27;s possibly shady business practices.  So I figured I would write a review of the actual product rather than a particular seller.  I purchased this clipper because I am in the military and cut my hair once a week and I wanted a heavy duty clipper that wouldn&#x27;t get snagged or give me an uneven cut.  The clippers are heavier than any pair I have ever used before and they are slightly awkward if you are trying to cut your own hair, but this is a small price to pay for the quality of the hair cut.  It only takes me about ten minutes and I don&#x27;t have to run over the same area several times so it leads to less skin irritation.    Pros:  Heavy duty, almost never got snagged or pulled hair       Easy to clean and maintain, Blades come off quickly and easily       Long lasting, my last set of Wahl clippers the motor burnt out in 6 months, but this one has already lasted over a year.         Cons:  Price, costs as much as 5 of the cheap clippers       Does not come with a set of guide combs have to purchase seperately, only comes with one blade which cuts to about 1/8th of an inch        Heavy and slightly awkward    Overall: best set of clippers I have ever used, worth the price</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the clipper.  I have been using Oster  clippers for years.</li>
            <li> I got this clipper just over a year ago to replace the old Oster clipper I started Barber School with back in 1967. I chose the 111 because I could use the same heads that I had for my old reliable. I must admit that at first I was impressed. The clipper preformed to expectations, but then - in the middle of a haircut(with out warning)the plastic drive gear that transfers power to the head stripped out rendering the clipper useless. I have ordered a new gear to replace the old, but have also ordered a Oster 76. I will use the 111 as a back up, and hope the 76 is a better clipper. I think the 111 may work well for lighter use, but to use the term \\&quot;professional,\\&quot; may be misleading.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for the same model that broke...Not the same quality probably from China.  Subtle cheap differences too bad.</li>
            <li> Some serious, grown up clippers. Buy these and you will have them in your life forever. Its well engineered and very easy to clean and use. They are bigger than they look in the pic, they are professional grade. The blades are solid and super easy to change.</li>
            <li> I have had this clippers for over 5yrs and i have no complaints. It is durable and reliable. I cut hair regularly and it has never failed me. I must admit, it is not as quick as the Oster 76 or has as many attachments but it still does a great job at its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> Guess what??? A few weeks ago they were offering the Turbo 111 for $20 or so. With shipping included, it cost me $29 and change. I thought that it was too good to be true but the price was listed for the clipper and not anything else. Who knows what their reasons were but I ordered the clipper for the price that was advertised.    A few days later, the price was upped to $28 and change for the same model. You can imagine the disappointment when I received my shipment in the mail days later and it was for the \\&quot;000\\&quot; clipper blade for the Turbo 111. I didn&#x27;t order the clipper blade and the item description on the bill of lading was showing the Turbo 111. I have a feeling that it was mainly a marketing ploy by Beauty 4 Less to move a bunch of clipper blades to unsuspecting people. They were probably thinking that they had more to gain than lose by what they were doing.    Of course, I am very disappointed in what Amazon or Beauty 4 Less has done. Their credibility has been lowered in my opinion of them. They are supposed to be sending me the information to mail the blades back and get a refund. Who knows what&#x27;s going to happen next. Looks to me like they don&#x27;t do a good job of editing their product listings.</li>
            <li> I purchased this clipper after having gone through 5 lower priced store bought models in the last 7 years. I am not a professional hair dresser but have been cutting my family&#x27;s hair for 20 years or more. I really like the way this buzzer powers through hair with only one or two passes. Using the store bought clippers took at least twice as long for the same cut. One of the things I really like is how well they perform on thick hair. I didn&#x27;t have to stop and clean them during a haircut. I have only owned it one month so we will see how long it lasts, it feels well made. Heavy, but nicely balanced and comfortable in my hand. My only complaint is that the stock blade is very thick and doesn&#x27;t shave the neck area closely, might look into a thinner blade, until then I will just use a razor to do clean up around the neckline. For my birthday my son purchased the attachment combs, I am excited to try those with the clippers. Overall a wise purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought the Oster Professional Turbo 111 hair clipper about 2 years ago and I am very pleased with this purchase.  It is so easy to use and it still works great and I love the results! I would recommend this item to anyone who is looking to buy a good professional hair clipper!</li>
            <li> The 111 Oster Clipper is excellent build quality. It&#x27;s the same one I had for 25 years. The unit is not to heavy, but large enough to cut your hairs. Many blades and combs available for your specific need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Clipper uses a real electric motor, bearings, gears. It will need periodic cleaning and lube. All supplies - oil, blade, etc. come complete in box new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best choice for quality and easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I will highly recommend this Clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy</li>
            <li> I could not wait to get my clippers because I&#x27;d been working without them for a while (couple of weeks a long time when you were used to good clippers)... when they work good they work really well. HOWEVER, (and I&#x27;m trying to stay positive but my experience on Amazon is going to hell in a handbasket fast)...anyway the last two pairs have not lasted this pair could hardly turn on (a catch in the switch...still) is i lil noisy and doesn&#x27;t seem to run as fast and smooth. the last pair I bought only lasted about MAYBE 2 years... the first pair I ever owned lasted about 10 years. it must have become a Japanese product or some overseas quickly manufactured merchandise.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to keep my ears open for a better clipper....theae are becoming crap ...IMO&lt;br /&gt;Gave two stars because the ordering was easy and delivery was fairly quick for free</li>
            <li> I bought my 111 in 1996 and it is still going. It has cut a LOT of hair of all different types, from black to blonde,from wooly to fine, and with a little lubrication now and then, keeps on going.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it. If you are used to the cheap mini clippers this is going to feel pretty hefty in your hand, but it never snags and I shave my head with it twice a week with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;Oster is great.</li>
