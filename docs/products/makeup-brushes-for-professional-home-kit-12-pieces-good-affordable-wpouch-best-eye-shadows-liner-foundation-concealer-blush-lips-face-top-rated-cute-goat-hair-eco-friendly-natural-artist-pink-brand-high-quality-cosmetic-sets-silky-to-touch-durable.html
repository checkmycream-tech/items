            <li>They came in a stylish brush clutch case that will come in handy when I am traveling and will protect them from getting damaged.</li>
            <li>These professional brushes are excellent - I am really glad I bought them.  </li>
            <li>The quality is wonderful, the price was very affordable, and the brushes have made a huge difference in the ease of applying my makeup.  </li>
            <li>However, another great aspect of the design is that everything is labeled with the brush&#x27;s purpose, so that I know exactly what it is for.</li>
            <li>These makeup brushes are very high quality at a great price.</li>
            <li>I love that each of the brushes are labeled with they type/purpose.</li>
            <li>For the price it was a worthwhile purchase.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this kit.  </li>
            <li>I have been using 3 of the brushes each day for my blush and eyes, and will be using more as the weather gets cooler</li>
            <li>and I wear more</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>These set of brush is better than the brush  </li>
            <li>They are cute brushes though</li>
            <li>I am really glad that I purchased these makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li>and they would have just set in the case, but with the brush identifiers, I have done a lot of experimenting and absolutely love this brush set.  </li>
            <li>Most of these types don&#x27;t come with an eyebrow brush and this set did</li>
            <li>After she actually used the brushes, she was even more impressed, both with the brushes and me!</li>
            <li>Love the color and the faux snakeskin print.</li>
            <li>LOVE the fact that the name of the brush is on each handle.</li>
            <li>A couple of things that would make it better would be a more flexible material and snaps that would allow you to make it a column to stand on the counter.</li>
            <li>I just received my order on Friday, and I am already in love with these brushes.  </li>
            <li>:- )</li>
            <li>Packaging means a great deal to me because it shows that the seller really cares and has put a lot of time and effort into producing a quality product.</li>
            <li>, I admit I am not the most makeup savvy -</li>
            <li>but this kit essentially carries everything you need to ensure you&#x27;re looking your best for whatever occasion you need!</li>
            <li>but this kit essentially carries everything you need to ensure you&#x27;re looking your best for whatever occasion you need!</li>
            <li>I am really glad that I purchased these makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>Another feature that I liked was that each brush has a name of the type of brush, so if you aren’t too familiar with applying makeup, you will know what it is intended to be used for.</li>

            <li>The case is great and it keeps the brushes separated from each other and will be very handy when traveling.  </li>
            <li>To start with, they come in their own specially designed case, which separates each brush.  </li>
            <li>Now that&#x27;s really novel, and really nice!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try those brushes!</li>
            <li>I simply love the pink case - it looks like alligator and is a very nice touch!  </li>
            <li>Thanks again!!! :)</li>
            <li>the price it&#x27;s great, and is very soft and smooth easy to handle.</li>
            <li>They help you apply your makeup with greater accuracy and precision, and they create a significant difference to the finished look.</li>
            <li>The two larger brushes have protective sleeves for the top which is great.</li>
            <li>It is easy to store and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>Really easy to take with you when you travel and just throw in your handbag if you need them during the day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying them, and having them makes applying make up more fun.  </li>
            <li>The case is great and it keeps the all the brushes separated from each other in their own slots.</li>
            <li>What I love most about the purse is that everything is organized for you when you first get it.</li>
            <li>In fact, most people thought it was a nice clutch for a night out on the town and were surprised to see I carried all my makeup brushes in there!</li>
            <li>Nice handle color of brushes and very nice shiny textured black case.</li>
            <li>Was surprise when I receive it 2 days after, I usely order thing from amazon and get free shipping it always take 3 to 4 days to get to me, it was a lot of brushes,</li>
            <li>Not as tall as I thought, but still comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>Just recently my brushes I am so happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>My mother liked them so much too that she asked me to buy her a set.</li>
            <li>It is ordered from the biggest to the smallest brush, while there is a flap overhead to protect the bristles of the brushes themselves, a great touch to the design of the overall product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are fairly good quality which surprised me for the price.  </li>
            <li>She is very particular, but thought this set of brushes was of high quality and she was happy with them.  </li>
            <li>They seem really concerned to make the customer happy and deliver a high quality product.</li>
            <li>Fast ship, pretty set, fair brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just used my brushes one day and am very pleased with them thus far.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a great set of brushes for a long time</li>
            <li>so when I first received the bag, I had NO idea what the difference for most of the brushes was for.</li>
            <li>make up brushes plus, this set also includes a video on how to clean them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those who don&#x27;t want to spend the money on a top brand makeup kit, but are unsure of the extremely cheap brands.ice feel to the face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those who don&#x27;t want to spend the money on a top brand makeup kit, but are unsure of the extremely cheap brands.</li>
            <li>The bristles of each brush are soft to the touch, not to the point where it tickles, but where it feels like you&#x27;re sleeping on your own pillow.</li>
            <li>When I first received this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I noticed the price was a bit lower than a lot of high quality full makeup sets -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone interested in top quality brushes at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, those thoughts quickly faded once the package arrived.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.  </li>
            <li>I have tried out many new makeup techniques with my new brushes, and now consider myself just a tad more knowledgeable in what works with my face, and the effects I can create with each brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone looking to get a great traveling or everyday set.</li>
            <li>No makeup artist worth</li>
            <li>The picture on Amazon truly does not do it justice, and it looks extremely nice physically.</li>
            <li>Wife is using this product for the past two months and she is so happy with these</li>
            <li>The brush is good, soft, comes in different colors,shape and size.  </li>
            <li>It came very well packaged &amp; super fast!</li>
            <li>It is a quality product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>but I think washing them more will help with that since I just recently got this kit.</li>
            <li>Love this set and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>The brushes they are replacing are over 20 years old and the Azuka brushes offer a better variety for a more wide range of uses.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I finally did!  </li>
            <li>My mom actually stole the powder brush from me because she liked it more than her other one.</li>
            <li>It looks genuine, and I&#x27;ve had multiple comments on how pretty my makeup set is!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s always a feature I really like my brushes to have.</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy them again because there is only 3 brushes that fit my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>High quality brushes too!  </li>
            <li>The Price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>, I really wanted to like them..</li>
            <li>It makes applying my makeup so much easier.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are each marked, which made it much easier to use the right brush for the purpose.</li>
            <li>They each pick up a good portion of makeup without falling all over my clothes as some other low quality brushes do, letting me save money on makeup and reducing the hassle of having to spend time putting on makeup.</li>

            <li>I love the pretty little case too.</li>
            <li>I love the hot pink case and that each brush is marked with it&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li>I love the black protective flap that covers the tips of the brushes</li>
            <li>She did have some suggestions for how they could be improved and was able to provide that feedback to the owner of the company...who actually contacted me personally to get my opinion of the brushes.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and I appreciated the info on how to care for them.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are large enough for you to spread over your face, while each individual brush allows you to add your own personal details to your makeup without ruining it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I highly recomended this product..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li>The bristles feel like they are high quality</li>
            <li>The quality is good, but not great.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not hard brushes</li>
            <li>I contacted them and got a response back right away.  </li>
            <li>That being said, the purse is small enough to fit in a large purse to carry around 24/7 in case you quickly need to retouch your makeup.</li>
            <li>and I needed new brushes..</li>
            <li>I am new to makeup brushes so needed something that will have he name of brush imprinted on it and</li>
            <li>Azuka has a new customer for life.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are really very soft, it doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin at all.</li>
            <li>First of all the delivery arrived earlier than promised.  </li>
            <li>I got these brushes for my 17 year old step-daughter and she loves them!  </li>
            <li>I gave these as a gift to my sister and she instantly fell in love with them due to the natural material that was used and the softness and build of these makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>I feel sort of like a professional.</li>
            <li>I also feel like it is very compact and will be a brush roll I will actually travel with because this has almost all of the essentials in it!</li>
            <li>This was a purchase for my 15 year old granddaughter---a bit of a makeup expert.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and seem quite durable.  </li>
            <li>brushes are not as soft.</li>
            <li>Bought this set of brushes for my wife after hearing her complain about her old set.</li>
            <li>In fact I believe that I had some of the brushes from my older set mixed up.  </li>
            <li>The brushes themselves seem to be high quality, they are really gentle on my face and don’t shed like other brushes that I have used before.  </li>

            <li>They come in a cute black case with pink inside.</li>
            <li>Wow, may I say - the box I received a few days ago was extremely pretty!</li>
            <li>I have tried them a few times now and they make a world of difference from the little applicators that most makeup comes with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> These professional brushes are excellent - I am really glad I bought them.  </li>
            <li> The quality is wonderful, the price was very affordable, and the brushes have made a huge difference in the ease of applying my makeup.  </li>
            <li> However, another great aspect of the design is that everything is labeled with the brush&#x27;s purpose, so that I know exactly what it is for.</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are very high quality at a great price.</li>
            <li> I love that each of the brushes are labeled with they type/purpose.</li>
            <li> For the price it was a worthwhile purchase.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this kit.  </li>
            <li> I have been using 3 of the brushes each day for my blush and eyes, and will be using more as the weather gets cooler</li>
            <li> and I wear more</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> These set of brush is better than the brush  </li>
            <li> They are cute brushes though</li>
            <li> I am really glad that I purchased these makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li> and they would have just set in the case, but with the brush identifiers, I have done a lot of experimenting and absolutely love this brush set.  </li>
            <li> Most of these types don&#x27;t come with an eyebrow brush and this set did</li>
            <li> After she actually used the brushes, she was even more impressed, both with the brushes and me!</li>
            <li> Love the color and the faux snakeskin print.</li>
            <li> LOVE the fact that the name of the brush is on each handle.</li>
            <li> A couple of things that would make it better would be a more flexible material and snaps that would allow you to make it a column to stand on the counter.</li>
            <li> I just received my order on Friday, and I am already in love with these brushes.  </li>
            <li> :- )</li>
            <li> Packaging means a great deal to me because it shows that the seller really cares and has put a lot of time and effort into producing a quality product.</li>
            <li> , I admit I am not the most makeup savvy -</li>
            <li> but this kit essentially carries everything you need to ensure you&#x27;re looking your best for whatever occasion you need!</li>

            <li> I am really glad that I purchased these makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> Another feature that I liked was that each brush has a name of the type of brush, so if you aren’t too familiar with applying makeup, you will know what it is intended to be used for.</li>

            <li> The case is great and it keeps the brushes separated from each other and will be very handy when traveling.  </li>
            <li> To start with, they come in their own specially designed case, which separates each brush.  </li>
            <li> Now that&#x27;s really novel, and really nice!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to try those brushes!</li>
            <li> I simply love the pink case - it looks like alligator and is a very nice touch!  </li>
            <li> Thanks again!!! :)</li>
            <li> the price it&#x27;s great, and is very soft and smooth easy to handle.</li>
            <li> They help you apply your makeup with greater accuracy and precision, and they create a significant difference to the finished look.</li>
            <li> The two larger brushes have protective sleeves for the top which is great.</li>
            <li> It is easy to store and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Really easy to take with you when you travel and just throw in your handbag if you need them during the day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying them, and having them makes applying make up more fun.  </li>
            <li> The case is great and it keeps the all the brushes separated from each other in their own slots.</li>
            <li> What I love most about the purse is that everything is organized for you when you first get it.</li>
            <li> In fact, most people thought it was a nice clutch for a night out on the town and were surprised to see I carried all my makeup brushes in there!</li>
            <li> Nice handle color of brushes and very nice shiny textured black case.</li>
            <li> Was surprise when I receive it 2 days after, I usely order thing from amazon and get free shipping it always take 3 to 4 days to get to me, it was a lot of brushes,</li>
            <li> Not as tall as I thought, but still comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> Just recently my brushes I am so happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My mother liked them so much too that she asked me to buy her a set.</li>
            <li> It is ordered from the biggest to the smallest brush, while there is a flap overhead to protect the bristles of the brushes themselves, a great touch to the design of the overall product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are fairly good quality which surprised me for the price.  </li>
            <li> She is very particular, but thought this set of brushes was of high quality and she was happy with them.  </li>
            <li> They seem really concerned to make the customer happy and deliver a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Fast ship, pretty set, fair brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just used my brushes one day and am very pleased with them thus far.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a great set of brushes for a long time</li>
            <li> so when I first received the bag, I had NO idea what the difference for most of the brushes was for.</li>
            <li> make up brushes plus, this set also includes a video on how to clean them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those who don&#x27;t want to spend the money on a top brand makeup kit, but are unsure of the extremely cheap brands.ice feel to the face.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those who don&#x27;t want to spend the money on a top brand makeup kit, but are unsure of the extremely cheap brands.</li>
            <li> The bristles of each brush are soft to the touch, not to the point where it tickles, but where it feels like you&#x27;re sleeping on your own pillow.</li>
            <li> When I first received this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I noticed the price was a bit lower than a lot of high quality full makeup sets -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone interested in top quality brushes at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, those thoughts quickly faded once the package arrived.</li>
            <li> Very pretty.  </li>
            <li> I have tried out many new makeup techniques with my new brushes, and now consider myself just a tad more knowledgeable in what works with my face, and the effects I can create with each brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone looking to get a great traveling or everyday set.</li>
            <li> No makeup artist worth</li>
            <li> The picture on Amazon truly does not do it justice, and it looks extremely nice physically.</li>
            <li> Wife is using this product for the past two months and she is so happy with these</li>
            <li> The brush is good, soft, comes in different colors,shape and size.  </li>
            <li> It came very well packaged &amp; super fast!</li>
            <li> It is a quality product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> but I think washing them more will help with that since I just recently got this kit.</li>
            <li> Love this set and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> The brushes they are replacing are over 20 years old and the Azuka brushes offer a better variety for a more wide range of uses.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I finally did!  </li>
            <li> My mom actually stole the powder brush from me because she liked it more than her other one.</li>
            <li> It looks genuine, and I&#x27;ve had multiple comments on how pretty my makeup set is!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s always a feature I really like my brushes to have.</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy them again because there is only 3 brushes that fit my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> High quality brushes too!  </li>
            <li> The Price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> , I really wanted to like them..</li>
            <li> It makes applying my makeup so much easier.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are each marked, which made it much easier to use the right brush for the purpose.</li>
            <li> They each pick up a good portion of makeup without falling all over my clothes as some other low quality brushes do, letting me save money on makeup and reducing the hassle of having to spend time putting on makeup.</li>

            <li> I love the pretty little case too.</li>
            <li> I love the hot pink case and that each brush is marked with it&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li> I love the black protective flap that covers the tips of the brushes</li>
            <li> She did have some suggestions for how they could be improved and was able to provide that feedback to the owner of the company...who actually contacted me personally to get my opinion of the brushes.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and I appreciated the info on how to care for them.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are large enough for you to spread over your face, while each individual brush allows you to add your own personal details to your makeup without ruining it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I highly recomended this product..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles feel like they are high quality</li>
            <li> The quality is good, but not great.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not hard brushes</li>
            <li> I contacted them and got a response back right away.  </li>
            <li> That being said, the purse is small enough to fit in a large purse to carry around 24/7 in case you quickly need to retouch your makeup.</li>
            <li> and I needed new brushes..</li>
            <li> I am new to makeup brushes so needed something that will have he name of brush imprinted on it and</li>
            <li> Azuka has a new customer for life.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are really very soft, it doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin at all.</li>
            <li> First of all the delivery arrived earlier than promised.  </li>
            <li> I got these brushes for my 17 year old step-daughter and she loves them!  </li>
            <li> I gave these as a gift to my sister and she instantly fell in love with them due to the natural material that was used and the softness and build of these makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I feel sort of like a professional.</li>
            <li> I also feel like it is very compact and will be a brush roll I will actually travel with because this has almost all of the essentials in it!</li>
            <li> This was a purchase for my 15 year old granddaughter---a bit of a makeup expert.  </li>
            <li> They are soft and seem quite durable.  </li>
            <li> brushes are not as soft.</li>
            <li> Bought this set of brushes for my wife after hearing her complain about her old set.</li>
            <li> In fact I believe that I had some of the brushes from my older set mixed up.  </li>
            <li> The brushes themselves seem to be high quality, they are really gentle on my face and don’t shed like other brushes that I have used before.  </li>
            <li> The brushes themselves seem to be high quality, they are really gentle on my face and don’t shed like other brushes that I have used before.</li>
            <li> They come in a cute black case with pink inside.</li>
            <li> Wow, may I say - the box I received a few days ago was extremely pretty!</li>
            <li> I have tried them a few times now and they make a world of difference from the little applicators that most makeup comes with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When they came I pulled them out and they just weren&#x27;t as soft as my other brushes..</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because at a price like this i thought that the face brushes would not be the soft or dense enough for my liking.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and stayed tight even after washing.  </li>
            <li> The only other brush I would suggest you buy along with this is a stippling brush for cream products (I recommend one from ELF for $3).</li>
            <li> My fear of loose bristles and smelly plastic almost outweighed my desire to find a bargain here.  </li>
            <li> Some brushes that I have used in the past actually hurt when I used them, especially around my eyes, but these don’t.  </li>

            <li> so you don&#x27;t get a big mess inside your case.</li>
            <li> When you first use some of the smaller brushes, they are a bit stiff and hard to maneuver, but after soaking some in water a few times and waiting for it to get try, it made it a lot easier.</li>

            <li> Bought this kit for the wide selection of brush.  </li>
            <li> It is a faux crocodile print with a pink fabric on the inside.</li>
            <li> Pink brushes!</li>
            <li> I checked out other reviews before I bought these.  </li>
            <li> And they are pink!  </li>
            <li> and I can tell each other&#x27;s apart.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other make up cases in which all the brushes have to be thrown in together in one compartment.  </li>
            <li> Very soft - no smell to bristles &amp; have not experienced any shedding (purchased 12/2013).  </li>
            <li> It smells a little bit, but I think it&#x27;s because of the pouch.</li>
            <li> They come in a container that folds up into what looks like a little purse.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just spoiled with the brushes I have/used in the past compared to all these other reviewers</li>
            <li> However, this required a few uses of each brush.</li>
            <li> However, this required a few uses of each brush.</li>

            <li> I got a few hubby points out of this one!</li>
            <li> you take your beauty regime seriously</li>
            <li> There is nothing bad about this set.  </li>

            <li> Gave them as a gift. they loved them!</li>
            <li> I just got it today. I haven&#x27;t try it yet, but it seems to have a nice quality. It smells a little bit, but I think it&#x27;s because of the pouch. It comes with instructions on how to wash them, so I&#x27;ll do that as soon as I can.&lt;br /&gt;The company also contacted me. They seem really concerned to make the customer happy and deliver a high quality product. I&#x27;m excited to try those brushes!</li>

            <li> I never gave a review before.  I am given this one because my wife loved it, it was a gift for her. First of all the delivery arrived earlier than promised.  Wife is using this product for the past two months and she is so happy with these make up brushes plus, this set also includes a video on how to clean them. I highly recomended this product..</li>
            <li> This was a purchase for my 15 year old granddaughter---a bit of a makeup expert.  She is very particular, but thought this set of brushes was of high quality and she was happy with them.  She did have some suggestions for how they could be improved and was able to provide that feedback to the owner of the company...who actually contacted me personally to get my opinion of the brushes.  I was pretty impressed with that.  I would recommend this set of brushes.  Joyce</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my daughter.  She loves them.  Says they feel excellent on her skin.  Very good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I checked out other reviews before I bought these.  My fear of loose bristles and smelly plastic almost outweighed my desire to find a bargain here.  I&#x27;m glad I ordered these!  No smell.  Very pretty.  Not as tall as I thought, but still comfortable to use.  The bristles are soft and stayed tight even after washing.  There is nothing bad about this set.  These will do everything they are designed to do.</li>
            <li> I received my make up brushes yesterday in the mail.  What a really nice set!  They come in a container that folds up into what looks like a little purse.  Really easy to take with you when you travel and just throw in your handbag if you need them during the day.  High quality brushes too!  And they are pink!  Bonus!  I&#x27;m hoping they will come out with a variety of colors so that I can give them as gifts and that way my friends and I can tell each other&#x27;s apart.  They have every brush you could need to do a formal makeover.  The customer service is exceptional too!  I contacted them and got a response back right away.  This is the kit to buy if you are looking for a set of great brushes!</li>
            <li> I got this set of brushes about a week ago and I am quite happy with my decision to order them.  The case is great and it keeps the brushes separated from each other and will be very handy when traveling.  The brushes are each marked, which made it much easier to use the right brush for the purpose. In fact I believe that I had some of the brushes from my older set mixed up.  The brushes are very soft and I appreciated the info on how to care for them.  I will probably order a set for my daughter and one for my friend for Christmas.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really very soft, it doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin at all. Great quality for the price.  Would recommend all to try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> I was very glad that I purchased this product. I have enjoyed using the brushes; they are good quality and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I got these brushes for my 17 year old step-daughter and she loves them!  She is involved with the drama department at school and loves to experiment with make up but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a bunch of money.  They are fairly good quality which surprised me for the price.  So far very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> These professional brushes are excellent - I am really glad I bought them.  There is every size and shape needed, and the quality is very good.  I simply love the pink case - it looks like alligator and is a very nice touch!  I have been using 3 of the brushes each day for my blush and eyes, and will be using more as the weather gets cooler and I wear more makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent seller and nice experience. I recommend!</li>
            <li> What a nice, organized set of make up brushes!  To start with, they come in their own specially designed case, which separates each brush.  I&#x27;ve had other make up cases in which all the brushes have to be thrown in together in one compartment.  It&#x27;s really nice to have a case that keeps all the brushes separated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, each brush is labeled to identify its use.  Now that&#x27;s really novel, and really nice!  Without that, I wouldn&#x27;t have a clue what some of them are supposed to be used for.  The lableling is actually educational.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes themselves are really nice too.  They are soft and seem quite durable.  I&#x27;m really enjoying them, and having them makes applying make up more fun.  :)</li>
            <li> Just recently my brushes I am so happy with my purchase. Up until recently I had never used any but sponges to apply my foundation let me tell you what a difference!!! Thanks again!!! :)</li>
            <li> The brush is good, soft, comes in different colors,shape and size.  These set of brush is better than the brush  I had before  purchasing Azuka brush. The Price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Fast ship, pretty set, fair brushes.</li>
            <li> Makeup brushes can make a world of difference in the final results of your makeup application. Brushes are not just an optional extra. They help you apply your makeup with greater accuracy and precision, and they create a significant difference to the finished look. No makeup artist worth her lip gloss would be found without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this brand... among lots of choices... because they seemed like good quality and they were good looking as I plan to have them out on my vanity in the bathroom. I have tried them a few times now and they make a world of difference from the little applicators that most makeup comes with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take your beauty regime seriously, a set of good quality brushes could be the best investment you&#x27;ll make. I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> Love them! I alreadty used them three times and washed them twice! and they feel even softer after the wash great price good product!</li>
            <li> I ordered the brushes for my best friend for Christmas and also one for me because the reviews were so promising and I needed new brushes.. When they came I pulled them out and they just weren&#x27;t as soft as my other brushes.. Maybe I&#x27;m just spoiled with the brushes I have/used in the past compared to all these other reviewers but I&#x27;m returning them. They&#x27;re not hard brushes but I like my brushes to feel almost like clouds. They are cute brushes though, I really wanted to like them.. I debated for 2 weeks before deciding to return them after finding brushes I like in stores.</li>
            <li> good starter set but brushes are not as soft. I recommend ELF brush set as I have that for comparison. I am new to makeup brushes so needed something that will have he name of brush imprinted on it and this set has all their brushes names imprinted on brushes. Nice handle color of brushes and very nice shiny textured black case. Good for travelling too.</li>
            <li> I am really glad that I purchased these makeup brushes.  They came in a stylish brush case that will come in handy when I am traveling and will protect them from getting damaged.  The brushes themselves seem to be high quality, they are really gentle on my face and don’t shed like other brushes that I have used before.  Some brushes that I have used in the past actually hurt when I used them, especially around my eyes, but these don’t.  Another feature that I liked was that each brush has a name of the type of brush, so if you aren’t too familiar with applying makeup, you will know what it is intended to be used for.</li>
            <li> I love the hot pink case and that each brush is marked with it&#x27;s use.  I wouldn&#x27;t have known how to use them before and they would have just set in the case, but with the brush identifiers, I have done a lot of experimenting and absolutely love this brush set.  Most of these types don&#x27;t come with an eyebrow brush and this set did and it&#x27;s a great brush!  Love this set and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought this set of brushes for my wife after hearing her complain about her old set. The minute she got the package , she was impressed. Nice packaging with all the brushes in a nice case. After she actually used the brushes, she was even more impressed, both with the brushes and me! I got a few hubby points out of this one!</li>
            <li> these makeup brushes are beautiful, &amp; great quality. Love the color and the faux snakeskin print. Would recommend to anyone looking to get a great traveling or everyday set.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush set for my wife and she said the brushes are very nice as is the case.  She was also impressed with the variety of brushes included in the kit.  A home run for hubby.</li>
            <li> Really nice brush &amp; great price.  Very soft - no smell to bristles &amp; have not experienced any shedding (purchased 12/2013).  LOVE the fact that the name of the brush is on each handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just used my brushes one day and am very pleased with them thus far. The brushes they are replacing are over 20 years old and the Azuka brushes offer a better variety for a more wide range of uses. The bristles feel like they are high quality and I like that they are stamped with a description of the use for each. Although I would prefer if the handles were a bit heavier. The case is sleek, rolling up nicely for travel without marring the bristles. A couple of things that would make it better would be a more flexible material and snaps that would allow you to make it a column to stand on the counter. Also, the pockets for each brush could be made of solid material. The ends tend to get caught on the netting when replacing them in the case.&lt;br /&gt;  All that to say that I am very happy with my purchase. It is a quality product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!  It makes applying my makeup so much easier.  They work great!  I had been looking for a great set of brushes for a long time and I&#x27;m glad I finally did!  My mother liked them so much too that she asked me to buy her a set.</li>
            <li> I just received my order on Friday, and I am already in love with these brushes.  The quality is wonderful, the price was very affordable, and the brushes have made a huge difference in the ease of applying my makeup.  Azuka has a new customer for life.  :- )</li>
            <li> Wow, may I say - the box I received a few days ago was extremely pretty! Packaging means a great deal to me because it shows that the seller really cares and has put a lot of time and effort into producing a quality product. When I first received this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I noticed the price was a bit lower than a lot of high quality full makeup sets - so, I was a bit worried about the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, those thoughts quickly faded once the package arrived. Inside, I noticed just how beautiful the bag is in person. The picture on Amazon truly does not do it justice, and it looks extremely nice physically. It looks genuine, and I&#x27;ve had multiple comments on how pretty my makeup set is! In fact, most people thought it was a nice clutch for a night out on the town and were surprised to see I carried all my makeup brushes in there! That being said, the purse is small enough to fit in a large purse to carry around 24/7 in case you quickly need to retouch your makeup. What I love most about the purse is that everything is organized for you when you first get it. It is ordered from the biggest to the smallest brush, while there is a flap overhead to protect the bristles of the brushes themselves, a great touch to the design of the overall product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I admit I am not the most makeup savvy - so when I first received the bag, I had NO idea what the difference for most of the brushes was for. However, another great aspect of the design is that everything is labeled with the brush&#x27;s purpose, so that I know exactly what it is for. I have tried out many new makeup techniques with my new brushes, and now consider myself just a tad more knowledgeable in what works with my face, and the effects I can create with each brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes themselves are great. The bristles of each brush are soft to the touch, not to the point where it tickles, but where it feels like you&#x27;re sleeping on your own pillow. It&#x27;s a nice feel to the face. However, this required a few uses of each brush. When you first use some of the smaller brushes, they are a bit stiff and hard to maneuver, but after soaking some in water a few times and waiting for it to get try, it made it a lot easier. They each pick up a good portion of makeup without falling all over my clothes as some other low quality brushes do, letting me save money on makeup and reducing the hassle of having to spend time putting on makeup. Not only that, but this kit essentially carries everything you need to ensure you&#x27;re looking your best for whatever occasion you need! The brushes are large enough for you to spread over your face, while each individual brush allows you to add your own personal details to your makeup without ruining it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly, a great makeup kit that I am extremely happy to have. Highly recommended for those who don&#x27;t want to spend the money on a top brand makeup kit, but are unsure of the extremely cheap brands.ice feel to the face.
