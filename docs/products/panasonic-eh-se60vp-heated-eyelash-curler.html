    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I was very happy to receive this heated eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>I thought the rotating feature would be awesome, but I&#x27;m finding that I don&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
            <li>I am also very impressed with the Panasonic Beauty Line.</li>
            <li>And the best part is that I can curl the outer edges, too, and with no pinching and/or fear of pulling them out (which, let&#x27;s face it, can&#x27;t be healthful for lashes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t the best use of my time.</li>
            <li>So I suggest you just try it both ways and see which way you like best, and which works best for the mascara you use.</li>
            <li>this heated curler does the job wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I wish Panasonic the best of luck with this product, and thank Amazon for the opportunity to test and review</li>

            <li>She was especially happy that it didn&#x27;t pull out any of her eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>packaging, very attractive</li>
            <li>packaging, very attractive</li>
            <li>Reapplying the mascara made her lashes straighten immediately, so she wasn&#x27;t impressed, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best and easiest way to make your face look bright and beautiful is to curl and lengthen your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good news, while it does get very warm I still have both my eyes and no burns!</li>
            <li>THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>SO EASILYAND MAKES THEM LOOK GREAT.</li>
            <li>I think this is really a great addition to my makeup routine....</li>
            <li>She thought it did a great job and made her lashes curly as promised.</li>
            <li>Great idea</li>
            <li>am giving the product two stars, as I am a gadget person, and think this is a great concept product.  </li>

            <li>wife tried it out, and she was happy with it as well.  </li>
            <li>This eyelash curler is amazing!</li>
            <li>very nice tool, performs as good as I expect</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 3 weeks and the battery is still going strong, so I am a happy girl!</li>
            <li>The box says for best results to use the curler after applying mascara, but the inside paper directions clearly state that for best results to use it before applying mascara.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as good as I was hoping it would.</li>
            <li>and she loved the results.</li>
            <li>It did not do a good job of curling my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I know this, because as I was struggling to keep the button depressed for rotation and keep it positioned for optimum curl, I roasted my eyelid inadvertently, and repeatedly.</li>
            <li>save time and make the lashes looks so good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*This would probably be an ideal gift for the beauty-obsessed person in your life, who can perfectly and effortlessly look as though they have their own makeup artist (I&#x27;m positive that is what it takes to make this thing</li>

            <li>Technology is making it convenient to look beautiful &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>The truth is they are both OK but neither is great.  </li>
            <li>otherwise Love it!</li>
            <li>This one is used after mascara is applied, and it did curl the lashes nicely.</li>
            <li>It feels as warm as a blow dryer on low/medium heat.</li>
            <li>Just warm.  </li>
            <li>Keep soap handy for what comes out of your mouth when this happens.</li>
            <li>According to our own trial of this product, the reputation is well earned.</li>
            <li>thing I was happy to find was that the Beauty Line doesn&#x27;t get very hot at all--it&#x27;s comfortably warm.</li>
            <li>Transportation is very fast, very fine goods packaging, appearance is very good.</li>
            <li>A nice tube of mascara does a much better job.  </li>
            <li>I will say however, if you can get this to work for you, I think the heat makes it more effective, as it does on the heated clamp version I use.</li>
            <li>I run the wand through them to make sure everything looks nice.</li>
            <li>and it arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li>Easy and immediate results!  </li>
            <li>It certainly isn&#x27;t a must have item, but it is a nice bonus item (would be great as a stocking stuffer too).</li>
            <li>Easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li>I bought both this and the Panasonic EH2351AC Heated Eyelash Curling Wand to see which was better.  </li>
            <li>It is better to use after mascara and use mascara again after using the curler.</li>
            <li>I had no idea anything like this existed, but am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK product but  manual curler works better.</li>
            <li>felt that my mascara covered my lashes better after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried the manual curler many times,</li>
            <li>hope you love it like I do.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this eyelash curler!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more cumbersome than helpful for me.</li>
            <li>I mostly like this for the separating effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I have to say I like this more than I thought</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like the Panasonic Beauty Line Ladies Heated Eyelash Curler</li>
            <li>Then later it says it works best when mascara has already been applied.</li>
            <li>I do love this eyelash curler</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>But this one takes a lot more time.</li>
            <li>You may have better results using mascara</li>
            <li>it had a much better effect.  </li>
            <li>I saw this device and thought surely this would give me a pain-free curling experience?</li>
            <li>It felt like it needed &#x27;more&#x27; in the length of the plastic teeth</li>
            <li>but I just feel something like this would be impractical for most anyone who doesn&#x27;t spend all day doing their makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>but I just feel something like this would be impractical for most anyone who doesn&#x27;t spend all day doing their makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This may be better for those with shorter lashes; I think I&#x27;ll stick to my tried-and-true method.</li>
            <li>and I noticed that it said to use before mascara, but find that it works better after you apply mascara.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this,  I received it as a gift and thought it was a great idea for someone to give as a gift since it is not nessecarily a need type item but fun to have.  </li>
            <li>No real instructions included, but watched a video on youtube to see the best way to use this item.</li>
            <li>Uses batteries very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to forget to turn it off, and it does not have automatic shut-off.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>You can touch it easily with your fingers without any burning.</li>
            <li>Curler\\&quot; is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The unit heats up very fast, and the purple-to-pink indicator comes in handy.</li>
            <li>We both thought it heated up quickly and found it was safe and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It also matches perfectly with the other two products!</li>
            <li>But this item did the job just fine.  </li>
            <li>The heat indicater was accurate.  </li>
            <li>They are guffawing, and slapping their knees, and toasting with gold goblets filled with money-wine that they fooled thousands of women into buying this</li>
            <li>the product for free.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I really got this for my wife to use, but in the interest of reviewing</li>
            <li>When you read the manual, it reads as if it were not written by someone whose primary language is English.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not stupid -</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is so pretty and easy to carry.</li>
            <li>I cannot say if the Panasonic works well since I think its the type of style I have not been able to get the hang of, but it sure is pretty, and more amenable to carrying out in a purse than the clamp type of eyelash curler, assuming it works for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Panasonic sells the same model in Japan, where it is very popular.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited about buying this item to uplift my lashes.  </li>
            <li>When I was offered this eyelash curler to review I was excited.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this Panasonic heated curler.</li>
            <li>It would be great if it warmed up just a little bit more</li>
            <li>It seems like they would be more effective if the heating aspect could be combined with the traditional crimping curler</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried nearly every eyelash curler out there from Japonesque to Dior and this Panasonic one is definitely the best!</li>
            <li>This product is slightly better than the one by Blinc but is still frustrating at best.  </li>
            <li>it appears to require quite a bit of one&#x27;s time, and I am not even sure they would do much for me since I received the product for free.  </li>
            <li>B000EMWHD2 Tweezerman Classic Eyelash Curler]] and curled my lashes the old fashioned way, and within 2 seconds they were perfectly curled and ready for their close up , Mr. Demille.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It never gets as hot as a curling iron, which is a good thing for something you are putting near your eye.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a warm product that I&#x27;ve pressed directly on the rims of my eyelids.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, I tried this about two or three times only.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After spending 6 minutes on my top lashes, and the 2 minutes it took to heat this up, my lashes were just as straight as when I started.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m happy with the Beauty Line.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Heats up quickly and substantially&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Heats up quickly and substantially&lt;</li>
            <li>Whe you use it, you can see the results quickly.</li>
            <li>always used to see my gf searching for the perfect eyelash curler (shes into the whole beauty thing) while constantly buying replacement cushions for her old one.</li>
            <li>the rolling head make the lashes separate, therefore, when you apply mascara on, it looks very pretty.</li>
            <li>We also tried it on my eyelashes, which are naturally long and curly, and it did a rather good job there</li>
            <li>It many times does not turn on when button is pushed despite a new battery.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good at straightening those baby hairs at my hairline, so now when I wear my bangs pulled back</li>
            <li>Two of us felt like total derps as we discovered how this device functions, and it&#x27;s sure not intuitive!</li>
            <li>I even went to Youtube to see if there were videos showing other people using this thing successfully in case</li>
            <li>So, with that, I like this one, but I think I would have been fine purchasing a more &#x27;basic&#x27; model that doesn&#x27;t have the rotating functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed what a little AA battery can accomplish in this unit - with regards to rotating the curler and at the same time doing such a good job of heating it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>She used it on naked lashes and didn&#x27;t think it was effective.</li>
            <li>It is a bit of a frivolous item, but could be a fun stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to give it a shot to see if there was a better alternative to my old Revlon manual curler.</li>
            <li>Is it worth it to you?</li>
            <li>But the fact remains, the Panasonic heated curler that I received is not heating up properly, and just isn&#x27;t effective as an eyelash curler as it is.  </li>
            <li>but I could not find success at any level with this thing.</li>
            <li>but I could not find success at any level with this thing.</li>
            <li>I rarely use mascara.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and basically does EXACTLY what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>In any case, one of us loved it and the other was indifferent.</li>
            <li>First, the curler gets very, very hot.  </li>
            <li>(I know, whoa is me, right?)</li>
            <li>Mascara does help some (vs. naked eyelashes), but I&#x27;ve gotten better results from a traditional curler (the kind that pulls and pinches unfortunately).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it to be most effective if I first use the traditional crimping curler then use one of the heated curlers and then follow up with the traditional curler again.</li>
            <li>I have very straight eyelashes</li>
            <li>It is gentle, and not quite as effective on my lashes as a conventional eyelash curler but results in a more natural curl.  </li>
            <li>This heated eyelash curler gets HOT.  </li>
            <li>So hot that I burned a section of my lashes and the lash broke off.  </li>
            <li>Just be aware that your lashes can break using this</li>
            <li>I never felt like it was ever too hot.  </li>
            <li>Turn on curler so it gets a chance to warm up as I normally apply my regular mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working, the color indicator changes and if you take off the curling wand, the heating element is hot.</li>
            <li>I would at first.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It is a nice pink color</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with this product and will definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t heat up so hot it burns your skin</li>
            <li>I find this works better to curl my Younique 3D Fiberlash mascara after applying the mascara, rather than using a traditional eyelash curler on them.</li>
            <li>and i really like it!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find that it got too hot.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic beauty line, EH-SE60VP heated eyelash curler broke after the first use.  </li>
            <li>and then it says to apply mascara first.  </li>
            <li>It warms up pretty quickly--emphasis on \\&quot;warms\\</li>
            <li>and its pink color looks nice</li>
            <li>This works much better then traditional eyelash curlers.</li>
            <li>The adult in the house wasn&#x27;t as excited about it.</li>
            <li>Maybe I still need to give myself a bit more time to overcome the learning curve, but this model doesn&#x27;t work as well for my straight Asian lashes.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes actually stayed curled for more than a day; I bathed in the morning and when it was time to bath again in the evening, my lashes were still very curly and full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and only curl them occasionally because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good for them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice-looking, very portable (more so, I think, than my manual), and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do (think stocking stuffer come the holidays, especially if it&#x27;s on sale).</li>
            <li>You do have to really read the directions to make sure you are using it properly.</li>
            <li>I use it in the morning and it heats up pretty fast.</li>
            <li>The heat of the curler sets a all day long wear that I love because now make-up does not get smudged under my eyes</li>
            <li>I always got the same results; the powered brush would rotate, but the brush would barely get warm at all.  </li>
            <li>This is one handy little gadget.  </li>
            <li>here comes this handy little gadget.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly decent lashes so usually I just slap on mascara and call it good.</li>
            <li>Heat fast.</li>
            <li>after applied mascara it works very well.</li>
            <li>really do the job.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really well made - not</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to wait for the curler to be ready.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten in the rhythm of flipping the on switch for it to heat when I start putting my makeup on so that when I get to the curling part, it is ready to go.</li>
            <li>This curler heats up fast.</li>
            <li>and I really like this one.</li>
            <li>This is a very neat product.  </li>
            <li>but you really do need to change the batteries often.</li>
            <li>The manual wasn&#x27;t much help</li>
            <li>if you are caught in a rain, your lashes will become straight again, not the fault of the Panasonic heated eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>I have a lash on each eye that grows straight out</li>
            <li>even though it didn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>Just pop a battery in it, and you are ready to go.  </li>
            <li>Once you get it ready to go, you just flick the switch and the curler curls away.  </li>
            <li>I would much rather have something that can be re-charged from a wall socket.</li>
            <li>It is also very convenient to travel with.</li>
            <li>, I really, REALLY wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>But it did absolutely nothing to curl my lashes, with or without mascara.</li>
            <li>However, like-minded potential users will be pleased to learn that the Beauty Line works really well prior to applying mascara: just follow the instructions and Voila!--nice curl and eyes that appear more open.</li>
            <li>Mine only took seconds to get hot and cool.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about you, but I don&#x27;t have this kind of time to waste in the morning when I&#x27;m getting ready for work.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*It heats up quickly, and IT GETS HOT ENOUGH TO BURN.</li>
            <li>have relatively long lashes and they seem to curl relatively easily.</li>
            <li>The most the curler did was make my eyelashes stand straight outward (instead of pointing down)</li>
            <li>It heated up quite quickly and was easy to use and really like that it was small compact and had a cover</li>
            <li>I save it for nights out or special events, or if I have extra time in the morning</li>
            <li>I love that the next day when I get to curl my eyelashes again that they are still mostly curled from the day before, that certainly never happened with my prior eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li>The kind of cheese-paring business mentality that can&#x27;t be bothered to include a single AA battery is especially galling to find in a company that happens to manufacture batteries.</li>
            <li>I desperately wanted to love it, felt it would somehow fill my previously-unknown need for sexy curled lashes!</li>
            <li>I desperately wanted to love it, felt it would somehow fill my previously-unknown need for sexy curled lashes!</li>
            <li>The unit is small and handy, and there are plenty of warranty and replacement forms that accompany the product.</li>
            <li>She said that the curl didn&#x27;t stay all that well on natural eyelashes, but when she put on mascara first then used the curler</li>
            <li>I absolutely cannot live without this product I have purchased three now</li>
            <li>, I could not get a decent curl to save my life.</li>
            <li>For that and its price, it loses a star; I think buyers deserve to be able to use one-battery devices right out of the box.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product with high hopes of never having to use an old-fashioned eyelash curler again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>It works very well, gets hot enough and keeps eye lashes curled.</li>
            <li>Both my wife and my daughter initially complained about the hot plastic, but I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>I suppose if you&#x27;re obsessed with your eyes looking perfect and have long lashes alreay, this might be just the ticket.  </li>
            <li>the thought of baking mascara into my lashes (even at a comfortably low temperature) just doesn&#x27;t hit me right.</li>
            <li>You can change which way it rotates, which is a necessary feature for switching from the right to</li>
            <li>you push the arrow either left or right depending</li>
            <li>the cheap plastic that I&#x27;ve seen before on other eyelash</li>
            <li>This time, i decided to give this new model a try.</li>
            <li>I like it however I can live without it</li>
            <li>Even bought new cells from the store and tried them.  </li>
            <li>It is an utter waste of time unless you are the kind of person who spends 2 hours doing her face - what&#x27;s another 20 minutes</li>
            <li>I even looked like I had lush lashes!</li>
            <li>Yes it gets hot enough, but it doesn&#x27;t curl my lashes whatsoever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty big downside</li>
            <li>cause how could something so dazzling and with batteries fail you?</li>
            <li>It was also an adjustment putting my mascara on first before curling, I always did the opposite with the \\&quot;pinch\\&quot; type of curlers.  </li>
            <li>Somewhere in the upper echelons of Panasonic is a room full of suited up men, who are having a giant Larf at our expense.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic Beauty Line Ladies Heated Eyelash Curler in vivid pink is tiny and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>comes with a little booklet with DETAILED instructions on how to use this.  </li>
            <li>But I prefer the old one.</li>
            <li>have straight but dense Asian eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I bought this directly from Panasonic and I like it.</li>
            <li>I have completely disregarded my mascara with this product.</li>
            <li>For the record, I have incredibly long lashes (thanks, Dad!)</li>
            <li>I have Asian stick straight lashes and</li>
            <li>After using it several times she really started getting used it</li>
            <li>I have medium-length lashes with some natural curl.</li>
            <li>used the curler several times and it did nothing for my stick straight lashes.  </li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t like the rotating action of the brush, and worried that eyelashes could snag and be ripped out by the brush.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t personally notice much curl to my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>It did heat up as advertised but without the rotating action there was no curled lashes.</li>
            <li>My wife is Japanese, so her hair, including her lashes, is very stubborn when it comes to curling.  </li>
            <li>This device isn&#x27;t worth to waste that much of my time.  </li>
            <li>and I feel like playing with make-up a bit more than usual!</li>
            <li>shiny, its pink, and it looks like its gonna curl the curlness right into your eyelashes.</li>
            <li>This curler never gets hot enough to actually curl eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I have long but straight eyelashes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After quite a few attempts, I returned the batteries back into my remote control and grabbed my handy dandy</li>
            <li>also that I don&#x27;t use this daily; for me, those steps and the resulting look would be too much for my daily &#x27;go-to-work&#x27; look.</li>
            <li>I had clicked on the more expensive ones and the description and reviews are exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I tried other methods:&lt;br /&gt;Tried using Mascara first, no luck.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>Now, when I barely curled the lashes, they didn&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li>When I use this product after putting on several coats of mascara, it basically takes the mascara off completely.  </li>
            <li>You need to wait 1 to 2 minutes for the purple dot to turn pink, then you are ready to curl.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know why I thought there could be something better, why fix what isn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li>However, my product is either defective or just isn&#x27;t effective at all, and Panasonic support is too tedious to bother with.  </li>

            <li>My only comment is; I find it very strange that the Panasonic EH-SE60VP heated eyelash curler (same exact model number) varies in price from $18.93 to 79.59.</li>
            <li>hate dissing a Panasonic product as everything else I own by this company has been super.</li>
            <li>I have very pale lashes, I have to really coat them with mascara to look like I have lashes, and they are straight.</li>
            <li>I spent an hour trying to decipher the hieroglyphs on them, and finally figured it out after realizing a 3 year old on a cookie high illustrated them.  </li>
            <li>I then gave it the benefit of the doubt by making sure the mascara was fully dried after few hours....</li>
            <li>I followed the directions in the manual and spent at least 3 minutes on each of my top lashes.</li>
            <li>She was a little scared to try it at first.  </li>
            <li>Do not underestimate just how hot a &#x27;little battery&#x27; can make a Q-tip sized device that can sizzle your eyeballs</li>

            <li>but apparently there must be some engineering issue that prevents anyone from designing such a tool.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It did finally build up with pressing lashing against the curler and holding it a while.&lt;br /&gt;There result was no different than manual curler as far as amount of curl and length lasting.</li>
            <li>She got a little curl out of it, but noticed that it pretty much took off half the mascara she&#x27;d applied.</li>
            <li>Given the somewhat low cost of the product, I personally don&#x27;t feel it is worth the wasted time to try and work through all of the red tape at Panasonic, to get my test device replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>The rotating comb stops working every time I attempt to curl my eyelashes using this thing!&lt;br /&gt;Anddd the teeth really should have been slightly elongated...</li>
            <li>With my unskilled hands, I actually tapped my eyeballs a few times trying it out with no ill effects.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I was very happy to receive this heated eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> I thought the rotating feature would be awesome, but I&#x27;m finding that I don&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
            <li> I am also very impressed with the Panasonic Beauty Line.</li>
            <li> And the best part is that I can curl the outer edges, too, and with no pinching and/or fear of pulling them out (which, let&#x27;s face it, can&#x27;t be healthful for lashes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t the best use of my time.</li>
            <li> So I suggest you just try it both ways and see which way you like best, and which works best for the mascara you use.</li>
            <li> this heated curler does the job wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I wish Panasonic the best of luck with this product, and thank Amazon for the opportunity to test and review</li>

            <li> She was especially happy that it didn&#x27;t pull out any of her eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> packaging, very attractive</li>
            <li> packaging, very attractive</li>
            <li> Reapplying the mascara made her lashes straighten immediately, so she wasn&#x27;t impressed, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The best and easiest way to make your face look bright and beautiful is to curl and lengthen your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good news, while it does get very warm I still have both my eyes and no burns!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> SO EASILYAND MAKES THEM LOOK GREAT.</li>
            <li> I think this is really a great addition to my makeup routine....</li>
            <li> She thought it did a great job and made her lashes curly as promised.</li>
            <li> Great idea</li>
            <li> am giving the product two stars, as I am a gadget person, and think this is a great concept product.  </li>

            <li> wife tried it out, and she was happy with it as well.  </li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is amazing!</li>
            <li> very nice tool, performs as good as I expect</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks and the battery is still going strong, so I am a happy girl!</li>
            <li> The box says for best results to use the curler after applying mascara, but the inside paper directions clearly state that for best results to use it before applying mascara.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as good as I was hoping it would.</li>
            <li> and she loved the results.</li>
            <li> It did not do a good job of curling my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I know this, because as I was struggling to keep the button depressed for rotation and keep it positioned for optimum curl, I roasted my eyelid inadvertently, and repeatedly.</li>
            <li> save time and make the lashes looks so good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*This would probably be an ideal gift for the beauty-obsessed person in your life, who can perfectly and effortlessly look as though they have their own makeup artist (I&#x27;m positive that is what it takes to make this thing</li>

            <li> Technology is making it convenient to look beautiful &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The truth is they are both OK but neither is great.  </li>
            <li> otherwise Love it!</li>
            <li> This one is used after mascara is applied, and it did curl the lashes nicely.</li>
            <li> It feels as warm as a blow dryer on low/medium heat.</li>
            <li> Just warm.  </li>
            <li> Keep soap handy for what comes out of your mouth when this happens.</li>
            <li> According to our own trial of this product, the reputation is well earned.</li>
            <li> thing I was happy to find was that the Beauty Line doesn&#x27;t get very hot at all--it&#x27;s comfortably warm.</li>
            <li> Transportation is very fast, very fine goods packaging, appearance is very good.</li>
            <li> A nice tube of mascara does a much better job.  </li>
            <li> I will say however, if you can get this to work for you, I think the heat makes it more effective, as it does on the heated clamp version I use.</li>
            <li> I run the wand through them to make sure everything looks nice.</li>
            <li> and it arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li> Easy and immediate results!  </li>
            <li> It certainly isn&#x27;t a must have item, but it is a nice bonus item (would be great as a stocking stuffer too).</li>
            <li> Easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li> I bought both this and the Panasonic EH2351AC Heated Eyelash Curling Wand to see which was better.  </li>
            <li> It is better to use after mascara and use mascara again after using the curler.</li>
            <li> I had no idea anything like this existed, but am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK product but  manual curler works better.</li>
            <li> felt that my mascara covered my lashes better after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried the manual curler many times,</li>
            <li> hope you love it like I do.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eyelash curler!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more cumbersome than helpful for me.</li>
            <li> I mostly like this for the separating effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I have to say I like this more than I thought</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like the Panasonic Beauty Line Ladies Heated Eyelash Curler</li>
            <li> Then later it says it works best when mascara has already been applied.</li>
            <li> I do love this eyelash curler</li>
            <li> OK</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> But this one takes a lot more time.</li>
            <li> You may have better results using mascara</li>
            <li> it had a much better effect.  </li>
            <li> I saw this device and thought surely this would give me a pain-free curling experience?</li>
            <li> It felt like it needed &#x27;more&#x27; in the length of the plastic teeth</li>
            <li> but I just feel something like this would be impractical for most anyone who doesn&#x27;t spend all day doing their makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> /&gt;This may be better for those with shorter lashes; I think I&#x27;ll stick to my tried-and-true method.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that it said to use before mascara, but find that it works better after you apply mascara.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this,  I received it as a gift and thought it was a great idea for someone to give as a gift since it is not nessecarily a need type item but fun to have.  </li>
            <li> No real instructions included, but watched a video on youtube to see the best way to use this item.</li>
            <li> Uses batteries very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to forget to turn it off, and it does not have automatic shut-off.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> You can touch it easily with your fingers without any burning.</li>
            <li> Curler\\&quot; is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The unit heats up very fast, and the purple-to-pink indicator comes in handy.</li>
            <li> We both thought it heated up quickly and found it was safe and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It also matches perfectly with the other two products!</li>
            <li> But this item did the job just fine.  </li>
            <li> The heat indicater was accurate.  </li>

            <li> the product for free.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, I really got this for my wife to use, but in the interest of reviewing</li>
            <li> When you read the manual, it reads as if it were not written by someone whose primary language is English.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not stupid -</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is so pretty and easy to carry.</li>
            <li> I cannot say if the Panasonic works well since I think its the type of style I have not been able to get the hang of, but it sure is pretty, and more amenable to carrying out in a purse than the clamp type of eyelash curler, assuming it works for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Panasonic sells the same model in Japan, where it is very popular.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited about buying this item to uplift my lashes.  </li>
            <li> When I was offered this eyelash curler to review I was excited.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try this Panasonic heated curler.</li>
            <li> It would be great if it warmed up just a little bit more</li>
            <li> It seems like they would be more effective if the heating aspect could be combined with the traditional crimping curler</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried nearly every eyelash curler out there from Japonesque to Dior and this Panasonic one is definitely the best!</li>
            <li> This product is slightly better than the one by Blinc but is still frustrating at best.  </li>
            <li> it appears to require quite a bit of one&#x27;s time, and I am not even sure they would do much for me since I received the product for free.  </li>
            <li> B000EMWHD2 Tweezerman Classic Eyelash Curler]] and curled my lashes the old fashioned way, and within 2 seconds they were perfectly curled and ready for their close up , Mr. Demille.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It never gets as hot as a curling iron, which is a good thing for something you are putting near your eye.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a warm product that I&#x27;ve pressed directly on the rims of my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, I tried this about two or three times only.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After spending 6 minutes on my top lashes, and the 2 minutes it took to heat this up, my lashes were just as straight as when I started.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;m happy with the Beauty Line.</li>

            <li> always used to see my gf searching for the perfect eyelash curler (shes into the whole beauty thing) while constantly buying replacement cushions for her old one.</li>
            <li> the rolling head make the lashes separate, therefore, when you apply mascara on, it looks very pretty.</li>
            <li> We also tried it on my eyelashes, which are naturally long and curly, and it did a rather good job there</li>
            <li> It many times does not turn on when button is pushed despite a new battery.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty good at straightening those baby hairs at my hairline, so now when I wear my bangs pulled back</li>
            <li> Two of us felt like total derps as we discovered how this device functions, and it&#x27;s sure not intuitive!</li>
            <li> I even went to Youtube to see if there were videos showing other people using this thing successfully in case</li>
            <li> So, with that, I like this one, but I think I would have been fine purchasing a more &#x27;basic&#x27; model that doesn&#x27;t have the rotating functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed what a little AA battery can accomplish in this unit - with regards to rotating the curler and at the same time doing such a good job of heating it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> She used it on naked lashes and didn&#x27;t think it was effective.</li>
            <li> It is a bit of a frivolous item, but could be a fun stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> but I wanted to give it a shot to see if there was a better alternative to my old Revlon manual curler.</li>
            <li> Is it worth it to you?</li>
            <li> But the fact remains, the Panasonic heated curler that I received is not heating up properly, and just isn&#x27;t effective as an eyelash curler as it is.  </li>
            <li> but I could not find success at any level with this thing.</li>
            <li> but I could not find success at any level with this thing.</li>
            <li> I rarely use mascara.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and basically does EXACTLY what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> In any case, one of us loved it and the other was indifferent.</li>
            <li> First, the curler gets very, very hot.  </li>
            <li> (I know, whoa is me, right?)</li>
            <li> Mascara does help some (vs. naked eyelashes), but I&#x27;ve gotten better results from a traditional curler (the kind that pulls and pinches unfortunately).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it to be most effective if I first use the traditional crimping curler then use one of the heated curlers and then follow up with the traditional curler again.</li>
            <li> I have very straight eyelashes</li>
            <li> It is gentle, and not quite as effective on my lashes as a conventional eyelash curler but results in a more natural curl.  </li>
            <li> This heated eyelash curler gets HOT.  </li>
            <li> So hot that I burned a section of my lashes and the lash broke off.  </li>
            <li> Just be aware that your lashes can break using this</li>
            <li> I never felt like it was ever too hot.  </li>
            <li> Turn on curler so it gets a chance to warm up as I normally apply my regular mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working, the color indicator changes and if you take off the curling wand, the heating element is hot.</li>
            <li> I would at first.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It is a nice pink color</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this product and will definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t heat up so hot it burns your skin</li>
            <li> I find this works better to curl my Younique 3D Fiberlash mascara after applying the mascara, rather than using a traditional eyelash curler on them.</li>
            <li> and i really like it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that it got too hot.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic beauty line, EH-SE60VP heated eyelash curler broke after the first use.  </li>
            <li> and then it says to apply mascara first.  </li>
            <li> It warms up pretty quickly--emphasis on \\&quot;warms\\</li>
            <li> and its pink color looks nice</li>
            <li> This works much better then traditional eyelash curlers.</li>
            <li> The adult in the house wasn&#x27;t as excited about it.</li>
            <li> Maybe I still need to give myself a bit more time to overcome the learning curve, but this model doesn&#x27;t work as well for my straight Asian lashes.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes actually stayed curled for more than a day; I bathed in the morning and when it was time to bath again in the evening, my lashes were still very curly and full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and only curl them occasionally because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good for them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice-looking, very portable (more so, I think, than my manual), and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do (think stocking stuffer come the holidays, especially if it&#x27;s on sale).</li>
            <li> You do have to really read the directions to make sure you are using it properly.</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning and it heats up pretty fast.</li>
            <li> The heat of the curler sets a all day long wear that I love because now make-up does not get smudged under my eyes</li>
            <li> I always got the same results; the powered brush would rotate, but the brush would barely get warm at all.  </li>
            <li> This is one handy little gadget.  </li>
            <li> here comes this handy little gadget.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly decent lashes so usually I just slap on mascara and call it good.</li>
            <li> Heat fast.</li>
            <li> after applied mascara it works very well.</li>
            <li> really do the job.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really well made - not</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to wait for the curler to be ready.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten in the rhythm of flipping the on switch for it to heat when I start putting my makeup on so that when I get to the curling part, it is ready to go.</li>
            <li> This curler heats up fast.</li>
            <li> and I really like this one.</li>
            <li> This is a very neat product.  </li>
            <li> but you really do need to change the batteries often.</li>
            <li> The manual wasn&#x27;t much help</li>
            <li> if you are caught in a rain, your lashes will become straight again, not the fault of the Panasonic heated eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> I have a lash on each eye that grows straight out</li>
            <li> even though it didn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> Just pop a battery in it, and you are ready to go.  </li>
            <li> Once you get it ready to go, you just flick the switch and the curler curls away.  </li>
            <li> I would much rather have something that can be re-charged from a wall socket.</li>
            <li> It is also very convenient to travel with.</li>
            <li> , I really, REALLY wanted to like this.</li>
            <li> But it did absolutely nothing to curl my lashes, with or without mascara.</li>
            <li> However, like-minded potential users will be pleased to learn that the Beauty Line works really well prior to applying mascara: just follow the instructions and Voila!--nice curl and eyes that appear more open.</li>
            <li> Mine only took seconds to get hot and cool.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about you, but I don&#x27;t have this kind of time to waste in the morning when I&#x27;m getting ready for work.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*It heats up quickly, and IT GETS HOT ENOUGH TO BURN.</li>
            <li> have relatively long lashes and they seem to curl relatively easily.</li>
            <li> The most the curler did was make my eyelashes stand straight outward (instead of pointing down)</li>
            <li> It heated up quite quickly and was easy to use and really like that it was small compact and had a cover</li>
            <li> I save it for nights out or special events, or if I have extra time in the morning</li>
            <li> I love that the next day when I get to curl my eyelashes again that they are still mostly curled from the day before, that certainly never happened with my prior eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> The kind of cheese-paring business mentality that can&#x27;t be bothered to include a single AA battery is especially galling to find in a company that happens to manufacture batteries.</li>
            <li> I desperately wanted to love it, felt it would somehow fill my previously-unknown need for sexy curled lashes!</li>
            <li> I desperately wanted to love it, felt it would somehow fill my previously-unknown need for sexy curled lashes!</li>
            <li> The unit is small and handy, and there are plenty of warranty and replacement forms that accompany the product.</li>
            <li> She said that the curl didn&#x27;t stay all that well on natural eyelashes, but when she put on mascara first then used the curler</li>
            <li> I absolutely cannot live without this product I have purchased three now</li>
            <li> , I could not get a decent curl to save my life.</li>
            <li> For that and its price, it loses a star; I think buyers deserve to be able to use one-battery devices right out of the box.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with high hopes of never having to use an old-fashioned eyelash curler again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> It works very well, gets hot enough and keeps eye lashes curled.</li>
            <li> Both my wife and my daughter initially complained about the hot plastic, but I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> I suppose if you&#x27;re obsessed with your eyes looking perfect and have long lashes alreay, this might be just the ticket.  </li>
            <li> the thought of baking mascara into my lashes (even at a comfortably low temperature) just doesn&#x27;t hit me right.</li>
            <li> You can change which way it rotates, which is a necessary feature for switching from the right to</li>
            <li> you push the arrow either left or right depending</li>
            <li> the cheap plastic that I&#x27;ve seen before on other eyelash</li>
            <li> This time, i decided to give this new model a try.</li>
            <li> I like it however I can live without it</li>
            <li> Even bought new cells from the store and tried them.  </li>
            <li> It is an utter waste of time unless you are the kind of person who spends 2 hours doing her face - what&#x27;s another 20 minutes</li>
            <li> I even looked like I had lush lashes!</li>
            <li> Yes it gets hot enough, but it doesn&#x27;t curl my lashes whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty big downside</li>
            <li> cause how could something so dazzling and with batteries fail you?</li>
            <li> It was also an adjustment putting my mascara on first before curling, I always did the opposite with the \\&quot;pinch\\&quot; type of curlers.  </li>
            <li> Somewhere in the upper echelons of Panasonic is a room full of suited up men, who are having a giant Larf at our expense.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Beauty Line Ladies Heated Eyelash Curler in vivid pink is tiny and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> comes with a little booklet with DETAILED instructions on how to use this.  </li>
            <li> But I prefer the old one.</li>
            <li> have straight but dense Asian eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I bought this directly from Panasonic and I like it.</li>
            <li> I have completely disregarded my mascara with this product.</li>
            <li> For the record, I have incredibly long lashes (thanks, Dad!)</li>
            <li> I have Asian stick straight lashes and</li>
            <li> After using it several times she really started getting used it</li>
            <li> I have medium-length lashes with some natural curl.</li>
            <li> used the curler several times and it did nothing for my stick straight lashes.  </li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t like the rotating action of the brush, and worried that eyelashes could snag and be ripped out by the brush.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t personally notice much curl to my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> It did heat up as advertised but without the rotating action there was no curled lashes.</li>
            <li> My wife is Japanese, so her hair, including her lashes, is very stubborn when it comes to curling.  </li>
            <li> This device isn&#x27;t worth to waste that much of my time.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like playing with make-up a bit more than usual!</li>
            <li> shiny, its pink, and it looks like its gonna curl the curlness right into your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This curler never gets hot enough to actually curl eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have long but straight eyelashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After quite a few attempts, I returned the batteries back into my remote control and grabbed my handy dandy</li>
            <li> also that I don&#x27;t use this daily; for me, those steps and the resulting look would be too much for my daily &#x27;go-to-work&#x27; look.</li>
            <li> I had clicked on the more expensive ones and the description and reviews are exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I tried other methods:&lt;br /&gt;Tried using Mascara first, no luck.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> Now, when I barely curled the lashes, they didn&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li> When I use this product after putting on several coats of mascara, it basically takes the mascara off completely.  </li>
            <li> You need to wait 1 to 2 minutes for the purple dot to turn pink, then you are ready to curl.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know why I thought there could be something better, why fix what isn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> However, my product is either defective or just isn&#x27;t effective at all, and Panasonic support is too tedious to bother with.  </li>
            <li> However, my product is either defective or just isn&#x27;t effective at all, and Panasonic support is too tedious to bother with.  </li>
            <li> My only comment is; I find it very strange that the Panasonic EH-SE60VP heated eyelash curler (same exact model number) varies in price from $18.93 to 79.59.</li>
            <li> hate dissing a Panasonic product as everything else I own by this company has been super.</li>
            <li> I have very pale lashes, I have to really coat them with mascara to look like I have lashes, and they are straight.</li>
            <li> I spent an hour trying to decipher the hieroglyphs on them, and finally figured it out after realizing a 3 year old on a cookie high illustrated them.  </li>
            <li> I then gave it the benefit of the doubt by making sure the mascara was fully dried after few hours....</li>
            <li> I followed the directions in the manual and spent at least 3 minutes on each of my top lashes.</li>
            <li> She was a little scared to try it at first.  </li>
            <li> Do not underestimate just how hot a &#x27;little battery&#x27; can make a Q-tip sized device that can sizzle your eyeballs</li>
            <li> Do not underestimate just how hot a &#x27;little battery&#x27; can make a Q-tip sized device that can sizzle your eyeballs</li>
            <li> but apparently there must be some engineering issue that prevents anyone from designing such a tool.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It did finally build up with pressing lashing against the curler and holding it a while.&lt;br /&gt;There result was no different than manual curler as far as amount of curl and length lasting.</li>
            <li> She got a little curl out of it, but noticed that it pretty much took off half the mascara she&#x27;d applied.</li>
            <li> Given the somewhat low cost of the product, I personally don&#x27;t feel it is worth the wasted time to try and work through all of the red tape at Panasonic, to get my test device replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> When I&#x27;m using plain mascara, I curl first.</li>
            <li> The rotating comb stops working every time I attempt to curl my eyelashes using this thing!&lt;br /&gt;Anddd the teeth really should have been slightly elongated...</li>
            <li> With my unskilled hands, I actually tapped my eyeballs a few times trying it out with no ill effects.  </li>
            <li> much as I love pink, as much as I was desperate for this to work for me, it was not to be.</li>
            <li> much as I love pink, as much as I was desperate for this to work for me, it was not to be.</li>
            <li> It gets very warm as you apply it to the base of your lashes</li>
            <li> Batteries seem to last long enough, she has used it for 2 months without changing them.</li>
            <li> For me, it took less than 1 minute for the indicator to turn from purple to pink (ready mode).  </li>
            <li> Considering the number of times I have burned myself with a curling or flat iron, I was somewhat leary of trying this.</li>
            <li> Long lasting curl.</li>
            <li> She tells me how the heat of the curler sets her eyelash&#x27;s curl to last all day long.</li>
            <li> I felt like the nerd who had a crush on the football player, only to find out that he farts and scratches himself and is completely not for her.</li>
            <li> I felt like the nerd who had a crush on the football player, only to find out that he farts and scratches himself and is completely not for her.</li>
            <li> I am surprised since a previous Panasonic curler lasted for years.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, who claim that their heated eyelash curler burned them, or the heat damaged their eyelashes, my Panasonic heated curler barely got over room temperature.  </li>
            <li> I learned that as of that day there were NO videos about THIS item, and that with other products apparently even men can curl their lashes with a heated curler.</li>
            <li> What a letdown.that with other products apparently even men can curl their lashes with a heated curler.</li>
            <li> It was sort of awkward using it in the beginning with the rotating brushes and the heat, but now that I have gotten used to it, I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Not for me, I was never able to use and basically threw my money away, went back to my old fashioned eye lash curlers</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the flat one for regular use due to the shape of the brush.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes</li>
            <li> My lashes stays curled all day long.</li>
            <li> This was used by my middle school aged daughter as she Is into these things.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been blessed with long lashes, about 1/3\\&quot; long, thick but STRAIGHT.</li>
            <li> So long, in fact, that if I don&#x27;t curl them they brush against my glasses.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not the type of person to cake on tons of makeup everyday, but I always like to look awake and fresh and that usually starts with my eyes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Future personal injury case subject, future recall product.</li>
            <li> It is a little tricky to use thought i just use it to get my end lashes to curl back you know the tricky ones you never get in a regular eye lash curler.</li>
            <li> This was part of my gf&#x27;s present, which included two other Panasonic Women&#x27;s Products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Let the mascara dry a bit.&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li> I had high hopes of this helping my sad little eyelashes, but NOTHING on it worked on the first try.</li>
            <li> It operates on a single AA battery which is not included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li> I know of several instances of users pulling out their lashes and even if used carefully, one has to be very careful.</li>
            <li> The device heats up, and rotates, you must press it to your eyelashes and maneuver the button and hold it down, to the left, press upwards, all while managing not to sear your eyeball like a grilled grape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can definitely feel the heat from it on your eyelid but that it isn&#x27;t so hot that it makes me uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> and it only slightly changed the angle on them.  </li>
            <li> She eventually built up the nerve to try it anyway, and although relieved that it didn&#x27;t rip out her precious lashes, she was extremely disappointed overall.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several times over the past couple of years to use various versions of this type of eyelash curler</li>
            <li> Her only thing she doesn&#x27;t like is that it takes a minute and a half to heat up.  </li>
            <li> Only used a few times before it stopped working.</li>
            <li> Hotter than I expected.  </li>
            <li> It did not work for me as I expected.</li>
            <li> Not as expected.  </li>
            <li> (insert bitter</li>
            <li> I tried curling more at the base and them to the tip.&lt;br /&gt;The middle first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rotation is pretty useless also.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful due to some of the other reviews I had read about this product.</li>
            <li> I did attempt to contact Panasonic by phone, but after excessive hold times and transfers, I finally gave up.  </li>
            <li> It may be due to the lack of heat, but she found that this product didn&#x27;t curl her eyelashes a noticeable amount at all.  </li>
            <li> have problems with my grip due to carpal tunnel syndrome, and it was just too tricky for me to do two things at once with this device (push button to turn rotation on, hold at correct angle)</li>
            <li> other words</li>
            <li> Plus, I could feel the heat when I got it near the rims of my eyes, and when I&#x27;m in a hurry, or haven&#x27;t had my morning coffee yet, I can see this item getting a little too close where I may burn that delicate rim</li>
            <li> It does heat quickly but seemed a bit dangerous to have around eyes.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately when it arrived it rotated only once for the curling action then would no longer rotate.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> However, I found it so massively tedious and ineffective that I never was really motivated to give it another whirl.</li>
            <li> this might make the difference, but for me it&#x27;s not worth the time.</li>
            <li> I have asian black medium length thick eyelash.</li>
            <li> This gizmo was just not worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li> If you have pets or small children in the room when you are using it be careful.  </li>
            <li> It never got hotter than lukewarm, and sitting there for half an hour trying to make a little wand go around</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to, but practice makes perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money and time.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> After reading the directions several times, I still was confused as to how to work it -</li>
            <li> She felt that the product is geared toward teen-age girls, and says it just seems gimmicky.  </li>
            <li> Waste of my time.</li>
            <li> About the only complaint I have is that battery operated items can be annoying, with the need to keep a fresh supply of batteries on hand.  </li>
            <li> Just to save you the trouble, you have to slide the SILVER button with the arrow toggle on it, UP, to make the device start heating.</li>
            <li> I use it just about everyday.</li>
            <li> then, if you are a make up diva of that level, then you are probably using false eyelashes, gluing them individually, so then you don&#x27;t need this</li>
            <li> This product did absolutly nothing for my eyelashes, useless, a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The process is easy, I just start the brush rotating and the slowly follow it up from the base to tip of my lashes.  </li>
            <li> JUST A LITTLE TOUCH WITH THIS CURLER, AND THE JOB IS DONE!</li>
            <li> This unit is very hard to use and not what I expected.</li>
            <li> instructions are a little confusing..</li>
            <li> NO MORE PINCHING THE EYELIDS OR PULLING OUT LASHES.</li>
            <li> She feels that a heated, rotating brush near one&#x27;s eye seems rather dangerous.  </li>
            <li> She said that with the manual curler, she always yanks out at least a few.  </li>
            <li> can cause burns or injury, as you do have to get pretty close to the base of the lash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since she is always running behind that can slow her down.  </li>
            <li> and I found the curler hard to manage.  </li>
            <li> It was a bit awkward figuring out how to hold it properly, but after I got over my fear</li>
            <li> But at least I can confirm that you aren&#x27;t going to put your eyes out using this heated curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least once a week I accidentally get it too close and pinch my eyelid, and every so often I wind up pulling out an eyelash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick lashes either.  </li>
            <li> only things I found annoying about the Beauty Line were its lack of an enclosed AA battery and its list price (extreme for what it is and where it&#x27;s manufactured).</li>
            <li> I have very small eyes, so I was looking for an eyelash curler that I could get to curl my eyelashes without pinching my skin .</li>
            <li> I read the instructions for this product and was confused.  </li>
            <li> Alas...</li>
            <li> Alas...</li>
            <li> If you happen to drop it, you&#x27;ve broken it.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful when you start at the base of the eyelashes, not to get burned.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes look fake.</li>
            <li> People even ask me if they are fake.</li>
            <li> and it is difficult to push in and hold the button that makes it spin.</li>
            <li> It is useless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*First of all, the manual is mostly useless.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> it was hard to position this thing to get to the base of them.</li>
            <li> it was hard to position this thing to get to the base of them.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I&#x27;ve always found it impossible to catch the lashes at either corner, so I thought I&#x27;d see what an electric curler was like.&lt;br</li>
            <li> to the bad part.  </li>
            <li> I used an old-fashioned eyelash curler once, and pinched myself so badly that I never used it again.....</li>
            <li> I am rather disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Worst thing ever, totally useless</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> guess my eyelashes will have to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It did not curl my lashes and was very awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I hate that thing...</li>
            <li> The directions state to place the curler at the base of your eyelashes for 3 seconds to make the eyelashes stand at their base.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just an idiot.</li>
            <li> I hated this thing.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was very happy to receive this heated eyelash curler. It works very well, gets hot enough and keeps eye lashes curled. Well worth the money and it arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li> Only used a few times before it stopped working. Uses batteries very quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought both this and the Panasonic EH2351AC Heated Eyelash Curling Wand to see which was better.  The truth is they are both OK but neither is great.  It seems like they would be more effective if the heating aspect could be combined with the traditional crimping curler but apparently there must be some engineering issue that prevents anyone from designing such a tool.  I&#x27;ve found it to be most effective if I first use the traditional crimping curler then use one of the heated curlers and then follow up with the traditional curler again.</li>
            <li> Heat fast. Easy to use. It is better to use after mascara and use mascara again after using the curler. But I prefer the old one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic&#x27;s blue heated eyelash curler for years now. This time, i decided to give this new model a try. Maybe I still need to give myself a bit more time to overcome the learning curve, but this model doesn&#x27;t work as well for my straight Asian lashes. In using this, I realize that I need to hold the eyelash curler in place for a few seconds for my lashes to really curl. When using this curler, I will move it up my lashes a bit at a time and hold it in between to try to get the same look. But I&#x27;m not getting the same results, so have gone back to the blue one for the moment.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT. IT CURLS MY EYELASHES SO EASILYAND MAKES THEM LOOK GREAT. NO MORE PINCHING THE EYELIDS OR PULLING OUT LASHES. JUST A LITTLE TOUCH WITH THIS CURLER, AND THE JOB IS DONE!</li>
            <li> I like it however I can live without it</li>
            <li> It worked well initially, but gave out after about 1 month.  I am rather disappointed.  I am surprised since a previous Panasonic curler lasted for years.</li>
            <li> Considering the number of times I have burned myself with a curling or flat iron, I was somewhat leary of trying this. Good news, while it does get very warm I still have both my eyes and no burns! I have very pale lashes, I have to really coat them with mascara to look like I have lashes, and they are straight. I don&#x27;t much care for regular eyelash curlers as they always manage to pinch and pull a few lashes out. This one is used after mascara is applied, and it did curl the lashes nicely. I even looked like I had lush lashes! I had no idea anything like this existed, but am so glad I found it. It certainly isn&#x27;t a must have item, but it is a nice bonus item (would be great as a stocking stuffer too).</li>
            <li> I absolutely cannot live without this product I have purchased three now and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> When I got this , I used it immediately. But it did&#x27;t work! Awful quality! Because I am not in the US, I can&#x27;t return it back to Amazon. Waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything. Yes it gets hot enough, but it doesn&#x27;t curl my lashes whatsoever. The rotation is pretty useless also. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This unit is very hard to use and not what I expected. It&#x27;s OK product but  manual curler works better.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Beauty Line Ladies Heated Eyelash Curler in vivid pink is tiny and easy to use.  It heats up quickly and basically does EXACTLY what it says it will do.  My eyelashes actually stayed curled for more than a day; I bathed in the morning and when it was time to bath again in the evening, my lashes were still very curly and full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt that my mascara covered my lashes better after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the bad part.  This heated eyelash curler gets HOT.  Hotter than I expected.  So hot that I burned a section of my lashes and the lash broke off.  It&#x27;s a pretty big downside I think. I simply left it on my lashes longer than necessary.  Now, when I barely curled the lashes, they didn&#x27;t burn.  Just be aware that your lashes can break using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie S. for Amazon Vine</li>
            <li> No real instructions included, but watched a video on youtube to see the best way to use this item.</li>
            <li> after applied mascara it works very well.</li>
            <li> Worst thing ever, totally useless</li>
            <li> It did not work for me as I expected.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
            <li> This is one handy little gadget.  I have long lashes and I&#x27;ve tried the manual curler many times, only the have the rubber seal stick to my lashes and pull them out.  I hate that thing...:(&lt;br /&gt;Now here comes this handy little gadget.  Your curl your lashes BEFORE you put on your mascara.  It gets very warm as you apply it to the base of your lashes, it gets them to stand up and curl back toward the lid.  Mission accomplised with no lashes lost....now I apply my mascara to my already curled lashes.&lt;br /&gt;This comes with a little booklet with DETAILED instructions on how to use this.  I think this is really a great addition to my makeup routine....hope you love it like I do.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eyelash curler!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not the type of person to cake on tons of makeup everyday, but I always like to look awake and fresh and that usually starts with my eyes.  The best and easiest way to make your face look bright and beautiful is to curl and lengthen your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried nearly every eyelash curler out there from Japonesque to Dior and this Panasonic one is definitely the best! The comb is heated and it rotates.  I&#x27;ve never seen an eyelash curler with this feature before - and it&#x27;s really well made - not the cheap plastic that I&#x27;ve seen before on other eyelash curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this a 10 out of 10 and would definitely recommend to all or buy as a gift for my mom, sisters and friends!</li>
            <li> For me, it took less than 1 minute for the indicator to turn from purple to pink (ready mode).  It&#x27;s recommended to apply mascara first, and it usually takes me 2 minutes or so to apply mascara so I didn&#x27;t have to wait for the curler to be ready.  It operates on a single AA battery which is not included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The directions state to place the curler at the base of your eyelashes for 3 seconds to make the eyelashes stand at their base.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Move the comb towards the tips of your eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Curl the tips by turning on the rotator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have straight but dense Asian eyelashes.  The most the curler did was make my eyelashes stand straight outward (instead of pointing down) but I never did get any sort of curl.  Mascara does help some (vs. naked eyelashes), but I&#x27;ve gotten better results from a traditional curler (the kind that pulls and pinches unfortunately).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike others, I&#x27;ve not had a problem with burns whatsoever.  It&#x27;s just a warm product that I&#x27;ve pressed directly on the rims of my eyelids.  I never felt like it was ever too hot.  I could press it against my face and not worry about getting singed.  It feels as warm as a blow dryer on low/medium heat.</li>
            <li> I bought this directly from Panasonic and I like it. I thought the rotating feature would be awesome, but I&#x27;m finding that I don&#x27;t use it at all. It&#x27;s more cumbersome than helpful for me. So, with that, I like this one, but I think I would have been fine purchasing a more &#x27;basic&#x27; model that doesn&#x27;t have the rotating functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, my routine includes:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Turn on curler so it gets a chance to warm up as I normally apply my regular mascara. Let the mascara dry a bit.&lt;br /&gt;2.) Once curler is heated up, go to town separating and using the curler to amp up the curl on the lashes. I especially like this curler for the separating effect if provides me.&lt;br /&gt;3.) Go back to regular mascara and reapply. I find the second coat of mascara adds additional volume and length, but the lashes still stay separated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have relatively long lashes and they seem to curl relatively easily. I mostly like this for the separating effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note also that I don&#x27;t use this daily; for me, those steps and the resulting look would be too much for my daily &#x27;go-to-work&#x27; look. I save it for nights out or special events, or if I have extra time in the morning and I feel like playing with make-up a bit more than usual!</li>
            <li> Somewhere in the upper echelons of Panasonic is a room full of suited up men, who are having a giant Larf at our expense. They are guffawing, and slapping their knees, and toasting with gold goblets filled with money-wine that they fooled thousands of women into buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its shiny, its pink, and it looks like its gonna curl the curlness right into your eyelashes. You BELIEVE in it, cause how could something so dazzling and with batteries fail you? I did everything the unintelligible directions told me. I spent an hour trying to decipher the hieroglyphs on them, and finally figured it out after realizing a 3 year old on a cookie high illustrated them.  The device heats up, and rotates, you must press it to your eyelashes and maneuver the button and hold it down, to the left, press upwards, all while managing not to sear your eyeball like a grilled grape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After quite a few attempts, I returned the batteries back into my remote control and grabbed my handy dandy [[ASIN:B000EMWHD2 Tweezerman Classic Eyelash Curler]] and curled my lashes the old fashioned way, and within 2 seconds they were perfectly curled and ready for their close up , Mr. Demille.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone says this works, they are just experiencing buyers remorse and are wishing it to be so.</li>
            <li> It was probably my fault but I could never could get these to work, even though I bought them based on a recommendation I read on a beauty magazine article. Not for me, I was never able to use and basically threw my money away, went back to my old fashioned eye lash curlers, I don&#x27;t know why I thought there could be something better, why fix what isn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> This curler never gets hot enough to actually curl eyelashes. It&#x27;s working, the color indicator changes and if you take off the curling wand, the heating element is hot. But it just isn&#x27;t enough heat to make a difference through the plastic curling wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the instructions are contradictory. The box says for best results to use the curler after applying mascara, but the inside paper directions clearly state that for best results to use it before applying mascara. I suppose both can be \\&quot;best\\&quot; when neither works, but I don&#x27;t think that was what they were going for.</li>
            <li> This product was used by two of us in our house and we&#x27;ll share both opinions. The teenager in the house loves this item. She thought it did a great job and made her lashes curly as promised. We both thought it heated up quickly and found it was safe and easy to use. The adult in the house wasn&#x27;t as excited about it. She doesn&#x27;t wear mascara and the directions do instruct the user to apply mascara before curling and again after curling. She used it on naked lashes and didn&#x27;t think it was effective. Maybe the mascara helps the lashes to curl. In any case, one of us loved it and the other was indifferent. It is a bit of a frivolous item, but could be a fun stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need this.  It is an utter waste of time unless you are the kind of person who spends 2 hours doing her face - what&#x27;s another 20 minutes then?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then, if you are a make up diva of that level, then you are probably using false eyelashes, gluing them individually, so then you don&#x27;t need this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also agree with some of the others that repeated use or one-time carelessness can cause burns or injury, as you do have to get pretty close to the base of the lash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Future personal injury case subject, future recall product.</li>
            <li> I have to say I like this more than I thought I would at first.  It was sort of awkward using it in the beginning with the rotating brushes and the heat, but now that I have gotten used to it, I absolutely love it.  It was also an adjustment putting my mascara on first before curling, I always did the opposite with the \\&quot;pinch\\&quot; type of curlers.  I have gotten in the rhythm of flipping the on switch for it to heat when I start putting my makeup on so that when I get to the curling part, it is ready to go. I would say it take about a minute to heat up.  You can definitely feel the heat from it on your eyelid but that it isn&#x27;t so hot that it makes me uncomfortable.  The process is easy, I just start the brush rotating and the slowly follow it up from the base to tip of my lashes.  Easy and immediate results!  I love that the next day when I get to curl my eyelashes again that they are still mostly curled from the day before, that certainly never happened with my prior eyelash curler.  I have been using it for 3 weeks and the battery is still going strong, so I am a happy girl!</li>
            <li> This heated eyelash curler seems to work.  It is gentle, and not quite as effective on my lashes as a conventional eyelash curler but results in a more natural curl.  One thing to be alert to:  It is easy to forget to turn it off, and it does not have automatic shut-off.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  This gizmo was just not worth the trouble.  A non-heated lash curler works just as well for the occasional times I want to curl my lashes, and I don&#x27;t have to wait for that to heat up or remember to turn it off.</li>
            <li> This item works as advertised. Both my wife and my daughter initially complained about the hot plastic, but I&#x27;m sure and I can already see that this takes some adjusting. Since the heat helps the curling, we do not see it as a fault of the product. The unit heats up very fast, and the purple-to-pink indicator comes in handy. Just be careful when you start at the base of the eyelashes, not to get burned. The unit is small and handy, and there are plenty of warranty and replacement forms that accompany the product. I&#x27;m impressed what a little AA battery can accomplish in this unit - with regards to rotating the curler and at the same time doing such a good job of heating it.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is amazing! It works wonders with my eyelashes! It makes my eyelashes look fake. People even ask me if they are fake. I have completely disregarded my mascara with this product. I use it in the morning and it heats up pretty fast. The heat of the curler sets a all day long wear that I love because now make-up does not get smudged under my eyes ;) It is a nice pink color and I can carry it with me anywhere I go. I am completely satisfied with this product and will definitely recommend it to anyone! I am also very impressed with the Panasonic Beauty Line. Technology is making it convenient to look beautiful &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Great idea but, it did not work well.  It did not curl my lashes and was very awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like the Panasonic Beauty Line Ladies Heated Eyelash Curler but I wanted to give it a shot to see if there was a better alternative to my old Revlon manual curler. For the record, I have incredibly long lashes (thanks, Dad!) and only curl them occasionally because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good for them. I know of several instances of users pulling out their lashes and even if used carefully, one has to be very careful. Regardless, I&#x27;ve always found it impossible to catch the lashes at either corner, so I thought I&#x27;d see what an electric curler was like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I was happy to find was that the Beauty Line doesn&#x27;t get very hot at all--it&#x27;s comfortably warm. I should mention that the instructions state to curl after applying mascara but this is something I didn&#x27;t do with a manual curler and wouldn&#x27;t do with a heated one either; the thought of baking mascara into my lashes (even at a comfortably low temperature) just doesn&#x27;t hit me right. However, like-minded potential users will be pleased to learn that the Beauty Line works really well prior to applying mascara: just follow the instructions and Voila!--nice curl and eyes that appear more open. And the best part is that I can curl the outer edges, too, and with no pinching and/or fear of pulling them out (which, let&#x27;s face it, can&#x27;t be healthful for lashes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only things I found annoying about the Beauty Line were its lack of an enclosed AA battery and its list price (extreme for what it is and where it&#x27;s manufactured). The kind of cheese-paring business mentality that can&#x27;t be bothered to include a single AA battery is especially galling to find in a company that happens to manufacture batteries. For that and its price, it loses a star; I think buyers deserve to be able to use one-battery devices right out of the box. Other than that, I&#x27;m happy with the Beauty Line. It&#x27;s nice-looking, very portable (more so, I think, than my manual), and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do (think stocking stuffer come the holidays, especially if it&#x27;s on sale). Who knows, maybe I&#x27;ll start to curl my lashes every time I apply mascara (which I also avoid when possible).</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t heat up so hot it burns your skin and it is difficult to push in and hold the button that makes it spin. Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the flat one for regular use due to the shape of the brush. It would be great if it warmed up just a little bit more and you could click the button in place to make it circulate instead of having to keep a finger on it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes of this helping my sad little eyelashes, but NOTHING on it worked on the first try. The button didn&#x27;t move in any direction. I guess I got a dud. Since it was a test product, I can&#x27;t exchange it. Bummer.&lt;br /&gt;I guess my eyelashes will have to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I tried this about two or three times only. However, I found it so massively tedious and ineffective that I never was really motivated to give it another whirl. It never got hotter than lukewarm, and sitting there for half an hour trying to make a little wand go around (the button to make it spin didn&#x27;t work well on mine) isn&#x27;t the best use of my time.</li>
            <li> I find this works better to curl my Younique 3D Fiberlash mascara after applying the mascara, rather than using a traditional eyelash curler on them. It takes a little getting used to, but practice makes perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are a little confusing.. in one place they say to curl your lashes before applying your mascara. Then later it says it works best when mascara has already been applied. So I suggest you just try it both ways and see which way you like best, and which works best for the mascara you use. When I&#x27;m using plain mascara, I curl first. When I use my Younique 3D Fiberlash Macara, I curl after.</li>
            <li> Long lasting curl. Works well with or without mascara. This curler heats up fast. I have had several heated curlers and I really like this one.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and i really like it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as good as I was hoping it would.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know there was such a thing as a heated eyelash curler.  This is a very neat product.  Easy to use and effective.  The only fault I could find is that the battery only lasts for 42 minutes.  That means you&#x27;ll be replacing the battery about once a month.  Is it worth it to you?</li>
            <li> I do love this eyelash curler but you really do need to change the batteries often. It is a little tricky to use thought i just use it to get my end lashes to curl back you know the tricky ones you never get in a regular eye lash curler.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful due to some of the other reviews I had read about this product. But it just did not work for me the way I had hoped. I tried both with mascara and without. I&#x27;ll stick to my regular curler thank you.</li>
            <li> Not as expected.  It many times does not turn on when button is pushed despite a new battery.  Works OK but I would never buy again.</li>
            <li> Maybe you need longer eyelashes than I have but this just did not work for me.  The manual wasn&#x27;t much help and I found the curler hard to manage.  It does heat quickly but seemed a bit dangerous to have around eyes.  I suppose if you&#x27;re obsessed with your eyes looking perfect and have long lashes alreay, this might be just the ticket.  But for me, it&#x27;s a bust.</li>
            <li> I have asian black medium length thick eyelash. It doesn&#x27;t work on my eyelash at all. It take hours to make it curl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian.  I was so excited about buying this item to uplift my lashes.  Not.....  It doesn&#x27;t curl the lashes at all.  A nice tube of mascara does a much better job.  When I use this product after putting on several coats of mascara, it basically takes the mascara off completely.  I then gave it the benefit of the doubt by making sure the mascara was fully dried after few hours.... same thing happened.  What a waste of money and time.  Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> After reading the directions, I have no problems using this Panasonic heated eyelash curler.  I have Asian stick straight lashes and this heated curler does the job wonderfully. My lashes stays curled all day long. Now. . . if you are caught in a rain, your lashes will become straight again, not the fault of the Panasonic heated eyelash curler. My only comment is; I find it very strange that the Panasonic EH-SE60VP heated eyelash curler (same exact model number) varies in price from $18.93 to 79.59. I paid $18.93 for mine. I had clicked on the more expensive ones and the description and reviews are exactly the same. This review is written by Linda ,wife of Frederick, who uses the above mentioned product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with high hopes of never having to use an old-fashioned eyelash curler again. Those can pinch &amp; pull out lashes. After reading the directions several times, I still was confused as to how to work it - in the printed directions there were 2 opposing instructions. I&#x27;m not stupid - I have a college degree - but I still have not used this Panasonic Heated Eyelash Curler even once.</li>
            <li> This product is slightly better than the one by Blinc but is still frustrating at best.  After having used the Christian Dior eyelash curler - nothing compares! I can only hope that they will start selling it again.  As for this one as well as the Blinc, is going in the garbage.</li>
            <li> This was part of my gf&#x27;s present, which included two other Panasonic Women&#x27;s Products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always used to see my gf searching for the perfect eyelash curler (shes into the whole beauty thing) while constantly buying replacement cushions for her old one. So i decided to buy this for her in hopes that she stops looking for such a simple thing. After using it several times she really started getting used it and she loved the results. She tells me how the heat of the curler sets her eyelash&#x27;s curl to last all day long. The curlers design also prevents her from getting hurt since there&#x27;s no clamping involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curler&#x27;s sleek portable case makes it simple for her to carry it with her anywhere she goes - allowing for any necessary touchups throughout the day. It also matches perfectly with the other two products!</li>
            <li> I like the design.  I also like the case.  The heat indicater was accurate.  Mine only took seconds to get hot and cool.  I blew on it to speed the cooling.  I didn&#x27;t find that it got too hot.  Just warm.  You can touch it easily with your fingers without any burning. It was a bit awkward figuring out how to hold it properly, but after I got over my fear it ws okay.  I have a lash on each eye that grows straight out and it only slightly changed the angle on them.  I don&#x27;t have thick lashes either.  My only problem is that it just didn&#x27;t work on my lashes.</li>
            <li> Panasonic beauty line, EH-SE60VP heated eyelash curler broke after the first use.  It also made me fear that I would burn my eyeball.  It did not do a good job of curling my eyelashes.  If I could give this device \\&quot;no\\&quot; stars, I would.  I hated this thing.  Please don&#x27;t bother with it.  It is useless.</li>
            <li> I used the instructions to the T. I tried other methods:&lt;br /&gt;Tried using Mascara first, no luck.&lt;br /&gt;Then mascara last, no luck.&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried curling more at the base and them to the tip.&lt;br /&gt;The middle first.&lt;br /&gt;The tip first.&lt;br /&gt;No LUCK&lt;br /&gt;Bottom side first.&lt;br /&gt;Top side first.&lt;br /&gt;No LUCK.&lt;br /&gt;It did finally build up with pressing lashing against the curler and holding it a while.&lt;br /&gt;There result was no different than manual curler as far as amount of curl and length lasting. But this one takes a lot more time. I have medium-length lashes with some natural curl. If your manual curler isn&#x27;t work for you then this might make the difference, but for me it&#x27;s not worth the time.</li>
            <li> When I was offered this eyelash curler to review I was excited.  I have very straight eyelashes and I have been using a metallic eyelash curler for years... even though it didn&#x27;t work very well.  I read the instructions for this product and was confused.  In one place it says to use it without mascara and then it says to apply mascara first.  I used it without mascara.  First, the curler gets very, very hot.  If you have pets or small children in the room when you are using it be careful.  If they bump into you the curler could burn your eye or surrounding skin.  That was a big turnoff for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the curler several times and it did nothing for my stick straight lashes.  I didn&#x27;t even come away with the slightest curl.  You may have better results using mascara but I don&#x27;t use mascara so I can&#x27;t vouch for that method.</li>
            <li> The rotating comb stops working every time I attempt to curl my eyelashes using this thing!&lt;br /&gt;Anddd the teeth really should have been slightly elongated...</li>
            <li> Like the heat but maybe it is me but the curling part just does not seem to work like the directions.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutly nothing for my eyelashes, useless, a complete waste of money. My advice: Keep your money in your pocket.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, who claim that their heated eyelash curler burned them, or the heat damaged their eyelashes, my Panasonic heated curler barely got over room temperature.  I tried replacing the batteries several times.  Even bought new cells from the store and tried them.  I always got the same results; the powered brush would rotate, but the brush would barely get warm at all.  I have tried leaving it on for several minutes before use with no change in temperature.  I did attempt to contact Panasonic by phone, but after excessive hold times and transfers, I finally gave up.  This device isn&#x27;t worth to waste that much of my time.  If I had bought it from Amazon or a local, I would have returned it for exchange or refund.  However, as I received it as part of the Amazon Vine Program, what I got is what I got, and it looks like what I got is quite possibly defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife did test the Panasonic curler, even without the brush heating properly.  She was a little scared to try it at first.  She didn&#x27;t like the rotating action of the brush, and worried that eyelashes could snag and be ripped out by the brush.  She eventually built up the nerve to try it anyway, and although relieved that it didn&#x27;t rip out her precious lashes, she was extremely disappointed overall.  It may be due to the lack of heat, but she found that this product didn&#x27;t curl her eyelashes a noticeable amount at all.  She felt that the product is geared toward teen-age girls, and says it just seems gimmicky.  She feels that a heated, rotating brush near one&#x27;s eye seems rather dangerous.  Now that is only her personal opinion, so please take it with a grain of salt.  But the fact remains, the Panasonic heated curler that I received is not heating up properly, and just isn&#x27;t effective as an eyelash curler as it is.  Trying to get Panasonic product support to replace or repair it appears to require quite a bit of one&#x27;s time, and I am not even sure they would do much for me since I received the product for free.  Given the somewhat low cost of the product, I personally don&#x27;t feel it is worth the wasted time to try and work through all of the red tape at Panasonic, to get my test device replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving the product two stars, as I am a gadget person, and think this is a great concept product.  However, my product is either defective or just isn&#x27;t effective at all, and Panasonic support is too tedious to bother with.  I wish Panasonic the best of luck with this product, and thank Amazon for the opportunity to test and review this item.ved the product for free.

            <li> My eye got injured by using this product. Waste of my time. Doesn&#x27;t work. Ending up return this.... Would just buy a manual one</li>
            <li> To be honest, I really got this for my wife to use, but in the interest of reviewing I figured I could spend a day with curly lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Panasonic Beauty Line Ladies Heated Eyelash Curler\\&quot; is easy to use.  Just pop a battery in it, and you are ready to go.  It warms up pretty quickly--emphasis on \\&quot;warms\\&quot; up.  It never gets as hot as a curling iron, which is a good thing for something you are putting near your eye.  With my unskilled hands, I actually tapped my eyeballs a few times trying it out with no ill effects.  Once you get it ready to go, you just flick the switch and the curler curls away.  You can change which way it rotates, which is a necessary feature for switching from the right to the left eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t personally notice much curl to my eyelashes.  Maybe you have to hold it on longer, or use some technique I haven&#x27;t mastered.  But at least I can confirm that you aren&#x27;t going to put your eyes out using this heated curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife tried it out, and she was happy with it as well.  She said that the curl didn&#x27;t stay all that well on natural eyelashes, but when she put on mascara first then used the curler it had a much better effect.  She was especially happy that it didn&#x27;t pull out any of her eyelashes.  She said that with the manual curler, she always yanks out at least a few.  But no problems here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So two thumbs up from the guy and girl of this household.  About the only complaint I have is that battery operated items can be annoying, with the need to keep a fresh supply of batteries on hand.  I would much rather have something that can be re-charged from a wall socket.</li>
            <li> I have fairly decent lashes so usually I just slap on mascara and call it good. (I&#x27;m also not doing red carpet photo shoots, so sue me) I used an old-fashioned eyelash curler once, and pinched myself so badly that I never used it again.....I saw this device and thought surely this would give me a pain-free curling experience? (insert bitter laugh)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*First of all, the manual is mostly useless. Just so you know: if it takes you ten minutes to figure out why the )(%(*#% thing won&#x27;t rotate, it&#x27;s not just you. Two of us felt like total derps as we discovered how this device functions, and it&#x27;s sure not intuitive! Just to save you the trouble, you have to slide the SILVER button with the arrow toggle on it, UP, to make the device start heating. It will also only rotate when the button is in the UP position. When you read the manual, it reads as if it were not written by someone whose primary language is English.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It heats up quickly, and IT GETS HOT ENOUGH TO BURN. I know this, because as I was struggling to keep the button depressed for rotation and keep it positioned for optimum curl, I roasted my eyelid inadvertently, and repeatedly. Keep soap handy for what comes out of your mouth when this happens. and, tip: try to jerk your hand away from your face when that happens, not towards your hairline, where you might accidentally burn something else in your shock and surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I have problems with my grip due to carpal tunnel syndrome, and it was just too tricky for me to do two things at once with this device (push button to turn rotation on, hold at correct angle) I just couldn&#x27;t do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it on both eyes, with and without rotation, I could not get a decent curl to save my life. NOTHING happened in a positive-curling-way. I even went to Youtube to see if there were videos showing other people using this thing successfully in case I&#x27;m just an idiot. I learned that as of that day there were NO videos about THIS item, and that with other products apparently even men can curl their lashes with a heated curler. (Everyone but me) Maybe I am just a total loser makeup nerd but I could not find success at any level with this thing. I desperately wanted to love it, felt it would somehow fill my previously-unknown need for sexy curled lashes! Alas...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;*Nice packaging, very attractive&lt;br /&gt;*Heats up quickly and substantially&lt;br /&gt;*Works just as well with rechargeable battery as it does with regular (AA)&lt;br /&gt;*This would probably be an ideal gift for the beauty-obsessed person in your life, who can perfectly and effortlessly look as though they have their own makeup artist (I&#x27;m positive that is what it takes to make this thing work)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;*I have longer, dense lashes and it was hard to position this thing to get to the base of them. It felt like it needed &#x27;more&#x27; in the length of the plastic teeth&lt;br /&gt;*This thing gets hotter than a MO FO!!! Do not underestimate just how hot a &#x27;little battery&#x27; can make a Q-tip sized device that can sizzle your eyeballs&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;m sorry but I just feel something like this would be impractical for most anyone who doesn&#x27;t spend all day doing their makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I love pink, as much as I was desperate for this to work for me, it was not to be. I felt like the nerd who had a crush on the football player, only to find out that he farts and scratches himself and is completely not for her. What a letdown.that with other products apparently even men can curl their lashes with a heated curler.

            <li> very nice tool, performs as good as I expect</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all, I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have very small eyes, so I was looking for an eyelash curler that I could get to curl my eyelashes without pinching my skin . So, this curler works in that respect, but it doesn&#x27;t hold the curl.</li>
            <li> I have tried several times over the past couple of years to use various versions of this type of eyelash curler and I just can&#x27;t get it to work. I followed the instructions but they don&#x27;t seem to curl my eyelashes at all. I have to use the standard clamp type. I will say however, if you can get this to work for you, I think the heat makes it more effective, as it does on the heated clamp version I use. I cannot say if the Panasonic works well since I think its the type of style I have not been able to get the hang of, but it sure is pretty, and more amenable to carrying out in a purse than the clamp type of eyelash curler, assuming it works for you.</li>
            <li> Transportation is very fast, very fine goods packaging, appearance is very good. It is also very convenient to travel with.</li>
            <li> Heated Eyelash Curler If you happen to drop it, you&#x27;ve broken it.  Been through two........................otherwise Love it! I use it just about everyday.</li>
            <li> This was used by my middle school aged daughter as she Is into these things.  Her view of it is that it does work and she likes it.  I did notice today her eyelashes looked curled and she said she did use it.  So it can be noticed.  Her only thing she doesn&#x27;t like is that it takes a minute and a half to heat up.  Since she is always running behind that can slow her down.  Batteries seem to last long enough, she has used it for 2 months without changing them.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is so pretty and easy to carry. the rolling head make the lashes separate, therefore, when you apply mascara on, it looks very pretty.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this product. Unfortunately when it arrived it rotated only once for the curling action then would no longer rotate. It did heat up as advertised but without the rotating action there was no curled lashes. I had to return the product.</li>
            <li> works for asian eyes . save time and make the lashes looks so good. i like this product. and its pink color looks nice</li>
            <li> NOTE:  This uses a double A battery (AA), not a triple A (AAA) as the description says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate dissing a Panasonic product as everything else I own by this company has been super. I&#x27;ve been blessed with long lashes, about 1/3\\&quot; long, thick but STRAIGHT. I rarely use mascara. For years I&#x27;ve been heating my [[ASIN:B000VSG1PO Shu Uemura Eyelash Curler - -]] with my hair dryer while blow drying my hair, holding the curler on my lashes for 20 or so seconds, and I&#x27;m done with it. The curl lasts around 6 hours before they&#x27;re stick-straight again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was excited to try this Panasonic heated curler. You need to supply the AA battery yourself. Insert the battery in the compartment + side up, twist it shut, then flip the silver area with the arrows UP. You need to wait 1 to 2 minutes for the purple dot to turn pink, then you are ready to curl. It was closer to 2 minutes for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then you push the arrow either left or right depending on which way you want the end to rotate. I followed the directions in the manual and spent at least 3 minutes on each of my top lashes. It&#x27;s kind of awkward to hold as you have to keep the left/right arrows pressed while you&#x27;re holding the curler on the section you want to curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending 6 minutes on my top lashes, and the 2 minutes it took to heat this up, my lashes were just as straight as when I started.  I don&#x27;t know about you, but I don&#x27;t have this kind of time to waste in the morning when I&#x27;m getting ready for work.  Plus, I could feel the heat when I got it near the rims of my eyes, and when I&#x27;m in a hurry, or haven&#x27;t had my morning coffee yet, I can see this item getting a little too close where I may burn that delicate rim area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be better for those with shorter lashes; I think I&#x27;ll stick to my tried-and-true method.</li>
            <li> My wife is Japanese, so her hair, including her lashes, is very stubborn when it comes to curling.  But this item did the job just fine.  We also tried it on my eyelashes, which are naturally long and curly, and it did a rather good job there too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic sells the same model in Japan, where it is very popular.  According to our own trial of this product, the reputation is well earned.</li>
            <li> I have long but straight eyelashes. So long, in fact, that if I don&#x27;t curl them they brush against my glasses. (I know, whoa is me, right?) For years I&#x27;ve used the old-fashioned squeeze and crimp eyelash curlers. At least once a week I accidentally get it too close and pinch my eyelid, and every so often I wind up pulling out an eyelash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, I really, REALLY wanted to like this. But it did absolutely nothing to curl my lashes, with or without mascara. (The instructions say to use it after your mascara dries.) Unlike others, I didn&#x27;t suffer any burns but I didn&#x27;t get any curl, either. So I asked a friend who has shorter but thicker lashes to give it a try. She got a little curl out of it, but noticed that it pretty much took off half the mascara she&#x27;d applied. Reapplying the mascara made her lashes straighten immediately, so she wasn&#x27;t impressed, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t want to throw the thing into the landfill, I did find an alternate use: it&#x27;s pretty good at straightening those baby hairs at my hairline, so now when I wear my bangs pulled back I run the wand through them to make sure everything looks nice.</li>
            <li> This works much better then traditional eyelash curlers. Whe you use it, you can see the results quickly. Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this,  I received it as a gift and thought it was a great idea for someone to give as a gift since it is not nessecarily a need type item but fun to have.  It heated up quite quickly and was easy to use and really like that it was small compact and had a cover so I could just throw it in my drawer when I was done with it.  You do have to really read the directions to make sure you are using it properly. and I noticed that it said to use before mascara, but find that it works better after you apply mascara. (maybe so you don&#x27;t gunk it up)</li>
