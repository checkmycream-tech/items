            <li>It doesn&#x27;t just work ok -</li>
            <li>Honestly, my hair and scalp feel just as clean as if I had showered.</li>
            <li>, my hair felt very clean.</li>
            <li>I am arthritic, and I am able to follow these directions easily.  </li>
            <li>It made his hair very soft and he smelled great.</li>
            <li>This no rinse shampoo is easy to use, and seems to work pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Everyone feels better with clean hair.</li>
            <li>I thought it&#x27;d be more like a foam that you could actually clean your hair/scalp with when you can&#x27;t shampoo but not so.  </li>
            <li>easy to use</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for a camping trip (that hasn&#x27;t happened yet), but found it comes in handy right now.</li>
            <li>used it on my mom, works fine</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a perfect clean like real shampoo, but when you can&#x27;t wash your hair for 1-2 days (and you have naturally oily hair), 1-2 days just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li>I needed scent free for backpacking.</li>
            <li>When  water isn&#x27;t readily available or not convenient</li>
            <li>Works awesome for person who has trouble washing their hair</li>
            <li>Worked great on a recent camping trip, no complaints.</li>
            <li>I liked the results so much that I have now started buying it for myself for those days when I just don&#x27;t make it up in time for a full shower before work....</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and my hair actually looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li>TO HAVE CLEAN HAIR</li>
            <li>dont clean my clients hair</li>
            <li>My hair was style-able and looked clean.</li>
            <li>I use a brush to help me lather it, without lather it doesn&#x27;t clean as well.</li>
            <li>Works great and with limited water</li>
            <li>If the creators of this product were smart they would start a huge marketing campaign in California geared toward helping the drought (and I expect my percentage for the idea!).</li>
            <li>It is nice, soft and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>I use it for camping, but would also be great for homebound people or those with limited mobility!  </li>
            <li>It works good for both body and hair â€“ shampoo only takes 2 min.</li>
            <li>It leaves a hospital fragrance which quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and soft after use and, best of all, I don&#x27;t have to irritate my skin with a shower or make a mess trying to wash my hair in the sink.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it cleaned and left my hair manageable; however, I did not like the scent at all which lingered for hours.  </li>
            <li>I like this shampoo it works very well and has a pleasnt smell too.don&#x27;t need to use much either.it&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
            <li>It did not lather as much as I would have liked, although perhaps I did not use enough.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo really works well and freshens my hair when I need a quick fix.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>Great for older adults or anyone that&#x27;s disabled.  </li>
            <li>Works very well too!</li>
            <li>My father has always been fastidiously neat, and now that he is almost completely bedbound, it is important that he maintain whatever dignity he can.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>Maybe if you have short hair this might work better.</li>
            <li>I prefer this type of shampoo to the No Water Shampoo, which is pretty much like pouring baby powder on your head.</li>
            <li>It is not a substitute for a real shower and with shampoo.</li>
            <li>I really should give it five stars instead of four.</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s very viscous like water.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend shampooing with this two days in a row, it would leave too much buildup.  </li>
            <li>this is a really good shampoo, and versatile...can wet hair first, or put on dry, scrub, and towel off...</li>
            <li>I was so pleasantly surprised by this product!!!  </li>
            <li>It really works and left my hair shining and clean.</li>
            <li>feels just as clean as the regular way to wash the hair.</li>
            <li>They do give him a weekly full shower with regular shampoo</li>
            <li>You have to really saturate your hair and work it into a rich lather to get the right results, but when done properly, this product cleans just as well as traditional rinse-out shampoos.</li>
            <li>It works well, just thought it may be a little more sudsy.  </li>
            <li>Gets his hair clean, no tears and just dry with a towel after rubbing into hair.</li>
            <li>Then you towel it out with a clean dry towel.</li>
            <li>I order this to clean my hair because washing with other shampoo my hair would tangle up so much.</li>
            <li>will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with how well this stuff works.</li>
            <li>Maybe I did it incorrectly but this product left my hair feeling very oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this product seems to work well for others, but personally I consider it a waste of money.</li>
            <li>Not only my hair, but my scalp became even more dried out and flaky.</li>
            <li>Smells clean without heavy perfume.</li>
            <li>Using it the first time left my hair feeling sticky and scalp dry.</li>
            <li>I saw this product while looking for dry shampoos to use between washes and decided to give it a try, since the dry aerosol shampoos really didn&#x27;t cut it for me.</li>

            <li> so I don&#x27;t require a whole lot and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have fond this very helpful when not able to bend over the sink or get into the shower</li>
            <li> I use it every other day to shampoo my hair, it only takes a few minutes to use and cleans my hair very well.</li>
            <li> I can use some dry shampoos but this stuff actually makes your hair clean...not just give the illusion of it.</li>
            <li> I wet my short hair with about 1-2 tablespoons and rubbed it in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man with shorter hair, don&#x27;t know how it would work for really long hair.</li>
            <li> You just rub it into your hair and scalp and then dry off with  towel.</li>
            <li> But your hair will dry a little flat without a lot of body.</li>
            <li> I use it multiple times a week sometimes because SoCal is in such a bad drought right now.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well.</li>
            <li> My hair actually looked and felt worse than it would have if I had simply gone without washing it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to shower everyday</li>
            <li> I suffer from a chronic skin disease and regular bathing makes my condition so much worse.</li>
            <li> Can make your hair feel heavy.  </li>
            <li> No more going to theMarana</li>
            <li> but I have terrible hair and it looks super greasy when I wake up.</li>
            <li> I sponge bathe often to prevent that from happening, but hanging my head over the sink to wash my hair was getting annoying and messy.</li>
            <li> Horrible don&#x27;t waste money on it</li>
            <li> Confined to wheelchair with a bad leg....</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, a bit citrus or fruity.</li>
            <li> If you are sick or in a hurry grab some of this.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying this but was sadly disappointed...</li>
            <li> Feels disgusting, leaves greasy residue.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad this product seems to work well for others, but personally I consider it a waste of money. I wanted to use it for an upcoming camping trip so I tested it at home, and I&#x27;m glad I did. This stuff left my hair looking greasy and feeling gummy. My hair actually looked and felt worse than it would have if I had simply gone without washing it. If you decide to try this product I wish you luck. As for me, I wouldn&#x27;t use it again even if someone paid me to.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it cleaned and left my hair manageable; however, I did not like the scent at all which lingered for hours.  It did not lather as much as I would have liked, although perhaps I did not use enough.  I will use it again if needed, but it will not be a priority method of cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li> This no rinse shampoo is easy to use, and seems to work pretty good.  I am arthritic, and I am able to follow these directions easily.  Smells clean without heavy perfume.</li>
            <li> Confined to wheelchair with a bad leg....this is a really good shampoo, and versatile...can wet hair first, or put on dry, scrub, and towel off...easy!</li>
            <li> I was so pleasantly surprised by this product!!!  It really works and left my hair shining and clean. I will buy more!</li>
            <li> Used this on a Mission Trip where I knew we would not have access to running water. It worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> It works well, just thought it may be a little more sudsy.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> Again great product when it is. not possible to do a regular shampoo. Gets his hair clean, no tears and just dry with a towel after rubbing into hair. Love this!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells so nice it makes the fact a shampoo must be done without benefit of water easier! Works very well too!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mother who was going to have open heart surgery (but changed to a different type).  I decided to try it on my dog for in between baths.  It made his hair very soft and he smelled great.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves it and says she uses it every day because she can&#x27;t get into the shower.</li>
            <li> My father has always been fastidiously neat, and now that he is almost completely bedbound, it is important that he maintain whatever dignity he can. This is one of the things that has helped him feel more like himself.</li>

            <li> This shampoo is awesome. I have short hair so I don&#x27;t require a whole lot and a little goes a long way. It works extremely well. No smell, my hair felt very clean. Much better than some others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It definitely works as described. It is not a substitute for a real shower and with shampoo. It leaves a hospital fragrance which quickly dissipates. I needed scent free for backpacking.</li>
            <li> This product performed as well as I hoped. I really should give it five stars instead of four. But it as not a miracle product. Here&#x27;s how it worked for me: It&#x27;s very viscous like water. I wet my short hair with about 1-2 tablespoons and rubbed it in. It does not foam. It gets kind of fizzy. The smell isn&#x27;t bad, a bit citrus or fruity. Then you towel it out with a clean dry towel. Leaves your hair fresher than it was....like you washed it yesterday or the night before.But your hair will dry a little flat without a lot of body.</li>
            <li> Oh well.  I thought it&#x27;d be more like a foam that you could actually clean your hair/scalp with when you can&#x27;t shampoo but not so.  Maybe if you have short hair this might work better.</li>
            <li> I use this product twice a day on a home care patient. His parents request twice daily baths and hair washing. I have never seen his hair greasy after using this product. It is nice, soft and clean smelling. I can style his hair and no muss and no fuss. They do give him a weekly full shower with regular shampoo but I don&#x27;t think that there is any build up of the product on his hair when we are done.  I liked the results so much that I have now started buying it for myself for those days when I just don&#x27;t make it up in time for a full shower before work....lol</li>
            <li> This shampoo really works well and freshens my hair when I need a quick fix. It leaves my hair behaving and feeling like a traditional shampoo.</li>
            <li> Good product for those that can&#x27;t get into the bath.  This product proves to be very effective.  I will use it again.</li>
            <li> I AM SO GLAD WE PUT MEN ON THE MOON.  BECAUSE IT WAS THROUGH THAT PROGRAM THAT PRODUCTS WERE INVENTED THAT BENEFIT US.  I&#x27;VE USED THIS WHEN HOSPITALIZED AND IT IS SUCH A WONDERFUL RELIEF TO HAVE CLEAN HAIR WHEN YOU CAN&#x27;T TAKE A SHOWER.  LOVE THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for all kinds of emergencies.  Dries quickly and my hair actually looks and feels great.  When  water isn&#x27;t readily available or not convenient this solves the problem.  Fits in any bug out bag!</li>
            <li> I did not like this shampoo at all. Using it the first time left my hair feeling sticky and scalp dry. I gave it a second chance 2 days later. Not only my hair, but my scalp became even more dried out and flaky. Now I have to buy anti-dandruff shampoo to fix this situation caused by using No-Rinse shampoo.</li>
            <li> dont clean my clients hair</li>
            <li> used it on my mom, works fine</li>
            <li> Feels disgusting, leaves greasy residue.  I think I might just shave my head and use the No Rinse Bathing Wipes.</li>
            <li> Great deal.  I use it every other day to shampoo my hair, it only takes a few minutes to use and cleans my hair very well.</li>
            <li> I suffer from a chronic skin disease and regular bathing makes my condition so much worse. I sponge bathe often to prevent that from happening, but hanging my head over the sink to wash my hair was getting annoying and messy. I saw this product while looking for dry shampoos to use between washes and decided to give it a try, since the dry aerosol shampoos really didn&#x27;t cut it for me. I have to say that I was amazed. You have to really saturate your hair and work it into a rich lather to get the right results, but when done properly, this product cleans just as well as traditional rinse-out shampoos. My hair feels clean and soft after use and, best of all, I don&#x27;t have to irritate my skin with a shower or make a mess trying to wash my hair in the sink. I will definitely keep this on hand from now on.</li>
            <li> Great for in between shampoos.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying this but was sadly disappointed...my hair was twice as greasy as before using it!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how well this stuff works. My hair was style-able and looked clean. It isn&#x27;t a perfect clean like real shampoo, but when you can&#x27;t wash your hair for 1-2 days (and you have naturally oily hair), 1-2 days just doesn&#x27;t cut it. I prefer this type of shampoo to the No Water Shampoo, which is pretty much like pouring baby powder on your head.</li>
            <li> I use it for camping, but would also be great for homebound people or those with limited mobility!  Works great and with limited water, it fits the need perfectly.</li>
            <li> could have a fresher, cleaner smell.  easy to use</li>
            <li> Maybe I did it incorrectly but this product left my hair feeling very oily. But I&#x27;ve only used it once. If I try it again and it&#x27;s different results I will update my comment!</li>
            <li> Grandma used it in the hospital and wanted more! Works awesome for person who has trouble washing their hair</li>
            <li> Worked great on a recent camping trip, no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have fond this very helpful when not able to bend over the sink or get into the shower feels just as clean as the regular way to wash the hair. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I use it when we go camping. It doesn&#x27;t just work ok - it works great. Honestly, my hair and scalp feel just as clean as if I had showered. You just rub it into your hair and scalp and then dry off with  towel. I&#x27;m a man with shorter hair, don&#x27;t know how it would work for really long hair. Pleasant light fragrance. I&#x27;m ordering the body wash based on how well this works.</li>
            <li> Good to use in an emergency.  I don&#x27;t like to wash my hair every day, but my bangs can get oily so I use this on off days.  Can make your hair feel heavy.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend shampooing with this two days in a row, it would leave too much buildup.  I use a brush to help me lather it, without lather it doesn&#x27;t clean as well.</li>
            <li> It works good for both body and hair â€“ shampoo only takes 2 min. then you could style using hairdryer! Would be without this product.. No more going to theMarana</li>
            <li> great item, quick ship</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Product is as described.</li>
            <li> I order this to clean my hair because washing with other shampoo my hair would tangle up so much.</li>
