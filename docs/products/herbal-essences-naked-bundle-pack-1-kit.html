            <li>Smells great, but as a &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; product you do have to use a lot more shampoo and conditioner in your hair for it to thoroughly clean it.  </li>
            <li>Herbal Essences is making better products at a much more reasonable price and that is so great for all us who love our hair!  </li>
            <li>but yet the commercials and description are advertising this product as paraben and silicone free!</li>
            <li>This brand has better products.</li>

            <li>Nice packaging and really</li>
            <li>works.&lt;br /&gt;Not quite available yet in stores.</li>
            <li>The product smells nice and makes my hair soft and it does make my hair slightly more volumized.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but the only think I liked in the set was the dry shampoo, and even that wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>Hair is stronger and clean, and adds volume without stripping the strands.</li>
            <li>LOVE the dry shampoo, it gives my hair extra volume and smells awesome.</li>
            <li>Once you figure out how much you need, your hair is light and smooth for days without washing.</li>
            <li>I love this new line from Herbal Essences.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The actual product is great but the shampoo or conditioner don&#x27;t  have a nice smell as one usually finds in herbal essence products.</li>
            <li>The dry shampoo is top notch as well, it only leaves a great smell and added volume with no heavy product residue....</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more when I need it</li>
            <li>And the smell really lasts!</li>
            <li>it up next time :)</li>
            <li>which Herbal Naked has :)...</li>
            <li>I have not been to the store to read the ingredients for myself and what I have read on-line has been mixed but for myself I do not see sulfate free on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>If Herbal Naked is sulfate free, I would not problem trying it.  </li>
            <li>actually have used this product and it smells pretty fresh and makes my hair feel lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li>Has a nice scent , but the product left my hair dry and straw like .</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li>But the travel size dry shampoo i was only able to use three times and then it just stopped coming out.</li>
            <li>If you look through the ingredients list above it says right there that Dimethicone and Methylparaben are in it (a silicone and a paraben)...</li>
            <li>am just a girl with very natural curly hair and three years of life changing health issues.  </li>
            <li>It cleqns my hair and leaves it smooth with a slight bounce.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t actually tried the product, but they just straight up lied to everyone in their advertising.</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised to receive the box and find it contained full-sized products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Dimethicone is a silicon OIL that is a natural surfactant on your hair, lowering friction to prevent breakage in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Loved the products, but the small bottle of dry shampoo quit working after the 2nd use.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I strive everyday to hold onto my beautiful hair (It is scary, depressing and hard to love your &amp;#34;selfee&amp;#34; when you&#x27;ve been complimented a lifetime for great hair).  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even used the dry shampoo yet, but I am not expecting much.  </li>
            <li>Sulfates are found in many hair cleansers and are very hard on your hair.  </li>
            <li>Even my husband has been asking a lot about my hair and how it&#x27;s returned to such a natural lushish state.</li>
            <li>Methylparaben is readily metabolized by common soil bacteria, making it completely biodegradable.&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it, with all the pieces it was a great value. Smells good, a lighter version of the classics Herbal Essences scent. My hair feels clean and full when I use the whole system, I&#x27;ll keep using it happily.</li>
            <li> The product smells nice and makes my hair soft and it does make my hair slightly more volumized. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. The fragrance is heavenly. It cleqns my hair and leaves it smooth with a slight bounce. I will definitely buy more when I need it</li>
            <li> Has a nice scent , but the product left my hair dry and straw like . Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually tried the product, but they just straight up lied to everyone in their advertising. If you look through the ingredients list above it says right there that Dimethicone and Methylparaben are in it (a silicone and a paraben)... but yet the commercials and description are advertising this product as paraben and silicone free! How are they allowed to do that??</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with this product.  It was pretty average shampoo and conditioner, and the mousse made my hair feel dirty. I haven&#x27;t even used the dry shampoo yet, but I am not expecting much.  This brand has better products.</li>
            <li> I love this new line from Herbal Essences. Hair is stronger and clean, and adds volume without stripping the strands. I like the smell, too. Bundle pack was a good deal.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but the only think I liked in the set was the dry shampoo, and even that wasn&#x27;t great. My hair feels greasy and heavy after using the shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;m dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised to receive the box and find it contained full-sized products.  I have thick curly hair so I cannot speak to it&#x27;s &amp;#34;volume&amp;#34;.  But I love that it tames my curls.  Leaves my hair clean and looking wonderful.  The smell is great.</li>
            <li> Used this 2 Times and can already feel a difference in my hair, it feels and looks softer, healthier, my more voluminous. Only con is the the dry shampoo can stopped working after 1 use!! Other then that it&#x27;s a great product and makes it hair feel wonderful!!</li>
            <li> The spray shampoo only worked 1 time and stopped spaying after that.  I can still hear the spray in it and it has the weight of almost full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual product is great but the shampoo or conditioner don&#x27;t  have a nice smell as one usually finds in herbal essence products. It&#x27;s not a bad smell just not a great one.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner smells great and leaves my hair soft and light. LOVE the dry shampoo, it gives my hair extra volume and smells awesome. And the smell really lasts!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything fabulous about the kit. Seemed to dry my hair out as well. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again, but the price is ok for the items you get.</li>
            <li> Girls loved it and made their hair feel like silk. Highly recommend to others. Nice packaging and really works.&lt;br /&gt;Not quite available yet in stores.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with dry shampoo. I like the product, I like the scent, I like the texture. I dislike the clogging spray bottle, though. I was able to use it twice before it clogged up. I want more product but I&#x27;m afraid to waste my money on it.</li>
            <li> Actually methylparaben is produced by nature and found in fruits such as blueberries. Methylparaben is readily metabolized by common soil bacteria, making it completely biodegradable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dimethicone is a silicon OIL that is a natural surfactant on your hair, lowering friction to prevent breakage in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually have used this product and it smells pretty fresh and makes my hair feel lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look it up next time :)</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences is making better products at a much more reasonable price and that is so great for all us who love our hair!  I have not been to the store to read the ingredients for myself and what I have read on-line has been mixed but for myself I do not see sulfate free on the bottle.  Sulfates are found in many hair cleansers and are very hard on your hair.  I&#x27;ve learned you want to try to stay clear from sodium lauryl sulfate (harshest), ammonium laureth sulfate (very harsh) and sodium laureth sulfate (harsh).&lt;br /&gt;I also like a conditioner that contains emollients (jojoba oil, olive oil...), humectants  and moisturizers (aloe vera, mint extracts-which Herbal Naked has :)...&lt;br /&gt;I am just a girl with very natural curly hair and three years of life changing health issues.  I strive everyday to hold onto my beautiful hair (It is scary, depressing and hard to love your &amp;#34;selfee&amp;#34; when you&#x27;ve been complimented a lifetime for great hair).  Thanks to my Kevin, daughter, sisters, the great lady who has sometimes even come to my home to cut my hair and Deva Curl Products my hair is shorter and thinner but is still thriving!  If Herbal Naked is sulfate free, I would not problem trying it.  Smiles, Christine</li>
            <li> I love the products. I use the shampoo and conditioner every time i wash my hair. The volumizing souffle is alright too. But the travel size dry shampoo i was only able to use three times and then it just stopped coming out. I shake it and i can hear that there is still some left in it. But I loved THAT while it lasted. I&#x27;m gonna get myself a bigger bottle of it, probably from Smith&#x27;s. It&#x27;s cheaper there. But this bundle was awesome.</li>
            <li> Loved the products, but the small bottle of dry shampoo quit working after the 2nd use.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but as a &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; product you do have to use a lot more shampoo and conditioner in your hair for it to thoroughly clean it.  Once you figure out how much you need, your hair is light and smooth for days without washing. Even my husband has been asking a lot about my hair and how it&#x27;s returned to such a natural lushish state. The dry shampoo is top notch as well, it only leaves a great smell and added volume with no heavy product residue.... Just follow the given instructions.... Just a few sprays were its needed in the correct way. I&#x27;m already adding this to my Amazon list to buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Colored hair: after two months of use, no color has faded or changed. Only made my hair shinier and weightless.</li>
