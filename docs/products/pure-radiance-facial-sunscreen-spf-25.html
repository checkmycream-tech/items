            <li>I am one month pregnant and looked for a safe skincare line and bought the Belli line.</li>
            <li>Will recommend to our pregnant patients!</li>
            <li>We hope that this clears up any confusion, and please feel free to contact us at [...]</li>
            <li>At Belli, we believe important health decisions should be based on scientific evidence.</li>
            <li>I have use it since my pregnancy.it feel smooth</li>

            <li>and I was pregnant all spring/summer and exposed to sun).</li>
            <li>I definitely don&#x27;t feel motivated to use it any more than I have to, but it am glad it have it.  </li>
            <li>We have many hot humid days and this product really does protect your skin from the sun.  </li>
            <li>It provides good UV protection while give your skin a little polish like you wear a light foundation.</li>
            <li>I used this during my pregnancy with success.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, spreads easily, and has actually improved my skin tone.</li>
            <li>If I wasn&#x27;t pregnant, I would probably give in and use a more mainstream facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It supposedly was to be just a physical layer sitting on top of your skin, reflecting the UVs rather than chemicals absorbed by your body to protect you.</li>
            <li>It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA) to be safely used as a sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Our higher safety standards made us the number one recommended pregnancy skin care brand in a survey of OB/Gyns.    </li>
            <li>the controversies, what&#x27;s safe, what&#x27;s next.</li>
            <li>I just tried this sunscreen for the first time.</li>
            <li>It is not my first time buying this product.</li>
            <li>I loved the anti-chloasma cream for the few weeks</li>
            <li>I am fairly light skinned, but in the summer do get some color on my face, and this moisturizer is apparently intended to be tinted.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for a facial sunscreen, this would be fine.</li>
            <li>Instead, our Anti-Chloasma Facial Sunscreen SPF 25 uses traditional Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide in an advanced lightweight oil-free formula, which is tinted lightly to blend in with all skin tones.</li>
            <li>It blends in really well</li>
            <li>The beige tint doesn&#x27;t really go with my skin color</li>
            <li>It has been used for over 40 years in almost all physical sunscreens due to its high refractive index, strong UV absorbing ability and resistance to discoloration under ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li>Therefore, its use in sunscreens is safe since the substance remains on the skin surface, is not absorbed and does not reach the bloodstream.</li>
            <li>(I have a medium complexion), doesn&#x27;t have the white sunscreen look, isn&#x27;t oily or shiny, wears well under makeup, and has a mild smell.</li>
            <li>Titanium dioxide is actually absorbed by the body and affects your brain (studies published by different researchers in the US, UK and France).  </li>
            <li>There are a few controversial published studies related to the toxicity of titanium dioxide.</li>
            <li>This is important because small amounts of some skin care product you use are absorbed into your bloodstream and into baby&#x27;s bloodstream, so we try to be extra cautious while you are expecting.  </li>
            <li>The new formulation (in the pump) does appear to be a bit different than the older products in the tube</li>
            <li>but this one made me breakout completely.</li>
            <li>When I get it,it is nearly Expired.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>I get it,it is nearly Expired.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>I have been enjoying this product for five years now - long past pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>I have not tried it yet in place of something heavy duty like coppertone butat least as an everyday facial sunscreen it is great</li>

            <li> You only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> Titanium dioxide has a wide range of applications, from paint to sunscreen to food coloring.</li>
            <li> However, that&#x27;s to be expected with titanium dioxide and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, all the studies conducted to check the skin absorption of titanium dioxide in humans have shown that this substance remains on the skin surface.</li>
            <li> This substance remains on the skin surface and is not absorbed into the skin nor passes into the bloodstream.  </li>
            <li> It will expire in half a year.</li>
            <li> and I will continue to use even when not pregnant.</li>
            <li> It makes your face looks very pale, not natural at all!</li>
            <li> It protected my skin plus it has a little tint to it</li>
            <li> so it makes me look a little pale.</li>
            <li> She likes the feel and likes that it has few ingredients to cause issues and reactions.</li>
            <li> Really a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as an everyday lotion under makeup.</li>
            <li> I need sunscreen everyday.  </li>
            <li> That probably won&#x27;t be an issue for you if you wear face powder or foundation everyday.</li>
            <li> We search through millions of published medical research articles, guarding against chemicals known to cause birth defects, and erring on the side of caution by avoiding questionable ingredients as well.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just because of hormone change or this face washer worked.</li>
            <li> It is really hard to find pregnancy-safe face lotion with SPF though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very sad, I meant to use it in summer,but this cannot be possible.</li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong.</li>
            <li> And it absorbs very poorly...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this during my pregnancy with success. It was a great moisturizer for me and I did not have any chloasma issues during my pregnancy (and I was pregnant all spring/summer and exposed to sun). I was happy with everything in Belli&#x27;s line that I used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan.  I am fairly light skinned, but in the summer do get some color on my face, and this moisturizer is apparently intended to be tinted.  The tint made me look like a ghost.  The consistency is thicker than I would like for a moisturizer and as a result, I felt like I had a white mask on.  Ewww.</li>
            <li> I was a firm believer that mineral sunscreen (ie containing titanium dioxide vs the chemical ingredients) was safer and was using it on myself and young children. It supposedly was to be just a physical layer sitting on top of your skin, reflecting the UVs rather than chemicals absorbed by your body to protect you. Boy, was I wrong. Titanium dioxide is actually absorbed by the body and affects your brain (studies published by different researchers in the US, UK and France).  I am one month pregnant and looked for a safe skincare line and bought the Belli line. I loved the anti-chloasma cream for the few weeks I used it but will be seeking refund as the \\&quot;safe during pregnancy\\&quot; claim is no longer true.</li>
            <li> We would like to comment about the mineral ingredients in Anti-Chloasma Facial Sunscreen on behalf of Belli&#x27;s Medical Director. We hope that this clears up any confusion, and please feel free to contact us at [...] with any further concerns. Her comments are as follows:    Titanium dioxide has a wide range of applications, from paint to sunscreen to food coloring. It has been used for over 40 years in almost all physical sunscreens due to its high refractive index, strong UV absorbing ability and resistance to discoloration under ultraviolet light. This advantage increases stability and ability to protect the skin from the harmful ultraviolet rays. This substance remains on the skin surface and is not absorbed into the skin nor passes into the bloodstream.  There are a few controversial published studies related to the toxicity of titanium dioxide. It should be taken into account that these were implemented in animals using the orally, injected or inhaled form of the substance and not the topical form. On the other hand, all the studies conducted to check the skin absorption of titanium dioxide in humans have shown that this substance remains on the skin surface. (\\&quot;Micronized titanium dioxide is solely deposited on the outermost surface of the stratum corneum and cannot be detected in deeper stratum corneum layers, the human epidermis and dermis\\&quot; Advan Drug Del Rev 2002;54:S157-S163) Therefore, its use in sunscreens is safe since the substance remains on the skin surface, is not absorbed and does not reach the bloodstream. It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA) to be safely used as a sunscreen.  At Belli, we believe important health decisions should be based on scientific evidence. We continually update and improve our information to provide the safest, most effective products to our customers. Belli Pregnancy, including the Anti-Chloasma Facial Sunscreen SFP 25, is the only skin care line in the world thatis teratology screened (see below). We search through millions of published medical research articles, guarding against chemicals known to cause birth defects, and erring on the side of caution by avoiding questionable ingredients as well. Because we always try to err on the side of caution, Belli has decided to avoid the \\&quot;invisible\\&quot; nanoparticle sunscreen ingredients. Instead, our Anti-Chloasma Facial Sunscreen SPF 25 uses traditional Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide in an advanced lightweight oil-free formula, which is tinted lightly to blend in with all skin tones. Our higher safety standards made us the number one recommended pregnancy skin care brand in a survey of OB/Gyns.    What is teratology screening? Teratology is the medical field that studies the relationship between chemicals and birth defects. Belli&#x27;s teratology screening process searches through all the world&#x27;s published medical literature - over 16 million studies in over 5000 international journals-and excludes ingredients with even remote links to birth defects. This is important because small amounts of some skin care product you use are absorbed into your bloodstream and into baby&#x27;s bloodstream, so we try to be extra cautious while you are expecting.

            <li> Love love Belli brand and I use all their stuff but this one made me breakout completely. I wish it didn&#x27;t. I used the rest on my chest and neck and it was fine.</li>
            <li> I have use it since my pregnancy.it feel smooth and I did&#x27;t get the spot on face, so maybe this one helps.</li>
            <li> the tinted part shows up easily on your face and leaves a smear almost</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying this product for five years now - long past pregnancy.  It has become my daily replacement for a separate moisturizer and foundation.  People cannot believe that I am able to only wear a tinted moisturizer and have flawless looking skin.  The new formulation (in the pump) does appear to be a bit different than the older products in the tube but I&#x27;m still happy with it and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Wife is using this one because many of the sunscreens she has used, started to give her allergies. This one has worked great so far. She likes the feel and likes that it has few ingredients to cause issues and reactions.</li>
            <li> too white, look like a white mask on my face</li>
            <li> When I get it,it is nearly Expired.&lt;br /&gt;How can you do that?&lt;br /&gt;When I get it,it is nearly Expired.&lt;br /&gt;How can you do that?</li>
            <li> It makes your face looks very pale, not natural at all! Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I just tried this sunscreen for the first time. I&#x27;m very picky about sunscreens but this stuff is amazing. It blends in really well (I have a medium complexion), doesn&#x27;t have the white sunscreen look, isn&#x27;t oily or shiny, wears well under makeup, and has a mild smell.</li>
            <li> Love love this sunscreen! Used it for the first time this summer and it worked great! It protected my skin plus it has a little tint to it so it covers your skin well! I work for a Dermatologist and this brand has everything it shuold to TRUELY protect you from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays! Will recommend to our pregnant patients!</li>
            <li> Commodity use period is too short.It will expire in half a year.The emulsion texture is too thick,and color is too white.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this face washer through my nine-month pregnancy and I am still using it after our son was born. It&#x27;s mild, smells good, keeps my face clean, and the best part, it&#x27;s safe for baby. No acne bothered me through the pregnancy but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just because of hormone change or this face washer worked.</li>
            <li> I would put this in the category of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sun screens.  I find that they all have a heavy, somewhat greasy feel no matter how much you spend.  I guess it is the price you pay for using more natural ingredients over the stuff that is bad for you but light textured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use this, I try to use it sparingly or else it definitely feels greasy to me.  I definitely don&#x27;t feel motivated to use it any more than I have to, but it am glad it have it.  If I wasn&#x27;t pregnant, I would probably give in and use a more mainstream facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It is not my first time buying this product. It provides good UV protection while give your skin a little polish like you wear a light foundation.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on Dec.2,2013, when I got it, I saw the product will be expired in May,2014. That is to say, I only have 5 months to use it! I am very sad, I meant to use it in summer,but this cannot be possible. Really a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face for two days. It is lightly tinted and provides the perfect amount of color for days when I might not want to wear regular foundation. (I am euromut with blue eyesnand.light brown to blond hair.) I also wore it under foindation and it was fine. It is nongreasy. I have not tried it yet in place of something heavy duty like coppertone butat least as an everyday facial sunscreen it is great and I will continue to use even when not pregnant.</li>
            <li> This is a very good thing, I really like it, then I still need me will come again very&lt;br /&gt;good</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking it would be like a face lotion with sunscreen (during pregnancy) but really it&#x27;s just a thick, white sunscreen. You only need a little bit. I will definitely use it this summer but it does turn your face a bit white so I am hesitant to use it under makeup. It is really hard to find pregnancy-safe face lotion with SPF though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a facial sunscreen, this would be fine. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as an everyday lotion under makeup.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I need sunscreen everyday.  We have many hot humid days and this product really does protect your skin from the sun.  I apply it every day and I love it.</li>
            <li> I like using this sunscreen. It&#x27;s light, spreads easily, and has actually improved my skin tone. It&#x27;s also a good moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t break out my oily/acne prone skin. Since it is a mineral sunscreen, it leave a white film on my face. The beige tint doesn&#x27;t really go with my skin color so it makes me look a little pale. However, that&#x27;s to be expected with titanium dioxide and it doesn&#x27;t bother me. That probably won&#x27;t be an issue for you if you wear face powder or foundation everyday. I will continue to use it throughout the rest of my pregnancy and probably afterwards too.</li>
            <li> Unbelievably white when applied! Seems like liquid foundation rather than sunscreen. And it absorbs very poorly...</li>
