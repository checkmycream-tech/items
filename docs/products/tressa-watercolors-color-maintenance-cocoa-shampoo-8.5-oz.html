            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It has helped bring my hair to a very beautiful, and natural looking color.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it had more staying power.</li>
            <li>I find that very interesting considering they took my money so easily.  </li>
            <li>I do have to use another hair product called &amp;#34;tween time&amp;#34; just around the bang line roots where I am the most gray.</li>
            <li>I will reorder some more</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I like quantum better</li>
            <li>Quantum smells better and is thicker and makes more suds.</li>
            <li>Recommended by my hairstylist and I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Kept my color rich and warm.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good at diminishing the look of gray roots between hair coloring.</li>
            <li>I appreciate a good and natural product and loved that this was sulfate free and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for some time with good results and it is gentle on my hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>It added just the right amount of warm tones to my hair without overly darkening it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have my hair professionally colored and it looks very nice, rich, and shiny for about 3 weeks .  </li>
            <li>Sulfate free and easy on your hair.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant scent and not heavy on the hair.</li>
            <li>Tressa is great for red heads.</li>
            <li>You also need to use a lot to get your hair clean.</li>
            <li>But just have to make sure you don&#x27;t get too much on scalp</li>
            <li>I have medium  to dark brown hair and this color works great.  </li>
            <li>anyways then I would squeeze out any excess water in my hair and apply this shampoo liberally and leave it in for a few minutes before rinsing it out and it works great.</li>
            <li>love the way it leaves the hair so soft and shiny</li>
            <li>This seems to work fine, getting me through until I could get the color blended with my natural color - brown and silver.</li>
            <li>I like this better than my regular shampoo</li>
            <li>I personally love the neutral/ash look and since my hair wasn&#x27;t blonde the purple shampoo had no use for me.</li>
            <li>I had recently purchased this product at my salon to help keep my blonde highlights natural looking and thought it did a great job doing just that.</li>
            <li>It will add color to your hair, and some nice volume, but also dries it out a little.</li>
            <li>Color enhances and I apply it specifically to the root area then spread it through to the whole head.</li>
            <li>I am almost 53 and am using this product to tide me over until I have to really die my hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I used this 1-2 times a week depending on how much color I wanted deposited</li>
            <li>Who wants that?</li>
            <li>My hairdresser told me my color really holds and still looks shiny.....</li>
            <li>Super, will definitely purchase again.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Not only does it make my colored hair last longer, it gives it a rich shine and makes it very soft.</li>
            <li>I use it every washing and try to leave it in my hair while I complete my shower, then rinse it out.  </li>
            <li>According to my colorist and a color wheel I referenced the green in this hazelnut wash really helped contrast the reddish/copper undertones my light brown/dark blonde (about a level 5-6) hair had.</li>
            <li>SO FAR,  WORKED</li>
            <li>The color suits me and looks natural for my skin tone</li>
            <li>I may eventually choose one over the other, or mix the colors to get the right one for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Now, in its natural state it is mousey brown with a lot of grey in its natural state.  </li>
            <li>My hair has been lightened several shades from my natural color.  </li>
            <li>So far, this method is adding just enough shading to notice that this should work as intended over time.  </li>
            <li>I bought this in several colors for my medium to dark brown hair thinking it would be fun to bring out different highlights.</li>

            <li> I would use a regular shampoo on my scalp since my roots were my natural dark brown color</li>
            <li> Firstly, the item arrived late.</li>
            <li> It worked so try it if you know your skin is not sensitive</li>
            <li> It did dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> I have dark blonde/light brown colors in my hair that I had gotten balayged and toned to look ashy.</li>
            <li> I have this wash as well as the cocoa rinse depending on how dark or ashy I want to be.</li>
            <li> One word of caution - be careful when shampooing as it will stain anything that it drops or splashes on--including shower liner and tub--promptly rinse it off!!</li>
            <li> While trying to tone down the brassiness and deposit a bit of &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34; to my previously colored hair, I tried this product, but used it in conjunction with another shampoo to tone down the brassiness that keeps popping out.  </li>
            <li> Extends my color times a little beyond the 6 week mark...maybe by about 1.5-2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I always lather it  in and leave on for a few minutes before rinsing. .</li>
            <li> Then I confessed my secret.</li>
            <li> My hair was th eperfect tone, matched my roots exactly, unfortunately my hair turned just a bit too ashy.</li>
            <li> Too bad, but everything gives me a rash.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and shame on my for not returning them.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this to use over my dyed brown hair. It definitely adds some red tones in there, but I like the shade it gives me. Great product that does work.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good at diminishing the look of gray roots between hair coloring. Extends my color times a little beyond the 6 week mark...maybe by about 1.5-2 weeks.Not a miracle but definitely &amp;#34;a helper&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> love the way it leaves the hair so soft and shiny</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product and it does what is says! Color enhances and I apply it specifically to the root area then spread it through to the whole head. Pleasant scent and not heavy on the hair. One word of caution - be careful when shampooing as it will stain anything that it drops or splashes on--including shower liner and tub--promptly rinse it off!! I will definitely use this again!</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo.  I am almost 53 and am using this product to tide me over until I have to really die my hair.  I use it every washing and try to leave it in my hair while I complete my shower, then rinse it out.  I have medium  to dark brown hair and this color works great.  I tried the next darker color and it did not work as well for me.  This product also adds great body to my hair.  I do have to use another hair product called &amp;#34;tween time&amp;#34; just around the bang line roots where I am the most gray.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. Not only does it make my colored hair last longer, it gives it a rich shine and makes it very soft. I like this better than my regular shampoo but I try to only use it once per week to make it last. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I already have red tones; &amp;#34;cocoa&amp;#34; implies chocolate brown. It will add color to your hair, and some nice volume, but also dries it out a little.</li>
            <li> I will reorder some more</li>
            <li> I have dark blonde/light brown colors in my hair that I had gotten balayged and toned to look ashy. I personally love the neutral/ash look and since my hair wasn&#x27;t blonde the purple shampoo had no use for me. According to my colorist and a color wheel I referenced the green in this hazelnut wash really helped contrast the reddish/copper undertones my light brown/dark blonde (about a level 5-6) hair had. I appreciate a good and natural product and loved that this was sulfate free and not tested on animals. I used this 1-2 times a week depending on how much color I wanted deposited and I would notice a difference every time and so did my friends and co workers! I have this wash as well as the cocoa rinse depending on how dark or ashy I want to be. The cocoa rinse deposits a neutral brown so it makes my hair look a bit darker. I would use a regular shampoo on my scalp since my roots were my natural dark brown color anyways then I would squeeze out any excess water in my hair and apply this shampoo liberally and leave it in for a few minutes before rinsing it out and it works great.</li>
            <li> My hair has been lightened several shades from my natural color.  I want to blend the lighter hair with new growth and try to lighten it less often.  So far, this method is adding just enough shading to notice that this should work as intended over time.  I am trying another Tressa Watercolors Color Maintenance Shampoo in Hazelnut as well.  I may eventually choose one over the other, or mix the colors to get the right one for my hair.  My goal is to use only the color maintenance shampoo until the lightened hair has grown out and entirely cut from my medium length &amp;#34;Bob&amp;#34; hairstyle.  The color change will be gradual, which is what I want.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  Sulfate free and easy on your hair.  Bought several different colors to mix together for my shade of red.  Keeps the color looking nice and bright.</li>
            <li> USED ONCE SO FAR,  WORKED WELL.  THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Great color deposit. It did dry out my hair. A good conditioner a must after using this product. Package arrived in perfect shape &amp; on time.</li>
            <li> I like quantum better but tressa would be my second choice. Quantum smells better and is thicker and makes more suds.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hairstylist and I absolutely love this product. Brings back color to my hair when coloring starts to fade. Love it!</li>
            <li> I had gone to Sally&#x27;s and bought 5a and 5n as they instructed me to match my roots to my very blonde body and ends. My hair was th eperfect tone, matched my roots exactly, unfortunately my hair turned just a bit too ashy. I bought this in an effort not to have to dye my hair again. It has helped bring my hair to a very beautiful, and natural looking color. It added just the right amount of warm tones to my hair without overly darkening it. I will definitely keep using this shampoo to balance out my hair colors.</li>
            <li> TSatisfactory in all regards.&lt;br /&gt;This Teressa product achieves everything advertised and sought. It can be trusted in terms of safety and efficacy.</li>
            <li> I used to have med.  brown colored hair.. Now, in its natural state it is mousey brown with a lot of grey in its natural state.  Who wants that? I have my hair professionally colored and it looks very nice, rich, and shiny for about 3 weeks .  Then,  I turn to Tressa Watercolors shampoo to bring it back to life and cover the roots until my next appointment. My hairdresser told me my color really holds and still looks shiny..... Then I confessed my secret. (She was impressed!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Not as great as some reviews have made it out to be.</li>
            <li> I bought this in several colors for my medium to dark brown hair thinking it would be fun to bring out different highlights. I bought this based on the recommendation of a YT video review.  I tried each of the colors I bought several times. No color change in my hair at all. Not even in the sunlight. You also need to use a lot to get your hair clean. I was very disappointed and shame on my for not returning them. They YTer did not say she was sponsored but I have a feeling that was the case.</li>
            <li> Super, will definitely purchase again.  Great product and seller.</li>
            <li> but one of the only such shampoo in products out there.  It would be nice if it had more staying power.</li>
            <li> A great product for use between coloring appointments.  Kept my color rich and warm.</li>
            <li> Too bad, but everything gives me a rash. It worked so try it if you know your skin is not sensitive</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some time with good results and it is gentle on my hair and scalp.  The color suits me and looks natural for my skin tone</li>
            <li> Works but stains your hands</li>
            <li> Firstly, the item arrived late. When I told the seller it had not arrived they told me it was it was now my responsibility to find the package and that there was nothing else they could do.  I find that very interesting considering they took my money so easily.  No customer service here...click along.  The shampoo doesn&#x27;t compete with Artec (discontinued) product. It lacks luster and coverage, &amp; color for that matter. I would try something else or if you can find Artec buy it!</li>
            <li> Stained my fiberglass shower stall.  Happy with product but not what it did to my shower!!!!</li>
            <li> I had recently purchased this product at my salon to help keep my blonde highlights natural looking and thought it did a great job doing just that. Now that I don&#x27;t want to highlight anymore, I purchased this product in the darker shade and it is helping me keep things looking great while they grow out. My husband noticed that my hair styled nicer and felt great after i used this too! My hair turns out like it does when the stylist blows it out...it&#x27;s very soft and silky. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Product definitely helps maintain your hair color if used 1 to 2 times a week.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> While trying to tone down the brassiness and deposit a bit of &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34; to my previously colored hair, I tried this product, but used it in conjunction with another shampoo to tone down the brassiness that keeps popping out.  This seems to work fine, getting me through until I could get the color blended with my natural color - brown and silver.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Tressa is great for red heads. .. bottled or not! ! I always lather it  in and leave on for a few minutes before rinsing. . But just have to make sure you don&#x27;t get too much on scalp cuz it will dye Ur scalp! !</li>
