            <li>I love this conditioner!</li>
            <li>This is a really amazing hair mask.</li>
            <li>I put a nice size glob and work through after shampooing then</li>
            <li>I have been using the Giovanni Eco Chic line for three years or so and am loving the 2chic Ultra Moist collection much better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and, every time I use it, my hair looks better and better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more manageable, too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m afro-american with 4A hair and this makes my hair silky smooth!</li>
            <li>Have to shake to get more..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to me that this care line does not test products on animals!  </li>
            <li>Most conditioners make me feel like I haven&#x27;t used a conditioner at all.</li>
            <li>Great smell and makes my hair feel much softer.  </li>
            <li>And bought a bunch more for people for Christmas.</li>
            <li>and i love this a staple i love avocado</li>
            <li>I loved it the first time I used it</li>
            <li>This is a good stuff, and my hair felt really silky after using this mask.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend purchasing from Amazon when the prices are more economical at TJ Maxx or Walmart.</li>
            <li>I handed out free samples to my friends.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into hair quickly and easily</li>
            <li>But it makes my hair so soft like baby hair its amazing.</li>
            <li>Offers incredible conditioning and manageability, especially during the summer months for those who spend time outdoors.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent.  </li>
            <li>I have 3c natural curly hair and this product made it extremely easy to comb.  </li>
            <li>I will for sure be following with hair products that have avocado  in it.  </li>
            <li>First I tried the Magnetic line in Giovanni--wonderful.  </li>
            <li>For the first time since I was a kid</li>
            <li>My graying, course hair finally looks shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>A nickel size amount coating the top layer of hair after washed is enough for me.</li>
            <li>silicone is one of the first ingredients int his conditioner</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s only after the first use!!!  </li>
            <li>I first got this stuff from a local whole foods store via free sample.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 after receiving a sample at whole foods.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this!</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner because it makes my very coarse hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Actually, I don&#x27;t even think it does as good of a job as my everyday conditioner.</li>
            <li>Cant beat such a fantastic product with NATURAL ORGANIC ingredients.</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous for naturally curly and/or dry hair.</li>
            <li>Is very easy to rinse out for me and leaves my hair so soft and tangle free and it dosent make my hair heavy or weighed down.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair very soft</li>
            <li>Im fair skin, I have thick, long hair.</li>
            <li>My new favorite thing to use right now , only problem is it&#x27;s very hard to get out</li>
            <li>Great product but too expensive for only one use on course hair.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and shiny, but never greasy.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so soft and my scalp so rejuvenated...</li>
            <li>out well and leaves hair soft</li>
            <li>One treatment lasts nearly a week for me.</li>
            <li>i have type 4 natural hair type 4abc</li>
            <li>It is heavy though, and it doesn&#x27;t rise out cleanly.</li>
            <li>I actually feel like I have normal hair and not hair made out of hay.</li>
            <li>Since I was tired of paying high prices, I wanted something that worked the same or better than the nut oil stuff.  </li>
            <li>The product is great, But.... since the mask is very thick and  the container is not convenient,it is hard to take the product out.</li>
            <li>Next I tried the Brazilian Keratin &amp; argan oil shampoo and conditioner--LOVE the smell and leaves my coarse silver hair soft as can be.  </li>
            <li>When I rinse it out and air dry, again, my hair is so soft!  </li>
            <li>If you have damaged or dry hair, coarse or wild hair, try this conditioner!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My hair is long and I can actually use 4 pumps of the anti-frizz!  </li>
            <li> Anyways it was marked down and an additional 50% off (trying to make space for new products) plus my 20% employee discount I ended up paying a little over 2 dollars.</li>
            <li> feels healthier and scalp isnt left dry</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars but gave it 4 instead since it does cause minor dandruff on my scalp.</li>
            <li> (I have long curly hair)</li>
            <li> and they feel the different from other</li>
            <li> I have never used any other hair mask prior to this one.</li>
            <li> living in a desert, my hair has become dry and split ends.</li>
            <li> i put this on my dry hair and it automatically responded and i was so shock</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the texture, but I don&#x27;t notice any difference between this and my everyday regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> As with the other Giovanni product&#x27;s this is no exception.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a small amount for the money.</li>
            <li> Before, it was brittle and dull.  </li>
            <li> I was having a bad hair day i didn&#x27;t want to even wet my hair</li>
            <li> The packaging design makes it almost impossible to get the product out.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and shiny, but never greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I purchased it at a mass retailer after using some macadamia nut oil deep conditioner that costs a bundle of money.  Since I was tired of paying high prices, I wanted something that worked the same or better than the nut oil stuff.  I know that Giovanni is a good brand and so I decided to give this conditioner a try.  I loved it the first time I used it and, every time I use it, my hair looks better and better.  Before, it was brittle and dull.  Now it&#x27;s soft and silky.  It&#x27;s much more manageable, too.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I would have given this product 5 stars but gave it 4 instead since it does cause minor dandruff on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afro-american with 4A hair and this makes my hair silky smooth! Also smells really good.</li>
            <li> This is a really amazing hair mask. Worth every cent.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> The product was just what I was looking for.  I will for sure be following with hair products that have avocado  in it.  I have searched various sites and your sight is the only one that had all of the products that was recommended to me.</li>
            <li> Great product but too expensive for only one use on course hair. Would not recommend purchasing from Amazon when the prices are more economical at TJ Maxx or Walmart.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!</li>
            <li> First I tried the Magnetic line in Giovanni--wonderful.  Next I tried the Brazilian Keratin &amp; argan oil shampoo and conditioner--LOVE the smell and leaves my coarse silver hair soft as can be.  Now this hair mask.  I put a nice size glob and work through after shampooing then go on to shave legs.  When I rinse it out and air dry, again, my hair is so soft!  The problem I&#x27;m having now is which one will I use next?!!  Every Giovanni product I&#x27;ve tried has been great.  I also use the styling gel and frizz be gone.  My hair is long and I can actually use 4 pumps of the anti-frizz!  But I&#x27;ll have to review that separately.  If you have damaged or dry hair, coarse or wild hair, try this conditioner!</li>
            <li> My new favorite thing to use right now , only problem is it&#x27;s very hard to get out once you already got some out.. Have to shake to get more..</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so soft and my scalp so rejuvenated...and that&#x27;s only after the first use!!!  It&#x27;s important to me that this care line does not test products on animals!  I will be trying the shampoo and daily conditioner as well in the future. I would recommend this product to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my girlfriend and it makes her hair look beautiful. She loves it.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into hair quickly and easily&lt;br /&gt;Rinses out well and leaves hair soft&lt;br /&gt;Helps with finger combing and detangling.&lt;br /&gt;Hair feels healthier and scalp isnt left dry</li>
            <li> love this product!! living in a desert, my hair has become dry and split ends. this product is awesome for moisturizing and smoothing out the frizz and ends. I bought 2 after receiving a sample at whole foods.</li>
            <li> I got this from my work today. If anyone has heard of Harmon? Anyways it was marked down and an additional 50% off (trying to make space for new products) plus my 20% employee discount I ended up paying a little over 2 dollars. This stuff is amazing! Almost instantly removed knots from my hair (I have long curly hair) I highly recomend this!</li>
            <li> Best hair stuff around , I love it !</li>
            <li> This works well for my Type 4 hair.</li>
            <li> Most conditioners make me feel like I haven&#x27;t used a conditioner at all. For the first time since I was a kid I actually feel like I have normal hair and not hair made out of hay. I use this every time I wash my hair. My graying, course hair finally looks shiny and healthy. It has a great smell too.</li>
            <li> It has been used by my wife and my daughter they say it&#x27;s excellent and they feel the different from other</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner because it makes my very coarse hair soft and shiny. The packaging design makes it almost impossible to get the product out. Also, it&#x27;s a small amount for the money.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the texture, but I don&#x27;t notice any difference between this and my everyday regular conditioner. Actually, I don&#x27;t even think it does as good of a job as my everyday conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair very soft and I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvements in frizziness or split ends. I will use up my current bottle, but won&#x27;t be re-purchasing.</li>
            <li> The product is great, But.... since the mask is very thick and  the container is not convenient,it is hard to take the product out. Frustrating&lt;br /&gt;xo</li>
            <li> Great smell and makes my hair feel much softer.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> One of the best hair products on the market.</li>
            <li> I love this deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I first got this stuff from a local whole foods store via free sample. Im fair skin, I have thick, long hair. A nickel size amount coating the top layer of hair after washed is enough for me. I have never used any other hair mask prior to this one. But it makes my hair so soft like baby hair its amazing. I handed out free samples to my friends. And bought a bunch more for people for Christmas. Cant beat such a fantastic product with NATURAL ORGANIC ingredients. Which I am def a fan of! One treatment lasts nearly a week for me. And this is a fairly good size bottle.</li>
            <li> As with the other Giovanni product&#x27;s this is no exception. Another winner for Giovanni. Great price and works great on my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous for naturally curly and/or dry hair. I have been using the Giovanni Eco Chic line for three years or so and am loving the 2chic Ultra Moist collection much better. Offers incredible conditioning and manageability, especially during the summer months for those who spend time outdoors. The Ultra Moist Shampoo and the Ultra Moist Conditioner are great also!</li>
            <li> This is a good stuff, and my hair felt really silky after using this mask. However, I give it three stars because I believe it is overpriced. The tiny bottle you get for the price of 10 dollars isn&#x27;t going to last you long.</li>
            <li> I have 3c natural curly hair and this product made it extremely easy to comb.  It is heavy though, and it doesn&#x27;t rise out cleanly.</li>
            <li> silicone is one of the first ingredients int his conditioner so  you dont wanna use this too often. It smells great, glides through the hair. Is very easy to rinse out for me and leaves my hair so soft and tangle free and it dosent make my hair heavy or weighed down.I used to use carols daughter but after trying these 2chic products from Giovanni and Wen I found my 2 holy grail product lines.</li>
            <li> I was having a bad hair day i didn&#x27;t want to even wet my hair i put this on my dry hair and it automatically responded and i was so shock i have type 4 natural hair type 4abc everything and i love this a staple i love avocado this works great with the olive oils hair has a great shine and everything i love this</li>
