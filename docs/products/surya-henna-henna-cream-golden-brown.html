            <li>Best coverage I have used with a henna product.  </li>
            <li>Surya is the best one I found.  </li>
            <li>the coverage is very good; comparable to any semi-color that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll get great results.</li>
            <li>In a nutshell this product is great</li>

            <li>So ignorantly I thought this would be a good solution..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought it based on good reviews.</li>
            <li>I just used it today and liked it.</li>
            <li>I think it is not as effective as chemical hair creams while covering the grays</li>
            <li>I liked the results</li>
            <li>This product works; it is the best of the natural dyes!  </li>
            <li>This henna does a great job of coloring grays and leaves your hair feeling soft and looking very healthy.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair looking healthy and shinny and don&#x27;t shed hair like with chemical hair dye.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more gold.</li>
            <li>I have experimented with this several times and 3 hours or longer seem to work best.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments on the color of my hair,</li>
            <li>she says its okay</li>
            <li>I thought henna suppose to be much better option</li>
            <li>So, I just presumed that it was mostly henna with some</li>
            <li>I did notice that my hair was falling out more, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had no time or energy for anything more.  </li>
            <li>Works ok for me.</li>
            <li>Have to do it twice to get better results.</li>
            <li>this is a good product I have a very sensible skin and my experience with this product</li>
            <li>This dye covered my gray the best out of all the other henna dyes I have tried.</li>
            <li>It washed out very quickly unlike the powder.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use, there&#x27;s no mixing and preparing.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is reported by FDA to be safe, but FDA deems many things safe that really are not.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone with fine hair as mine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>My mother has not lost as much hair as the chemical dyes, so she&#x27;s pretty happy with this one.</li>
            <li>I developed an allergy to the regular hair color products (anything containing PPD) and tried many henna products, but this one has been the best.</li>
            <li>This stuff is much easier than mixing up my own henna and indigo powders.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to be back with Surya Henna!</li>
            <li>This was very simple to apply and it provided great coverage.  </li>
            <li>but since it is natural and does smell good, we like and recommend it.</li>
            <li>had to color my hair quick and easy for a business trip.  </li>
            <li>However, it was easy to use, had no smell whatsoever, and left my hair in good condition.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased to have found this product because I was looking for a natural alternative to hair care.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this I got okay results.</li>
            <li>I Love my Healthy Natural 4a virgin hair (it use to be virgin, before this product)</li>
            <li>But in general, very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>not give full coverage to greys.&lt;br /&gt;do</li>
            <li>This is more of a stain and washes out even though I only use a conditioning shampoo like Wen that is color safe.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I will have better luck with Light Mountain&#x27;s Cover the Gray Natural Hair color.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and it covers the gray very well.</li>
            <li>The wait time is not too long and, best of all, zero allergic reaction, which is a real plus for someone with highly sensitive skin, scalp, etc.</li>
            <li>Clean up was very easy must use daily</li>
            <li>was very positive regarding to a chemical reactions.</li>
            <li>I can always depend on my hair having good volume after each treatment due to the conditioning affect.  </li>
            <li>The instructions also say you shouldn&#x27;t shampoo your hair right after coloring, just rinse and condition</li>
            <li>So easy to apply, no mess and great results, covers my grey hair and lasts up to a month,sometimes more, maybe because I wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li>I guess this is the best compromise for me for now, as the LM CTG was way too messy and made my hair red.  </li>
            <li>and I do no see the breakage that I had before as it is very gentle and</li>
            <li>Great for quick touch ups when I don&#x27;t have time to do a complete raw henna treatment.</li>
            <li>This is my first time dying my hair</li>
            <li>Product works well, lasting time could be better.</li>
            <li>If you have well water, wash out the minerals first.  </li>
            <li>Better than regular Henna powder.</li>
            <li>It covered the gray at first but then faded.</li>
            <li>It does not cover gray on the first try like it says it does.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I received the box which was pretty beat up.  </li>
            <li>Still, if you know much about natural hair dye, this is a great review!&lt;br /&gt;Conversely, &amp;#34;Palette by Nature&amp;#34; is at the bottom of natural hair dye; no dye effect whatsoever except to turn your scalp blue for two weeks.  </li>
            <li>For my hair it comes out to a beautiful rich brown color which I really like (not a fan of black, black hair anway).  </li>
            <li>I dont have much gray hair, but even then this doesnot work to coverup gray.</li>
            <li>i thought it would be easier to apply than the real henna powder.</li>
            <li>I have quite alot of gray, and this product covers very well.</li>
            <li>Some days I explain that it really isn&#x27;t highlights but the Henna color that I use that has the affect and some days I just say &amp;</li>
            <li>cant really tell much about it if you ask me</li>
            <li>The second time, I left it on for THREE hours, then washed off with warm water...</li>
            <li>good news is I have thick hair</li>
            <li>For the person that wrote the first review, henna isn&#x27;t supposed to make your hair a new color (unless you are really gray).</li>
            <li>Otherwise I would say it is a great product for anyone who wants to stay clear of the chemicals and odors of traditional dyes, or anyone that has allergies or other sensitivities to those products.</li>
            <li>SURYA BRASIL IS A COMPOUND HENNA..and unless you have decided to use this product for the rest of your hair&#x27;s life, No other product can be Safely used over it without possible melting your hair..</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was easy to apply but due to the chemicals I may have to go back to \\&quot;Light</li>
            <li>Conditioning is the main reason I decided to use it.</li>
            <li>This product works better for me than the regular commercial rinse and does not irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li>Not as natural as expected, more additives to product smallish amount for cost.</li>
            <li>I am 4 months pregnant and have been trying just about every brand of henna to cover my white hairs.</li>
            <li>The first time I left on for a little over an hour, after which when I washed my face with just warm water, all the color came out.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it for anyone who is highly allergic like myself.</li>
            <li>I have tried other semi-color treatments and even semi-color treatment were too strong for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my mom because she wants to use the natural hair dye.  </li>
            <li>I had to re-dye it with a normal chemical colouration...</li>
            <li>So the henna doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long and it takes longer for it to process, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>However, I recently moved to a new city and went into a Whole Foods for the first time</li>
            <li>I chose to use it because I wanted a natural alternative to traditional hair dyes while I was pregnant and nursing.  </li>
            <li>The second time I used it I left it on longer than they suggested and got fabulous results.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older my hair has been even mor sensitive</li>
            <li>so I guess I&#x27;m having the same exact problem.</li>
            <li>This product is good for people with naturally dark hair who want to cover a few grays or want to condition their hair.</li>
            <li>I spoke with (2) Surya&#x27;s customer service reps, inquiring if it was safe to use Garnier OLIA, after several weeks of just One application of SURYA BRASIL, (color: Black Creme)</li>
            <li>They are clearly listed on the ingredients on the box; I don&#x27;t know why they aren&#x27;t listed here as well.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny and ALL the gray is covered.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is, leave it on for at least 3 hours, more if you can do it</li>
            <li>My hair has always been sensitive to hair coloring.  </li>
            <li>Leave it on for the allocated time or the color does not set completely.  </li>
            <li>I think this company sold me a defective or old bottle of color.</li>
            <li>all natural henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Aug. 7, 2012&lt;</li>
            <li>It IS a compromise between the straight henna powders and the regular semi-permanent dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really did like the color when I used it prior to using the LM</li>
            <li>I thought I couldn&#x27;t use any hair coloring because I broke out every time I tried using one, including professional coloring.  </li>
            <li>at least I can cover most of my gray.  </li>
            <li>Then I realized that the product was old.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I dont think I will be purchasing from this vendor again, and will purchase directly from Surya if I can.</li>
            <li>I read some reviews that this henna is not totally 100% natural; well, it really depends on what you are looking for, if you are looking for something natural, or a product that will cover your grays.</li>
            <li>I use the black cream and as a full disclosure one should not expect your hair to be a true black from this product.  </li>
            <li>It dyes the white hairs to light grey and the color lasts for 2 to 3 days only</li>
            <li>It worked very well to blend grey, but it is NOT all-natural.</li>
            <li>I thought I would have to go grey, but thanks for this product i can cover my grays.</li>
            <li>I hope it will get back to normal with 2-3 shampoos.</li>
            <li>This has been working for her for a few years already and it is not a bad product.  </li>
            <li>While it didn&#x27;t come out quiet as dark as I expected (hense the 4/5 stars), my hair is an extremely dark brown right now, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Just be warned for any other persons interested in using this product.</li>
            <li>I have lots of gray it cover the grays just fine, but I did no see a single hair colored in black.</li>
            <li>but again, this is all natural so the effects of henna vs. chemicals may not be as dramatic as hair dye and my hair stays healthy.</li>
            <li>Color is dark at first but lightens up slowly as weeks progress into a brownish color, but that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li>You will get a deep color and your hair will be soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Not only is it a natural dye but it is a conditioner as well.  </li>
            <li>Barely made a difference.  </li>
            <li>I used the black in hopes of covering the red that resulted from using Light Mountain Cover the Grey (Dk. Brown).  </li>
            <li>The liquid/gel type consistency of this product makes it much easier to use than any other henna products I used where you had to mix it up yourself.</li>
            <li>Ladies be honest on these reviews there are many reviews out there and have the same issues I had with this terrible</li>
            <li>and I did not like the product much because my hair got red stead of black</li>
    </ol>

            <li> SURYA BRASIL IS A COMPOUND HENNA..and unless you have decided to use this product for the rest of your hair&#x27;s life, No other product can be Safely used over it without possible melting your hair..</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was easy to apply but due to the chemicals I may have to go back to \\&quot;Light</li>
            <li> Conditioning is the main reason I decided to use it.</li>
            <li> This product works better for me than the regular commercial rinse and does not irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li> Not as natural as expected, more additives to product smallish amount for cost.</li>
            <li> I am 4 months pregnant and have been trying just about every brand of henna to cover my white hairs.</li>
            <li> The first time I left on for a little over an hour, after which when I washed my face with just warm water, all the color came out.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone who is highly allergic like myself.</li>
            <li> I have tried other semi-color treatments and even semi-color treatment were too strong for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my mom because she wants to use the natural hair dye.  </li>
            <li> I had to re-dye it with a normal chemical colouration...</li>
            <li> So the henna doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long and it takes longer for it to process, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> However, I recently moved to a new city and went into a Whole Foods for the first time</li>
            <li> I chose to use it because I wanted a natural alternative to traditional hair dyes while I was pregnant and nursing.  </li>
            <li> The second time I used it I left it on longer than they suggested and got fabulous results.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older my hair has been even mor sensitive</li>
            <li> so I guess I&#x27;m having the same exact problem.</li>
            <li> This product is good for people with naturally dark hair who want to cover a few grays or want to condition their hair.</li>
            <li> I spoke with (2) Surya&#x27;s customer service reps, inquiring if it was safe to use Garnier OLIA, after several weeks of just One application of SURYA BRASIL, (color: Black Creme)</li>
            <li> They are clearly listed on the ingredients on the box; I don&#x27;t know why they aren&#x27;t listed here as well.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny and ALL the gray is covered.</li>
            <li> The bottom line is, leave it on for at least 3 hours, more if you can do it</li>
            <li> My hair has always been sensitive to hair coloring.  </li>
            <li> Leave it on for the allocated time or the color does not set completely.  </li>
            <li> I think this company sold me a defective or old bottle of color.</li>
            <li> all natural henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Aug. 7, 2012&lt;</li>
            <li> It IS a compromise between the straight henna powders and the regular semi-permanent dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really did like the color when I used it prior to using the LM</li>
            <li> I thought I couldn&#x27;t use any hair coloring because I broke out every time I tried using one, including professional coloring.  </li>
            <li> at least I can cover most of my gray.  </li>
            <li> Then I realized that the product was old.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I dont think I will be purchasing from this vendor again, and will purchase directly from Surya if I can.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that this henna is not totally 100% natural; well, it really depends on what you are looking for, if you are looking for something natural, or a product that will cover your grays.</li>
            <li> I use the black cream and as a full disclosure one should not expect your hair to be a true black from this product.  </li>
            <li> It dyes the white hairs to light grey and the color lasts for 2 to 3 days only</li>
            <li> It worked very well to blend grey, but it is NOT all-natural.</li>
            <li> I thought I would have to go grey, but thanks for this product i can cover my grays.</li>
            <li> I hope it will get back to normal with 2-3 shampoos.</li>
            <li> This has been working for her for a few years already and it is not a bad product.  </li>
            <li> While it didn&#x27;t come out quiet as dark as I expected (hense the 4/5 stars), my hair is an extremely dark brown right now, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Just be warned for any other persons interested in using this product.</li>
            <li> I have lots of gray it cover the grays just fine, but I did no see a single hair colored in black.</li>
            <li> but again, this is all natural so the effects of henna vs. chemicals may not be as dramatic as hair dye and my hair stays healthy.</li>
            <li> Color is dark at first but lightens up slowly as weeks progress into a brownish color, but that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li> You will get a deep color and your hair will be soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Not only is it a natural dye but it is a conditioner as well.  </li>
            <li> Barely made a difference.  </li>
            <li> I used the black in hopes of covering the red that resulted from using Light Mountain Cover the Grey (Dk. Brown).  </li>
            <li> The liquid/gel type consistency of this product makes it much easier to use than any other henna products I used where you had to mix it up yourself.</li>
            <li> Ladies be honest on these reviews there are many reviews out there and have the same issues I had with this terrible</li>
            <li> and I did not like the product much because my hair got red stead of black</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that sometimes there are small &amp;#34;chunks&amp;#34; of dye in certain batches.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to re write my original review which was very positive but after 2 weeks since first time use of this product, I must update my frightening discovery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to last as long as traditional hair dye</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered this product and found hard clumps in it.  </li>
            <li> (henna naturally makes the hair reddish), but it isn&#x27;t enough to make it pitch black.</li>
            <li> I have hair that is naturally medium brown, but I&#x27;ve always wanted black hair.</li>
            <li> Others always seemed to dry my hair, but this once actually conditions my hair as well.</li>
            <li> It works on natural color (black) but not on gray.</li>
            <li> : takes forever to rinse out and got out of shower still dripping color, gloves are cheap, bottle weird to use&lt;br /&gt;Tips</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m Soo not ready to embrace the gray that has recently started appearing..</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> (I have grey hair.)  </li>
            <li> which should not take long as everytime</li>
            <li> cover the grey.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on grey beards.</li>
            <li> It didnt cover much grey even after leaving it on for 1 hour.</li>
            <li> Does not dye hairs no matter for how long you leave that on.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing is that it is not as long lasting as the traditional chemical dyes, but it is a hundred times healthier than the chemicals.  </li>
            <li> And the results were the same: All the color came out - the grey wasn&#x27;t even tinged with a slight color.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s short one star because I just didn&#x27;t feel like it made my hair as dark as I thought it would be</li>
            <li> It toned it down just a bit, but still red!  </li>
            <li> I will keep using this until my hair grows out, because it DOES tone down the red somewhat and helps my roots not look quite so</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve got a lot of black on the walls of my shower, on the pillow case, next day in the pool...</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that the bottle says \\&quot;guaranteed 100% gray coverage\\&quot; this product did not cover my grays, despite the fact I left it on for about an hour and a half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going give another try and see the results maybe it will be black within the second try.</li>
            <li> I left this product in for one hour and half</li>
            <li> It imparts some color but not much.  </li>
            <li> went to my hair stylist over the weekend for a hair cut and when she comb through my wet hair, she caught a clump of hair fall out.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this product is quite alarming.</li>
            <li> It worked well and colored my gray hair as expected.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t completely chemical free like raw henna but not as bad as the over the counter hair color.</li>
            <li> I react slightly to them but nothing like the PPD in permanent hair dyes, so I plan to use this as long as I can.</li>
            <li> And in couple of weeks, nothing black remained on my grey.</li>
            <li> and my hair didn&#x27;t change at all, but my hair feels less dry.</li>
            <li> so tried this to cover the 15% grey in my very dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I am extremely allergic to chemical hair dyes (severe swelling, itching, burning)</li>
            <li> AND...there are a lot of other chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I tried other henna products but they contained chemicals also and made my head itch.  </li>
            <li> I tried to color it with a conventional dye as a teenager (I&#x27;m 26) and had a reaction</li>
            <li> then conventional hair dye</li>
            <li> : for hard white hair leave on 1.5 instead of 1 hour, use lotion on hairline for non skin coloring</li>
            <li> I mix it with dark brown to make the brown darker.</li>
            <li> As I have thick hair, I left it on for about two hours before rinse.</li>
            <li> this crap will bleed forever no matter how many time you washed your hair.  </li>
            <li> I combine the black, 1/2 and 1/2 with dark brown to make dark brown.  </li>
            <li> Liquid  not much better at coloring than a cheaper dry grain of henna would be  though,</li>
            <li> Henna cannot dye anything black.  </li>
            <li> It is unnatural &amp; possibly dangerous, especially if you are using henna for its natural properties.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Colora products before but decided to switch as I couldn&#x27;t find Colora black.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally black with strands of gray all over.</li>
            <li> The dye didn&#x27;t turn the gray black</li>
            <li> Yes, they do put some black dyes in there</li>
            <li> Has a slight chemical odor when using it but goes away after you rinse it.</li>
            <li> I use black to cover my graying hair.</li>
            <li> The down side is it does wear off, and can look a little brassy/copper colored.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunatly it turned out really dark green.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a mess to apply and doesn&#x27;t get your hair black.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I do spray some water on to get it a little damp before coloring, this seems to help the color stick.</li>
            <li> Not sure what could be causing this since I did not have any other allergic reaction to the dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t last very long (about 3 weeks)</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Wasted the money and time on this Product.</li>
            <li> After few treatments my hair would start thinning and have a brittleness to it.  </li>
            <li> I chose this product because I wanted a hair color that was not too harsh on my hair.  </li>
            <li> But All my skin got really dark, and it is really looking bad ( like a scar now)</li>
            <li> I switched to henna because I was starting to get a bad allergic reaction to regular hair dyes.</li>
            <li> Usually repeat every 6 to 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> Read about them and the ingredient, especially in black hair dyes, is harsh and a suspected (or known) carcinogenic.</li>
            <li> I guess this is the least toxic of the non-all-natural product.  </li>
            <li> They are like small crystals that clog the dispenser as you are applying the color, and if they do come through, they are difficult to rinse out of your hair when you are finished.  </li>
            <li> the Chemicals used to make Surya Creme will/may interact horribly with other products by either melting your hair, or disintergrating your hair slowly resulting in dry, damaged Thin, discolored hair.</li>
            <li> It is useless.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am HORRIFIED to discover I will either have to cut off the colored hair..or stick with this UN-ORGANIC product forever..</li>
            <li> I probably did something wrong or my hair could not hold the dye as was supposed to.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> Very poor product.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Years ago I used the powered version and it was a horrible messy disaster.  </li>
            <li> so bad</li>
            <li> so if you are expecting those results you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will be disappointed if you buy this one in the hope of replacing Henna powder products to dye you hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for this crap to wash out of my hair</li>
            <li> I AM SOOO MAD AT MYSELF FOR PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT, before investigating it thoroughly!!</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worst product I ever tried.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So easy to apply, no mess and great results, covers my grey hair and lasts up to a month,sometimes more, maybe because I wash my hair every other day. Leaves hair looking healthy and shinny and don&#x27;t shed hair like with chemical hair dye.</li>
            <li> Henna cannot dye anything black.  This product may have henna in it, but it is not the henna that dyes your hair.  It is unnatural &amp; possibly dangerous, especially if you are using henna for its natural properties.</li>
            <li> I dont have much gray hair, but even then this doesnot work to coverup gray. There was no change in the color for hair even after keeping it for 1 hr as instructed. But All my skin got really dark, and it is really looking bad ( like a scar now) I hope it will get back to normal with 2-3 shampoos. Dont buy this product at all. It is useless.</li>
            <li> I am extremely allergic to chemical hair dyes (severe swelling, itching, burning) so tried this to cover the 15% grey in my very dark brown hair. It worked very well to blend grey, but it is NOT all-natural. All Surya cream colors contain aniline dyes (such as Disperse Violet, HCA red, etc.) They are clearly listed on the ingredients on the box; I don&#x27;t know why they aren&#x27;t listed here as well. I react slightly to them but nothing like the PPD in permanent hair dyes, so I plan to use this as long as I can. I do wish the color lasted longer though, it washes out in about a month and since I am a swimmer, the chlorine in the pool bleaches it out even faster.</li>
            <li> Hi there,  I tried the henna fluid cause i thought it would be easier to apply than the real henna powder. Unfortunatly it turned out really dark green. I had to re-dye it with a normal chemical colouration...</li>
            <li> I spoke with (2) Surya&#x27;s customer service reps, inquiring if it was safe to use Garnier OLIA, after several weeks of just One application of SURYA BRASIL, (color: Black Creme) but I was told: MY HAIR MAY MELT...(OMG) the Chemicals used to make Surya Creme will/may interact horribly with other products by either melting your hair, or disintergrating your hair slowly resulting in dry, damaged Thin, discolored hair. SURYA BRASIL IS A COMPOUND HENNA..and unless you have decided to use this product for the rest of your hair&#x27;s life, No other product can be Safely used over it without possible melting your hair.. I Love my Healthy Natural 4a virgin hair (it use to be virgin, before this product) but I&#x27;m Soo not ready to embrace the gray that has recently started appearing..So ignorantly I thought this would be a good solution..Needless to say I am HORRIFIED to discover I will either have to cut off the colored hair..or stick with this UN-ORGANIC product forever.. I AM SOOO MAD AT MYSELF FOR PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT, before investigating it thoroughly!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought it based on good reviews. I&#x27;ve used Colora products before but decided to switch as I couldn&#x27;t find Colora black. Well, I&#x27;ve got a lot of black on the walls of my shower, on the pillow case, next day in the pool... And in couple of weeks, nothing black remained on my grey. Going back to Colora even if I have to switch the color.</li>
            <li> This dye covered my gray the best out of all the other henna dyes I have tried. My hair is naturally black with strands of gray all over. The dye didn&#x27;t turn the gray black it&#x27;s more gold. The dye turned my gray strands gold, so it gives my hair some highlights.</li>
            <li> For the person that wrote the first review, henna isn&#x27;t supposed to make your hair a new color (unless you are really gray). Yes, they do put some black dyes in there (henna naturally makes the hair reddish), but it isn&#x27;t enough to make it pitch black. This product is good for people with naturally dark hair who want to cover a few grays or want to condition their hair. I just finished using it and my hair didn&#x27;t change at all, but my hair feels less dry. Conditioning is the main reason I decided to use it. It washed out very quickly unlike the powder. It also has no smell and doesn&#x27;t irritate your head. I&#x27;m very pleased to have found this product because I was looking for a natural alternative to hair care.</li>
            <li> Great for quick touch ups when I don&#x27;t have time to do a complete raw henna treatment. This is more of a stain and washes out even though I only use a conditioning shampoo like Wen that is color safe. This isn&#x27;t completely chemical free like raw henna but not as bad as the over the counter hair color. Has a slight chemical odor when using it but goes away after you rinse it.</li>
            <li> I have quite alot of gray, and this product covers very well. The down side is it does wear off, and can look a little brassy/copper colored.  But in general, very satisfied with this product. I developed an allergy to the regular hair color products (anything containing PPD) and tried many henna products, but this one has been the best. The liquid/gel type consistency of this product makes it much easier to use than any other henna products I used where you had to mix it up yourself. DEFINITELY recommend!!</li>
            <li> I just used it today and liked it. It is easy to use and it covers the gray very well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a mess to apply and doesn&#x27;t get your hair black.&lt;br /&gt;The color that you do get will run out in about two weeks anyway so don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed! It&#x27;s the worst product I ever tried. The color doesn&#x27;t stay on your hair at all. Don&#x27;t wast your money to try it!.  BTW, it&#x27;s not nature at all.</li>
            <li> This product did not work as advertised.  It imparts some color but not much.  It didn&#x27;t work too well for me.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I got okay results. The second time I used it I left it on longer than they suggested and got fabulous results. My hair is soft and shiny and ALL the gray is covered. It lasted about 6 weeks and I will definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I have hair that is naturally medium brown, but I&#x27;ve always wanted black hair. I tried to color it with a conventional dye as a teenager (I&#x27;m 26) and had a reaction so bad I needed prescription antihistamines! However, I recently moved to a new city and went into a Whole Foods for the first time and I saw this. Since it is 100% vegan, I thought I should give it a whirl. As I have thick hair, I left it on for about two hours before rinse. While it didn&#x27;t come out quiet as dark as I expected (hense the 4/5 stars), my hair is an extremely dark brown right now, and I LOVE it. The color is beautiful and no allergic reaction this time! I will definitely purchase this dye again.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that the bottle says \\&quot;guaranteed 100% gray coverage\\&quot; this product did not cover my grays, despite the fact I left it on for about an hour and a half. However, it was easy to use, had no smell whatsoever, and left my hair in good condition. I wish it had covered my grays, but since it did not I will have to seek out another product. Perhaps I will have better luck with Light Mountain&#x27;s Cover the Gray Natural Hair color.</li>
            <li> I think it is not as effective as chemical hair creams while covering the grays but since it is natural and does smell good, we like and recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my first time dying my hair and I did not like the product much because my hair got red stead of black I probably did something wrong or my hair could not hold the dye as was supposed to. I have lots of gray it cover the grays just fine, but I did no see a single hair colored in black. Don&#x27;t get me wrong this is a good product I have a very sensible skin and my experience with this product was very positive regarding to a chemical reactions. I&#x27;m going give another try and see the results maybe it will be black within the second try. I gave this product five stars just because of color results, otherwise I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Tried this product 3 times with longer than the suggested time. But my Gray hair didn&#x27;t change the color at all . Wasted the money and time on this Product.</li>
            <li> Product works well, lasting time could be better. It last for one day. Clean up was very easy must use daily</li>
            <li> This product works better for me than the regular commercial rinse and does not irritate my scalp. Results also last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I switched to henna because I was starting to get a bad allergic reaction to regular hair dyes. Read about them and the ingredient, especially in black hair dyes, is harsh and a suspected (or known) carcinogenic. Ack! So the henna doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long and it takes longer for it to process, but it&#x27;s okay. This stuff is much easier than mixing up my own henna and indigo powders.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use, there&#x27;s no mixing and preparing. Best used with the Surya Nature Leave-In conditioner.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to leave it on for 45 minutes or an hour but if you do that the color won&#x27;t take. I have experimented with this several times and 3 hours or longer seem to work best. You will get a deep color and your hair will be soft and shiny. I don&#x27;t wash my hair before but I do spray some water on to get it a little damp before coloring, this seems to help the color stick. It&#x27;s not going to last as long as traditional hair dye so if you are expecting those results you will be disappointed. I can go 3 weeks between coloring and that&#x27;s good enough for me. The instructions also say you shouldn&#x27;t shampoo your hair right after coloring, just rinse and condition, I&#x27;ve never done that, I have to shampoo. The bottom line is, leave it on for at least 3 hours, more if you can do it and you&#x27;ll get great results.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with fine hair as mine.  My hair has always been sensitive to hair coloring.  After few treatments my hair would start thinning and have a brittleness to it.  As I&#x27;ve gotten older my hair has been even mor sensitive and i had continued to see thinning.  I have tried other semi-color treatments and even semi-color treatment were too strong for my hair.  I finally discovered the Henna color by Surya at my health food and vitamin store and thought I&#x27;d try it.  It&#x27;s been wonderful for my hair!  Not only is it a natural dye but it is a conditioner as well.  I can always depend on my hair having good volume after each treatment due to the conditioning affect.  I use the black cream and as a full disclosure one should not expect your hair to be a true black from this product.  For my hair it comes out to a beautiful rich brown color which I really like (not a fan of black, black hair anway).  I also get an added bonus because the greys in my hair actually turn a reddish color which makes my hair appear as though I have highlights.  I have gotten so many compliments on the color of my hair, i.e. &amp;#34;your highlights are beautiful&amp;#34;.  Some days I explain that it really isn&#x27;t highlights but the Henna color that I use that has the affect and some days I just say &amp;#34;why thank you!&amp;#34; and don&#x27;t bother to explain.  In a nutshell this product is great and I do no see the breakage that I had before as it is very gentle and the coverage is very good; comparable to any semi-color that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I use black to cover my graying hair. Color is dark at first but lightens up slowly as weeks progress into a brownish color, but that&#x27;s fine with me. Usually repeat every 6 to 8 weeks. Best henna I have tried. Others always seemed to dry my hair, but this once actually conditions my hair as well. Have been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> You will be disappointed if you buy this one in the hope of replacing Henna powder products to dye you hair. Stay away.</li>
            <li> This product works; it is the best of the natural dyes!  I combine the black, 1/2 and 1/2 with dark brown to make dark brown.  (I have grey hair.)  This product will fade and a red undertone emerges, so you need to use this product every 2-4 weeks to maintain the richness.  If you have well water, wash out the minerals first.  Still, if you know much about natural hair dye, this is a great review!&lt;br /&gt;Conversely, &amp;#34;Palette by Nature&amp;#34; is at the bottom of natural hair dye; no dye effect whatsoever except to turn your scalp blue for two weeks.  It was ultra-drying as if my hair had been treated with peroxide... and it costs double!  The company was untrustworthy.  Buyer beware.  I am so happy to be back with Surya Henna!</li>
            <li> family member asked me to buy it for her she says its okay cant really tell much about it if you ask me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine. Easy to use. Better than regular Henna powder.</li>
            <li> It works on natural color (black) but not on gray. It will leave a brown color on the gray hair,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to re write my original review which was very positive but after 2 weeks since first time use of this product, I must update my frightening discovery.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been losing a lot of hair. Especially while being washed. It comes out in clumps. It falls out every time I stroke through it or when being comb or brushed. It seems I&#x27;m just leaving a trail of hair every where.&lt;br /&gt;The good news is I have thick hair so I have lots of it but this loss of hair is quite alarming.&lt;br /&gt;I went to my hair stylist over the weekend for a hair cut and when she comb through my wet hair, she caught a clump of hair fall out. She gasped. I told her about this henna and said I&#x27;ve been losing hair since use...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read from another reviewer that she also lost a lot of hair so I guess I&#x27;m having the same exact problem. Just be warned for any other persons interested in using this product. Not sure what could be causing this since I did not have any other allergic reaction to the dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other then that, this would have been a perfect product. The ingredients in this product is quite alarming. I thought henna suppose to be much better option then conventional hair dye but it&#x27;s actually the later... Stay away from it.</li>
            <li> I mix it with dark brown to make the brown darker.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I wanted a hair color that was not too harsh on my hair.  It worked well and colored my gray hair as expected.  Leave it on for the allocated time or the color does not set completely.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product, work&#x27;s well</li>
            <li> I used this product for three years.  I chose to use it because I wanted a natural alternative to traditional hair dyes while I was pregnant and nursing.  This henna does a great job of coloring grays and leaves your hair feeling soft and looking very healthy.  The only drawback is that sometimes there are small &amp;#34;chunks&amp;#34; of dye in certain batches.  They are like small crystals that clog the dispenser as you are applying the color, and if they do come through, they are difficult to rinse out of your hair when you are finished.  But that only seems to happen once in a while.  Otherwise I would say it is a great product for anyone who wants to stay clear of the chemicals and odors of traditional dyes, or anyone that has allergies or other sensitivities to those products.</li>
            <li> The color lasted about four days and it is supposed to be permanant. It covered the gray at first but then faded. Very poor product.</li>
            <li> Not as natural as expected, more additives to product smallish amount for cost. Liquid  not much better at coloring than a cheaper dry grain of henna would be  though,</li>
            <li> Best coverage I have used with a henna product.  I am 4 months pregnant and have been trying just about every brand of henna to cover my white hairs. I will list my pros and cons below.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: so easy to apply, no mixing, smells great, can reuse, best henna coverage&lt;br /&gt;Cons: takes forever to rinse out and got out of shower still dripping color, gloves are cheap, bottle weird to use&lt;br /&gt;Tips: for hard white hair leave on 1.5 instead of 1 hour, use lotion on hairline for non skin coloring</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom because she wants to use the natural hair dye.  This has been working for her for a few years already and it is not a bad product.  The only negative thing is that it is not as long lasting as the traditional chemical dyes, but it is a hundred times healthier than the chemicals.  My mother has not lost as much hair as the chemical dyes, so she&#x27;s pretty happy with this one.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered this product and found hard clumps in it.  I think this company sold me a defective or old bottle of color.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible don&#x27;t waste your money.  It does not cover gray on the first try like it says it does.  I left this product in for one hour and half even set un the dryer after calling the company.  My gray was orange and did not cover well.  I washed it as stated even brought their  conditioner and let me tell  you this crap will bleed forever no matter how many time you washed your hair.  I decided after calling the company again and they told me to leave it on for 2 to 3 hours ladies read the box no where does it tell you to leave this stuff on your head for 2 to 3 hours and even longer if you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never recommend this product to anyone with the exeception if a person could not use standard hair dye.  I can&#x27;t wait for this crap to wash out of my hair which should not take long as everytime you wash your hair color comes out which is a pain, but what gets me is when you sleeping color is all over your pillowcases.  Ladies be honest on these reviews there are many reviews out there and have the same issues I had with this terrible so called henna cream</li>
            <li> I tried this...I liked the results but my scalp itched for quite some time.  I never bothered to read the ingredients because it was called, \\&quot;Henna Cream.\\&quot;  So, I just presumed that it was mostly henna with some botanicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept the box to reorder.  But when I read the ingredients today, the second ingredient is a form of ether!  AND...there are a lot of other chemicals.  I did notice that my hair was falling out more, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to apply but due to the chemicals I may have to go back to \\&quot;Light Mountain Cover the Grey\\&quot; all natural henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Aug. 7, 2012&lt;br /&gt;I was researching again....reconsidering this product.  I looked up the ingredient, \\&quot;Dipropropylene glycol methyl ether\\&quot;  and it was listed under use for cosmetics.  It is reported by FDA to be safe, but FDA deems many things safe that really are not.  So.....I guess this is the least toxic of the non-all-natural product.  It IS a compromise between the straight henna powders and the regular semi-permanent dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Sept.18, 2012&lt;br /&gt;I had to color my hair quick and easy for a business trip.  I had no time or energy for anything more.  This product touted to cover ANY condition of hair...dyed, henna&#x27;d, etc.  I used the black in hopes of covering the red that resulted from using Light Mountain Cover the Grey (Dk. Brown).  Barely made a difference.  It toned it down just a bit, but still red!  So, I learned from this, that Suryea does NOT cover henna-dyed hair!!  Very disappointing!!  I will keep using this until my hair grows out, because it DOES tone down the red somewhat and helps my roots not look quite so obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND...I really did like the color when I used it prior to using the LM cover the grey.  I guess this is the best compromise for me for now, as the LM CTG was way too messy and made my hair red.  So, I do recommend it, but be cautioned that it may not cover henna colored hair.</li>
            <li> I thought I couldn&#x27;t use any hair coloring because I broke out every time I tried using one, including professional coloring.  I tried other henna products but they contained chemicals also and made my head itch.  Surya is the best one I found.  It makes my head itch a bit but it&#x27;s tolerable and at least I can cover most of my gray.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t last very long (about 3 weeks) before I have to color again.  I recommend it for anyone who is highly allergic like myself.</li>
            <li> Works ok for me. After leaving it on for an hour I still see some gray hairs in my beard. Have to do it twice to get better results.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to try on my graying beard.  I have tried twice.  The first time I left on for a little over an hour, after which when I washed my face with just warm water, all the color came out.  The second time, I left it on for THREE hours, then washed off with warm water...And the results were the same: All the color came out - the grey wasn&#x27;t even tinged with a slight color.  Bottom line: Doesn&#x27;t work on grey beards.</li>
            <li> i tried this dye on numerous occasions.&lt;br /&gt;Does not give full coverage to greys.&lt;br /&gt;do not buy this product at all!</li>
            <li> First of all, I received the box which was pretty beat up.  Then I realized that the product was old.  When I used it on my hair, it had a lot of gritty substance which I have no idea of what it was.  I had to wash my hair THREE TIMES to get whatever this substance was out of my hair.  It didnt cover much grey even after leaving it on for 1 hour. For the price, I dont think I will be purchasing from this vendor again, and will purchase directly from Surya if I can.</li>
            <li> I m totally allergic to any type of hair dye. If you are looking for a product that covers the gray, that is the way to go. It ll whash off within 6 weeks. I have never read the chemicals that is in it. What I care about is the fact that covers the gray. I thought I would have to go grey, but thanks for this product i can cover my grays. I read some reviews that this henna is not totally 100% natural; well, it really depends on what you are looking for, if you are looking for something natural, or a product that will cover your grays. Five stars for this product.</li>
            <li> Does not dye hairs no matter for how long you leave that on. I used that for 5 times, but the result was same. It dyes the white hairs to light grey and the color lasts for 2 to 3 days only</li>
            <li> Yay, no allergies!!!  The color is great.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  The wait time is not too long and, best of all, zero allergic reaction, which is a real plus for someone with highly sensitive skin, scalp, etc.</li>
            <li> Years ago I used the powered version and it was a horrible messy disaster.  This was very simple to apply and it provided great coverage.  Of course it&#x27;s henna so rinsing it out is the hardest part.  It&#x27;s short one star because I just didn&#x27;t feel like it made my hair as dark as I thought it would be but again, this is all natural so the effects of henna vs. chemicals may not be as dramatic as hair dye and my hair stays healthy.</li>
