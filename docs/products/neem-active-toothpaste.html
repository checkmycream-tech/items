            <li>this product were universally available, I believe the price would be more palatable too!</li>

            <li>Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s more profitable for them to keep us hooked on putting our \\&quot;dental lives\\</li>
            <li>SURE know</li>
            <li>but when I added Trader Joe&#x27;s Myrrh propolis toothpaste, the spreading was better.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t have fluoride in our water supply and it&#x27;s better than digesting it.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite toothpaste this works</li>
            <li>you want a SAFE and HEALTHY TOOTHPASTE, avoid this one.</li>
            <li>Azadirachta (Neem) kills most bacteria and has even been shown to de-activate some viruses.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this before it is ok ..</li>
            <li>It has so many chemicals, I do hope it works as promised.</li>
            <li>(I need 8 more words so this is fill)</li>
            <li>I think it works better than the name brands.</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>I feel the paste has a more cleansing feeling on my&lt;br /&gt;Teeth and mouth.  </li>
            <li>So, I am pleased</li>
            <li>makes your mouth feel refreshing.  </li>
            <li>It tastes okay.</li>
            <li>I love the taste and the way it makes my mouth and teeth feel.</li>
            <li>you can do much better than this product.  </li>
            <li>OK..</li>
            <li>v Fluoride Ion (interesting huh?).  </li>
            <li>I hope this has redeemed myself and has Helped many in their selection of what kind of toothpastes are available.  </li>
            <li>I will try the toothpastes (Himalaya &amp; Neem) to see if they work better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>If I find anything that may be interesting I will update this post again.  </li>
            <li>I did some further research and found NON-SHAMPOO ingredients in some excellent toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>i have happily given up american toothpaste for a good product that makes me feel cleaner.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>May take more time to evaluate how I like it.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and look nice and shiny after using this product.</li>
            <li>Mouth felt very clean.</li>
            <li>Toothpastes with neem are definitely worth the $$$&#x27;s!!  </li>
            <li>Teeth feel clean!</li>
            <li>I am happy it is a natural product at that.  </li>
            <li>no hard scraping they used water!!!!!</li>
            <li>Thieves Oil toothpaste and mouthwash is an excellent product (cost is very high thought) and has no &#x27;soaps in it, also Desert Product uses TEA TREE OIL and NEEM OILS in their toothpaste and mouthwash, Tea Tree oil is a natural anti-bacterial ingredient used for thousands of years.  </li>
            <li>I love the taste and how clean my teeth feel after using it.  </li>
            <li>My Wife who works for the County of Los Angeles Health Dept. got more information on what is regarded as a &#x27;good&#x27; natural toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Love the taste and how clean my mouth feels.  </li>
            <li>but I strongly suggest that you DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>The taste is rather strong.</li>
            <li>High in flouride, but thats good for us.  </li>
            <li>and my breathe seem to be fine after eating and drinking</li>
            <li>Quick shipping,great feel after brushing taste good..and minty  Refreshing..</li>
            <li>A clean, odd taste which takes a little getting used to; experienced some nausea after using, but teeth were clean, and gums felt good; I experienced a good delivery, product was as advertised and worth the price,</li>
            <li>Thank you for making it available.</li>
            <li>We Americans call our society advanced</li>
            <li>Then it says it contains 1000 ppm max of fluoride available when packed.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;100% Vegetarian and Free from</li>
            <li>been using Neem Active for about a year or more...... does a great job of keeping teeth clean and tartar away.</li>
            <li>I get ulcers easily and this seems to help them heal quickly</li>
            <li>These people live for many many years and have all their original teeth.  </li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m more than willing to brush with it rather than having anymore wasteful painful/time-consuming/expensive dental visits.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh!</li>
            <li>First ingredient... SORBITOL (which indicates more then</li>
            <li>This toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling so clean.  </li>
            <li>but my mouth feels clean after using.</li>
            <li>My teeth have never been feeling so clean except just the days after the dental cleaning a the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>This tastes so clean</li>
            <li>My teeth did feel clean afterwards,but,leaves your breath smell like clay.</li>
            <li>this toothpaste makes my teeth feel clean</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get excited about toothpaste, but I&#x27;m impressed with the taste, texture and performance of this product.  </li>
            <li>This paste is different but in a good way I like the mint</li>
            <li>very healthy no warning sign not to swallow like regular toothpaste</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not to strong and gets rid of morning mouth taste fast</li>
            <li>I use neem for killing bugs in my garden since it is a great pesticide in natural form but not for internal use and don&#x27;t forget, produced in India.</li>
            <li>I like that there is no artificial coloring or flavoring.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I took a chance on this product before using this product my gums were so sensitive</li>
            <li>SWEARING that Indians rarely go to dentists because their #1 protection is brushing with neem.  </li>
            <li>Tastes fresh and minty.  </li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;m not a Dentist or any oral healthcare professional, so take this with a grain of salt.</li>
            <li>but this seems to find those particles that were hiding by the gums or between teeth and leaving my mouth fresh and teeth like they were polished.</li>
            <li>The natural bacteria protection from Neem leaves my mouth and gum tissue feeling refreshed and healthy.  </li>
            <li>This is ok, but I have sensitive teeth and have been using sensodine for years.  </li>
            <li>OK but I was hoping for all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It says \\&quot;Natural and nature derived ingredients\\&quot;, \\&quot;Natural protection for strong teeth and healthy</li>
            <li>Really feel clean when using.</li>
            <li>I would recomment to everyone who wants clean teeth,mouth and breath......</li>
            <li>The fresh minty flavor does a good job masking the slight earthy after taste of neem.  </li>
            <li>The name of this toothpaste is very misleading, as it is full of toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>&quot; on fluoride and having to go back to pay $$$&#x27;s for more dental visits and more dental products than it is to let people know there are better foreign products out there used by other just as intelligent humans in far off lands.</li>
            <li>Neem toothpaste not only tastes great and may have some medical benefits ([...]).</li>
            <li>We like this toothpaste very much, dosing even seems easier.</li>
            <li>It is a fine toothpaste, but as a creature of liking to be given what I ask for, I was surprised.  </li>
            <li>and it really does whiten your teeth!</li>
            <li>and when I do i&#x27;m interested to see if he sees any difference</li>
            <li>Evidently it has a LOT of fluoride too.</li>
            <li>Neem is also used regularly in skin and hair products and give better results (with lotions, oils, soaps, shampoo, etc.</li>
            <li>This is the ultimate toothpaste for those of us who brush faithfully but still get too many cavities.  </li>
            <li>I saw this product on the Dr. Oz show and it is exactly as they described.  </li>
            <li>and so they are healthy and white  </li>
            <li>I RETRACT MY FIRST STATEMENT ABOUT THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Just tried this Neem toothpaste for the first time.  </li>
            <li>use it everyday with good results.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and the fact that it is a natural anti bacterial won me over!</li>
            <li>the teeth naturally, leaves a fresh smell and fresh feeling to dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li>Neem in the toothpaste certainly is my DENTAL SAVIOR.  </li>
            <li>It contains neem, which, I heard, is a derivative from a certain type of tree, and that people in India and Africa chew on the tree bark for their dental hygiene, and don&#x27;t have to worry about dental visits.  </li>
            <li>The whole family uses this.</li>
            <li>Thanks all and</li>
            <li>, they really need to update the photo with the ingredient list.</li>
            <li>got the rest of my order really fast, everything that didn&#x27;t come from spice world that is....</li>
            <li>; 4 ppm is considered unsafe (really, any amount will calcify your pineal gland and reduce your brain function).  </li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to mint flavors found in many toothpastes, Neem toothpaste will freshen your mouth in a similar fashion without the discomfort.</li>
            <li>but now the good news which I think I was in error by giving this product a negative review...</li>
            <li>It made a major difference in my most recent checkup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This tooth paste has a slight soapy taste, but OK.</li>
            <li>I have no issues to complain of with this brand, it works like a charm and is decent on teeth when applied as directed.</li>
            <li>I had to go to sensodyne tooth paste in order to stop the irritation at gum line, I had been able to use just regular tooth paste, prior to Neem.</li>
            <li>The taste is mainly minty, but has a &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; overtone of taste or smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is the ingredient that makes the toothpaste &#x27;sudsy&#x27; or we would be brushing with &#x27;GOO&#x27; but don&#x27;t ingest it because it is essentially harmful to the body especially for Children, read the warning on most toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>my teeth feel clean all day and not sensitive</li>
            <li>I l.ike the taste and keeps my teeth feeling clean for a long time.</li>
            <li>It definitely leaves my teeth clean, my tongue has become more pink since using it (I use inhalers for asthma which causes the surface to turn white - yeast).  </li>
            <li>this new blend is far more tasty than the other neem toothpaste i had been using before  </li>
            <li>read the list on Amazon.com re: Known Cancer causing chemicals in personal care/beauty products), that I must admit it wasn&#x27;t worth the price, waiting for it or even taking a chance on using.  </li>
            <li>If there are any negatives in the future, I will update this post but so far I am thrilled with Neem Active</li>
            <li>When I returned for a check up, the gum disease was completely gone!  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just note aware enough.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a long lasting clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>and I was using the soft bristle brush along with Sensodyne for the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>and the toothpastes together are not as abrasive as when I use Desert Essence Natural Tea Tree Oil and Neem Toothpaste with either one.</li>
            <li>It contains traces of minerals vital to teeth, bones and connective</li>
            <li>It contains traces of minerals vital to teeth, bones and connective tissues.)</li>
            <li>I reorder often and appreciate the natural ingredients without the toxic fluoride.</li>
            <li>I heard that neem naturally heals, protects, and takes care of dental needs.  </li>
            <li>gums\\&quot;, \\&quot;Complete Care\\&quot;</li>
            <li>i got this toothpaste based on the idea that it was made from neem and would be a natural alternative to mainstream toothpaste.</li>
            <li>teeth don&#x27;t seem to be as sensitive.</li>
            <li>i just wanted to use something on the natural side</li>
            <li>I was looking to purchase a &#x27;Nature&#x27;s Natural&#x27; type of toothpaste, Mouth Care product</li>
            <li>Sodium Fluoride 0.24% &amp; Triclosan 0.30% (Antigingivitis), CREST COMPLETE W/SCOPE</li>
            <li>was called &#x27;Himalaya Active Fresh Gel&#x27;  </li>
            <li>but when I compare our society with societies like India where the people have a LONG history for THOUSANDS of years of rarely needing dentists/doctors because they have learned through experience what herbs and other natural products will help them medically, then I begin to realize how greedy profit-driven, short-sighted, arrogant, blind, narcisstic and  more importantly FALLIBLE our society&#x27;s mainstream \\&quot;science\\&quot; and \\&quot;medicine\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Long story short, I have EXTREME confidence in Neem Active toothpaste from Henkel India, backed up by long usage and great dental checkup reports.</li>
            <li>I wish I could buy this where I live, it makes your teeth &amp; gums feel like you just left the dentist.</li>
            <li>and since I didn&#x27;t receive my NEEM TOOTHPASTE I originally ordered I went down to my local FAR EAST GROCERY STORE and found the NEEM toothpaste as described in the picture which cost only 1/3 the price</li>
            <li>no other meds necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my mouth feel so clean, but the taste is so bad to me, it lingers on and on.</li>
            <li>I still have a few cavities and a deep cleaning that needs to be done which eventually i&#x27;m going to make my way back to the dentist and get filled</li>
            <li>This is the only tooth paste my 6 year old will use.</li>
            <li>is the only toothpaste i use, it cured my gingivitus, and my bad breath, from the first time i used it, and my teeth are white and clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>But from my personal experience so far this toothpaste is definitely helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>COLGATE TOTAL (Advanced Whitening) coded DARK BLUE (only active ingredient listed re:</li>
            <li>The flavor and medicinal purpose are of extreme high quality</li>
            <li>My breath is fresher and my teeth appears to be whiter, also, I would highly recommend this product and will not go back to other toothpaste.</li>

            <li> My dentist said whatever I was doing to keep doing as teeth looked good.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to try Neem toothpaste as I heard it was good for gums and teeth.  </li>
            <li> Makes my qums feel good too.</li>
            <li> I have been using it since years the best for your smile and teeth.</li>
            <li> but so far, I have been very impressed with the almost immediate results that I have experienced.</li>
            <li> My family and I Love it!</li>
            <li> Great tasting product, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE TASTE AND GOT A GOOD REPORT AT THE DENTIST AFTER USING IT.  </li>

            <li> A very good product that really cleans your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have now tried two brands of Neem toothpaste, and this is so far the best.</li>
            <li> Liked the idea that Neem is healthy.</li>
            <li> this product were universally available, I believe the price would be more palatable too!</li>

            <li> Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s more profitable for them to keep us hooked on putting our \\&quot;dental lives\\</li>
            <li> SURE know</li>
            <li> but when I added Trader Joe&#x27;s Myrrh propolis toothpaste, the spreading was better.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t have fluoride in our water supply and it&#x27;s better than digesting it.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite toothpaste this works</li>
            <li> you want a SAFE and HEALTHY TOOTHPASTE, avoid this one.</li>
            <li> Azadirachta (Neem) kills most bacteria and has even been shown to de-activate some viruses.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this before it is ok ..</li>
            <li> It has so many chemicals, I do hope it works as promised.</li>
            <li> (I need 8 more words so this is fill)</li>
            <li> I think it works better than the name brands.</li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> I feel the paste has a more cleansing feeling on my&lt;br /&gt;Teeth and mouth.  </li>

            <li> I love the taste and the way it makes my mouth and teeth feel.</li>
            <li> you can do much better than this product.  </li>
            <li> OK..</li>
            <li> v Fluoride Ion (interesting huh?).  </li>
            <li> I hope this has redeemed myself and has Helped many in their selection of what kind of toothpastes are available.  </li>
            <li> I will try the toothpastes (Himalaya &amp; Neem) to see if they work better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> If I find anything that may be interesting I will update this post again.  </li>
            <li> I did some further research and found NON-SHAMPOO ingredients in some excellent toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> i have happily given up american toothpaste for a good product that makes me feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> May take more time to evaluate how I like it.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean and look nice and shiny after using this product.</li>
            <li> Mouth felt very clean.</li>
            <li> Toothpastes with neem are definitely worth the $$$&#x27;s!!  </li>
            <li> Teeth feel clean!</li>
            <li> I am happy it is a natural product at that.  </li>
            <li> no hard scraping they used water!!!!!</li>
            <li> Thieves Oil toothpaste and mouthwash is an excellent product (cost is very high thought) and has no &#x27;soaps in it, also Desert Product uses TEA TREE OIL and NEEM OILS in their toothpaste and mouthwash, Tea Tree oil is a natural anti-bacterial ingredient used for thousands of years.  </li>
            <li> I love the taste and how clean my teeth feel after using it.  </li>
            <li> My Wife who works for the County of Los Angeles Health Dept. got more information on what is regarded as a &#x27;good&#x27; natural toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Love the taste and how clean my mouth feels.  </li>
            <li> but I strongly suggest that you DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> The taste is rather strong.</li>
            <li> High in flouride, but thats good for us.  </li>
            <li> and my breathe seem to be fine after eating and drinking</li>
            <li> Quick shipping,great feel after brushing taste good..and minty  Refreshing..</li>
            <li> A clean, odd taste which takes a little getting used to; experienced some nausea after using, but teeth were clean, and gums felt good; I experienced a good delivery, product was as advertised and worth the price,</li>
            <li> Thank you for making it available.</li>
            <li> We Americans call our society advanced</li>
            <li> Then it says it contains 1000 ppm max of fluoride available when packed.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;100% Vegetarian and Free from</li>
            <li> been using Neem Active for about a year or more...... does a great job of keeping teeth clean and tartar away.</li>
            <li> I get ulcers easily and this seems to help them heal quickly</li>
            <li> These people live for many many years and have all their original teeth.  </li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m more than willing to brush with it rather than having anymore wasteful painful/time-consuming/expensive dental visits.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh!</li>
            <li> First ingredient... SORBITOL (which indicates more then</li>
            <li> This toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling so clean.  </li>
            <li> but my mouth feels clean after using.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never been feeling so clean except just the days after the dental cleaning a the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> This tastes so clean</li>
            <li> My teeth did feel clean afterwards,but,leaves your breath smell like clay.</li>
            <li> this toothpaste makes my teeth feel clean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get excited about toothpaste, but I&#x27;m impressed with the taste, texture and performance of this product.  </li>
            <li> This paste is different but in a good way I like the mint</li>
            <li> very healthy no warning sign not to swallow like regular toothpaste</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not to strong and gets rid of morning mouth taste fast</li>
            <li> I use neem for killing bugs in my garden since it is a great pesticide in natural form but not for internal use and don&#x27;t forget, produced in India.</li>
            <li> I like that there is no artificial coloring or flavoring.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I took a chance on this product before using this product my gums were so sensitive</li>
            <li> SWEARING that Indians rarely go to dentists because their #1 protection is brushing with neem.  </li>
            <li> Tastes fresh and minty.  </li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m not a Dentist or any oral healthcare professional, so take this with a grain of salt.</li>
            <li> but this seems to find those particles that were hiding by the gums or between teeth and leaving my mouth fresh and teeth like they were polished.</li>
            <li> The natural bacteria protection from Neem leaves my mouth and gum tissue feeling refreshed and healthy.  </li>
            <li> This is ok, but I have sensitive teeth and have been using sensodine for years.  </li>
            <li> OK but I was hoping for all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It says \\&quot;Natural and nature derived ingredients\\&quot;, \\&quot;Natural protection for strong teeth and healthy</li>
            <li> Really feel clean when using.</li>
            <li> I would recomment to everyone who wants clean teeth,mouth and breath......</li>
            <li> The fresh minty flavor does a good job masking the slight earthy after taste of neem.  </li>
            <li> The name of this toothpaste is very misleading, as it is full of toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> &quot; on fluoride and having to go back to pay $$$&#x27;s for more dental visits and more dental products than it is to let people know there are better foreign products out there used by other just as intelligent humans in far off lands.</li>
            <li> Neem toothpaste not only tastes great and may have some medical benefits ([...]).</li>
            <li> We like this toothpaste very much, dosing even seems easier.</li>
            <li> It is a fine toothpaste, but as a creature of liking to be given what I ask for, I was surprised.  </li>
            <li> and it really does whiten your teeth!</li>
            <li> and when I do i&#x27;m interested to see if he sees any difference</li>
            <li> Evidently it has a LOT of fluoride too.</li>
            <li> Neem is also used regularly in skin and hair products and give better results (with lotions, oils, soaps, shampoo, etc.</li>
            <li> This is the ultimate toothpaste for those of us who brush faithfully but still get too many cavities.  </li>
            <li> I saw this product on the Dr. Oz show and it is exactly as they described.  </li>
            <li> and so they are healthy and white  </li>
            <li> I RETRACT MY FIRST STATEMENT ABOUT THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Just tried this Neem toothpaste for the first time.  </li>
            <li> use it everyday with good results.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean and the fact that it is a natural anti bacterial won me over!</li>
            <li> the teeth naturally, leaves a fresh smell and fresh feeling to dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li> Neem in the toothpaste certainly is my DENTAL SAVIOR.  </li>
            <li> It contains neem, which, I heard, is a derivative from a certain type of tree, and that people in India and Africa chew on the tree bark for their dental hygiene, and don&#x27;t have to worry about dental visits.  </li>
            <li> The whole family uses this.</li>
            <li> Thanks all and</li>
            <li> , they really need to update the photo with the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> got the rest of my order really fast, everything that didn&#x27;t come from spice world that is....</li>
            <li> ; 4 ppm is considered unsafe (really, any amount will calcify your pineal gland and reduce your brain function).  </li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to mint flavors found in many toothpastes, Neem toothpaste will freshen your mouth in a similar fashion without the discomfort.</li>
            <li> but now the good news which I think I was in error by giving this product a negative review...</li>
            <li> It made a major difference in my most recent checkup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This tooth paste has a slight soapy taste, but OK.</li>
            <li> I have no issues to complain of with this brand, it works like a charm and is decent on teeth when applied as directed.</li>
            <li> I had to go to sensodyne tooth paste in order to stop the irritation at gum line, I had been able to use just regular tooth paste, prior to Neem.</li>
            <li> The taste is mainly minty, but has a &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; overtone of taste or smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is the ingredient that makes the toothpaste &#x27;sudsy&#x27; or we would be brushing with &#x27;GOO&#x27; but don&#x27;t ingest it because it is essentially harmful to the body especially for Children, read the warning on most toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> my teeth feel clean all day and not sensitive</li>
            <li> I l.ike the taste and keeps my teeth feeling clean for a long time.</li>
            <li> It definitely leaves my teeth clean, my tongue has become more pink since using it (I use inhalers for asthma which causes the surface to turn white - yeast).  </li>
            <li> this new blend is far more tasty than the other neem toothpaste i had been using before  </li>
            <li> read the list on Amazon.com re: Known Cancer causing chemicals in personal care/beauty products), that I must admit it wasn&#x27;t worth the price, waiting for it or even taking a chance on using.  </li>
            <li> If there are any negatives in the future, I will update this post but so far I am thrilled with Neem Active</li>
            <li> When I returned for a check up, the gum disease was completely gone!  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just note aware enough.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a long lasting clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> and I was using the soft bristle brush along with Sensodyne for the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> and the toothpastes together are not as abrasive as when I use Desert Essence Natural Tea Tree Oil and Neem Toothpaste with either one.</li>
            <li> It contains traces of minerals vital to teeth, bones and connective</li>
            <li> It contains traces of minerals vital to teeth, bones and connective tissues.)</li>
            <li> I reorder often and appreciate the natural ingredients without the toxic fluoride.</li>
            <li> I heard that neem naturally heals, protects, and takes care of dental needs.  </li>
            <li> gums\\&quot;, \\&quot;Complete Care\\&quot;</li>
            <li> i got this toothpaste based on the idea that it was made from neem and would be a natural alternative to mainstream toothpaste.</li>
            <li> teeth don&#x27;t seem to be as sensitive.</li>
            <li> i just wanted to use something on the natural side</li>
            <li> I was looking to purchase a &#x27;Nature&#x27;s Natural&#x27; type of toothpaste, Mouth Care product</li>
            <li> Sodium Fluoride 0.24% &amp; Triclosan 0.30% (Antigingivitis), CREST COMPLETE W/SCOPE</li>
            <li> was called &#x27;Himalaya Active Fresh Gel&#x27;  </li>
            <li> but when I compare our society with societies like India where the people have a LONG history for THOUSANDS of years of rarely needing dentists/doctors because they have learned through experience what herbs and other natural products will help them medically, then I begin to realize how greedy profit-driven, short-sighted, arrogant, blind, narcisstic and  more importantly FALLIBLE our society&#x27;s mainstream \\&quot;science\\&quot; and \\&quot;medicine\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Long story short, I have EXTREME confidence in Neem Active toothpaste from Henkel India, backed up by long usage and great dental checkup reports.</li>
            <li> I wish I could buy this where I live, it makes your teeth &amp; gums feel like you just left the dentist.</li>
            <li> and since I didn&#x27;t receive my NEEM TOOTHPASTE I originally ordered I went down to my local FAR EAST GROCERY STORE and found the NEEM toothpaste as described in the picture which cost only 1/3 the price</li>
            <li> no other meds necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my mouth feel so clean, but the taste is so bad to me, it lingers on and on.</li>
            <li> I still have a few cavities and a deep cleaning that needs to be done which eventually i&#x27;m going to make my way back to the dentist and get filled</li>
            <li> This is the only tooth paste my 6 year old will use.</li>
            <li> is the only toothpaste i use, it cured my gingivitus, and my bad breath, from the first time i used it, and my teeth are white and clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> But from my personal experience so far this toothpaste is definitely helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> COLGATE TOTAL (Advanced Whitening) coded DARK BLUE (only active ingredient listed re:</li>
            <li> The flavor and medicinal purpose are of extreme high quality</li>
            <li> My breath is fresher and my teeth appears to be whiter, also, I would highly recommend this product and will not go back to other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> % w/v Fluoride Ion, SENSODYNE PRONAMEL gentle whitening is marked with DARK BLUE (BLACK)</li>
            <li> According to my wife the color GREEN means that this toothpaste is basically ALL NATURAL, BLUE indicates NATURAL WITH MEDICATIONS ADDED, RED indicates NATURAL WITH CHEMICALS ADDED and last but not least DARK BLUE or BLACK STRIPE indicates ALL CHEMICAL INGREDIENTS.</li>
            <li> I have a HEAVY history since childhood of dental problems with root canals and bleeding gums and currently gingivitis as my main problem.</li>
            <li> Neem natural antiseptic, gets my coffee teeth whiter than other products.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful until I tried it I am very pleased with it, if you have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> &quot;, \\&quot;Long lasting freshness\\&quot;, \\&quot;Strengthens teeth and</li>
            <li> /&gt; The shipping was very high and that is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> EXTRA WHITENING has a RED code (only active ingredient listed re: Sodium Fluoride 0.243% w/0.15</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless of the few key things stated above I still like this one because it obviously helped</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: After a few weeks my teeth developed sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> a long time to get, but within estimated delivery time.</li>
            <li> &quot; Gel has a GREEN STRIPE on it which indicate mostly NATURAL Ingredients.</li>
            <li> $7.50 for a bottle of toothpaste that only seems to be worth exactly $2.99 (as depicted FAIL!!)</li>
            <li> Only have to use a tiny little bit.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers noted, it does help with the overall health of your gums and the tissue in the mouth.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to other brands.</li>
            <li> I have not been using this product very long</li>
            <li> the ingredients list, the Neem Active was listed at the second from the bottom of the list.&lt;br /&gt;The seller should provide the snapshot of ingredients list on the box for the product description.</li>
            <li> only listed active ingredients</li>
            <li> According to the FDA all toothpastes are &#x27;coded&#x27; with either a GREEN, BLUE, RED or BLACK stripe on the end of the toothpaste container (the clamped end) which I was not aware of and probably not many people are aware of this coded message on all toothpastes.</li>
            <li> and I have even noticed I do not get ulcers as easily nor do I experience sensitivity to cold products like I usually do due to having several crowns.</li>
            <li> I was curious about a number of products with the active herbal ingredient Neem, therefore I ordered two different toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I have paid my dues, and I deserve something that will possibly cut down on dental</li>
            <li> Also it helps heal those little nicks such as toothbrush trama and bitten jaw or gums.</li>
            <li> now a couple months later I&#x27;m actually using the Hard bristle toothbrush</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;ll be trying that one out as well in the next few months.</li>
            <li> just be careful of the lid its not attached as i am use to</li>
            <li> I just really do not want fluoride in anything I use, or I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of thinking this product was minus SLS.  </li>
            <li> I felt like I was brushing my teeth with the green mud for your face,even smells the same.</li>
            <li> Taste is the same as other toothpastes, Use VERY little foams up a lot.</li>
            <li> You know you are getting the worst of worst when you see so many excellent reviews written about a product</li>
            <li> /&gt;-and other healing herbs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Teeth are whiter, brighter and fresher; other people have mentioned it.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I decided to give this item a try.</li>
            <li> Also, my teeth feel cleaner after brushing than with any other toothpaste that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> might try some other neem product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference from using any other toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> other items in that order.  </li>
            <li> makes me brush more often and masks the nasty taste of neem far bettter than the other brand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neem Active toothpaste from Henkel India (</li>
            <li> Since I have been using Neem Active toothpaste, all my dental problems have disappeared.</li>
            <li> Since Neem Active does not contain Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, it also does not give my Wife canker sores, as any toothpaste containing that chemical has done.    </li>
            <li> HIMALAYA HERBALS \\&quot;Active</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t enjoy giving a &#x27;Bad Review&#x27;</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not worth it</li>
            <li> This product came straight from India, and had a weird taste/smell that took a couple uses to get used to.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m also eager to try the other one which has a few added bonuses compared to this one.</li>
            <li> Less stain and tartar.</li>
            <li> I also squeeze out a little and mix it with water in my mouth as a mouthwash.</li>
            <li> taste and consistency take a little getting used to, though.  </li>
            <li> To counter the bad report Canadian testing gave Neem Active toothpaste, I can only guess that their sample was either contaminated or that they actually tested a counterfeit toothpaste claiming to be Neem Active</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t brush everyday</li>
            <li> I have trouble from time to time...</li>
            <li> After using a few times, my teeth started to hurt at gum line.</li>
            <li> and it also has a GREEN CODE on the end</li>
            <li> I just purchased Desert Products Toothpaste and Mouthwash a few minutes ago</li>
            <li> Gum disease had decreased significantly enough for her to notice--when she was measuring gum pockets around each tooth.</li>
            <li> I do not know that I feel like my mouth is any cleaner than with products I can get on the shelves here in the USA, but its definitely not any worse.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are seriously nasty.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Neem, but you need to look at other toothpaste ingredients and get with the program.</li>
            <li> I have very little buildup of plaque on my teeth, and my gums are healthier than they ever have been.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything I can think of to get past the taste</li>
            <li> i have had this dilemna in the  past.  </li>
            <li> So expensive tooth paste and so little Neem Active.</li>
            <li> I have a long and troubled dental history - cavities, gum problems, etc.</li>
            <li> The problem I had with Auromere&#x27;s toothpaste was because it had no SLS, it was hard to spread it in all the corners of my mouth on every tooth</li>
            <li> 50% of this product is artificial sweeteners (which I am allergic to, only if ingested, of course but why take a chance).</li>
            <li> Not only does it contain flouride, it contains toxic parabens wich are very bad and potentially cancerous.</li>
            <li> No, seriously i don&#x27;t know if i hate it or not....</li>
            <li> It took a long time to get through customs and get delivered, the package was in bad shape.</li>
            <li> but this one is not only disappointing but possibly dangerous.  </li>
            <li> but this one is &#x27;LOADED&#x27; with unhealthy ingredients</li>
            <li> This product contains fluoride among other poisonous crap.</li>
            <li> I was totally wrong.</li>
            <li> Sorry, Henkel Marketing India, ltd.</li>
            <li> Sorry Himalaya Herbals.    </li>
            <li> But it seems to be quite expensive for a tube of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste was really disappointing.  </li>
            <li> so I was afraid to try it.</li>
            <li> I would have assumed that all toothpaste with Neem is bad.  </li>
            <li> I have gum and bone decay issues which cause really bad breath.  </li>
            <li> I hope it slows the bacterial and decay issues and controls my bad breath too.  </li>
            <li> If you want to stay away from the awful toothpastes we find at the supermarkets, keep looking, and stay away from this one.</li>
            <li> This one has a terrible taste and after taste that I cannot describe.  </li>

            <li> You know you are getting the worst of worst when you see so many excellent reviews written about a product but when you visit their Website, instead of getting a list of the ingredients, you see a disclaimer ***Following content is provided by Henkel India Ltd.

This toothpaste is from India. Everyone I know, takes US made toothpaste to Asia but Amazon is trying to sell us a toothpaste from India while Canada has issued a warning. What a joke. I use neem for killing bugs in my garden since it is a great pesticide in natural form but not for internal use and don&#x27;t forget, produced in India.</li>
            <li> Toothpaste does a great job in cleaning our teeth, makes them shine and has a pleasant taste.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling so clean.  I like how my mouth feels after using each time.  I will keep buying this item.</li>
            <li> this toothpaste has seen me through checkups with ease.  taste is good.</li>
            <li> I have now tried two brands of Neem toothpaste, and this is so far the best. It tastes great and the best part is not having morning breath when you wake up in the morning. Great product!</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste good flavor and it really does whiten your teeth! I would recomend this product to everyone that has any gum problems as the neem is anti bacterial.&lt;br /&gt; The shipping was very high and that is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> no info about the product like weight or a photo disqualifies this offer for me,  lk</li>
            <li> Neem toothpaste not only tastes great and may have some medical benefits ([...]). If you are sensitive to mint flavors found in many toothpastes, Neem toothpaste will freshen your mouth in a similar fashion without the discomfort.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste. Refreshing  haven&#x27;t noticed any miraculous gum difference but my mouth feels clean after using. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Been using this product ever since I got it. I LOVE IT. Went to the dentist last week and were amazed at the results. Less stain and tartar. Will be using this product from now on.</li>
            <li> I like that there is no artificial coloring or flavoring. I tastes ok and leaves my mouth feeling refreshed. I also squeeze out a little and mix it with water in my mouth as a mouthwash. My dental reports have been much better. No cavities and my gums are improving.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I took a chance on this product before using this product my gums were so sensitive and I was using the soft bristle brush along with Sensodyne for the toothpaste. One day browsing amazon I saw the Neem toothpaste and decided to give it a shot and now a couple months later I&#x27;m actually using the Hard bristle toothbrush and I have no pain afterwards. I still have a few cavities and a deep cleaning that needs to be done which eventually i&#x27;m going to make my way back to the dentist and get filled and when I do i&#x27;m interested to see if he sees any difference and i&#x27;ll update my review. But from my personal experience so far this toothpaste is definitely helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also for those of you wondering what&#x27;s in it here are the ingredients that is written on the back of the toothpaste:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off it says it contains 1000ppm max of fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Precipitated Calcium Carbonate, Sorbitol, Aqua, Glycerine, Hydrated Silca, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Flavour, Sodium Silicate, Sodium CArboxymethylcellulose, Carrageenan, Sodium Saccharin, Methylparaben, Prapylparaben, Neem Extract, sodium Monofluoro Phosphate, Sodium Dihydrogen Phosphate, Tea Tree Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things in the ingredients that do strike out to me is the fluoride and SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate) if your looking for a neem toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t have that in it&#x27;s ingredients Thera Neem toothpaste claims not to have any of that in their product. I just purchased that one today so i&#x27;ll be trying that one out as well in the next few months.( Not to mention this one only has the neem leaf extract there is no bark extract.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of the few key things stated above I still like this one because it obviously helped but i&#x27;m also eager to try the other one which has a few added bonuses compared to this one.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  Soothing and eliminates gum irritation.  Bought some in India and was so happy to see I could replenish on line!!!  Thank you for making it available.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste was really disappointing.  It burned my mouth and I had to toss it.  Evidently it has a LOT of fluoride too.</li>
            <li> I have a condition called Lichen Planas and my gums swell quite often but the toothpaste seems to help. Taste good as well.</li>
            <li> Not ADA approved, I would not trust on your teeth</li>
            <li> I have a HEAVY history since childhood of dental problems with root canals and bleeding gums and currently gingivitis as my main problem. I don&#x27;t brush everyday (yeah, like I actually want to admit it!) and have always brushed with mainstream brands like Crest, Colgate&#x27;s, Aim, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One month, I had to go to the dentist to get my root canal cleaned and the dentist said I would likely have to come back in 3 months because of another root canal problem and would likely have to lose another tooth.  Then a week later while shopping for indian food in an indian grocery, they also had neem toothpaste (which I had never heard of) made in India for Indians with the Indian grocery owner SWEARING that Indians rarely go to dentists because their #1 protection is brushing with neem.  I&#x27;ve been brushing with neem toothpaste ever since then.  Well, it&#x27;s been OVER 2 YEARS and I still haven&#x27;t had to go back to the dentist.  Neem in the toothpaste certainly is my DENTAL SAVIOR.  The toothpaste has mint flavor added to freshen the breath but it has a garlicky taste/smell (because of the neem) but i&#x27;m more than willing to brush with it rather than having anymore wasteful painful/time-consuming/expensive dental visits.  I no longer use any of the mainstream toothpastes like Crest, Colgate, Aim, etc. and am either thinking of throwing them away or donating them to charity.  Toothpastes with neem are definitely worth the $$$&#x27;s!!  Neem is also used regularly in skin and hair products and give better results (with lotions, oils, soaps, shampoo, etc. for conditions such as lice, fleas, dandruff, eczema, etc.) compared to our American mainstream products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why our mainstream researchers and/or dental companies don&#x27;t talk about neem.  At (...) is one link of research on neem for dentistry.  I guess it&#x27;s more profitable for them to keep us hooked on putting our \\&quot;dental lives\\&quot; on fluoride and having to go back to pay $$$&#x27;s for more dental visits and more dental products than it is to let people know there are better foreign products out there used by other just as intelligent humans in far off lands. We Americans call our society advanced but when I compare our society with societies like India where the people have a LONG history for THOUSANDS of years of rarely needing dentists/doctors because they have learned through experience what herbs and other natural products will help them medically, then I begin to realize how greedy profit-driven, short-sighted, arrogant, blind, narcisstic and  more importantly FALLIBLE our society&#x27;s mainstream \\&quot;science\\&quot; and \\&quot;medicine\\&quot; is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using the non-SLS [[ASIN:B000L425PI Herbal Toothpaste Cardamon-Fennel 4.16 Ounces]] AT THE SAME TIME ON EVERY TOOTHBRUSHING with [[ASIN:B004GYM90A Trader Joe&#x27;s Antiplaque Toothpaste with Fennel, Propolis &amp; Myrrh]]for over a month to increase my anti-cavity/anti-plaque/gum healing protection and I&#x27;ve got to say that my mouth has never tasted/felt fresher and cleaner and I FOR SURE know I don&#x27;t need to go to any dentist (no gum bleeding, no pain in my gums/teeth) and the toothpastes together are not as abrasive as when I use Desert Essence Natural Tea Tree Oil and Neem Toothpaste with either one. The problem I had with Auromere&#x27;s toothpaste was because it had no SLS, it was hard to spread it in all the corners of my mouth on every tooth but when I added Trader Joe&#x27;s Myrrh propolis toothpaste, the spreading was better. So in the 2 combinations of toothpaste, everytime I brush my teeth, I know my teeth and gums are protected by:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-neem (which helps prevent plaque with antimicrobial properties which can treat periodontal disease and reverse gingivitis)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-and other healing herbs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and from the [[ASIN:B004GYM90A Trader Joe&#x27;s Antiplaque Toothpaste with Fennel, Propolis &amp; Myrrh]], I know my teeth and gums are protected by:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-myrrh (which helps fight infection of mouth and gums. Hasa stimulating effect on the gums)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-and propolis which is a sticky substance gathered by bees from the leaf buds of trees and plastered over hives for strength which is also an antibiotic and antiseptic that helps fight infections of the throat and mouth and speeds healing of gums. It contains traces of minerals vital to teeth, bones and connective tissues.)a stimulating effect on the gums)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-and propolis which is a sticky substance gathered by bees from the leaf buds of trees and plastered over hives for strength which is also an antibiotic and antiseptic that helps fight infections of the throat and mouth and speeds healing of gums. It contains traces of minerals vital to teeth, bones and connective tissues.)</li>
            <li> Tastes fresh and minty.  High in flouride, but thats good for us.  We don&#x27;t have fluoride in our water supply and it&#x27;s better than digesting it.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite toothpaste this works so well this is the fourth box i have bought this is the only toothpaste i use, it cured my gingivitus, and my bad breath, from the first time i used it, and my teeth are white and clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> No question,  the teeth get cleaner.  Only have to use a tiny little bit.  My teeth feel really great.  When I wake up in the morning my mouth still feels great!</li>
            <li> There are no words for Neem toothpaste it is just what your teeth needs.  Knock out cavities and whites the teeth naturally, leaves a fresh smell and fresh feeling to dental hygiene.  I have been using it since years the best for your smile and teeth.</li>
            <li> DANGER!!!&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste contained not only FLOURIDE, which is a POISON, but&lt;br /&gt;also Sodium Laurel Sulfate, Saccharin, Sodium Monoflouro Phosphate,Sodium Carbomethyl Cellulose, etc.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a SAFE and HEALTHY TOOTHPASTE, avoid this one. The ingredients are seriously nasty.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Neem, but you need to look at other toothpaste ingredients and get with the program.</li>
            <li> This paste is different but in a good way I like the mint it&#x27;s not to strong and gets rid of morning mouth taste fast my teeth feel clean all day and not sensitive</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m not a Dentist or any oral healthcare professional, so take this with a grain of salt. I&#x27;ve been using Neem Active toothpaste from Henkel India (and before that, Calcutta Chemical Company) for the last 6 years. I have a long and troubled dental history - cavities, gum problems, etc. Since I have been using Neem Active toothpaste, all my dental problems have disappeared. I have very little buildup of plaque on my teeth, and my gums are healthier than they ever have been. My Wife uses it, too, and she has had equally great results. Since Neem Active does not contain Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, it also does not give my Wife canker sores, as any toothpaste containing that chemical has done.    To counter the bad report Canadian testing gave Neem Active toothpaste, I can only guess that their sample was either contaminated or that they actually tested a counterfeit toothpaste claiming to be Neem Active (as they earlier found a counterfeit toothpaste claiming to be Colgate). Azadirachta (Neem) kills most bacteria and has even been shown to de-activate some viruses.    Long story short, I have EXTREME confidence in Neem Active toothpaste from Henkel India, backed up by long usage and great dental checkup reports. I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Teeth are whiter, brighter and fresher; other people have mentioned it. My family and I Love it! I have recommended it!</li>
            <li> Only a 1/2 pea-size amount is needed. The pasted is minty and cleans teeth excellently. I have no issues to complain of with this brand, it works like a charm and is decent on teeth when applied as directed.</li>
            <li> I now look forward to brushing my teeth whether with a powered brush or just regular.  My teeth have never been feeling so clean except just the days after the dental cleaning a the dentist&#x27;s office.  In fact some very good toothpaste was okay but this seems to find those particles that were hiding by the gums or between teeth and leaving my mouth fresh and teeth like they were polished.</li>
            <li> I love the taste and how clean my teeth feel after using it.  I will be using it on a regular basis now.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I decided to give this item a try. As other reviewers noted, it does help with the overall health of your gums and the tissue in the mouth. I get ulcers easily and this seems to help them heal quickly and I have even noticed I do not get ulcers as easily nor do I experience sensitivity to cold products like I usually do due to having several crowns. Also, my teeth feel cleaner after brushing than with any other toothpaste that I have ever used. I have not been using this product very long but so far, I have been very impressed with the almost immediate results that I have experienced. If there are any negatives in the future, I will update this post but so far I am thrilled with Neem Active Toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After a few weeks my teeth developed sensitivity issues. I have trouble from time to time...probably just my teeth but I had to discontinue use of this toothpaste to stop this problem.</li>
            <li> I saw on Dr. Oz show a guest that was on the show about the Neem tree products.&lt;br /&gt;This is very good tooth paste.</li>
            <li> The natural bacteria protection from Neem leaves my mouth and gum tissue feeling refreshed and healthy.  I reorder often and appreciate the natural ingredients without the toxic fluoride.</li>
            <li> A great toothpaste for people who need to pay special attention to their gums. Chemo patients sometimes need to use baby toothbrushes because they are gentler on the gums, and this toothpaste has the ingredient, Neem, that works to strengthen the gums.  Also great for Lupus patients, who sometimes also have problems with their gums.</li>
            <li> Mouth felt very clean. Teeth were whiter. I would buy this product again. Loved the minty taste. Protects against cavities</li>
            <li> This is ok, but I have sensitive teeth and have been using sensodine for years.  While I was using this, my sensitivity started back up, so I have switched back.</li>
            <li> This is the only tooth paste my 6 year old will use. He likes the taste and I like that it has no fluoride in it. The whole family uses this. Great product and great price.</li>
            <li> this new blend is far more tasty than the other neem toothpaste i had been using before  makes me brush more often and masks the nasty taste of neem far bettter than the other brand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this before it is ok .. I just needed to reorder</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE TASTE AND GOT A GOOD REPORT AT THE DENTIST AFTER USING IT.  JUST HOPE I CAN FIND IT LOCALLY - GUESS IN THE HEALTH FOOD STORES</li>
            <li> It has so many chemicals, I do hope it works as promised. (I need 8 more words so this is fill)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get excited about toothpaste, but I&#x27;m impressed with the taste, texture and performance of this product.  After only a couple days, I can tell this will be the toothpaste I use from now on.</li>
            <li> Not as whitening as I was hoping for, but very pleasant minty taste.</li>
            <li> Great tasting and effective tooth paste.</li>
            <li> OK but I was hoping for all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> been using Neem Active for about a year or more...... does a great job of keeping teeth clean and tartar away. recommend it for anyone with gum issues.... I think it works better than the name brands.</li>
            <li> Heard about this and tried it.  My dentist said whatever I was doing to keep doing as teeth looked good.</li>
            <li> After using a few times, my teeth started to hurt at gum line. I had to go to sensodyne tooth paste in order to stop the irritation at gum line, I had been able to use just regular tooth paste, prior to Neem.</li>
            <li> great product.will order again.tried other neem toothpastes,but this is the best.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have discovered this toothpaste.  It contains neem, which, I heard, is a derivative from a certain type of tree, and that people in India and Africa chew on the tree bark for their dental hygiene, and don&#x27;t have to worry about dental visits.  Of course, this is only what I heard; I have not been to India or Africa to witness this, but it does make sense.  I heard that neem naturally heals, protects, and takes care of dental needs.  I heard that it does both healing and preventive maintenace.  I used up the entire tube and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste is a product of India.  It says \\&quot;Natural and nature derived ingredients\\&quot;, \\&quot;Natural protection for strong teeth and healthy gums\\&quot;, \\&quot;Complete Care\\&quot; (but I still use floss), \\&quot;Prevents cavities\\&quot;, \\&quot;Long lasting freshness\\&quot;, \\&quot;Strengthens teeth and gums\\&quot;, and \\&quot;100% Vegetarian\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have paid a fortune in dental bills for both myself and my kids.  I&#x27;ve kept those dentists in business.  Therefore, I have paid my dues, and I deserve something that will possibly cut down on dental bills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; person, and I will never go back to regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with gum disease.  I read about neem and what it can do for dental problems.  I decided to try Neem.  When I returned for a check up, the gum disease was completely gone!  I told my Dentist I was brushing with Neem and gave him a tube to try.  Within one month, he called me and asked me where I had purchased the Neem!  The Best!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since last year and im using it till this day,i like this toothpaste because it has no fluoride,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh! Teeth feel clean!</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my mouth feel so clean, but the taste is so bad to me, it lingers on and on. I&#x27;ve tried everything I can think of to get past the taste but it is still like perfume or deodorizer like taste. If it wasn&#x27;t for the taste I would give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is the ultimate toothpaste for those of us who brush faithfully but still get too many cavities.  It made a major difference in my most recent checkup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste and consistency take a little getting used to, though.  There is a lack of smoothness to the texture almost as if the batch had not been mixed enough.  The taste is mainly minty, but has a &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; overtone of taste or smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this product were universally available, I believe the price would be more palatable too!</li>
            <li> I saw this product on the Dr. Oz show and it is exactly as they described.  My breath is fresher and my teeth appears to be whiter, also, I would highly recommend this product and will not go back to other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The name of this toothpaste is very misleading, as it is full of toxic ingredients. If you want to stay away from the awful toothpastes we find at the supermarkets, keep looking, and stay away from this one. I like Christopher&#x27;s Herbal Tooth and Gum Powder.</li>
            <li> i saw this product promoted on Dr Oz for those who don&#x27;t like to floss their teeth, and experience bleeding gums.  i have had this dilemna in the  past.  Great tasting product, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> i got this toothpaste based on the idea that it was made from neem and would be a natural alternative to mainstream toothpaste. I was totally wrong. Not only does it contain flouride, it contains toxic parabens wich are very bad and potentially cancerous. when i realized this, i couldnt bring myself to use it and ended up throuwing it away.</li>
            <li> I purchase this from watching Dr. Oz..I use it with my regular Colgate toothpaste products...teeth are softer and clearer!! It works! It does stop your gums from bleeding!</li>
            <li> I rate this item 5 star. I feel the paste has a more cleansing feeling on my&lt;br /&gt;Teeth and mouth.  So, I saw my dentist last week I did not need a&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning..  He attributed it to a change in toothpaste to neem.  So, I am pleased</li>
            <li> use it everyday with good results. teeth don&#x27;t seem to be as sensitive. nice flavor and texture. just be careful of the lid its not attached as i am use to</li>
            <li> very healthy no warning sign not to swallow like regular toothpaste</li>
            <li> My toothpaste came wrapped in a box from India.  Himalaya Herbals was the name on the tube, not Neem as I had requested.  It is a fine toothpaste, but as a creature of liking to be given what I ask for, I was surprised.  Perhaps if they run out of Neem, it would be best to send a note and send the correct tube when the supplies come in.</li>
            <li> We like this toothpaste very much, dosing even seems easier. The flavor and medicinal purpose are of extreme high quality</li>
            <li> wonderful toothpaste. makes your mouth feel refreshing.  i would purchase this item again. thank you.  karen fadda monday april 01 2013 monday</li>
            <li> getting my teeth clean @the dentist was the fastest ever!!! no hard scraping they used water!!!!! I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I like the product.  My hygenist has never heard of the product before.  I don&#x27;t know if it lives up to the advertising but it is toothpaste.  It tastes okay.</li>
            <li> It is great toothpaste and it says it is 100% vegetarian.  Then it says it contains 1000 ppm max of fluoride available when packed. I just really do not want fluoride in anything I use, or I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after watching Dr. Oz.  My teeth are whiter.  It takes a moment for you to receive as it ships from India.</li>
            <li> Neem natural antiseptic, gets my coffee teeth whiter than other products. Taste is the same as other toothpastes, Use VERY little foams up a lot. BTW it also helped heal injury from brushing asap.  no other meds necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Took a long time to get, but within estimated delivery time.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste ever.  My breath stays under control the entire day.  I am happy it is a natural product at that.  I will never go back to other brands.</li>
            <li> I love the taste and the way it makes my mouth and teeth feel. I will order it again and reccommend it. .</li>
            <li> my teeth is my pride and so they are healthy and white  i just wanted to use something on the natural side and it keeps my teeth white and my breathe seem to be fine after eating and drinking</li>
            <li> So expensive tooth paste and so little Neem Active. I cannot tell that it actually contain even 1% of Neem Active.&lt;br /&gt;In the ingredients list, the Neem Active was listed at the second from the bottom of the list.&lt;br /&gt;The seller should provide the snapshot of ingredients list on the box for the product description.</li>
            <li> A very good product that really cleans your teeth. Also it helps heal those little nicks such as toothbrush trama and bitten jaw or gums.</li>
            <li> One STARS because the product was a so-called toothpaste and was delivered at no extra charge.  BUT....  It was not a NEEM PRODUCT (the one I received anyway). The product I received (which took 19 days and I had to pick up at the post office which required a signature) was called &#x27;Himalaya Active Fresh Gel&#x27;  I checked the ingredients and it didn&#x27;t contain any Neem extract but contained both Sorbitol and Saccharin as sweetening agents.  First ingredient... SORBITOL (which indicates more then 50% of this product is artificial sweeteners (which I am allergic to, only if ingested, of course but why take a chance). I was looking to purchase a &#x27;Nature&#x27;s Natural&#x27; type of toothpaste, Mouth Care product but this one is &#x27;LOADED&#x27; with unhealthy ingredients (Sodium Lauryl Sulphate, which is on the CANCER CAUSING CHEMICAL list and it also causes TOOTH ENAMEL WEAKENING (Tooth decay) and Mouth Cankers sores, etc.  read the list on Amazon.com re: Known Cancer causing chemicals in personal care/beauty products), that I must admit it wasn&#x27;t worth the price, waiting for it or even taking a chance on using.  I&#x27;m not returning this item, it&#x27;s not worth it but I strongly suggest that you DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.  On the box it states: \\&quot;100% Vegetarian and Free from Parabens\\&quot;... so what! Lauryl Sulphate is the 4th ingredient which means it is about 1/4 Shampoo.  Hey.. I got it... take your current Shampoo and use it as a mouthwash or take your bar of soap and use it as a toothpaste (I believe it will be safer than this product) just add &#x27;Flavor&#x27; to your desired taste) ugh!  I really don&#x27;t enjoy giving a &#x27;Bad Review&#x27; but this one is not only disappointing but possibly dangerous.  Sorry, Henkel Marketing India, ltd. you can do much better than this product.  All that Neem at your disposal and you have this &#x27;junky&#x27; mouth care product, Shame on you.    UPDATE: 11-2-14  OK.. After writing this review I did some research on &#x27;Toothpastes&#x27;.  My Wife who works for the County of Los Angeles Health Dept. got more information on what is regarded as a &#x27;good&#x27; natural toothpaste.  According to the FDA all toothpastes are &#x27;coded&#x27; with either a GREEN, BLUE, RED or BLACK stripe on the end of the toothpaste container (the clamped end) which I was not aware of and probably not many people are aware of this coded message on all toothpastes. According to my wife the color GREEN means that this toothpaste is basically ALL NATURAL, BLUE indicates NATURAL WITH MEDICATIONS ADDED, RED indicates NATURAL WITH CHEMICALS ADDED and last but not least DARK BLUE or BLACK STRIPE indicates ALL CHEMICAL INGREDIENTS. I checked my toothpaste supply and was amazed at this coded message on all the toothpastes end.  re: COLGATE TOTAL (Advanced Whitening) coded DARK BLUE (only active ingredient listed re: Sodium Fluoride 0.24% &amp; Triclosan 0.30% (Antigingivitis), CREST COMPLETE W/SCOPE EXTRA WHITENING has a RED code (only active ingredient listed re: Sodium Fluoride 0.243% w/0.15% w/v Fluoride Ion, SENSODYNE PRONAMEL gentle whitening is marked with DARK BLUE (BLACK) only listed active ingredients re: Potassium Nitrate 5% &amp; Sodium fluoride 0.15% w/v Fluoride Ion (interesting huh?).  but now the good news which I think I was in error by giving this product a negative review... HIMALAYA HERBALS \\&quot;Active Fresh\\&quot; Gel has a GREEN STRIPE on it which indicate mostly NATURAL Ingredients. and since I didn&#x27;t receive my NEEM TOOTHPASTE I originally ordered I went down to my local FAR EAST GROCERY STORE and found the NEEM toothpaste as described in the picture which cost only 1/3 the price and it also has a GREEN CODE on the end and it also has Sodium Lauryl Sulfate as the 4th ingredient.  I guess Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is the ingredient that makes the toothpaste &#x27;sudsy&#x27; or we would be brushing with &#x27;GOO&#x27; but don&#x27;t ingest it because it is essentially harmful to the body especially for Children, read the warning on most toothpastes.  I RETRACT MY FIRST STATEMENT ABOUT THIS PRODUCT and I&#x27;ve learned a lotabout toothpastes via my Wife&#x27;s Health Dept&#x27;s. associates.  I hope this has redeemed myself and has Helped many in their selection of what kind of toothpastes are available.  I will try the toothpastes (Himalaya &amp; Neem) to see if they work better than any others I&#x27;ve tried. If I find anything that may be interesting I will update this post again.  Thanks all and Sorry Himalaya Herbals.    UPDATE 11-5-14:  SODIUM LAUREL SULPHATE still bugs me in this product. I did some further research and found NON-SHAMPOO ingredients in some excellent toothpastes.  Thieves Oil toothpaste and mouthwash is an excellent product (cost is very high thought) and has no &#x27;soaps in it, also Desert Product uses TEA TREE OIL and NEEM OILS in their toothpaste and mouthwash, Tea Tree oil is a natural anti-bacterial ingredient used for thousands of years.  I just purchased Desert Products Toothpaste and Mouthwash a few minutes ago so I will let you know.  Check out the reviews...all excellent.</li>
            <li> Liked the idea that Neem is healthy. It took a long time to get through customs and get delivered, the package was in bad shape. The taste is rather strong. might try some other neem product.</li>
            <li> i have happily given up american toothpaste for a good product that makes me feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My teeth feel clean and the fact that it is a natural anti bacterial won me over!</li>
            <li> Really feel clean when using.</li>
            <li> This product contains fluoride among other poisonous crap. I wish i would have known before i bought it, they really need to update the photo with the ingredient list. I am never buying this product again...</li>
            <li> We tried Neem toothpaste for one month. At the next teeth cleaning, the hygienist asked if we had been doing anything different in tooth/gum care. Gum disease had decreased significantly enough for her to notice--when she was measuring gum pockets around each tooth. She even called the dentist in, and raved about the improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Research well, before using with children.</li>
            <li> I was curious about a number of products with the active herbal ingredient Neem, therefore I ordered two different toothpastes.  This one has a terrible taste and after taste that I cannot describe.  Had I not ordered another brand I would have assumed that all toothpaste with Neem is bad.  But another brand TheraNeem Mint is very nice.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to try Neem toothpaste as I heard it was good for gums and teeth.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference from using any other toothpaste.  Maybe I&#x27;m just note aware enough.  I did the job, but no big deal.</li>
            <li> I wish I could buy this where I live, it makes your teeth &amp; gums feel like you just left the dentist. No bad aftertaste just great results.</li>
            <li> A clean, odd taste which takes a little getting used to; experienced some nausea after using, but teeth were clean, and gums felt good; I experienced a good delivery, product was as advertised and worth the price,</li>
            <li> This product came straight from India, and had a weird taste/smell that took a couple uses to get used to. I do not know that I feel like my mouth is any cleaner than with products I can get on the shelves here in the USA, but its definitely not any worse.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of thinking this product was minus SLS.  Otherwise, the product does as it states.  It definitely leaves my teeth clean, my tongue has become more pink since using it (I use inhalers for asthma which causes the surface to turn white - yeast).  Anyway, when this is gone I will try another Neem toothpaste when I find one without harmful chemicals.  Yeah, yeah, I know, I am using it.  I bought it and can&#x27;t bring myself to toss it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product...........leaves mouth and teeth very clean.......I would recomment to everyone who wants clean teeth,mouth and breath......Everyone shoule buy this product.</li>
            <li> $7.50 for a bottle of toothpaste that only seems to be worth exactly $2.99 (as depicted FAIL!!) HE HE HE</li>
            <li> Quick shipping,great feel after brushing taste good..and minty  Refreshing..</li>
            <li> Just tried this Neem toothpaste for the first time.  Love the taste and how clean my mouth feels.  I have gum and bone decay issues which cause really bad breath.  This tastes so clean and it&#x27;s a long lasting clean feeling.  I hope it slows the bacterial and decay issues and controls my bad breath too.  I will post an update after prolonged use.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was brushing my teeth with the green mud for your face,even smells the same. My teeth did feel clean afterwards,but,leaves your breath smell like clay.</li>
            <li> this toothpaste makes my teeth feel clean I was doubtful until I tried it I am very pleased with it, if you have sensitive teeth I don&#x27;t recommend this toothpaste</li>
            <li> No, seriously i don&#x27;t know if i hate it or not.... Cuz i never got to try it!!!!  ordered it almost 2 months ago, still haven&#x27;t gotten it....  got the rest of my order really fast, everything that didn&#x27;t come from spice world that is....</li>
            <li> This paste has a pleasant smooth and creamy texture. The fresh minty flavor does a good job masking the slight earthy after taste of neem.  My teeth feel clean and look nice and shiny after using this product.</li>
            <li> I had to get used to the taste, overall. It cleans well, no bleeding of the gums or any type of reactions in my mouth when using the product.</li>
            <li> This tooth paste has a slight soapy taste, but OK. May take more time to evaluate how I like it.</li>
            <li> I l.ike the taste and keeps my teeth feeling clean for a long time. Makes my qums feel good too.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste contains 1000 ppm of Fluoride.  My municipal water supply doses the water to 1.1 ppm; 4 ppm is considered unsafe (really, any amount will calcify your pineal gland and reduce your brain function).  This toothpaste seems like a health risk.</li>
            <li> the toothpaste smell great</li>
            <li> Great taste, leaves mouth feeling very fresh.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a Cardiologist from India.  He spoke in great detail about how the people of India use the branches of the Neem tree for their oral care.  These people live for many many years and have all their original teeth.  And, they have minimla to no heart disease in that country as well.</li>
            <li> Have not received product as of yet.  Hope to receive soon.  Rec&#x27;d other items in that order.  Happy with them.</li>
            <li> It was not sealed with foil under the cap and the box was smashed so I was afraid to try it.</li>
            <li> Hope this product can reduce on dental bills.  The flavor is nice.  But it seems to be quite expensive for a tube of toothpaste.</li>
