            <li>I had to change to bottle poured some into my UD bottle which has a nice mist like refreshing spray.  </li>
            <li>Model in a Bottle is the most effective setting spray I have used.  </li>
            <li>Wore this for my wedding- works great and kept my makeup fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I liked that the shipment got here very quickly</li>
            <li>When I dont use it, i can tell a huge difference!</li>

            <li>I love love love</li>
            <li>This stuff is seriously magical.  </li>
            <li>Ok, yeah</li>
            <li>This product is awesome if only i heard of it before.</li>
            <li>WHICH MAKES ME THINK IF IM DAMAGING MY FACE.I WILL DO MORE RESEARCH ABOUT THE INGREDIENTS</li>
            <li>THE BOTTLE IS CUTE AND SLIM.</li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>I still love Amazon, but this was not a must have Hit for me.</li>
            <li>rather it be more like a mist.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>it will make your makeup stay on for most of the day.</li>
            <li>This works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>SPRAYING IS EASY.   </li>
            <li>Lipstick still comes off easily, but that doesn&#x27;t surprise me.</li>
            <li>: Strong smell when you spray it on your face</li>
            <li>it shoots out strong and in spots</li>
            <li>I really love this, it smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I would find my self at the end of the day with a super shiny face!</li>
            <li>Super glad</li>
            <li>For me, my mascara looks even better toward the end of the day than after I first put it on!</li>
            <li>A TRY AT SUCH A GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li>a light mist which I feel would benefit your face setting the makeup without drenching the skin and ruining the makeup.</li>
            <li>that just looking at it too much will make it break out), smells quite nice and light, and gives you a light glowy refreshed look.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would actually help me get through the day, but it did and it is an amazing product!</li>
            <li>I was REALLY excited about this product.</li>
            <li>When I bought it my friends made fun of me until they saw how well it works!</li>
            <li>have normal skin, and it gives me a nice lightly-dewy, luminous finish.</li>
            <li>I originally learned about this product in Oprah.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice natural matte finish.  </li>
            <li>Also it does have a pretty strong fragrance</li>
            <li>My makeup stays exactly where I want it, and it cleanses off easily when I want to take it</li>
            <li>I like this product but not as great as other reviews have said it was.</li>
            <li>Be warned that the spray doesn&#x27;t come out in a fine mist and please shake the solution first.  </li>
            <li>AND IT QUICKLY SETS THE MAKEUP.</li>
            <li>It smells great, doesn&#x27;t smudge makeup, and lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li>IT DRIES QUICK.</li>
            <li>It does have a odor, but it quickly fades.  </li>
            <li>For someone with super oily skin who has tried everything under the sun to keep her face from being shiny, this stuff works pretty well!</li>
            <li>I live in south Louisiana which is very hot and humid most of the year</li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more of this!</li>
            <li>3 sprays, I notice my blush wiped off on a white top I had tried on at a retail store!</li>
            <li>just make sure your mascara is dry before you spray the product on your face! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve practiced with it a few times already and it seems to work great.</li>
            <li>I am happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in just a few days after it was shipped.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S WORTH</li>
            <li>Good thing I hadn&#x27;t left my house and i was able to go back and wash all of it off my face...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even want to take off my make up because it looked freshly applied.</li>
            <li>It kept my makeup on all day and looking fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s your decision if the burn is worth it.</li>
            <li>It keeps my make-up looking fresh all day.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong, like a perfume, i LOVE perfume, just not directly on my face.</li>
            <li>Also be aware that it has an immense isopropyl alcohol smell, which is not something most people enjoy spraying on their face.</li>
            <li>you have to spray about 3 or 4 sprays and you feel the tightness right away</li>
            <li>Model in a bottle was rated pretty highly on most of the reviews, but since I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Not sure if this one is as good as the original or not.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind the ingredients in this are extreme, mostly chemical with Alcohol being the primary ingredient under the wrapping and</li>
            <li>and i was a little scared spraying any kind of liquid on my face specially after applying powder on my face</li>
            <li>great for making make up last long.</li>
            <li>Does make your face feel like a mask in the first minute after it dries, but that eases.</li>
            <li>very sticky &amp; becomes flaky!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only allowed myself to use it three times and each time I used it, it got better.</li>
            <li>I use this product more in the summer especially at the pool.   </li>
            <li>one first</li>
            <li>my make-up looks almost exactly like when I firts put it on.</li>
            <li>On those really hot days I just spray some of this on and after it dries which takes</li>
            <li>Fast shipping over a holiday weekend too!</li>
            <li>It really does work!</li>
            <li>Model in a bottle is one of my all time favorite setting sprays, but this specific one did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>Also when sprayed it burns for the first 5 minutes...</li>
            <li>so i didnt have super high expectations</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I use it even if I&#x27;m only going to be out for an hour.</li>
            <li>Now I have to admit the scent is a little strong at first but vanishes quickly.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;IT&#x27;S A GREAT SECRET USED BY CELEBRITIES AND MODELS.</li>
            <li>WELL I WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIMENT WITH THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE I HAVE SO MUCH HOPE FOR IT</li>
            <li>My make up would alwas be very shiny and cakey</li>
            <li>It really does keep your make up on all day.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s too soon to review that much</li>
            <li>I didnt really notice a difference in my makeup staying in place.</li>
            <li>and I looked it up to see how much it cost.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unless you really douse yourself in it, it&#x27;s not sticky once</li>
            <li>It just kinda shoots you in the face and has a very chemically smell to it.  </li>
            <li>It made my face look very oily.</li>
            <li>It does keep your make-up in place, but it really stings my face when I put it on.</li>
            <li>Although this spray does keep makeup in place all day, the smell is very overbearing.</li>
            <li>It has made my make-up regimen much simpler.</li>
            <li>It sets all your make-up and gave me the extra confidence that while getting married on the beach my face wont melt off in the process!I wore it for a whole day special event and fell asleep without washing my face (bad girl) and it all still looked pretty perfect in the morning.</li>
            <li>I only use on special occasions or weekends.</li>
            <li>it is highly fragranced and left my face feeling very sticky at first.</li>
            <li>I loved this product, thought it was totally fake at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it has been reformulated since without the formaldehyde because the last ingredient is now listed as \\&quot;light fragrance\\&quot; instead of the last 2 listed as \\&quot;diazolidinyl urea, fragrance\\&quot; on the bottle I own.</li>
            <li>Gave if to a friend that has normal skin</li>
            <li>My only criticism of it is that the spray apparatus isn&#x27;t quite fine enough</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and this makes my makeup stay put all day even in100 degree weather.</li>
            <li>Yes it was worth every penny especially if you have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up.</li>
            <li>my skin is very sensitive and oily</li>
            <li>also prevented my makeup from sliding off on hot days and especially at theme parks.</li>
            <li>I will mention that it is important that you are completely satisfied with your finished look before you spray because once it sets it is pretty impossible to touch up.  </li>
            <li>but this just proves what i said previously about how it just shoots wherever it wants.</li>
            <li>but whenever I have used it, it works fine except the sprayer tends to go on heavy.  </li>
            <li>and you better believe that Model in a Bottle will be packed tightly in my suitcase for daily spritzes!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually been with it in the pouring rain and it held it very well.</li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive skin, I would suggest getting the one made for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so i decided to get this product in the sensitive formula.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so it didn&#x27;t surprise me.</li>
            <li>, i actually like it &amp; it doesnt really linger so it doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li>but it may bother some people who are sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li>BUT SO FAR...</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I went with the Sensitive Makeup Setting spray.  </li>
            <li>it sets the makeup, takes away any ashiness from the powder used, does not irritate (shocklingly so) and I have aging sensitive skin</li>
            <li>(so sensitive-</li>
            <li>I would prefer to purchase directly than thru Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Maybe because it was for sensitive skin?</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and I have eczema</li>
            <li>It did its job so far.</li>
            <li>the reviews on the spray bottle should no longer be an issue because they have since fixed the problem</li>
            <li>I like this product so far.  </li>
            <li>The sensitive skin formula doesn&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li>I had to literally place it in the fridge to cool the item down.  </li>
            <li>a pinch, hairspray have exactly the same virtue, it will glue your makeup to your face for a far smaller price.</li>
            <li>if you spray too much it will make your makeup dry or crack, BUT it has not made me break out.</li>
            <li>Overall, yes it really locks in your makeup all day like it will NOT move, but I think it has different effects on all skin types.</li>
            <li>you use liquid or cream foundation and powder, I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s helpful to spray this on before using the powder, or it looks kind of weird.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m normal to dry at the moment)</li>
            <li>I much prefer other setting sprays.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants to spend an active day not worrying about whether their makeup will hold up.</li>
            <li>The second tiime, I sprayed a little less because I thought maybe I sprayed too much the first time, but</li>
            <li>I thought it would definitely work on me because I live in such a dry climate, but no sir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Eye</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin that gets shiny within even a half hour</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very slightly sticky when you first put it on</li>
    </ol>

            <li> a mac makeup artist compared this product to the mac version and said that she would use model in a bottle instead of the mac product because it works so much better!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s absolutely amazing</li>

            <li> I had to change to bottle poured some into my UD bottle which has a nice mist like refreshing spray.  </li>
            <li> Model in a Bottle is the most effective setting spray I have used.  </li>
            <li> Wore this for my wedding- works great and kept my makeup fresh all day.</li>
            <li> I liked that the shipment got here very quickly</li>
            <li> When I dont use it, i can tell a huge difference!</li>

            <li> I love love love</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously magical.  </li>
            <li> Ok, yeah</li>
            <li> This product is awesome if only i heard of it before.</li>
            <li> WHICH MAKES ME THINK IF IM DAMAGING MY FACE.I WILL DO MORE RESEARCH ABOUT THE INGREDIENTS</li>
            <li> THE BOTTLE IS CUTE AND SLIM.</li>
            <li> ok.  </li>
            <li> I still love Amazon, but this was not a must have Hit for me.</li>
            <li> rather it be more like a mist.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> it will make your makeup stay on for most of the day.</li>
            <li> This works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> SPRAYING IS EASY.   </li>
            <li> Lipstick still comes off easily, but that doesn&#x27;t surprise me.</li>
            <li> : Strong smell when you spray it on your face</li>
            <li> it shoots out strong and in spots</li>
            <li> I really love this, it smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I would find my self at the end of the day with a super shiny face!</li>
            <li> Super glad</li>
            <li> For me, my mascara looks even better toward the end of the day than after I first put it on!</li>
            <li> A TRY AT SUCH A GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li> a light mist which I feel would benefit your face setting the makeup without drenching the skin and ruining the makeup.</li>
            <li> that just looking at it too much will make it break out), smells quite nice and light, and gives you a light glowy refreshed look.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would actually help me get through the day, but it did and it is an amazing product!</li>
            <li> I was REALLY excited about this product.</li>
            <li> When I bought it my friends made fun of me until they saw how well it works!</li>
            <li> have normal skin, and it gives me a nice lightly-dewy, luminous finish.</li>
            <li> I originally learned about this product in Oprah.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice natural matte finish.  </li>
            <li> Also it does have a pretty strong fragrance</li>
            <li> My makeup stays exactly where I want it, and it cleanses off easily when I want to take it</li>
            <li> I like this product but not as great as other reviews have said it was.</li>
            <li> Be warned that the spray doesn&#x27;t come out in a fine mist and please shake the solution first.  </li>
            <li> AND IT QUICKLY SETS THE MAKEUP.</li>
            <li> It smells great, doesn&#x27;t smudge makeup, and lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li> IT DRIES QUICK.</li>
            <li> It does have a odor, but it quickly fades.  </li>
            <li> For someone with super oily skin who has tried everything under the sun to keep her face from being shiny, this stuff works pretty well!</li>
            <li> I live in south Louisiana which is very hot and humid most of the year</li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering more of this!</li>
            <li> 3 sprays, I notice my blush wiped off on a white top I had tried on at a retail store!</li>
            <li> just make sure your mascara is dry before you spray the product on your face! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve practiced with it a few times already and it seems to work great.</li>
            <li> I am happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in just a few days after it was shipped.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S WORTH</li>
            <li> Good thing I hadn&#x27;t left my house and i was able to go back and wash all of it off my face...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even want to take off my make up because it looked freshly applied.</li>
            <li> It kept my makeup on all day and looking fresh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s your decision if the burn is worth it.</li>
            <li> It keeps my make-up looking fresh all day.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong, like a perfume, i LOVE perfume, just not directly on my face.</li>
            <li> Also be aware that it has an immense isopropyl alcohol smell, which is not something most people enjoy spraying on their face.</li>
            <li> you have to spray about 3 or 4 sprays and you feel the tightness right away</li>
            <li> Model in a bottle was rated pretty highly on most of the reviews, but since I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Not sure if this one is as good as the original or not.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind the ingredients in this are extreme, mostly chemical with Alcohol being the primary ingredient under the wrapping and</li>
            <li> and i was a little scared spraying any kind of liquid on my face specially after applying powder on my face</li>
            <li> great for making make up last long.</li>
            <li> Does make your face feel like a mask in the first minute after it dries, but that eases.</li>
            <li> very sticky &amp; becomes flaky!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only allowed myself to use it three times and each time I used it, it got better.</li>
            <li> I use this product more in the summer especially at the pool.   </li>
            <li> one first</li>
            <li> my make-up looks almost exactly like when I firts put it on.</li>
            <li> On those really hot days I just spray some of this on and after it dries which takes</li>
            <li> Fast shipping over a holiday weekend too!</li>
            <li> It really does work!</li>
            <li> Model in a bottle is one of my all time favorite setting sprays, but this specific one did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Also when sprayed it burns for the first 5 minutes...</li>
            <li> so i didnt have super high expectations</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I use it even if I&#x27;m only going to be out for an hour.</li>
            <li> Now I have to admit the scent is a little strong at first but vanishes quickly.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;IT&#x27;S A GREAT SECRET USED BY CELEBRITIES AND MODELS.</li>
            <li> WELL I WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIMENT WITH THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE I HAVE SO MUCH HOPE FOR IT</li>
            <li> My make up would alwas be very shiny and cakey</li>
            <li> It really does keep your make up on all day.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s too soon to review that much</li>
            <li> I didnt really notice a difference in my makeup staying in place.</li>
            <li> and I looked it up to see how much it cost.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless you really douse yourself in it, it&#x27;s not sticky once</li>
            <li> It just kinda shoots you in the face and has a very chemically smell to it.  </li>
            <li> It made my face look very oily.</li>
            <li> It does keep your make-up in place, but it really stings my face when I put it on.</li>
            <li> Although this spray does keep makeup in place all day, the smell is very overbearing.</li>
            <li> It has made my make-up regimen much simpler.</li>
            <li> It sets all your make-up and gave me the extra confidence that while getting married on the beach my face wont melt off in the process!I wore it for a whole day special event and fell asleep without washing my face (bad girl) and it all still looked pretty perfect in the morning.</li>
            <li> I only use on special occasions or weekends.</li>
            <li> it is highly fragranced and left my face feeling very sticky at first.</li>
            <li> I loved this product, thought it was totally fake at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it has been reformulated since without the formaldehyde because the last ingredient is now listed as \\&quot;light fragrance\\&quot; instead of the last 2 listed as \\&quot;diazolidinyl urea, fragrance\\&quot; on the bottle I own.</li>
            <li> Gave if to a friend that has normal skin</li>
            <li> My only criticism of it is that the spray apparatus isn&#x27;t quite fine enough</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and this makes my makeup stay put all day even in100 degree weather.</li>
            <li> Yes it was worth every penny especially if you have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up.</li>
            <li> my skin is very sensitive and oily</li>
            <li> also prevented my makeup from sliding off on hot days and especially at theme parks.</li>
            <li> I will mention that it is important that you are completely satisfied with your finished look before you spray because once it sets it is pretty impossible to touch up.  </li>
            <li> but this just proves what i said previously about how it just shoots wherever it wants.</li>
            <li> but whenever I have used it, it works fine except the sprayer tends to go on heavy.  </li>
            <li> and you better believe that Model in a Bottle will be packed tightly in my suitcase for daily spritzes!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually been with it in the pouring rain and it held it very well.</li>
            <li> So if you have sensitive skin, I would suggest getting the one made for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so i decided to get this product in the sensitive formula.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so it didn&#x27;t surprise me.</li>
            <li> , i actually like it &amp; it doesnt really linger so it doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li> but it may bother some people who are sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li> BUT SO FAR...</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I went with the Sensitive Makeup Setting spray.  </li>
            <li> it sets the makeup, takes away any ashiness from the powder used, does not irritate (shocklingly so) and I have aging sensitive skin</li>
            <li> (so sensitive-</li>
            <li> I would prefer to purchase directly than thru Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Maybe because it was for sensitive skin?</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and I have eczema</li>
            <li> It did its job so far.</li>
            <li> the reviews on the spray bottle should no longer be an issue because they have since fixed the problem</li>
            <li> I like this product so far.  </li>
            <li> The sensitive skin formula doesn&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> I had to literally place it in the fridge to cool the item down.  </li>
            <li> a pinch, hairspray have exactly the same virtue, it will glue your makeup to your face for a far smaller price.</li>
            <li> if you spray too much it will make your makeup dry or crack, BUT it has not made me break out.</li>
            <li> Overall, yes it really locks in your makeup all day like it will NOT move, but I think it has different effects on all skin types.</li>
            <li> you use liquid or cream foundation and powder, I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s helpful to spray this on before using the powder, or it looks kind of weird.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m normal to dry at the moment)</li>
            <li> I much prefer other setting sprays.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who wants to spend an active day not worrying about whether their makeup will hold up.</li>
            <li> The second tiime, I sprayed a little less because I thought maybe I sprayed too much the first time, but</li>
            <li> I thought it would definitely work on me because I live in such a dry climate, but no sir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Eye</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin that gets shiny within even a half hour</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very slightly sticky when you first put it on</li>
            <li> The second time was a little less bad and the third was pretty good.</li>
            <li> I bought this right before a trip to FL - in Sept - when it was hot, humid, and muggy</li>
            <li> I usually buy straight from the company.</li>
            <li> Once i sprayed it on, my face looked dewy and fresh, BUT After about 10-15 minutes, my skin started to itch pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wedding and the product delivers, your makeup will hold a long time.</li>
            <li> It also minimizes any minor imperfections in my skin texture; I look like my face has been airbrushed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially helpful since I have really oily skin as well, and usually everything just slides off after a few hours,</li>
            <li> Left my face feeling a little on the greasy side and my pores appeared larger.  </li>
            <li> : wait until your eye makeup is dry before putting on!</li>
            <li> My lashes are long &amp; black all day long with no need to reapply mascara.</li>
            <li> i also notice little water spots that scared me but about 5 minutes later they were gone and</li>
            <li> Yes, it goes on with a wet look...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this everyday, just on occasions when I want my makeup to last &amp; not have to touchup.  </li>
            <li> If you retouch your makeup throughout the day you have to reapply the spray, and because its wet it changes the look of the makeup.  </li>
            <li> Since then, i&#x27;m buying only green product for my makeup</li>
            <li> After an 8 hour day, my face was only slightly shiny, whereas without this product, my face would look like a disco ball!</li>
            <li> the bad thing was that at this point i had hives/rash, so i was not able to re-apply my makeup right away, since my skin was still very irritated.</li>
            <li> and it also has a very strong medicated smell which I hate</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finished the bottle and went back to my usual UD setting spray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be re-ordering when my bottle is empty!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cost as much as on other sites.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Just a few sprays in the morning goes a long way!</li>
            <li> not only was this product hard to hold while spraying on your face</li>
            <li> It did keep most of my makeup in place, but was I was a little bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> &quot; but found it to be expensive and since I always look at makeup tutorials in youtube; there was much raving about this product.</li>
            <li> only complaint</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping that it would help my eyeliner and mascara from running down my face.  </li>
            <li> My only negative is that is stings just a little.</li>
            <li> opposed to my typical make up forever</li>
            <li> It has a very strong eucalyptus scent, which I find sickening.</li>
            <li> I use it when I go to theme parks and conventions - especially conventions, considering I usually wear very heavy costume makeup then.</li>
            <li> I finally did and it was just not good, for MY SKIN.</li>
            <li> Just a little test you can do.</li>
            <li> and sometimes it can coat a little coarser than I would like,</li>
            <li> Seems a little drying though.</li>
            <li> it leaves your face a little shiny and sticky like there is oil in it</li>
            <li> so you have little spots on your face when it dries..</li>
            <li> It did its job to set makeup, but this is not for your everyday</li>
            <li> It shoots out too harsh.</li>
            <li> Every morning after putting on my make-up I put a few squirts on and by the end of the day</li>
            <li> a few seconds</li>
            <li> I do not know how well it works because it comes out so uneven.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few years ago and it&#x27;s been sitting on a shelf since</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The first time was awful, my foundation separated and was left blotchy and dry.</li>
            <li> the way you can tell is if you apply some  product like eye shadow on both your hands or wrist and spray this on ONE hand and let it sit for a couple seconds, then  rub the one you sprayed continuously, it hardly fades or disappears compared to the other hand that isn&#x27;t sprayed.</li>
            <li> I had a pretty bad break out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a great make up person, but when I do, I hate touching up stuff.</li>
            <li> Not really sure how I feel about this...</li>
            <li> it does keep lipstick on longer than usual but it still needs to be re-applied).  </li>
            <li> (the thick glass bottle slips out of your hand and the nozzle sticks) but it sprays unevenly.</li>
            <li> USED IN HERE AND KEEP TESTING TO SEE WHAT I AM DOING WRONG BECAUSE MY MAKEUP DOES NOT SEEM TO LAST ALL DAY</li>
            <li> but that is actually a small thing compared to how well it keeps one&#x27;s makeup in place.  </li>
            <li> not sure what thats about</li>
            <li> I hate that the pretty glass bottle was damaged and the almost 1/2 the product was lost.  </li>
            <li> The spray is hard.</li>
            <li> I had tested a little on my skin days prior and didn&#x27;t see any bad reactions , so i had no idea this would have happened.</li>
            <li> My makeup stays on all day long, from morning till night, though heat and cold.  </li>
            <li> but it was spilled into my package so my bottle was half empty by the time it reached here so that made me disappointed.</li>
            <li> Also the spray action of this bottle is terrible, its a stream Vs.</li>
            <li> I cannot imagine how anyone could not LOVE this stuff!!!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying and using this product</li>
            <li> DOES NOT KEEP SHINE AT BAY BUT NEEDLESS TO SAY.</li>
            <li> ILL KEEP</li>
            <li> I bought this on a recommendation from a YouTube beauty guru, but it failed my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> To start the packaging or mailing of this was awful, it took too long to ship and even though it was wrapped up in bubble wrap for some wierd reason the liquid leaked damaging the bottle.  </li>
            <li> or maybe i&#x27;m just afraid of spraying stuff in my face...</li>
            <li> my skin still stung bad and i feel like I had just sprayed my face with hairspray.</li>
            <li> $15 was not too bad of a deal compared some others listed that were priced for $50-80.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate wearing make up without this product.</li>
            <li> i am very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> and I hated it!</li>
            <li> Also it smells horrible</li>
            <li> and it sprays horribly ..</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i was having issues with my makeup rubbing off on people when i gave them a hug. i didn&#x27;t want to stop hugging :) so i tried this. it works great!</li>
            <li> great for making make up last long. I&#x27;m not a great make up person, but when I do, I hate touching up stuff. This is great for that. Does make your face feel like a mask in the first minute after it dries, but that eases.</li>
            <li> This spray works great!! I wear it almost every day and my make up lasts forever. I&#x27;ve actually been with it in the pouring rain and it held it very well. I only gave it 4 stars because it stings your skin a bit when you apply it. But after it drys (which is almost instantly) it&#x27;s alright. I&#x27;ll be buying another one!!</li>
            <li> Great Company!  Definetly would shop here again, excellent experience, highly recommended.  The customer service was great, and I was helped out quickly and had a great customer experience.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My only negative is that is stings just a little. So if you have sensitive skin, I would suggest getting the one made for sensitive skin. I have very oily skin and it did a great job of \\&quot;holding\\&quot; my make-up in place for 6 hours.</li>
            <li> very sticky &amp; becomes flaky! like you face is peeling off. once you spray you can not touch up. otherwise you face will look like your peeling.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what I&#x27;d do without this stuff. I use it when I go to theme parks and conventions - especially conventions, considering I usually wear very heavy costume makeup then. My makeup doesn&#x27;t budge after using this! It&#x27;s especially helpful since I have really oily skin as well, and usually everything just slides off after a few hours, ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use liquid or cream foundation and powder, I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s helpful to spray this on before using the powder, or it looks kind of weird. Otherwise, it&#x27;s absolutely amazing and I recommend it to everybody!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had Urban Decay&#x27;s \\&quot;ALL NIGHTER SETTING SPRAY\\&quot; but found it to be expensive and since I always look at makeup tutorials in youtube; there was much raving about this product. my skin is very sensitive and oily so i decided to get this product in the sensitive formula. my skin still stung bad and i feel like I had just sprayed my face with hairspray. It did its job to set makeup, but this is not for your everyday setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finished the bottle and went back to my usual UD setting spray. Never mind the cost.</li>
            <li> Loved it! I didn&#x27;t think it would actually help me get through the day, but it did and it is an amazing product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! My makeup looks great by the end of the day. Just a few sprays in the morning goes a long way! Will definitely be ordering more of this!</li>
            <li> Not really sure how I feel about this... I&#x27;ve only allowed myself to use it three times and each time I used it, it got better. The first time was awful, my foundation separated and was left blotchy and dry. The second time was a little less bad and the third was pretty good. Overall, yes it really locks in your makeup all day like it will NOT move, but I think it has different effects on all skin types. (I&#x27;m normal to dry at the moment)</li>
            <li> I SAW THIS PRODUCT BEING USED BY OPRAH&#x27;S MAKEUP ARTIST, ANDRE&#x27;, AND FIGURED IT MUST BE GOOD! &lt;br /&gt;YOU SPRAY IT ON AFTER APPLYING YOUR MAKEUP AND IT QUICKLY SETS THE MAKEUP. &lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S A GREAT SECRET USED BY CELEBRITIES AND MODELS. &lt;br /&gt;IT SEEMS LIKE IT&#x27;S WORTH A TRY AT SUCH A GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my destination wedding in Mexico this coming January. I&#x27;ve practiced with it a few times already and it seems to work great. It sets all your make-up and gave me the extra confidence that while getting married on the beach my face wont melt off in the process!I wore it for a whole day special event and fell asleep without washing my face (bad girl) and it all still looked pretty perfect in the morning. I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> I was REALLY excited about this product. I had been going back and fourth about purchasing this spray. I finally did and it was just not good, for MY SKIN. The smell is strong, like a perfume, i LOVE perfume, just not directly on my face. Once i sprayed it on, my face looked dewy and fresh, BUT After about 10-15 minutes, my skin started to itch pretty bad. I have sensitive skin, so it didn&#x27;t surprise me. Good thing I hadn&#x27;t left my house and i was able to go back and wash all of it off my face... the bad thing was that at this point i had hives/rash, so i was not able to re-apply my makeup right away, since my skin was still very irritated. I had tested a little on my skin days prior and didn&#x27;t see any bad reactions , so i had no idea this would have happened. I thought about returning this one and trying the \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; type, but the seller has yet to respond to me.</li>
            <li> Awesome great fast to get! Love this stuff ! You must order it ! I love love love it works great will reorder again !</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t all that. The spray is hard. It shoots out too harsh. It keeps your makeup in place but if you your forehead inches for some reason don&#x27;t scratch cuz it looks as if your skin is peeling. You can&#x27;t touch your face at all. Not even pat it. It looks flaky if you do.</li>
            <li> Bottom line . . . it works great.  My makeup stays on all day long, from morning till night, though heat and cold.  I never have to do a touch-up anymore (except for lipstick . . . it does keep lipstick on longer than usual but it still needs to be re-applied).  My eyeshadow never creases and my mascara and eyeliner never run.  Gives a nice natural matte finish.  I&#x27;ll be re-ordering when my bottle is empty!</li>
            <li> For someone with super oily skin who has tried everything under the sun to keep her face from being shiny, this stuff works pretty well! It smells great, doesn&#x27;t smudge makeup, and lasts pretty long. After an 8 hour day, my face was only slightly shiny, whereas without this product, my face would look like a disco ball!</li>
            <li> I use this product more in the summer especially at the pool.   It helps a lot in preventing makeup from running.</li>
            <li> OMG BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU.....SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!! not only was this product hard to hold while spraying on your face (the thick glass bottle slips out of your hand and the nozzle sticks) but it sprays unevenly. it does not mist your face. it stings! it shoots out of the bottle like a moisturizer with a pump would. it is highly fragranced and left my face feeling very sticky at first. i even got it into my hair (u have no idea where the spray is going to shoot) and it made my hair sticky. yes i know it isnt a hair product but this just proves what i said previously about how it just shoots wherever it wants. i am very disappointed with this product. i had used urban decays all nighter prior to this product and definitely will be repurchasing that instead. save your money ladies!</li>
            <li> I cannot imagine how anyone could not LOVE this stuff!!!  I bought this right before a trip to FL - in Sept - when it was hot, humid, and muggy and my makeup stayed on the entire day!!  My girlfriend even borrowed it from me every day because she couldnt believe how great my make up looked at the end of the night.  This stuff is seriously magical.  Ok, yeah it stinks...for like 8 seconds after you&#x27;ve sprayed it.  Big deal.  Yes, it goes on with a wet look...that dries up perfectly after 9 seconds.  Are you kidding me?  If those are the only complaints - send me another bottle.  I will never not use this stuff.  My hubby and I are going to Hawaii in Nov and you better believe that Model in a Bottle will be packed tightly in my suitcase for daily spritzes!!!  Loooove it!!!</li>
            <li> This works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  I don&#x27;t use this everyday, just on occasions when I want my makeup to last &amp; not have to touchup.  I will mention that it is important that you are completely satisfied with your finished look before you spray because once it sets it is pretty impossible to touch up.  Also it does have a pretty strong fragrance, i actually like it &amp; it doesnt really linger so it doesn&#x27;t bother me but it may bother some people who are sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying and using this product but I am a very happy consumer now. It holds my makeup in place all day and I do not need any touch ups. Amazing. Would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I like this product but not as great as other reviews have said it was.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this because i always have to touch up my make up through out the day and i was a little scared spraying any kind of liquid on my face specially after applying powder on my face so i bought the travel size one first you have to spray about 3 or 4 sprays and you feel the tightness right away i also notice little water spots that scared me but about 5 minutes later they were gone and my make up lasted all day and night i put on my make up in the morning and when i got home at 10:30pm it looked like it did in the morning perfect! I didn&#x27;t even want to take off my make up because it looked freshly applied. This product is awesome if only i heard of it before.</li>
            <li> WELL I WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIMENT WITH THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE I HAVE SO MUCH HOPE FOR IT BUT SO FAR... NO,IT DOES HELP MAKE MY MAKEUP LAST ALL DAY.. DOES NOT KEEP SHINE AT BAY BUT NEEDLESS TO SAY. IT DRIES QUICK. NICE SMELL. FEELS LIKE HAIRSPRAY FOR THE FACE WHICH MAKES ME THINK IF IM DAMAGING MY FACE.I WILL DO MORE RESEARCH ABOUT THE INGREDIENTS USED IN HERE AND KEEP TESTING TO SEE WHAT I AM DOING WRONG BECAUSE MY MAKEUP DOES NOT SEEM TO LAST ALL DAY NO MATTER THE QUALITY OF MAKEUP I USE. ILL KEEP YOU POSTED ASAP.BTW, TO ADD.. THE BOTTLE IS CUTE AND SLIM. SPRAYING IS EASY.   GOOD LUCK ON YOUR CHOICE!!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I don&#x27;t like it and it works ok.  If you retouch your makeup throughout the day you have to reapply the spray, and because its wet it changes the look of the makeup.  I had to use my pressed powder to cover up the effects of it.  It doesn&#x27;t comepletely keep your makeup from transferring but it helps.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I would find my self at the end of the day with a super shiny face! I work out in the morning and I never have time to put make-up on after so I just do it before. My make up would alwas be very shiny and cakey and I hated it! I didn&#x27;t want to have to do touch ups evry hour just to keep from getting shiny at the end of the day. After buying this product, I don&#x27;t know what I ever did without it! Every morning after putting on my make-up I put a few squirts on and by the end of the day my make-up looks almost exactly like when I firts put it on. If you are on the fence about buying this product you definitely  should!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Helps to decrease my oil production on my skin. Makes makeup last longer. I like it so far.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. My friend suggested it to me and she loves make up (and has a make up blog).  It really does keep your make up on all day.  It&#x27;s very slightly sticky when you first put it on but after about five minutes you can&#x27;t feel the stickiness anymore.</li>
            <li> Model in a bottle was rated pretty highly on most of the reviews, but since I have fairly sensitive skin I went with the Sensitive Makeup Setting spray.  Not sure if this one is as good as the original or not.  Left my face feeling a little on the greasy side and my pores appeared larger.  Also after using this for a couple of days I had a pretty bad break out.  It did keep most of my makeup in place, but was I was a little bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a recommendation from a YouTube beauty guru, but it failed my expectations.  It does not help my makeup last longer.  Also be aware that it has an immense isopropyl alcohol smell, which is not something most people enjoy spraying on their face.</li>
            <li> I loved this product, thought it was totally fake at first but when you use it you can tell it isn&#x27;t. the way you can tell is if you apply some  product like eye shadow on both your hands or wrist and spray this on ONE hand and let it sit for a couple seconds, then  rub the one you sprayed continuously, it hardly fades or disappears compared to the other hand that isn&#x27;t sprayed. Just a little test you can do. also prevented my makeup from sliding off on hot days and especially at theme parks.</li>
            <li> I really love this, it smells great and lasts a long time. The only problem I had was it was leaking when I got it in the mail, I don&#x27;t know where the leak from but it&#x27;s since stopped.</li>
            <li> Ok...I have read marvelous things about this product which influenced my decision to purchase.  My experience with this will be a \\&quot;Torn\\&quot; one.  To start the packaging or mailing of this was awful, it took too long to ship and even though it was wrapped up in bubble wrap for some wierd reason the liquid leaked damaging the bottle.  Keep in mind the ingredients in this are extreme, mostly chemical with Alcohol being the primary ingredient under the wrapping and the extensive heat this thing was like a chemical bomb waiting to explode when I received it.  I hate that the pretty glass bottle was damaged and the almost 1/2 the product was lost.  I had to literally place it in the fridge to cool the item down.  Also the spray action of this bottle is terrible, its a stream Vs. a light mist which I feel would benefit your face setting the makeup without drenching the skin and ruining the makeup. I had to change to bottle poured some into my UD bottle which has a nice mist like refreshing spray.  Now for the positve: It works! it sets the makeup, takes away any ashiness from the powder used, does not irritate (shocklingly so) and I have aging sensitive skin (so sensitive- that just looking at it too much will make it break out), smells quite nice and light, and gives you a light glowy refreshed look.  I like this product but for the price paid and the time it took to ship plus the issues of shipping.  I would not purchase again.  Regardless, it is good product, maybe if I found the maker and its website. I would prefer to purchase directly than thru Amazon.  Sorry Amazon, I always have a hit or miss experience with you!  I still love Amazon, but this was not a must have Hit for me.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! I will never have to buy waterproof makeup again!! On those really hot days I just spray some of this on and after it dries which takes a few seconds I&#x27;m good for the day!! No mid-day touch ups and even my lipstick lasts longer! Now I have to admit the scent is a little strong at first but vanishes quickly. When I bought it my friends made fun of me until they saw how well it works! Now guess what they are on here buying?! I just wish I knew about &amp;#34; Model in a bottle&amp;#34; years ago!!</li>
            <li> works great except I noticed if you spray too much it will make your makeup dry or crack, BUT it has not made me break out.</li>
            <li> This stuff WORKS. For me, my mascara looks even better toward the end of the day than after I first put it on! I love it so much that I use it even if I&#x27;m only going to be out for an hour. My lashes are long &amp; black all day long with no need to reapply mascara. Foundation &amp; concealer stays on as well. Lipstick still comes off easily, but that doesn&#x27;t surprise me. This product is perfect and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> works well and smells great only complaint the mist doesn&#x27;t spray evenly</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cost as much as on other sites. Received just what I ordered and it works great.  Keeps my make-up on the face and not on my clothes</li>
            <li> Model in a Bottle is the most effective setting spray I have used.  My only criticism of it is that the spray apparatus isn&#x27;t quite fine enough and sometimes it can coat a little coarser than I would like, but that is actually a small thing compared to how well it keeps one&#x27;s makeup in place.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to spend an active day not worrying about whether their makeup will hold up.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Fast shipping over a holiday weekend too!</li>
            <li> It really does work! I love this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wedding and the product delivers, your makeup will hold a long time. Since then, i&#x27;m buying only green product for my makeup so i got rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;In a pinch, hairspray have exactly the same virtue, it will glue your makeup to your face for a far smaller price.</li>
            <li> Model in a bottle is one of my all time favorite setting sprays, but this specific one did nothing for me. Didnt hold my make up at all. Maybe because it was for sensitive skin?</li>
            <li> I bought this item for those humid summer days when your make up is melting off. So it&#x27;s too soon to review that much lol but I went to a concert Monday night and I used it then opposed to my typical make up forever hd setting powder. It held my make up so well!! A lot of people complain about the alcohol smell or feel. It totally seems like you&#x27;re spraying rubbing alcohol on but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. My skin is sensitive and I have eczema so it didn&#x27;t bother that so I&#x27;m a happy camper! It did its job so far. I only give it 4 stars because I want to come back and review after using on a scorching summer day.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping that it would help my eyeliner and mascara from running down my face.  After using it for a couple days, I gave up with the thought that it would work on eyeliner/mascara.  My eyeshadow is perfectly in place at the end of the day, but I&#x27;m still runny McGee with the eyeliner/mascara.  I thought it would definitely work on me because I live in such a dry climate, but no sir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Eye shadow stays in place&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Strong smell when you spray it on your face (I end up holding my breath)&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t open your eyes for about 30 seconds until it dries (or it BURNS)&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s like the sprayer puts big drops all over my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years with great results.  I live in south Louisiana which is very hot and humid most of the year and this product keeps my makeup set and shine-free.</li>
            <li> I didnt really notice a difference in my makeup staying in place. I have really oily skin that gets shiny within even a half hour so i didnt have super high expectations but this product didnt help anything. Also when sprayed it burns for the first 5 minutes...not sure what thats about but i wont be buying it again. Also it smells horrible</li>
            <li> I had heard very good things about this setting spray.  The problem I encountered was the sprayer on the bottle did not work.  I had to buy a different container to put the product in.  I tend to forget to use it but whenever I have used it, it works fine except the sprayer tends to go on heavy.  I would rather it be more like a mist.</li>
            <li> I saw this on tv ....and I looked it up to see how much it cost. $15 was not too bad of a deal compared some others listed that were priced for $50-80. I done a couple of trials with it too see it would be helpful for my wedding day (marrying in July). The first trial My makeup lasted longer than it usually does...but don&#x27;t expect it to stay on until next day (tv claimed). The second tiime, I sprayed a little less because I thought maybe I sprayed too much the first time, but 3 sprays, I notice my blush wiped off on a white top I had tried on at a retail store! It looks shiny for several minutes after applications and then it went away &amp; couldn&#x27;t tell I had sprayed anything.</li>
            <li> works great and i loooove it! just make sure your mascara is dry before you spray the product on your face! :)</li>
            <li> This product sets my make up well, however, the spray nozzle isn&#x27;t the greatest.  It sprays a lot of the product out all at once.  I wish the mist was a bit gentler.  Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I used this spray on my wedding day and it was AMAZING!!! This is my turn to spray from now on!</li>
            <li> I have not used the product yet because I just received it yesterday. I liked that the shipment got here very quickly but it was spilled into my package so my bottle was half empty by the time it reached here so that made me disappointed.</li>
            <li> My makeup stays exactly where I want it, and it cleanses off easily when I want to take it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you really douse yourself in it, it&#x27;s not sticky once it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal skin, and it gives me a nice lightly-dewy, luminous finish. It also minimizes any minor imperfections in my skin texture; I look like my face has been airbrushed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. I am happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in just a few days after it was shipped.</li>
            <li> Great product. Seems a little drying though. I only use on special occasions or weekends.</li>
            <li> I much prefer other setting sprays.  The spray dosent flow evenly.  It just kinda shoots you in the face and has a very chemically smell to it.  I will be going back to urban decay all nighter</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It kept my makeup on all day and looking fresh. I definitely recommend getting this!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product ever since it came out. It&#x27;s amazing! When I dont use it, i can tell a huge difference! I usually buy straight from the company. the reviews on the spray bottle should no longer be an issue because they have since fixed the problem and it sprays great! a mac makeup artist compared this product to the mac version and said that she would use model in a bottle instead of the mac product because it works so much better!</li>
            <li> I do not know how well it works because it comes out so uneven. Big splotches.  It also smells like mouth wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed. This product is veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeery sticky. It made my face look very oily. I will deffinately not use it again.</li>
            <li> I originally learned about this product in Oprah. I absolutely love it. I have to have it. I hate wearing make up without this product. My make up looks just as good at the end of the day as it does in the morning.</li>
            <li> It does keep your make-up in place, but it really stings my face when I put it on. It&#x27;s your decision if the burn is worth it.</li>
            <li> Although this spray does keep makeup in place all day, the smell is very overbearing. It has a very strong eucalyptus scent, which I find sickening. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Yes it was worth every penny especially if you have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up. It&#x27;s like &amp;#34;hairspray&amp;#34; but to set your makeup though. Ran out so I need to buy another bottle ASAP!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. It keeps my make-up looking fresh all day. No need to touch up, you just spray in on once and you are good for the rest of the day. It gives a dewey look to your skin that I like. Super glad I discovered this item. It has made my make-up regimen much simpler.</li>
            <li> I have heard great things about this product so I thought I give it a try. OH MY GOSH!! This stuff is amazing. My makeup lasted all day. I didn&#x27;t have to blot since I have oily skin. I love this. I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I like this product so far.  It does have a odor, but it quickly fades.  Be warned that the spray doesn&#x27;t come out in a fine mist and please shake the solution first.  Overall I would re purchase.  This does make my makeup last for a longer period of time.  I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Wore this for my wedding- works great and kept my makeup fresh all day. Only con is that it stings a bit when you put it on. Advice: wait until your eye makeup is dry before putting on!</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup setting spray period!  I&#x27;ve used all kinds and none of them compare to model in a bottle.  I live in Florida and this makes my makeup stay put all day even in100 degree weather.</li>
            <li> this is like hairspray for your makeup. it is no joke! it will make your makeup stay on for most of the day.</li>
            <li> keeps your face where you put it and not all over your clothes, i LOVE LOVE LOVE MODEL IN A BOTTLE!!!</li>
            <li> I regret buying this BC it leaves your face a little shiny and sticky like there is oil in it and it sprays horribly ..it shoots out strong and in spots so you have little spots on your face when it dries..I changed out the bottle but I still don&#x27;t like it and it also has a very strong medicated smell which I hate will not order this product again..waste of money.</li>
            <li> crappy...or maybe i&#x27;m just afraid of spraying stuff in my face...</li>
            <li> I bought this a few years ago and it&#x27;s been sitting on a shelf since and I thought I would try using it again except I realized there is a FORMALDEHYDE RELEASER (Diazolidinyl Urea) listed in the ingredients! I&#x27;m not sure if it has been reformulated since without the formaldehyde because the last ingredient is now listed as \\&quot;light fragrance\\&quot; instead of the last 2 listed as \\&quot;diazolidinyl urea, fragrance\\&quot; on the bottle I own. The sensitive skin formula doesn&#x27;t have it. Please do some research before you purchase this item!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it it did nothing for my oily skin... Gave if to a friend that has normal skin and she loves it</li>
            <li> This spray is not all it&#x27;s hyped up to be. Make-up becomes lumpy and cakey after spraying this on, and wipes off. Waste of money.</li>
