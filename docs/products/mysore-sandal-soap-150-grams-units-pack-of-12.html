            <li>That said, I use more for aroma that its cleaning ability.</li>
            <li>No chemicals and love the smell.</li>
            <li>This is the most wonderful sandalwood soap that I have purchased, and, believe me, I have purchased quite a few, but this one beats them all, and I will be ordering more.  </li>
            <li>For those who are sandalwood fans, you know that the Indian Mysore is the best and is not as outsourced as much due to the scarcity of the trees today.  </li>
            <li>Also delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>Since that&#x27;s taken care of, it&#x27;s worth noting that this is a terrific soap with a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>the fragrance is strong but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I use this soap with a boar&#x27;s head brush and double edge razor for shaving, and it works great.</li>
            <li>This soap is fabulous and the smell is true sandalwood.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing like the original product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild on my face, smells great and lasts very long.</li>
            <li>and then a month ago I found one bar left and remembered how much I loved it</li>
            <li>I mean it is not the best cleaning soap I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Only soap I&#x27;ve ever used that retains the wonderful sandalwood fragrance til the last slliver.  </li>
            <li>Have purchased sandalwood soap from many high priced brands but had never tried the Mysore soap.  </li>
            <li>Love sandal wood soap and have tried many, many, brands from cheap to super expensive and this stuff, Mysore, is the most aromatic I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I can just barely smell it on my skin throughout the day which I love because I can&#x27;t wear perfume anymore.  </li>
            <li>I have a sensitive nose and have issues with allergies and strong odors but not with Mysore.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>The great long lasting scent, creamy lather.  </li>
            <li>Very prompt delivery and as described.</li>
            <li>Looks like I had the exact same problem as another reviewer.</li>
            <li>I prefer the large bars but also comes in smaller size.</li>
            <li>Will last me for a while thanks</li>
            <li>Unlike other soaps, some quite expensive, this one lasts a reasonably long time and for the cost is a great value.</li>
            <li>Soap cleans well, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like many other soaps (dial, etc) with my hard water.</li>

            <li> She loves the smell and says that doesn&#x27;t dry her skin out like a lot of other soaps.</li>
            <li> I drop the puck into a wide coffee cup, load the brush and lather using a scuttle.</li>
            <li> Also,I have allergies and other soaps gave me hives in all over my body,and I was told that I needed to use a neutral soap with no perfume on it.</li>
            <li> The bars lather up well, and last for about 15 showers before the bar becomes too small and breaks.  </li>
            <li> and I keep looking for other alternatives,and I found this product!  </li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve tried a few.</li>
            <li> But I was a hard head</li>
            <li> I brought up the issue of the wrong size with Amazon and they refunded the difference.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this purchase, I know I never am.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very prompt delivery and as described. These are the very best of products, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i found out about this soap when my sister was a Peace Corps Volunteer in Sri Lanka in the 70&#x27;s. It had the best smell of sandalwood. I purchased it off and on up until about 10 years ago and then a month ago I found one bar left and remembered how much I loved it, so i decided to get some more. Unfortunately the smell has changed and become more peppery. i am guessing it may be because of restrictions in India on harvesting the sandalwood. It&#x27;s still creamy and lovely on the skin, but oh I miss that luscious smell!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as advertised. Not sure why the other review said it was the smaller size bar; maybe that was an old post. But I received 12 bars all 150g. Also delivered very quickly. Great soap with a great scent and lasts quite awhile. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this purchase, I know I never am.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this many times. Love the smell, and the way it leaves my skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is so calming,refreshing, truly sandal smell! Also,I have allergies and other soaps gave me hives in all over my body,and I was told that I needed to use a neutral soap with no perfume on it. But I was a hard head and I keep looking for other alternatives,and I found this product!  So I recommend it!</li>
            <li> This soap is great but if you are expecting the 150 gram bars that are advertised here you may be in for a surprise.  I ordered this pack of 12 150gram bars and instead I received a pack of 12 75gram bars.  Had to return for a refund and buy elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Have purchased sandalwood soap from many high priced brands but had never tried the Mysore soap.  For those who are sandalwood fans, you know that the Indian Mysore is the best and is not as outsourced as much due to the scarcity of the trees today.  This soap is fabulous and the smell is true sandalwood.  Still priced well and hopefully improves the Mysore India economy.  There is nothing like the original product.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  The great long lasting scent, creamy lather.  Have used it for years. It keeps my linen closet smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li> Only soap I&#x27;ve ever used that retains the wonderful sandalwood fragrance til the last slliver.  This is a great soap.</li>
            <li> This is the third dozen of Mysore Sandal soap we&#x27;ve bought.  I really love the scent, consistently pleasant with a lingering aroma after a shower.  It helps the bathroom smell consistently pleasant.  The bars lather up well, and last for about 15 showers before the bar becomes too small and breaks.  It&#x27;s still good for use after that, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Sandalwood soap we&#x27;ve bought, and we&#x27;ve tried a few.</li>
            <li> Looks like I had the exact same problem as another reviewer. I got the 75gr bars delivered and not the 150gram.  Edit: I brought up the issue of the wrong size with Amazon and they refunded the difference. Recently, I reordered the 150gr size and got the correct items. Since that&#x27;s taken care of, it&#x27;s worth noting that this is a terrific soap with a wonderful scent. Unlike other soaps, some quite expensive, this one lasts a reasonably long time and for the cost is a great value.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE Mysore Sandal Soap!!  the fragrance is strong but not overpowering.  I have a sensitive nose and have issues with allergies and strong odors but not with Mysore.  I can just barely smell it on my skin throughout the day which I love because I can&#x27;t wear perfume anymore.  For years my mother has been putting these bars of soap in her dresser drawers to keep her clothes smelling nice.  I buy it in bulk because I&#x27;ve heard rumors of the scarcity of Sandalwood in India.  It will be a tragedy if this soap becomes unavailable.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife. She loves the smell and says that doesn&#x27;t dry her skin out like a lot of other soaps. I tried it also and the scent is  neither m/f just smells nice like sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Love the sandalwood scent. Soap cleans well, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like many other soaps (dial, etc) with my hard water.</li>
            <li> Will last me for a while thanks</li>

That said, I use more for aroma that its cleaning ability. I mean it is not the best cleaning soap I have ever used. I prefer the large bars but also comes in smaller size. Give a bar a try and see what you think.</li>
            <li> We use this regularly at home. In fact this is the only soap used by residents in our home.No chemicals and love the smell.</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful sandalwood soap that I have purchased, and, believe me, I have purchased quite a few, but this one beats them all, and I will be ordering more.  Thanks for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I use this soap with a boar&#x27;s head brush and double edge razor for shaving, and it works great. It&#x27;s mild on my face, smells great and lasts very long. I drop the puck into a wide coffee cup, load the brush and lather using a scuttle. Great cost savings and it feels luxurious.</li>
