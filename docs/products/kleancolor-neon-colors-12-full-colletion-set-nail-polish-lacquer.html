            <li>love the colors but no ear rings.</li>
            <li>These colors are vivid and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>They go on smoothly and very easy to take off.</li>
            <li>so I can enjoy more colors and designs.</li>
            <li>The nail polish works great and always comes early.</li>
            <li>I just with they wouldn&#x27;t chip so easily.</li>
            <li>I love these colors and they came in excelent condition and the colors are true to the order</li>
            <li>The colors were very cute but the nail polishes wasn&#x27;t really that full</li>
            <li>Also I did not receive the free earring as advertised</li>
            <li>also received the free earrings my daughter loves them</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t get the free earrings</li>
            <li>their cheap btw..when these are finish , I will never buy anymore..</li>
            <li>but I did get my free earring that supposed to come with it</li>
            <li>Great Product, the item was way better that expected specially the quality.</li>
            <li>I recommend this brand to anyone who is looking for cheap quality unique nail polish.</li>
            <li>i will surely order some more next time :)</li>
            <li>I really love all the bright colors but the picture is kind of deceiving because some of the colors that are shown are not as bright, there more basic colors, like for instance the green in the  photo,(which was the main reason I really wanted</li>
            <li>I have really become a huge fan of these nailpolishes!</li>
            <li>are all bright enough to see.</li>
            <li>A coat or two of bright white under two coats of neon makes them POP!  </li>
            <li>It was a present for my daughter and both of us loved the colors.</li>
            <li>They are going to love them as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Her main interest is anime and sleep :)  </li>
            <li>And the shipping was very fast too!</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I order this on Friday received it on Tuesday and Monday was holiday fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>These are so pretty!</li>
            <li>it dries pretty quick also so if your rushing no need to wait</li>
            <li>The colors are so bright, vibrant, and they really glow with black light!</li>
            <li>Product arrived early and they were full sized bottles!</li>
            <li>So far I have used only two of the colors, but I am liking the bright colors.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast and was at my door a week before the estimated date.</li>
            <li>I said they are very pretty colors and for the price I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>I thought it was so pretty)</li>
            <li>I received all 12 colors and was exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>They were blue which is my favorite color.</li>
            <li>I actually got the free earrings also!</li>
            <li>I got exactly the colors that were advertised.</li>
            <li>And the free earings i received were completely bent and unwearable.  </li>
            <li>neon fuschia (looks more red in the picture)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the entire collection and the quality of the polish along with the price.</li>
            <li>It stay on, pretty colors.</li>
            <li>The colors are so pretty</li>
            <li>Love love lovvvvveeee these color, I order them and got them early than expected!</li>
            <li>Love all the colors and it stays on a long time.</li>
            <li>but they are all so pretty and very opique</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, but some of the fingernail Polish wasn&#x27;t even neon, &amp; the neon green was what I wanted most, &amp;</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and so pretty..</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: This polish chips incredibly fast, I&#x27;m talking within hours after painting your nails.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and only takes 2 coats.</li>
            <li>It dries too fast</li>
            <li>Also polish is very think</li>
            <li>Spring colors, very shinny.  </li>
            <li>What I really loved about this polish is the sleek yet thick going on with no lumps unlike some polishes.</li>
            <li>Its recive on time and beautiful but some colors like green and blue one more darker than picture and green its not neon at all</li>
            <li>Im excited to try the polish later on..</li>
            <li>They are ok, but not nearly as pretty colors in person.</li>
            <li>Several are dupes for high-price brands, some completely original.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you let the first coat dry before applying your second coat!</li>
            <li>Colors are a bit extreme but several are real pretty, if the odor wasn&#x27;t so freakin strong I would have kept it.</li>
            <li>I received 12 different colours as well as the earrings (they are kind of bubblegum pink.)</li>
            <li>and that was the main reason I got them</li>
            <li>The colors are very vivid, but some do stain your nails.</li>
            <li>Wow this came in the mail sooo fast..</li>
            <li>it is more of a frog green</li>
            <li>Beautiful colors, except blue, purple, and green were much darker than expected.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would try and save some money while adding some new, funky colors to my polish collection.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty, but the polish itself is total junk.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s 5 yrs old!  </li>
            <li>They last very well.</li>
            <li>I was given 4 different shades of orange, which happens to be my least favorite color.</li>
            <li>when it arrived it&#x27;s just a plain green like the green color in a crayon box which was kind of disappointing, but they still look very pretty good.</li>
            <li>It takes FOREVER to dry and even with a nice (OPI) base and top coat</li>
            <li>: these are all on bare nails.</li>
            <li>It was very well packaged and even combined with my other order of cleancolor polishes</li>
            <li>Got a few colors that aren&#x27;t as shown but they&#x27;re still pretty nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the picture like the first reviewer said the green is not neon at all</li>
            <li>so when I use this I use it at night when I&#x27;m just sitting down with nothing to do and then tell my kids be ready I&#x27;m doing my nails</li>
            <li>I love the colors but it is a little too thick and polish comes off after a day</li>
            <li>the nail polishes are not that bad nor good either .</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I recommend this brand to anyone who is looking for cheap quality unique nail polish.</li>
            <li> i will surely order some more next time :)</li>
            <li> I really love all the bright colors but the picture is kind of deceiving because some of the colors that are shown are not as bright, there more basic colors, like for instance the green in the  photo,(which was the main reason I really wanted</li>
            <li> I have really become a huge fan of these nailpolishes!</li>
            <li> are all bright enough to see.</li>
            <li> A coat or two of bright white under two coats of neon makes them POP!  </li>
            <li> It was a present for my daughter and both of us loved the colors.</li>
            <li> They are going to love them as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Her main interest is anime and sleep :)  </li>
            <li> And the shipping was very fast too!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I order this on Friday received it on Tuesday and Monday was holiday fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> These are so pretty!</li>
            <li> it dries pretty quick also so if your rushing no need to wait</li>
            <li> The colors are so bright, vibrant, and they really glow with black light!</li>
            <li> Product arrived early and they were full sized bottles!</li>
            <li> So far I have used only two of the colors, but I am liking the bright colors.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast and was at my door a week before the estimated date.</li>
            <li> I said they are very pretty colors and for the price I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I thought it was so pretty)</li>
            <li> I received all 12 colors and was exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> They were blue which is my favorite color.</li>
            <li> I actually got the free earrings also!</li>
            <li> I got exactly the colors that were advertised.</li>
            <li> And the free earings i received were completely bent and unwearable.  </li>
            <li> neon fuschia (looks more red in the picture)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the entire collection and the quality of the polish along with the price.</li>
            <li> It stay on, pretty colors.</li>
            <li> The colors are so pretty</li>
            <li> Love love lovvvvveeee these color, I order them and got them early than expected!</li>
            <li> Love all the colors and it stays on a long time.</li>
            <li> but they are all so pretty and very opique</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, but some of the fingernail Polish wasn&#x27;t even neon, &amp; the neon green was what I wanted most, &amp;</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and so pretty..</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: This polish chips incredibly fast, I&#x27;m talking within hours after painting your nails.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and only takes 2 coats.</li>
            <li> It dries too fast</li>
            <li> Also polish is very think</li>
            <li> Spring colors, very shinny.  </li>
            <li> What I really loved about this polish is the sleek yet thick going on with no lumps unlike some polishes.</li>
            <li> Its recive on time and beautiful but some colors like green and blue one more darker than picture and green its not neon at all</li>
            <li> Im excited to try the polish later on..</li>
            <li> They are ok, but not nearly as pretty colors in person.</li>
            <li> Several are dupes for high-price brands, some completely original.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you let the first coat dry before applying your second coat!</li>
            <li> Colors are a bit extreme but several are real pretty, if the odor wasn&#x27;t so freakin strong I would have kept it.</li>
            <li> I received 12 different colours as well as the earrings (they are kind of bubblegum pink.)</li>
            <li> and that was the main reason I got them</li>
            <li> The colors are very vivid, but some do stain your nails.</li>
            <li> Wow this came in the mail sooo fast..</li>
            <li> it is more of a frog green</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, except blue, purple, and green were much darker than expected.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would try and save some money while adding some new, funky colors to my polish collection.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty, but the polish itself is total junk.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s 5 yrs old!  </li>
            <li> They last very well.</li>
            <li> I was given 4 different shades of orange, which happens to be my least favorite color.</li>
            <li> when it arrived it&#x27;s just a plain green like the green color in a crayon box which was kind of disappointing, but they still look very pretty good.</li>
            <li> It takes FOREVER to dry and even with a nice (OPI) base and top coat</li>
            <li> : these are all on bare nails.</li>
            <li> It was very well packaged and even combined with my other order of cleancolor polishes</li>
            <li> Got a few colors that aren&#x27;t as shown but they&#x27;re still pretty nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the picture like the first reviewer said the green is not neon at all</li>
            <li> so when I use this I use it at night when I&#x27;m just sitting down with nothing to do and then tell my kids be ready I&#x27;m doing my nails</li>
            <li> I love the colors but it is a little too thick and polish comes off after a day</li>
            <li> the nail polishes are not that bad nor good either .</li>
            <li> Also as i have seen from other reviews the green is more of a forest-y type green rather then a neon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other reviews on this brand saying that the polish stained the ladies natural nails after the polish was taken off.</li>
            <li> These neons are actually very neon (I&#x27;ve had issues with other brand&#x27;s neons being the same as their other colours.)</li>
            <li> I do have to apply at least two coats (normal) and sometime three because the first two coats are sometime a little streaky, but only sometimes.  </li>
            <li> Only one problem was the Mandarin color bottle cover was loose and the content spilled out.</li>
            <li> I also only received one purple and instead of the other purple color, I have a Navy blue.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get them, only to find the green is not nearly as bright as the picture.</li>
            <li> Delivery was earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> But for the lighter colors I would recommend using a white base to make the color pop out even more!</li>
            <li> Nail polish came in earlier than expectedly!</li>
            <li> They take two coats for opacity, other than Neon Yellow and Neon Lime, which take three(note</li>
            <li> everything I need unroll my nails are dry.</li>
            <li> , it chips almost as soon as it does dry.</li>
            <li> One last thing to note is that none of these colours have any sparkle except the Neon Purple which has a slight purple and teal sparkle to it.</li>
            <li> I mixed it up which did help slightly, but then it just would coagulate at the tip of the nail during application.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors are a little different then</li>
            <li> Got a neon pink and a matte fashion district..not neon.</li>
            <li> pink lady</li>
            <li> The blue is a neon Aqua, and not really a bright neon blue.</li>
            <li> some other reviewers say.</li>
            <li> I watched the reviews to see what other people were saying</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly what I expected!  </li>
            <li> The neon green is very dark, definitely not neon.</li>
            <li> I got 2 of the same neon purples, not bright at all.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more like the color of a green frog, pretty disappointed :((</li>
            <li> not happy at all 2 of the same color  </li>
            <li> but it dried up on the lid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;#17 neon green (the frog green)&lt;br</li>
            <li> They shipped fast and they were neatly packaged in boxes (Ensuring i received zero broken bottles!!)</li>
            <li> It goes on really thick and unevenly.</li>
            <li> Imagine my dismay when I get ready to apply a color (Neon Lime was the name) only to find out it is terribly stringy, sticky, and unusable.</li>
            <li> only thing that I hate is it takes forever to dry</li>
            <li> She is at the age where it is hard to know what to give when gift giving time comes around.  </li>
            <li> Dries slow and you have to do a couple of coats--as reported by daughter.</li>
            <li> Plus its thick and goopy like</li>
            <li> This nail polish is thick.</li>
            <li> It was just the one color that was thick</li>
            <li> Not good quality.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S  not  really good.</li>
            <li> Had two colours that are so thick that I&#x27;m unable to use.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in these.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately something leaked onto the packaging.</li>
            <li> If you dont mind getting random colors</li>
            <li> I, however, have never had that problem even if I fail to put a base coat on.</li>
            <li> Horribly disappointing!</li>
            <li> To prevent this, try using a base coat before you put it on.</li>
            <li> Disappointing!!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand before and it works great I really love all the bright colors but the picture is kind of deceiving because some of the colors that are shown are not as bright, there more basic colors, like for instance the green in the  photo,(which was the main reason I really wanted this cause I thought it was so pretty) when it arrived it&#x27;s just a plain green like the green color in a crayon box which was kind of disappointing, but they still look very pretty good.</li>

            <li> So far I have used only two of the colors, but I am liking the bright colors.  I do have to apply at least two coats (normal) and sometime three because the first two coats are sometime a little streaky, but only sometimes.

            <li> The colors were very cute but the nail polishes wasn&#x27;t really that full</li>
            <li> I received all 12 colors and was exactly as pictured. There was only one color that seemed like it leaked but it dried up on the lid. Also I did not receive the free earring as advertised but I didn&#x27;t care :)  the order came faster then I thought as well I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price. I bought them as favors for a bachelorette party.</li>
            <li> I order this on Friday received it on Tuesday and Monday was holiday fast shipping!! All the colors I received are as seen in the pictures also received the free earrings my daughter loves them also nail polish are all bright enough to see. I definitely would buy them again!!</li>
            <li> I love these colors and they came in excelent condition and the colors are true to the order</li>
            <li> Dries slow and you have to do a couple of coats--as reported by daughter. Shipping good.</li>
            <li> The item was as described. My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> For the price this is a good brand colors are beautiful but...... only thing that I hate is it takes forever to dry I&#x27;m talking an hour or two so when I use this I use it at night when I&#x27;m just sitting down with nothing to do and then tell my kids be ready I&#x27;m doing my nails they know that means they will be doing anything and everything I need unroll my nails are dry.</li>
            <li> Great for nail stamping. Love the earrings I got as well. They were blue which is my favorite color. And they are in both neon and regular colors.</li>
            <li> Nail polish came in earlier than expectedly! And all colors came as shown. I actually got the free earrings also! Goes on smoothly and only takes 2 coats. But for the lighter colors I would recommend using a white base to make the color pop out even more!</li>
            <li> Not good quality. Every time I use the polish it recedes back from the tip of my nail. It dries too fast so it&#x27;s not smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Love them all as pictured great quality will be again but I didn&#x27;t get the free earrings</li>
            <li> I really love all of these colors, this is a great collection.</li>
            <li> I gave these polishes a 3 star because they are not all neon, especially the ones I received. The blue is a neon Aqua, and not really a bright neon blue. I got 2 of the same neon purples, not bright at all. The neon green is very dark, definitely not neon. Got a neon yellow and neon lime. Got a neon pink and a matte fashion district..not neon. Got one neon orange,a darker orange,and a lighter orange color.&lt;br /&gt;Only 2 would I say is neon. But I do like the colors.</li>
            <li> I got exactly the colors that were advertised. Unfortunately something leaked onto the packaging. It was orange. And the free earings i received were completely bent and unwearable.  But I am happy with the colors!</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty, but the polish itself is total junk. It goes on really thick and unevenly. It takes FOREVER to dry and even with a nice (OPI) base and top coat, it chips almost as soon as it does dry.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them!</li>
            <li> I love the colors but it is a little too thick and polish comes off after a day</li>
            <li> Daughters love the bright colors</li>
            <li> The nail polish arrived on time and the colors were  bright and I&#x27;m happy about my purchase.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, but some of the fingernail Polish wasn&#x27;t even neon, &amp; the neon green was what I wanted most, &amp; it&#x27;s more like the color of a green frog, pretty disappointed :((</li>
            <li> Wow this came in the mail sooo fast..I placed an order on March 12th and the seller shipped it the next day and today Monday, March 16 i already received it..i love the colors, they are so bright. Only one problem was the Mandarin color bottle cover was loose and the content spilled out. Nevertheless all is perfect. Im excited to try the polish later on..i will surely order some more next time :)</li>
            <li> The colors are so bright, vibrant, and they really glow with black light! The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this product 5 stars is because I purchased these specifically for water marbling and they do not spread at all.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> Horribly disappointing! Colors are great, that is it! It chips off not in a couple of days its overnight!! Doesn&#x27;t even make 24 hours!!! Plus its thick and goopy like it&#x27;s 5 yrs old!  I will never buy this brand again! The cheapest polish at Walmart lasts longer!!!</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars. The colors are vibrant and so pretty.. Make sure you let the first coat dry before applying your second coat! Also polish is very think so be care when applying..</li>
            <li> I love bright nail polishes, and these colors are beautiful. I will recommend this set of polish to my friends . They are going to love them as much as I do. I  will shop with this seller again. Thank-you</li>
            <li> This brand always goes on well. These colors are bright and beautiful. They last very well. I&#x27;ve seen other reviews on this brand saying that the polish stained the ladies natural nails after the polish was taken off. I, however, have never had that problem even if I fail to put a base coat on. Wonderful summer color collection.</li>
            <li> I received 12 different colours as well as the earrings (they are kind of bubblegum pink.) These neons are actually very neon (I&#x27;ve had issues with other brand&#x27;s neons being the same as their other colours.) They take two coats for opacity, other than Neon Yellow and Neon Lime, which take three(note: these are all on bare nails. I haven&#x27;t tested on white.). (also to note, neon lime looks highlighter yellow, so don&#x27;t expect a lime colour.) One last thing to note is that none of these colours have any sparkle except the Neon Purple which has a slight purple and teal sparkle to it.</li>
            <li> They are ok, but not nearly as pretty colors in person. Some of the colors are not the bright neon like the pic.</li>
            <li> These are so pretty! And the shipping was very fast too! Some of the colors are a little different then the picture like the first reviewer said the green is not neon at all it is more of a frog green but they are all so pretty and very opique so one coat would probably do good. My favorite part is that they all stamp so well and that was the main reason I got them so that made me very happy! However when I purchased these I wanted to know the name of then colors so I will list them to help others out:&lt;br /&gt;#14 neon aqua&lt;br /&gt;#17 neon green (the frog green)&lt;br /&gt;#18 neon yellow&lt;br /&gt;#204 neon lime&lt;br /&gt;#21 neon fuschia (looks more red in the picture)&lt;br /&gt;#20 neon pink&lt;br /&gt;#126 pink lady&lt;br /&gt;#16 neon purple&lt;br /&gt;#253 grape burst&lt;br /&gt;#249 mandarin burst (lightest orange)&lt;br /&gt;#250 sangria burst (like a melon orange)&lt;br /&gt;#251 tangerine burst (darkest orange)&lt;br /&gt;Like I said they are very pretty colors and for the price I highly recommend them! Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> Love it. Love the colors.</li>
            <li> Had two colours that are so thick that I&#x27;m unable to use. 249 mandarins burst and 250 sangria. Disappointing!!</li>
            <li> Arrived unbroken and beautiful!</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, I will be buying from here again</li>
            <li> I thought I would try and save some money while adding some new, funky colors to my polish collection. Imagine my dismay when I get ready to apply a color (Neon Lime was the name) only to find out it is terribly stringy, sticky, and unusable. I mixed it up which did help slightly, but then it just would coagulate at the tip of the nail during application. Sigh. I suppose I&#x27;ll stick with higher end brands like OPI which have a great running track record with me!</li>
            <li> I bought this set to start off my collection for water marbling and i was absolutly blown away! The shipping was super fast and was at my door a week before the estimated date. It was very well packaged and even combined with my other order of cleancolor polishes so i got them all at the same time. I love the entire collection and the quality of the polish along with the price. The only downside was i was not given what was pictured as ive seen some other reviewers say. I was given 4 different shades of orange, which happens to be my least favorite color. Also as i have seen from other reviews the green is more of a forest-y type green rather then a neon. If you dont mind getting random colors then this is the perfect set for you but if you are looking for specific colors id suggest buying them separately.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is thick. Why ???  It seem to be petty good. It stay on, pretty colors. It was just the one color that was thick but I did put some thinner in it . It is ok now.And it does chip the next day.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my niece.  She is at the age where it is hard to know what to give when gift giving time comes around.  Her main interest is anime and sleep :)  But she does love neon colors- makeup and painting her nails.  When I seen this set, I put it on my wish list and debated.  I watched the reviews to see what other people were saying and I seen most people were impressed.  She was very happy with them and I think I made the perfect choice.  Now I want a set for myself!</li>
            <li> Colors are a bit extreme but several are real pretty, if the odor wasn&#x27;t so freakin strong I would have kept it. I gave it away</li>
            <li> i really loved the colors</li>
            <li> Amazing nail polish for a great price!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love all the colors. They go on smoothly and very easy to take off. I will mis and match these with the Kleancolor Nail Polish HOLO SET! Look great together.</li>
            <li> Great Product, the item was way better that expected specially the quality.</li>
            <li> These colors are vivid and beautiful.  Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, except blue, purple, and green were much darker than expected.  I realize color varies from monitor to monitor but I checked on three different monitors and the same situation existed.  Great if you&#x27;re. Or looking for a specific color.  Very nice variety.</li>
            <li> Un excelente Regalo para tu novia... Es algo asi como un dulce a un ni&amp;ntilde;o Aajaja</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!  Searching for some NICE nail polish, good colors.  This is it!  Spring colors, very shinny.  This is a good brand and gives you quality and nice product.  I would recommend and buy more from this seller.</li>
            <li> I have really become a huge fan of these nailpolishes! I just with they wouldn&#x27;t chip so easily. The colors are very vivid, but some do stain your nails. To prevent this, try using a base coat before you put it on.</li>
            <li> Ah the colors! Wish it had more blues greens</li>
            <li> 100% happy!  I&#x27;m now using in my salon.  A coat or two of bright white under two coats of neon makes them POP!  Love it</li>
            <li> They were great colors</li>
            <li> I always have a great experience with kleancolor nail polish. So for I have 2 sets and one on the way. The colors are so pretty and I love the boxes they come in. The nail polish works great and always comes early. I recommend this brand to anyone who is looking for cheap quality unique nail polish.</li>

            <li> This is a great buy and has about every neon color you would ever want.  Several are dupes for high-price brands, some completely original.  I&#x27;m going to start wearing them even if it isn&#x27;t spring yet!</li>

            <li> IT&#x27;S  not  really good.</li>
            <li> As always, Kleancolor delivers spectacular products!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in these. I was excited to get them, only to find the green is not nearly as bright as the picture. I also did not get a neon yellow, instead I have a red color not pictured. I also only received one purple and instead of the other purple color, I have a Navy blue. Otherwise,  the colors are very bright, and very pretty!</li>
            <li> These colors are MAGNIFICENT!!!!!!! I did not get any doubles so that&#x27;s great too!</li>
