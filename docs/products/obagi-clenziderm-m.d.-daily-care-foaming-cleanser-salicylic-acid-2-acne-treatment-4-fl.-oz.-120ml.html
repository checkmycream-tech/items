            <li>I love the feel of this product on my face!</li>
            <li>Huge cysts everywhere that I haven&#x27;t experienced since pre-Accutane.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh(no flaky skin), but it is soo effective for acne, or acne prone skin...</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buck!!!</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m able to save 20$ a bottle, and have my skin looking Fantastic!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best acne wash I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>I have a bit of Adult acne, and this product works to keep me looking GREAT!</li>
            <li>I have run out now, just ordered some more &amp; my skin is already broke out again.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t entirely sure it was the face wash that was doing all the work, after all I was now washing my face 2-3 times a day -</li>
            <li>I love that this cleanser removes my makeup as well as cleanses my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use a reputable Salicylic Acid soap with my Clarisonic, and after researching the internet I decided on this Obagi cleanser.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a couple months now and love it.</li>
            <li>and it has a refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>and I really love it so</li>
            <li>I really feel like this product does a great job of preventing and controlling acne even when it does appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have dryer skin than most, I might suggest using it once a day or decreasing if the dryness persists.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I ran across this product for my face.  </li>
            <li>i love obaji and this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried sooooooo many products.  </li>
            <li>I got so confident about it that i switched to their Nuderm line and immediately started breaking out again.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, had my face cleared up from continuous breakouts within 3-4 days and has continued to keep my face looking much better.</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy more of this stuff!!</li>
            <li>I appreciate the feel and scent of Obagi; the use of menthol is pleasant, but for my acne-prone super sensitive skin, this just isn&#x27;t a great product for me.</li>
            <li>A beautiful, manageable and clear face is what you will gain!</li>
            <li>Well worth using this cleanser, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>This product is so good, you will have clear skin very quickly!</li>
            <li>It cleared up quickly and I&#x27;ve been left with great looking skin for weeks now!</li>
            <li>I strongly believe that it is the percentage of salicylic acid in the product that works so well.</li>
            <li>It feels so cool and refreshing on your face.  </li>
            <li>Always nice to get exactly what you order on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s necessary for me to use both the cleanser and the toner for best consistent results.</li>
            <li>My skin has never gone this long looking SO GOOD!</li>
            <li>and I am a huge fan of that in comparison.</li>
            <li>so if you are reading this and have any questions feel free to ask.</li>
            <li>WITH THE RESULTS!!!ALSO IT SHIPS FAST!!!</li>
            <li>and she said that she didn&#x27;t think it would work, but after that she felt fresh and perky!</li>
            <li>The only thing I would have liked more is if it had helped with my oily skin.  </li>
            <li>My acne is special in the fact that it doesn&#x27;t discriminate and pops up anywhere and everywhere.</li>
            <li>Depends on how much acne you have, I think a SA cleanser in the gel form works better for me.</li>
            <li>Love the results of this combined with clenziderm purple toner followed by 5% bpo lotion (I have very oily skin).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own although, I can&#x27;t imagine using the other two steps would cause any harm :)</li>
            <li>and this is the first thing that has worked!</li>
            <li>but just not cutting it anymore</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  now 25, and thanks to Obagi, have rare occurrences of pimple outbreaks!</li>
            <li>Tip: Since this purchase was right after Christmas</li>
            <li>(a good sign of an effective cleanser) and had only a small amount.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>husband can&#x27;t stop giving me compliments on how much better my overall skin is.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>and so when I was searching for a new cleanser ad my old one (Aveeno Clear Complexion Cleansing Bar) was okay</li>
            <li>This product was kind of expesive for this little bottle...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had pimples consistently since high school.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading so many positive reviews here and in other places as well.</li>
            <li>Tried the whole Clenziderm system.</li>
            <li>I have tried Proactive because it&#x27;s generally much cheaper then SA products, but benzyl peroxide promotes a lot of redness on my face.</li>
            <li>This foaming stuff makes it very convenience to use</li>
            <li>but I still have very oily skin even after using this product for months.  </li>
            <li>Gentle, thorough cleanser.  </li>
            <li>today, my sister woke up feeling really grss but had no time to shower</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how well it really works..  </li>
            <li>you really DON&#x27;T need to use a lot, I&#x27;m talking pea size for your whole face.</li>
            <li>Because of the salicylic acid, you really don&#x27;t need to over do it.</li>
            <li>think this is a real quality</li>
            <li>It seems to work really well all on</li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and was so excited to find a face cleanser that actually cleans!The</li>
            <li>The process is quick and gentle enough on my face.</li>
            <li>the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because of the scent but will definitely buy this again :)</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is normal to oily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for a few years now I just love it</li>
            <li>my face is so clear!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased a second bottle because I don&#x27;t want to be without when my first one is used up.</li>
            <li>After using for a week my face was almost completely clear.</li>
            <li>It removes dead skin and makes the skin smooth and helps clear up blemishes.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and have frequent acne breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin along with cystic acne.</li>
            <li>That being said I ended up purchasing the hydro-cleanser for sensitive skin by Clarisonic</li>
            <li>and so far it&#x27;s a winner!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as if my natural oils have been balanced.</li>
            <li>My acne is interesting since I don&#x27;t usually breakout by means of a rash of zits in a specific area on my face.</li>
            <li>I recently stopped taking birth control and my face turned into that of a 13 year old!!</li>
            <li>I am 43 years old and starting to experience adult acne.  </li>
            <li>I would still give it a shot though as I (and others apparently!)</li>
            <li>Only thing that keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>Not only does it keep me clear,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very drying &amp; irritating, BUT just the cleanser alone &amp; the tonor when you&#x27;re feeling super oily, keeps acne at bay.</li>
            <li>It does not dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li>It has cleared up my skin significantly and I only have small blemishes if any!  </li>
            <li>My acne is limited only to my face and always stays for an excessively long time and leaves behind some nice hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li>It keeps my face looking clear and doesnt seem to dry it out like  proactive does!</li>
            <li>Although I would say that in the beginning I puchased only the Daily Care Cleanser (#1) and nothing else... which does not clear up the acne as fast as using the cleanser with the other steps (#2 &amp; #3).</li>

            <li> and so far it&#x27;s a winner!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if my natural oils have been balanced.</li>
            <li> My acne is interesting since I don&#x27;t usually breakout by means of a rash of zits in a specific area on my face.</li>
            <li> I recently stopped taking birth control and my face turned into that of a 13 year old!!</li>
            <li> I am 43 years old and starting to experience adult acne.  </li>
            <li> I would still give it a shot though as I (and others apparently!)</li>
            <li> Only thing that keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> Not only does it keep me clear,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very drying &amp; irritating, BUT just the cleanser alone &amp; the tonor when you&#x27;re feeling super oily, keeps acne at bay.</li>
            <li> It does not dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li> It has cleared up my skin significantly and I only have small blemishes if any!  </li>
            <li> My acne is limited only to my face and always stays for an excessively long time and leaves behind some nice hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li> It keeps my face looking clear and doesnt seem to dry it out like  proactive does!</li>
            <li> Although I would say that in the beginning I puchased only the Daily Care Cleanser (#1) and nothing else... which does not clear up the acne as fast as using the cleanser with the other steps (#2 &amp; #3).</li>
            <li> Definitely wet your face first before applying or it may sting a little.</li>
            <li> I only use step one, because 2 and 3 dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced such quick results from anything other than obagi CLENZIderm.</li>
            <li> should add that I only use this cleanser and do not use the other two steps in the system.</li>
            <li> will warn you that it might INITIALLY dry out your face a bit.</li>
            <li> ALL THE ONES ON TV,I HAVE SPENT HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS AND EVEN WENT ON</li>
            <li> I use this stuff, and 2 (green) and 3 (blue)</li>
            <li> Just wet your face liberally and apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In six months I&#x27;ve spent $1200 going to the spa and having facials, extractions, chemical peels, laser treatments, microdermabrasion and the combination of all of those donâ€™t compare to the combination of 1.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way and it works so well.</li>
            <li> I then tried the soap without the Clarisonic and started using the Clarisonic every other day.</li>
            <li> I noticed the days I used the Obagi soap my skin was still extremely irritated and continued to keep breaking out.</li>
            <li> There is no more dirt on my white towel.  </li>
            <li> use the product twice a day, day and night, and A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!</li>
            <li> I have tried other face washes with the other two steps</li>
            <li> Try the other products that go with this</li>
            <li> it a try and stick with it for at least 1 month of daily use before your skin can get used to it.</li>
            <li> I thought it would go away in while once I have less acne</li>
            <li> Now I have one step less</li>
            <li> cleanser slightly tingles as it cleans</li>
            <li> I typically breakout during my time of the month, about a week or so before</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to begin my review by telling you a little about my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23 (female) and definitely tired of the breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Day 2 of not using it and using just a regular face wash and the acne is starting to rear its ugly head again.   </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste it!</li>
            <li> My sister introduced this to me a couple years back, and I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> I just wish this was an Amazon Prime item, it takes at least a week to receive.</li>
            <li> but I will say that I&#x27;ve noticed that when I do (especially for those dreaded &#x27;under the skin&#x27; monsters) the spots are small and just...not so bad.</li>
            <li> its just having to remember EACH night to was my face with steps 1, 2, &amp; 3... no matter how tired or late it is.</li>
            <li> I dropped down to once a day with the Clarisonic, and broke out like crazy.</li>
            <li> The breakouts I was having were worse than I had even when I was a teenager</li>
            <li> It did not make it worse</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out using the Obagi cleanser twice a day with the Clarisonic and that was extremely irritating.</li>
            <li> i have a weird reaction to benzoyl peroxide which made my acne problem worse</li>
            <li> I have had troubled skin for years...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this product for some time and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Only thing that keeps my skin clear. I bought on a suggestion from my mother-in-law. Tried the whole Clenziderm system. It&#x27;s very drying &amp; irritating, BUT just the cleanser alone &amp; the tonor when you&#x27;re feeling super oily, keeps acne at bay. I have run out now, just ordered some more &amp; my skin is already broke out again. OBAGI, you can&#x27;t come soon enough!!!</li>
            <li> I STARTED BREAKING OUT JUST ABOUT 4 YRS AGO (IAM 27 AND NEVER HAD ACNE BEFORE EVEN ON MY TEEN YEARS)I HAVE USED EVERY PRODUCT OUT THERE,ALL THE ONES ON TV,I HAVE SPENT HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS AND EVEN WENT ON THE PILL THINKING IT COULD BE A HORMONAL ISSUE.WELL LOOK NO MORE!!!I FOUND IT,I SAW AN IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENT ON MY COMPLEXION MY BLEMISHES ARE BEARLY VISIBLE,I HAVE GOTTEN COMPLIMENTS FROM MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS.IAM VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS!!!ALSO IT SHIPS FAST!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after all of the positive reviews. I recently stopped taking birth control and my face turned into that of a 13 year old!! The breakouts I was having were worse than I had even when I was a teenager so I was desperate for anything to help. After using for a week my face was almost completely clear. I used twice a day as directed and followed with Clinique&#x27;s daily moisturizer which I had on hand. At night I would moisturize after using this with the Ole Henricksen Night Serum.   I wasn&#x27;t entirely sure it was the face wash that was doing all the work, after all I was now washing my face 2-3 times a day - that was until I forgot it at my family&#x27;s house after traveling over the weekend. Day 2 of not using it and using just a regular face wash and the acne is starting to rear its ugly head again.   It&#x27;s the best acne wash I&#x27;ve found so far. It has a very pleasant smell, and leaves your face tingling. Definitely wet your face first before applying or it may sting a little. I&#x27;ll be ordering this from Amazon again as it&#x27;s WAY cheaper here! Best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and have frequent acne breakouts. I have tried Proactive because it&#x27;s generally much cheaper then SA products, but benzyl peroxide promotes a lot of redness on my face. I thought it would go away in while once I have less acne but it did not, so I tried this SA foaming cleanser. I gotta say, this foaming cleanser does help my face reduce a lot of redness. However, I feel that my acne breakouts remains about the same. This foaming stuff makes it very convenience to use but it seems as if SA does not get on my skin like a it would in a cleanser in the gel form. With this price, I would rather use neutrogena face wash next time. Depends on how much acne you have, I think a SA cleanser in the gel form works better for me.</li>
            <li> Finally found something that helps, after years of trying prescriptions and everything else under the sun.  So glad I tried this one!</li>
            <li> This is the greastest cleanser I have found since I have have blemish issues.  Mine cleared up almost immediately after beginning the use of this product.  I do not use it daily because it can be drying but it is a great product.  It is also great when combined with the tonic.</li>
            <li> I love that this cleanser removes my makeup as well as cleanses my skin.  I used to use proactive and had to wash my face (to remove my make up) before I washed my face.  Now I have one step less and it is a great refreshing cleanser.  The only thing I would have liked more is if it had helped with my oily skin.  It did not make it worse but I still have very oily skin even after using this product for months.  It has cleared up my skin significantly and I only have small blemishes if any!  Over all an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product. It has helped my skin a lot, I use it along with Step 2 - Pore Therapy. Using these 2 products together will produce GREAT results. I have had troubled skin for years...and this is the first thing that has worked!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for acne prone skin.  I am 43 years old and starting to experience adult acne.  Gentle, thorough cleanser.  I use it with my clarisonic.  It does not dry my skin out.  I would definately recommend this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to begin my review by telling you a little about my skin. I&#x27;ve struggled with acne since the 3rd grade...yes 3rd. I have extremely sensitive skin along with cystic acne. My acne is interesting since I don&#x27;t usually breakout by means of a rash of zits in a specific area on my face. My acne is special in the fact that it doesn&#x27;t discriminate and pops up anywhere and everywhere. My acne is limited only to my face and always stays for an excessively long time and leaves behind some nice hyper-pigmentation. That being said I have tried almost anything and everything on the market(including accutane) so if you are reading this and have any questions feel free to ask. After finishing my accutane treatment I started to breakout again about 6 months after. I had heard great things about the Clarisonic Mia so I purchased that. I wanted to use a reputable Salicylic Acid soap with my Clarisonic, and after researching the internet I decided on this Obagi cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out using the Obagi cleanser twice a day with the Clarisonic and that was extremely irritating. I dropped down to once a day with the Clarisonic, and broke out like crazy. Huge cysts everywhere that I haven&#x27;t experienced since pre-Accutane. I then tried the soap without the Clarisonic and started using the Clarisonic every other day. I noticed the days I used the Obagi soap my skin was still extremely irritated and continued to keep breaking out. That being said I ended up purchasing the hydro-cleanser for sensitive skin by Clarisonic and I am a huge fan of that in comparison. I appreciate the feel and scent of Obagi; the use of menthol is pleasant, but for my acne-prone super sensitive skin, this just isn&#x27;t a great product for me.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff, and 2 (green) and 3 (blue) and my skin is AMAZING! today, my sister woke up feeling really grss but had no time to shower and i told her to use this stuff and she said that she didn&#x27;t think it would work, but after that she felt fresh and perky!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple months now and love it. Nothing else worked as well (Proactive, SkinID, Murad).</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve heard of this brand for a while now but never tried their products until recently. its a great product and i use this with the pore therapy. i have a weird reaction to benzoyl peroxide which made my acne problem worse but this one cleared it out. the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because of the scent but will definitely buy this again :)</li>
            <li> My brother and I both use Obagi CLENIderm and we both agree that this has got to be the best acne product we&#x27;ve ever used. It feels so cool and refreshing on your face.  I have never experienced such quick results from anything other than obagi CLENZIderm. I will certainly buy more of this stuff!! Definitely worth the buck!!!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and was so excited to find a face cleanser that actually cleans!The cleanser slightly tingles as it cleans and it has a refreshing scent. There is no more dirt on my white towel.  I will continue to use this product. I just wish this was an Amazon Prime item, it takes at least a week to receive.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that \\&quot;feels like it&#x27;s working\\&quot; because it contains menthol.  I don&#x27;t know how well it really works..  I would not buy it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and I really love it so far!&lt;br /&gt;My skin has always been combination with breakouts in the dreaded T zone. I&#x27;m 23 (female) and definitely tired of the breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that my skin reacts quite well to cleaners with salicylic acid in them and so when I was searching for a new cleanser ad my old one (Aveeno Clear Complexion Cleansing Bar) was okay but just not cutting it anymore so I googled for best face cleaners with salicylic acid and this popped up! The reviews are consistently good so I decided to give it a shot and so far it&#x27;s a winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting a bit of a purge in my skin as soon as I started using it (a good sign of an effective cleanser) and had only a small amount. It cleared up quickly and I&#x27;ve been left with great looking skin for weeks now! I still get the occasional spot here and there but I will say that I&#x27;ve noticed that when I do (especially for those dreaded &#x27;under the skin&#x27; monsters) the spots are small and just...not so bad. I really feel like this product does a great job of preventing and controlling acne even when it does appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the product twice a day, day and night, and A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY! you really DON&#x27;T need to use a lot, I&#x27;m talking pea size for your whole face. Don&#x27;t waste it! It lathers quite well and goes all over. Because of the salicylic acid, you really don&#x27;t need to over do it. Just wet your face liberally and apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will warn you that it might INITIALLY dry out your face a bit. Your skin should get used to it and, of course, the severity of the dryness will depend on your skin type. If you have dryer skin than most, I might suggest using it once a day or decreasing if the dryness persists. I would still give it a shot though as I (and others apparently!) think this is a real quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that I only use this cleanser and do not use the other two steps in the system. It seems to work really well all on it&#x27;s own although, I can&#x27;t imagine using the other two steps would cause any harm :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: May, 10th&lt;br /&gt;I am convinced that I&#x27;ve found the holy grail of acne cleansers for my skin! I&#x27;ve purchased a second bottle because I don&#x27;t want to be without when my first one is used up. My skin has never gone this long looking SO GOOD! I&#x27;ve been getting compliments and asked what it is that I use. I typically breakout during my time of the month, about a week or so before and I was prepared for this month but...nothing! I strongly believe that it is the percentage of salicylic acid in the product that works so well. I still use it twice a day, but if I ever skip one of the applications it doesn&#x27;t matter. My skin has also fully acclimated itself to the product and I guess it&#x27;s Ph balance has evened out because I don&#x27;t have to slather on lotion on my face anymore....sometimes non at all. It&#x27;s as if my natural oils have been balanced. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the cleanser my Facialist uses on me, and the product I&#x27;ve bought from her... Now I&#x27;m able to save 20$ a bottle, and have my skin looking Fantastic!! This product is so good, you will have clear skin very quickly! It&#x27;s not harsh(no flaky skin), but it is soo effective for acne, or acne prone skin... I have a bit of Adult acne, and this product works to keep me looking GREAT! Well worth using this cleanser, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It keeps my face looking clear and doesnt seem to dry it out like  proactive does! I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Obagi 3-step acne program works miracles. Plain and simple. Was Purchasing through a plastic surgeons office prior to purchasing from 123Medical and was paying nearly double. I&#x27;ve had pimples consistently since high school. I&#x27;m  now 25, and thanks to Obagi, have rare occurrences of pimple outbreaks!</li>
            <li> My sister introduced this to me a couple years back, and I was skeptical.  I tried it, and I think I have had maybe one blemish since then.  My skin is normal to oily.  I only use step one, because 2 and 3 dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> The number one cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used for my acne prone skin.  I couldn&#x27;t be without this product.  Not only does it keep me clear, my skin is brighter and radiant.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  We purchase this all the time.  I am so glad that I ran across this product for my face.  It removes dead skin and makes the skin smooth and helps clear up blemishes.</li>
            <li> i love obaji and this product. shipped fast. a little goes a long way and it works so well. i wouldnt ever switch.</li>
            <li> Great deal on this item! Arrived on time and was exactly as advertised. Always nice to get exactly what you order on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for a few years now I just love it,it&#x27;s the only thing I use!</li>
            <li> Love the results of this combined with clenziderm purple toner followed by 5% bpo lotion (I have very oily skin). This face wash truly opens everything up to let the rest penetrate. I have tried other face washes with the other two steps but none come close to results I get using all three products together.</li>
            <li> Couldnâ€™t ask for anything better! - I have had problems with breakouts and blackheads since my teen years. I&#x27;m 26 now. In six months I&#x27;ve spent $1200 going to the spa and having facials, extractions, chemical peels, laser treatments, microdermabrasion and the combination of all of those donâ€™t compare to the combination of 1. Daily Care Foaming Cleanser Salicylic Acid 2. Pore Therapy 3. Therapeutic Lotion by Obagi CLENZiderm M.D. - I&#x27;ve also tried ProActive but it irritated my skin and it seemed as if it stopped working after a while. Also, the 3rd step of Obagi contains  5% benzoyl peroxide (BPO)  vs ProActive 3rd step  2.5%. â€“ Iâ€™ll let you be the judge. -&lt;br /&gt;My husband can&#x27;t stop giving me compliments on how much better my overall skin is. I&#x27;ve been also getting compliments from my close friends and they&#x27;ve asked me what is it that I&#x27;m using b/c my face is so clear! I do use all three steps at night. Morning I use 1&amp;2 plus Obagi AM 50SPF moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try and stick with it for at least 1 month of daily use before your skin can get used to it. You might experience some burning feeling but it will go away and after continual use.&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried sooooooo many products.  I&#x27;ve one of those people you may call a product whore.  This is the only face wash and toner that has stopped me from breaking out.  I got so confident about it that i switched to their Nuderm line and immediately started breaking out again.  I&#x27;m back to this.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be trying anything else again. Lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note- it&#x27;s necessary for me to use both the cleanser and the toner for best consistent results.</li>
            <li> Best product out there.  Would not use anything else for my daughter&#x27;s acne!  Better then all others!  Great service also!</li>
            <li> This product was kind of expesive for this little bottle...but it has truly helped out my acne. Although I would say that in the beginning I puchased only the Daily Care Cleanser (#1) and nothing else... which does not clear up the acne as fast as using the cleanser with the other steps (#2 &amp; #3). Tip: Since this purchase was right after Christmas and I couldnt pay a lot for steps 2 &amp; 3... I bought the equate brand of proactive steps 2 &amp; 3 along with a spinning facial brush cleanser .... and now I&#x27;m all clear.&lt;br /&gt;Now its just having to remember EACH night to was my face with steps 1, 2, &amp; 3... no matter how tired or late it is.</li>
            <li> Love this product, had my face cleared up from continuous breakouts within 3-4 days and has continued to keep my face looking much better. I love the feel of this product on my face! Would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> best product on the market, my daughter has the best skin now that she uses this.  Try the other products that go with this</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading so many positive reviews here and in other places as well. The process is quick and gentle enough on my face. It works quite good, give it a chance along with the Pore Therapy too. What do you have to lose? money? that comes and goes. A beautiful, manageable and clear face is what you will gain!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the service I received.  My product shipped within a couple of days from ordering and when i received the product it was sealed and had not expired. I will order more products!!!! very satisfied !!!</li>
