            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This is one great product.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great way to get you hooked.</li>
            <li>However, my curiosity was piqued when I saw the great reviews for the Miracle Hand Repair Cream.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is a miracle and it feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li>(BTW - The foot cream is equally great stuff.)</li>
            <li>Then I tried this cream after a read a lol rave review about it on a skincare blog.   </li>
            <li>No scents, so great for men as well as women.</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>The best product of it&#x27;s kind on the market.</li>
            <li>and Great Price</li>
            <li>But it is equally great on arms, legs and even feet.</li>
            <li>and it works great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>This product has found a great use for this ingredient.</li>
            <li>Great Seller+Fast Shipping+Great Communication.</li>
            <li>This product is great for me too.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>It was a great price as well.</li>
            <li>It just makes me think &#x27;hospital&#x27; when I&#x27;m not there, which isn&#x27;t a good thing, for me.  </li>
            <li>and she loved the feel of her hands and arms afterwards.</li>
            <li>scaly hands are in good condition now</li>
            <li>good item.good</li>
            <li>Good delivery.</li>
            <li>it is a good product for this price</li>
            <li>It is good on the hands too.</li>
            <li>Nothing works as good.  </li>
            <li>Good Stuff.</li>
            <li>But it is darn good cream.  </li>
            <li>So I am always on the prowl for good hand cream.  </li>
            <li>For me a good hand cream is one that moisturizes without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>Good buy for the price</li>
            <li>This is because I can never find one that does a good job but doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer</li>
            <li>, I find this effective at keeping my hands in good shape even when I&#x27;m not so good to my hands, and it additionally seems to be helping my burned fingers heal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, and I think I need another tube for upstairs, too.  </li>
            <li>very pleased wtih this product...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in the store anymore, so I looked it up online and was so happy to find it.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>however both my wife and I LOVE this hand cream!  </li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>this cream/lotion is NOT greasy and does everything it promises and more!</li>
            <li>Leaves on a nice thick-kind of feeling without the oily feel the hands that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>Even the men like to use it because the smell is not too feminine and it is really effective.</li>
            <li>I cannot say everyone will have the safe good fortune that I do with this stuff, but</li>
            <li>Pleasant, light scent, and</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice, but very light.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best hand cream I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is a superior product that leaves my hands and finger tips feeling smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have highly sensitive skin and allergies, and this product is awesome.</li>
            <li>Miracle hand repair dries very quickly and does not leave my hands greasy at all!</li>
            <li>The store was smart offering to let customers try a bit of the product for free, because it&#x27;s a wonderful product</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say that your split fingers will get healed,  But if what you want is a good skin softening hand cream, this is very good stuff.</li>
            <li>Nice creamy texture in an easy to use tube.</li>
            <li>which is probably better because buying the cream through Amazon was surely cheaper.  </li>
            <li>and I have tried many many creams.</li>
            <li>and they all love it.</li>
            <li>(truly fabulous!).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and I now refuse to buy pricy promises that don&#x27;t deliver!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I found this to be a safe product to use.  </li>
            <li>love this stuff-</li>
            <li>The sample product I tried was much better than the product I purchased.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream -</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for the price, non-greasy, very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I also love the foot cream they make.</li>
            <li>My fiancee and I love this hand cream.</li>
            <li>I love using this lotion from Fall to Spring.  </li>
            <li>If I can get to it, I may apply the cream 1-2 times a day at most.</li>
            <li>I have bought this cream before and really love it.  </li>
            <li>We are satisfied with the product :)</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>reason why am writing this review on Amazon is that I came in to check if I can buy more after running out of it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and just keep buying it</li>
            <li>Plus, keeps them healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Gave it to most of my friends.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, this lotion is ok.</li>
            <li>I still like the o&#x27;keeffe&#x27;s working hands much better as it stays in your hand</li>
            <li>I put it on everynight just before bed when my hands seem most thirsty.  </li>
            <li>Glad to have found more than a sample 1oz size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not awful.</li>
            <li>But it is way more pricier.</li>
            <li>No joke, a liberal amount before bed, and overnight better than 50% improvement.  </li>
            <li>Might be better to use with gloves to prevent leaving grease marks everywhere.</li>
            <li>My hands look and feel immediately better after just one application.</li>
            <li>LOVE this cream....</li>
            <li>I have tried many hand creams before this one, but they are either too oily or smelly.</li>
            <li>My favorite...</li>
            <li>I bought this for my grand son and he just loves it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Crabtree and Evelyn&#x27;s hand therapy is much much better.</li>
            <li>Very rich nourishing hand cream.  </li>
            <li>Hand cream very effective in moisturing extremely dry hands; absorbs well into skin leaving no noticeable residue; pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>Miracle Hand Repair is the best for dry hands.  </li>
            <li>This is without a doubt one of the best hand (or anywhere you have dry skin) creams I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Best hand cream for dry cracked hands.</li>
            <li>Look at the ingredients for most moisturizers and what&#x27;s the primary ingredient: water.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve never really gone on a mission for the perfect hand cream, I will say that for me this is as close as any</li>
            <li>Best hand cream for rough hands.</li>
            <li>However, for a temporary relief it works best among other creams.</li>
            <li>The bottle easily fits in my bag and does not leak when I take it with me.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>It has a strong &#x27;baby-powderish&#x27; scent, that smells</li>
            <li>This hand cream doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance smell but like the herb.</li>
            <li>I found the hydrating properties of the Miracle Cream to be average, at best, although it does absorb well and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>, I zap my hands with this stuff and they are good as new again.  </li>
            <li>So, keep in mind, this product may work splendidly for those who have not abused their hands to such an extreme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is very dry and this cream is very good for moisturizing my hands.  </li>
            <li>Within 24 hours (4-5 applications) my hands were smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>There is a light fragrance so it doesn&#x27;t make one have an overpowering scent.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the amazing product.  </li>
            <li>This stuff made my hands soft and gorgeous, which made me try using it on my face.  </li>
            <li>It feels like good penetrating moisture and it leaves my hands feeling soft, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Amazon sell this without tax or shipping cost, that&#x27;s a real bonus on top of finding such a great product.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it at Bed Bath and Beyond</li>
            <li>: the smell isn&#x27;t the most pleasant on your hands after use, but it hydrates very dry and/or calloused hands!</li>
            <li>Defiantly worth a try!</li>
            <li>Well, I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Well worth every cent!</li>
            <li>This is great for dry, chapped, cracked hands.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, and keeps my hands soft for the lady!</li>
            <li>Very light scent, very moisturizing and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because my family and I have always had a problem with dry skin on our hands and also eczema on our bodies and this product works Fantasticly!!!  </li>
            <li>What makes this one so special?</li>
            <li>Repair\\&quot; right now!</li>
            <li>i am a diabetic and have very dry feet and hands this works great for me.</li>
            <li>Unlike the brilliant foot cream, I did not initially think there was anything particularly miraculous about this.</li>
            <li>This is a much thicker cream than many I&#x27;ve used, and can be used on legs and knees as well.  </li>
            <li>Most hand lotions don&#x27;t seem to have much residual effect.  </li>
            <li>But if you are just using it for instant moisturizer, it work good</li>
            <li>I really love this foot cream but the hand cream has this smell to it that I really can&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li>It really does make them look and feel better.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to use other hand creams but this one is great and my whole family loves it.</li>
            <li>This lotion absorbs quick</li>
            <li>I cannot express enough how much I love this stuff, and the price, to me, is the cherry on top.  </li>
            <li>This product soaks into skin quickly.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>So if you poke a hole in the top to use normal...</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the product, the price could be a bit lower but it is quite a bit of lotion.</li>
            <li>the price is much better on Amazon) I cannot live without this- nor will I.  </li>
            <li>It is absorbed fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any signs of itself on paper or anything else.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more of this product!</li>
            <li>This is the only cream I use now and love it!  </li>
            <li>This product is exactly what it claims to be: a miracle!</li>
            <li>Very slightly scented of aloe (which is great, because not overpowering), absorbs quickly and shows results quickly.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not greasy and really makes hands smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no secret that aloe is simply fantastic for the skin, but who woulda thought for this purpose.  </li>
            <li>I love how it completely absorbs into the skin so my face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy either.  </li>
            <li>lotion is really worth a try.</li>
            <li>Most hand lotions leave my hands very greasy, while this product, in reasonable amounts, doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the money, and lasts a while.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product, ladies it seriously works, I bought one from Ross Yesterday, tried it at night and this morning as I woke up</li>
            <li>This one seems to be helpful, but not as good as some other products.</li>
            <li>And priced right.  </li>
            <li>Heals like Pure Aloe right out of the plant!  </li>
            <li>so I can use it right away when I need it.</li>
            <li>, I felt my hands are SUPER soft, fresh, clean.</li>
            <li>I also noticed there is salicylic acid in it too, but it doesn&#x27;t indicate how much since it isn&#x27;t near the top of the ingredient list.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had that experience with any other hand cream, so I&#x27;m very pleased and will continue to use this faithfully.</li>
            <li>Works very very well ....</li>
            <li>The fragrance is extremely pleasant and not overbearing and the texture is thick, but absorbs and quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li>so I figure I&#x27;m really getting my moneys worth out of the purchase.</li>
            <li>i have tried so many lotions and hand creams to help heal my hands from cracked skin that i thought nothing would actually work.</li>
            <li>It has been the only thing to keep my hand&#x27;s hydrated, with a healthy appearance.  </li>
            <li>First time I bought this was at a drugstore, I was working as a cook/dishwasher/barback, so my hands were cracked and bleeding.</li>
            <li>After a year of agony, it really was a miracle!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this hand cream, and after reading the reviews I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>Love this deep lotion!</li>
            <li>It is really a miracle!</li>
            <li>I tried so many different grocery and drug store products that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Only thing I have noticed is that my nails will grow faster the more I consistently use this stuff.</li>
            <li>Priced better than local stores.</li>
            <li>This cream does exactly that.  </li>
            <li>Its good cream and its cream that I don&#x27;t mind using several times a day because as I said it leaves my hands feeling soft and not greasy and for me that is very important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it every morning and before I go to bed, and my hands are always soft and smooth now.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, I thought I had truly found a miracle cream....</li>
            <li>working , and using the chemicals to clean, my hand crack all the time, and are very sensitive to cleaning products.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need at a time and it works Great and last a long time!!  </li>
            <li>won&#x27;t poke a hole in the lid, but seems strange to have a top that doesn&#x27;t click to lock.</li>
            <li>If you rub it into your hands most nights before you go to bed, you will not develop any dry skin cracks.   </li>
            <li>Slightly scented but smells nice.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find a product that works on dry hands better than this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Look at MHR: the main ingredient is Aloe, 60% of it!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hand lotion and I have very dry hands.  </li>
            <li>this product really helps my hands.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Arrived fast &amp; as described.  </li>
            <li>, it absorbs really well.</li>
            <li>The guys really loves it, too.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very outdoorsy person - always around horses, dogs, the garden.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>that really work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really is a miracle.</li>
            <li>so this really repairs my fingers overnight.</li>
            <li>My hands get very cracked from the work I do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, I really don&#x27;t care for the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li>works really well absorbs my daughter also loves it as well.</li>
            <li>not so much.</li>
            <li>This cream is good but not amazing.</li>
            <li>Before getting this, have tried more than a dozen of other products including whatever my dermatologist prescribed which did not work.  </li>
            <li>This miracle hand repair worked better than any other before but won&#x27;t cure.  </li>
            <li>So, my hands are screaming for care by the time I get home; definitely presenting a special challenge.</li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance and does not feel heavy or greasy!</li>
            <li>A nice thick cream, not greasy but no dramatic, overnight results.</li>
            <li>We can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Big bottle, and the lotion works so well that you only need, at most, a dime sized blob.</li>
            <li>I was also lucky enough to find this cream on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this item.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to diabetics</li>
            <li>So, I highly recommend this product for both men &amp; women.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>In sum: highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a flight attendant and I&#x27;ve tried almost everything to help my super dry hands.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so hard to find the cram to heal them and keep them nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Like this because it isn&#x27;t greasy and seems to really make my hands soft.</li>
            <li>Also saving money by not having to buy concealers and heavy foundations; I don&#x27;t need them anymore &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I found this hand cream for him a few years ago he wanted more.</li>
            <li>The skin on the sides of my fingernails crack in the winter (I live in Michigan).</li>
            <li>This cream will protect your hands, and the high Aloe content heals very dry skin quickly.</li>
            <li>I work with papers and at a computer and my hands get super dry.</li>
            <li>Living in Nevada&#x27;s dry air something extraordinary is required to keep my hands from cracking.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin very soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months now, inspired by the same manufacturer&#x27;s Miracle Foot Repair, which I&#x27;ve used ever since it first appeared in the 1990s</li>
            <li>I first purchased this hand cream in my local area for 20.00 a tube.</li>
            <li>I was at a complete loss, nothing worked!</li>
            <li>Okay, I am not sure I would classify this hand cream as a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; because that would be a bit of a stretch.  </li>
            <li>I bought this cream at Bed Bath and Beyond, and the next day my hands were much softer!</li>
            <li>I have a drawer full of partially used hand creams.</li>
            <li>After this very long, dry winter, I found my favorite hand cream was not working to keep my finger tips from cracking.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hand cream for anyone who washes their hands a lot, and who wants a daily treatment for their hands.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s summer right now, but this week, I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of heavy-duty cleaning, so my hands are getting some pretty harsh treatment.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product for anyone that suffers from dry hands, which crack and peel.</li>
            <li>This product also arrived fairly quickly this was packed in the same box as the Neutrogena facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try if you have dry hands, just not cuticles!</li>
            <li>Hand cream is certainly one of those things that is very personal on whether you like it or not,</li>
            <li>So far, no chapped hands this winter.</li>
            <li>I used Miracle Hand Cream for years and found that it was the only one on the market, including precription creams,that really do heal my hands.</li>
            <li>The lotion is soft and not &#x27;oily&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Will make your hands as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>has come thus far.</li>
            <li>I only really use it in winter or after doing lots of dishes, but I have become so attached that I fear being without it.</li>
            <li>So far the husband and son are using it and no complaints.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And yet they feel soft and</li>
            <li>So, needless to say, I was thrilled to be able to buy this cream through Amazon for half the price I had paid for it!  </li>
            <li>This cream absorbs quickly and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>It works better than other more expensive premium lotion out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought this first at Bed, Bath and Beyond since I worked in Preschool and washing hands a lot made them dry out.  </li>
            <li>being a big tough guy, it hurts to have cracked and bleeding hands, and this stuff doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling like you rubbed female lotion all over, non greasy, and smell is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Purchased my first hand and feet repair cream on QVC several years back.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s thick, and I find it generally non-greasy and fast-absorbing.  </li>
            <li>We live in the second driest State in the Nation (for humidity) and this stuff does the job.</li>
            <li>It really works for dry skin in this desert environment.  </li>
            <li>This is the only thing I have found that makes them feel soft and not dried out.</li>
            <li>After following the directions, and about 2 to 3 days, my skin is soft and has that natural color.  </li>
            <li>i noticed a change in the first few days and after about 10 days,my hands were clear.</li>
            <li>I am 43 years old and I am back to having youthful hands.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hands silky soft and if applied last thing at night by morning you won&#x27;t believe the difference!  </li>
            <li>The results were immediate: soothing of the pain in my hands from the dryness and in about 10 days or so, complete and total healing and repair of my hands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every hand cream in the world because my hands were starting to look really old.  </li>
            <li>Fast ship, works as expected just like the foot one.  </li>
            <li>The main ingredient, aloe, helps to heal and soften dry, cracked hands.  </li>
            <li>Great product - less expensive online</li>
            <li>I never liked my hands before for they were always dry, but I guess I love them now.</li>
            <li>My husband works with drywall, concrete, lots of materials that dry and crack his hands.  </li>
            <li>Granted it&#x27;s been a mild winter but even when I feel the slightest bit of dryness coming on, usually after power cleaning the house or a walk with the dog at the park</li>
            <li>My hands peel so bad from cleaning and doing dishes and this cream has worked magically!!</li>
            <li>After moving to New Mexico I tried all kinds of lotions to combat the dry climate.</li>
            <li>The only problem is I can only get them online, no stores near me carry it.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, I burned my hand with boiling water while canning 2 days ago; I immediately slathered Miracle Hand Cream on it and later that same day I had already forgotten about it since the pain was nearly gone and my skin still hasn&#x27;t blistered.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream to everyone that has rough and cracked hands.</li>
            <li>My hands get dry and irritated too from winter and frequent hand washing.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t completely remove dry skin.</li>
            <li>However, after using MHR several times daily (I keep a tube at home and one at work where I&#x27;m handling lots of paper and books) for a couple of months, I have noticed a minor miracle: the skin on my 50+ yr old hands is no longer \\&quot;crepey\\&quot;, my hands look younger than they&#x27;ve looked in years.</li>
            <li>I bought this at the local BedBath&amp;Beyond in a sample size desperate for hand lotion while Christmas shopping and instantly fell in love with how soft and ungreasy my hands were.  </li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s a great way to get you hooked.</li>
            <li> However, my curiosity was piqued when I saw the great reviews for the Miracle Hand Repair Cream.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle and it feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li> (BTW - The foot cream is equally great stuff.)</li>
            <li> Then I tried this cream after a read a lol rave review about it on a skincare blog.   </li>
            <li> No scents, so great for men as well as women.</li>
            <li> Great product</li>
            <li> The best product of it&#x27;s kind on the market.</li>
            <li> and Great Price</li>
            <li> But it is equally great on arms, legs and even feet.</li>
            <li> and it works great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> This product has found a great use for this ingredient.</li>
            <li> Great Seller+Fast Shipping+Great Communication.</li>
            <li> This product is great for me too.  </li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> It was a great price as well.</li>
            <li> It just makes me think &#x27;hospital&#x27; when I&#x27;m not there, which isn&#x27;t a good thing, for me.  </li>
            <li> and she loved the feel of her hands and arms afterwards.</li>
            <li> scaly hands are in good condition now</li>
            <li> good item.good</li>
            <li> Good delivery.</li>
            <li> it is a good product for this price</li>
            <li> It is good on the hands too.</li>
            <li> Nothing works as good.  </li>
            <li> Good Stuff.</li>
            <li> But it is darn good cream.  </li>
            <li> So I am always on the prowl for good hand cream.  </li>
            <li> For me a good hand cream is one that moisturizes without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> Good buy for the price</li>
            <li> This is because I can never find one that does a good job but doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer</li>
            <li> , I find this effective at keeping my hands in good shape even when I&#x27;m not so good to my hands, and it additionally seems to be helping my burned fingers heal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, and I think I need another tube for upstairs, too.  </li>
            <li> very pleased wtih this product...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in the store anymore, so I looked it up online and was so happy to find it.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> however both my wife and I LOVE this hand cream!  </li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> this cream/lotion is NOT greasy and does everything it promises and more!</li>
            <li> Leaves on a nice thick-kind of feeling without the oily feel the hands that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Even the men like to use it because the smell is not too feminine and it is really effective.</li>
            <li> I cannot say everyone will have the safe good fortune that I do with this stuff, but</li>
            <li> Pleasant, light scent, and</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice, but very light.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best hand cream I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This is a superior product that leaves my hands and finger tips feeling smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have highly sensitive skin and allergies, and this product is awesome.</li>
            <li> Miracle hand repair dries very quickly and does not leave my hands greasy at all!</li>
            <li> The store was smart offering to let customers try a bit of the product for free, because it&#x27;s a wonderful product</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say that your split fingers will get healed,  But if what you want is a good skin softening hand cream, this is very good stuff.</li>
            <li> Nice creamy texture in an easy to use tube.</li>
            <li> which is probably better because buying the cream through Amazon was surely cheaper.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried many many creams.</li>
            <li> and they all love it.</li>
            <li> (truly fabulous!).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and I now refuse to buy pricy promises that don&#x27;t deliver!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I found this to be a safe product to use.  </li>
            <li> love this stuff-</li>
            <li> The sample product I tried was much better than the product I purchased.  </li>
            <li> I love this cream -</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for the price, non-greasy, very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I also love the foot cream they make.</li>
            <li> My fiancee and I love this hand cream.</li>
            <li> I love using this lotion from Fall to Spring.  </li>
            <li> If I can get to it, I may apply the cream 1-2 times a day at most.</li>
            <li> I have bought this cream before and really love it.  </li>
            <li> We are satisfied with the product :)</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> reason why am writing this review on Amazon is that I came in to check if I can buy more after running out of it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and just keep buying it</li>
            <li> Plus, keeps them healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Gave it to most of my friends.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, this lotion is ok.</li>
            <li> I still like the o&#x27;keeffe&#x27;s working hands much better as it stays in your hand</li>
            <li> I put it on everynight just before bed when my hands seem most thirsty.  </li>
            <li> Glad to have found more than a sample 1oz size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not awful.</li>
            <li> But it is way more pricier.</li>
            <li> No joke, a liberal amount before bed, and overnight better than 50% improvement.  </li>
            <li> Might be better to use with gloves to prevent leaving grease marks everywhere.</li>
            <li> My hands look and feel immediately better after just one application.</li>
            <li> LOVE this cream....</li>
            <li> I have tried many hand creams before this one, but they are either too oily or smelly.</li>
            <li> My favorite...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grand son and he just loves it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Crabtree and Evelyn&#x27;s hand therapy is much much better.</li>
            <li> Very rich nourishing hand cream.  </li>
            <li> Hand cream very effective in moisturing extremely dry hands; absorbs well into skin leaving no noticeable residue; pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> Miracle Hand Repair is the best for dry hands.  </li>
            <li> This is without a doubt one of the best hand (or anywhere you have dry skin) creams I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Best hand cream for dry cracked hands.</li>
            <li> Look at the ingredients for most moisturizers and what&#x27;s the primary ingredient: water.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve never really gone on a mission for the perfect hand cream, I will say that for me this is as close as any</li>
            <li> Best hand cream for rough hands.</li>
            <li> However, for a temporary relief it works best among other creams.</li>
            <li> The bottle easily fits in my bag and does not leak when I take it with me.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> It has a strong &#x27;baby-powderish&#x27; scent, that smells</li>
            <li> This hand cream doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance smell but like the herb.</li>
            <li> I found the hydrating properties of the Miracle Cream to be average, at best, although it does absorb well and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> , I zap my hands with this stuff and they are good as new again.  </li>
            <li> So, keep in mind, this product may work splendidly for those who have not abused their hands to such an extreme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and this cream is very good for moisturizing my hands.  </li>
            <li> Within 24 hours (4-5 applications) my hands were smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> There is a light fragrance so it doesn&#x27;t make one have an overpowering scent.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the amazing product.  </li>
            <li> This stuff made my hands soft and gorgeous, which made me try using it on my face.  </li>
            <li> It feels like good penetrating moisture and it leaves my hands feeling soft, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Amazon sell this without tax or shipping cost, that&#x27;s a real bonus on top of finding such a great product.</li>
            <li> I originally bought it at Bed Bath and Beyond</li>
            <li> : the smell isn&#x27;t the most pleasant on your hands after use, but it hydrates very dry and/or calloused hands!</li>
            <li> Defiantly worth a try!</li>
            <li> Well, I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Well worth every cent!</li>
            <li> This is great for dry, chapped, cracked hands.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, and keeps my hands soft for the lady!</li>
            <li> Very light scent, very moisturizing and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because my family and I have always had a problem with dry skin on our hands and also eczema on our bodies and this product works Fantasticly!!!  </li>
            <li> What makes this one so special?</li>
            <li> Repair\\&quot; right now!</li>
            <li> i am a diabetic and have very dry feet and hands this works great for me.</li>
            <li> Unlike the brilliant foot cream, I did not initially think there was anything particularly miraculous about this.</li>
            <li> This is a much thicker cream than many I&#x27;ve used, and can be used on legs and knees as well.  </li>
            <li> Most hand lotions don&#x27;t seem to have much residual effect.  </li>
            <li> But if you are just using it for instant moisturizer, it work good</li>
            <li> I really love this foot cream but the hand cream has this smell to it that I really can&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li> It really does make them look and feel better.  </li>
            <li> I have not been able to use other hand creams but this one is great and my whole family loves it.</li>
            <li> This lotion absorbs quick</li>
            <li> I cannot express enough how much I love this stuff, and the price, to me, is the cherry on top.  </li>
            <li> This product soaks into skin quickly.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> So if you poke a hole in the top to use normal...</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the product, the price could be a bit lower but it is quite a bit of lotion.</li>
            <li> the price is much better on Amazon) I cannot live without this- nor will I.  </li>
            <li> It is absorbed fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any signs of itself on paper or anything else.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more of this product!</li>
            <li> This is the only cream I use now and love it!  </li>
            <li> This product is exactly what it claims to be: a miracle!</li>
            <li> Very slightly scented of aloe (which is great, because not overpowering), absorbs quickly and shows results quickly.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not greasy and really makes hands smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no secret that aloe is simply fantastic for the skin, but who woulda thought for this purpose.  </li>
            <li> I love how it completely absorbs into the skin so my face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy either.  </li>
            <li> lotion is really worth a try.</li>
            <li> Most hand lotions leave my hands very greasy, while this product, in reasonable amounts, doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the money, and lasts a while.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product, ladies it seriously works, I bought one from Ross Yesterday, tried it at night and this morning as I woke up</li>
            <li> This one seems to be helpful, but not as good as some other products.</li>
            <li> And priced right.  </li>
            <li> Heals like Pure Aloe right out of the plant!  </li>
            <li> so I can use it right away when I need it.</li>
            <li> , I felt my hands are SUPER soft, fresh, clean.</li>
            <li> I also noticed there is salicylic acid in it too, but it doesn&#x27;t indicate how much since it isn&#x27;t near the top of the ingredient list.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had that experience with any other hand cream, so I&#x27;m very pleased and will continue to use this faithfully.</li>
            <li> Works very very well ....</li>
            <li> The fragrance is extremely pleasant and not overbearing and the texture is thick, but absorbs and quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li> so I figure I&#x27;m really getting my moneys worth out of the purchase.</li>
            <li> i have tried so many lotions and hand creams to help heal my hands from cracked skin that i thought nothing would actually work.</li>
            <li> It has been the only thing to keep my hand&#x27;s hydrated, with a healthy appearance.  </li>
            <li> First time I bought this was at a drugstore, I was working as a cook/dishwasher/barback, so my hands were cracked and bleeding.</li>
            <li> After a year of agony, it really was a miracle!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this hand cream, and after reading the reviews I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> Love this deep lotion!</li>
            <li> It is really a miracle!</li>
            <li> I tried so many different grocery and drug store products that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Only thing I have noticed is that my nails will grow faster the more I consistently use this stuff.</li>
            <li> Priced better than local stores.</li>
            <li> This cream does exactly that.  </li>
            <li> Its good cream and its cream that I don&#x27;t mind using several times a day because as I said it leaves my hands feeling soft and not greasy and for me that is very important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it every morning and before I go to bed, and my hands are always soft and smooth now.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, I thought I had truly found a miracle cream....</li>
            <li> working , and using the chemicals to clean, my hand crack all the time, and are very sensitive to cleaning products.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need at a time and it works Great and last a long time!!  </li>
            <li> won&#x27;t poke a hole in the lid, but seems strange to have a top that doesn&#x27;t click to lock.</li>
            <li> If you rub it into your hands most nights before you go to bed, you will not develop any dry skin cracks.   </li>
            <li> Slightly scented but smells nice.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find a product that works on dry hands better than this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Look at MHR: the main ingredient is Aloe, 60% of it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hand lotion and I have very dry hands.  </li>
            <li> this product really helps my hands.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Arrived fast &amp; as described.  </li>
            <li> , it absorbs really well.</li>
            <li> The guys really loves it, too.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very outdoorsy person - always around horses, dogs, the garden.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> that really work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really is a miracle.</li>
            <li> so this really repairs my fingers overnight.</li>
            <li> My hands get very cracked from the work I do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I really don&#x27;t care for the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li> works really well absorbs my daughter also loves it as well.</li>
            <li> not so much.</li>
            <li> This cream is good but not amazing.</li>
            <li> Before getting this, have tried more than a dozen of other products including whatever my dermatologist prescribed which did not work.  </li>
            <li> This miracle hand repair worked better than any other before but won&#x27;t cure.  </li>
            <li> So, my hands are screaming for care by the time I get home; definitely presenting a special challenge.</li>
            <li> It has a nice fragrance and does not feel heavy or greasy!</li>
            <li> A nice thick cream, not greasy but no dramatic, overnight results.</li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Big bottle, and the lotion works so well that you only need, at most, a dime sized blob.</li>
            <li> I was also lucky enough to find this cream on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this item.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to diabetics</li>
            <li> So, I highly recommend this product for both men &amp; women.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> In sum: highly recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a flight attendant and I&#x27;ve tried almost everything to help my super dry hands.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so hard to find the cram to heal them and keep them nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Like this because it isn&#x27;t greasy and seems to really make my hands soft.</li>
            <li> Also saving money by not having to buy concealers and heavy foundations; I don&#x27;t need them anymore &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I found this hand cream for him a few years ago he wanted more.</li>
            <li> The skin on the sides of my fingernails crack in the winter (I live in Michigan).</li>
            <li> This cream will protect your hands, and the high Aloe content heals very dry skin quickly.</li>
            <li> I work with papers and at a computer and my hands get super dry.</li>
            <li> Living in Nevada&#x27;s dry air something extraordinary is required to keep my hands from cracking.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin very soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months now, inspired by the same manufacturer&#x27;s Miracle Foot Repair, which I&#x27;ve used ever since it first appeared in the 1990s</li>
            <li> I first purchased this hand cream in my local area for 20.00 a tube.</li>
            <li> I was at a complete loss, nothing worked!</li>
            <li> Okay, I am not sure I would classify this hand cream as a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; because that would be a bit of a stretch.  </li>
            <li> I bought this cream at Bed Bath and Beyond, and the next day my hands were much softer!</li>
            <li> I have a drawer full of partially used hand creams.</li>
            <li> After this very long, dry winter, I found my favorite hand cream was not working to keep my finger tips from cracking.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hand cream for anyone who washes their hands a lot, and who wants a daily treatment for their hands.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s summer right now, but this week, I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of heavy-duty cleaning, so my hands are getting some pretty harsh treatment.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for anyone that suffers from dry hands, which crack and peel.</li>
            <li> This product also arrived fairly quickly this was packed in the same box as the Neutrogena facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try if you have dry hands, just not cuticles!</li>
            <li> Hand cream is certainly one of those things that is very personal on whether you like it or not,</li>
            <li> So far, no chapped hands this winter.</li>
            <li> I used Miracle Hand Cream for years and found that it was the only one on the market, including precription creams,that really do heal my hands.</li>
            <li> The lotion is soft and not &#x27;oily&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Will make your hands as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> has come thus far.</li>
            <li> I only really use it in winter or after doing lots of dishes, but I have become so attached that I fear being without it.</li>
            <li> So far the husband and son are using it and no complaints.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And yet they feel soft and</li>
            <li> So, needless to say, I was thrilled to be able to buy this cream through Amazon for half the price I had paid for it!  </li>
            <li> This cream absorbs quickly and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> It works better than other more expensive premium lotion out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this first at Bed, Bath and Beyond since I worked in Preschool and washing hands a lot made them dry out.  </li>
            <li> being a big tough guy, it hurts to have cracked and bleeding hands, and this stuff doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling like you rubbed female lotion all over, non greasy, and smell is pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Purchased my first hand and feet repair cream on QVC several years back.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s thick, and I find it generally non-greasy and fast-absorbing.  </li>
            <li> We live in the second driest State in the Nation (for humidity) and this stuff does the job.</li>
            <li> It really works for dry skin in this desert environment.  </li>
            <li> This is the only thing I have found that makes them feel soft and not dried out.</li>
            <li> After following the directions, and about 2 to 3 days, my skin is soft and has that natural color.  </li>
            <li> i noticed a change in the first few days and after about 10 days,my hands were clear.</li>
            <li> I am 43 years old and I am back to having youthful hands.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hands silky soft and if applied last thing at night by morning you won&#x27;t believe the difference!  </li>
            <li> The results were immediate: soothing of the pain in my hands from the dryness and in about 10 days or so, complete and total healing and repair of my hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every hand cream in the world because my hands were starting to look really old.  </li>
            <li> Fast ship, works as expected just like the foot one.  </li>
            <li> The main ingredient, aloe, helps to heal and soften dry, cracked hands.  </li>
            <li> Great product - less expensive online</li>
            <li> I never liked my hands before for they were always dry, but I guess I love them now.</li>
            <li> My husband works with drywall, concrete, lots of materials that dry and crack his hands.  </li>
            <li> Granted it&#x27;s been a mild winter but even when I feel the slightest bit of dryness coming on, usually after power cleaning the house or a walk with the dog at the park</li>
            <li> My hands peel so bad from cleaning and doing dishes and this cream has worked magically!!</li>
            <li> After moving to New Mexico I tried all kinds of lotions to combat the dry climate.</li>
            <li> The only problem is I can only get them online, no stores near me carry it.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I burned my hand with boiling water while canning 2 days ago; I immediately slathered Miracle Hand Cream on it and later that same day I had already forgotten about it since the pain was nearly gone and my skin still hasn&#x27;t blistered.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream to everyone that has rough and cracked hands.</li>
            <li> My hands get dry and irritated too from winter and frequent hand washing.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t completely remove dry skin.</li>
            <li> However, after using MHR several times daily (I keep a tube at home and one at work where I&#x27;m handling lots of paper and books) for a couple of months, I have noticed a minor miracle: the skin on my 50+ yr old hands is no longer \\&quot;crepey\\&quot;, my hands look younger than they&#x27;ve looked in years.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the local BedBath&amp;Beyond in a sample size desperate for hand lotion while Christmas shopping and instantly fell in love with how soft and ungreasy my hands were.  </li>
            <li> absence of scent means it won&#x27;t clash with my cologne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a product that really improves my dry hands and doesn&#x27;t leave me with a greasy mess</li>
            <li> I have struggled with adult acne for years and have a cabinet full of expensive products that claim a lot, but don&#x27;t work, so I had nothing to lose.  </li>
            <li> I had cracked bleeding hands very painful used this for about a week at least 6 or more times at first ( because my hands were so bad ) and this healed them wonderful</li>
            <li> Nice cooling lotion won&#x27;t sting if hands are too dry and chapped hands looked normal after a couple weeks if dry and cold winter should buy a few tubes because you&#x27;ll probably need it</li>
            <li> And it seems that I wash my hands so frequently that I can feel it washing off half of the time.</li>
            <li> I have severe dry skin, especially in the winter months, that affects my elbows and knees.  </li>
            <li> If your hands are dry and crack, definitely try this lotion!</li>
            <li> Now, this is the only repair for my dry, cracked, and bleeding hands.  </li>
            <li> I also use the same brand foot cream which has made my dry heels disappear!  </li>
            <li> This is the only cream that will help my dry, cracked hands!</li>
            <li> Over the years she&#x27;s tried just about every lotion and cream out there, and had even gone the route of Udder Balm and other &amp;#34;working hands&amp;#34; products with only moderate improvement.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all the other big namers, and the only one that used to help was Udder Balm.  </li>
            <li> Steroid creams had left his skin so very dry and scaly.  </li>
            <li> You could always use a little scented lotion after if you have a tendency to put them near your nose.</li>
            <li> I have eczema really bad on my hands and after trying many different creams this is the only one that has releaved the itching and dryness.</li>
            <li> Miracle Hand Repair has completely cleared up my skin within about a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> and just using one takes a LONG time.</li>
            <li> We will continue to use Miracle Hand Repair for as long as it is made.</li>
            <li> I play violin and my knuckle stretched out.</li>
            <li> Easiest review to write for Miracle of Aloe as I am a long time user because the product works.</li>
            <li> However silly, that was previously my biggest gripe with creams -- my hands would be rendered unusable for minutes, if not longer, unless I was okay with leaving greasy fingerprints on anything I touched.</li>
            <li> I have a severe problem with rough, dry hands that crack open all the time.</li>
            <li> 10 minutes later my knuckles were rough and dry.</li>
            <li> They all take too long to dry</li>
            <li> As an RN, I wash my hands constantly, to the point of extreme dryness.  </li>
            <li> larger size would due to the amount I have to use on 1 application.</li>
            <li> My hands get so dry, they will crack.  </li>
            <li> Using this cream just twice a day has gotten rid of my cracked, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> In fact, by the end of the shift, our computer often can no longer read my fingerprints, when I try to access controlled items, because my hands are so dry.  </li>
            <li> Got dry hands?</li>
            <li> They are so dry that I will pick at them all the time and mangle my cuticles.     </li>
            <li> Soothes my winter dry hands.  </li>
            <li> dry cracked skin Miracle Hand Repair keeps my skin moist, no signs of cracking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dry hands -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of hand creams, but none of them healed my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t help my dry hands at all.</li>
            <li> but did not resolve my dry hand issue</li>
            <li> but it works on my dry calloused and cracked</li>
            <li> My hands are disgustingly dry during the winter.</li>
            <li> but it fades away after 2-3 minutes, and you will never feel dry until you wash it away.</li>
            <li> Miracle hand repair probably would work for someone with mildly dry hands.</li>
            <li> I have really dry hands!</li>
            <li> My hands get dry very quickly and the skin above my nails painfully cracks.</li>
            <li> the cream works wonders on dry hands!</li>
            <li> I have tried various treatments in the past including the white greasy one and one made out lamb fat.  </li>
            <li> I would say that it has made a slight improvement on the dryness of my cuticles, but I don&#x27;t apply it regularly either.</li>
            <li> This cream keeps them from feeling that dry and rough feeling.</li>
            <li> My hands are very dry as are</li>
            <li> recommend it for very dry hands or just as &amp;#34;upkeep&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re always very dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;m not enthusiastic about spending nearly ten dollars for this product, but it&#x27;s a big tube of cream that goes a long way</li>
            <li> I got a little tube from my local drug store.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and you only need a little bit of it.  </li>
            <li> My hands were cracked and rough, but after applying Miracle of Aloe, they are without the little cracks and cuts that were not only</li>
            <li> I am a 86 year old man and my hands hurt from all that hard work in my life</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money trying this cream and that.</li>
            <li> Even my husband who&#x27;s a rough &amp; tumble guy has a tube of Miracle Hand Repair Cream in his work tool box.</li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money if you are expecting miracle.</li>
            <li> The product was just as we expected and we use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Not to greasy and not much scent.  </li>
            <li> No real scent to speak of, certainly not one that lingers.</li>
            <li> I keep super glue to close up these &amp;#34;paper cut&amp;#34; type injuries but after using this for a week, no more irritating splits</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only issue I have is this hand cream is a little thin, and maybe not thick for winter.</li>
            <li> Only a small dab about the size of a dime</li>
            <li> None of them did anything other than moisture.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other stuff, like bag balm--nasty and greasy.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> and then they quit stocking it due to customs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the other products.</li>
            <li> I have had two pesky thumb splits for the past 6 weeks that go away only temporarily</li>
            <li> My hands were still a little dry</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t heal my skin problems but the cream is very thick and doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance, good or bad.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of tree work and outdoor labor which is very rough on my hands, and this makes all the difference in the world.</li>
            <li> My hands are especially dry during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Especially on dry hands and feet .</li>
            <li> that this includes tolnaftate (an antifungal, the active ingredient in Tinactin athlete&#x27;s foot medication).  </li>
            <li> Oddly, after a few days of use, though, my hands actually felt a little dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of lotions &amp; creams that were less expensive (and some that were more expensive) that either don&#x27;t work or left me with a greasy mess on my hands.</li>
            <li> Com and saved a lot of money, probably half of what I was paying in other stores.</li>
            <li> Kiehl&#x27;s is terribly expensive, while the MHRC provides a lot of product, for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Not as thick as the last tubes I purchased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick, greasy formula; not something I would use regularly during the day.</li>
            <li> It lasts, it&#x27;s not greasy or watered down, and it gets results.  </li>
            <li> it is just like any other lotion!</li>
            <li> Its a little  expensive  but its working, no as fast as i thought but</li>
            <li> The consistency seems to have changed slightly.</li>
            <li> Also, I find it odd</li>
            <li> and it hurts bad specially in the winter time</li>
            <li> At first I was afraid it would be too greasy, but it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> My hands gets cracked with the first cold day</li>
            <li> Quickly repairs badly cracked fingertips.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which ingredient is responsible for the odor and the odor is proving difficult to describe.  </li>
            <li> It helps me just a little bit.</li>
            <li> , that is how little you need to apply.</li>
            <li> We put it on while watching a little TV at night and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> and I have used this a little over a week.  </li>
            <li> Its a little trick I learned from a surgeon)</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad enough to go to the doctor, but there are some sensitive areas where the blistered skin peeled away.  </li>
            <li> I use this at the job because I work with with cardboard and in cold conditions which are very drying for my hands.</li>
            <li> Still get a few cracks now and</li>
            <li> I remembered a few year ago I had tried Miracle Hand Repair and my fingers were protected.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was tired of dry, cracked, rough skin that snagged on delicate fabrics.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from this condition.</li>
            <li> I have issues with my cuticles getting really dry from working with tons of papers and labels and dusty bottles in a pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only a little disappointed that the cream did not take care of the dryness I experience daily.</li>
            <li> so institutional---think hospital, or convalescent center, or that nasty powder odor inside the hospital latex gloves (if you happen to be familiar), that you can&#x27;t even wash off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how she came upon Miracle Hand Repair, but it has been her savior.  </li>
            <li> I even gave small ones to my co-workers as gifts.</li>
            <li> I always have a small container in my pocket</li>
            <li> We had tried other lotions/creams in the past, with poor results.  </li>
            <li> They work outdoors, and that&#x27;s really hard on the hands.</li>
            <li> This hand lotion was a gift to my mom who has a cleaning job, hard on the hands.  </li>
            <li> Once I had burnt in my hand, but the scar is hardly seen after about a month using this hand cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I foolishly sandpapered my fingers to get rid of hard skin and they ended up with cracks in them that were bleeding, I couldn&#x27;t pick anything up, my fingers were so sore.  </li>
            <li> We both use it at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my father, whom suffers from chronic dry skin on his hands.  </li>
            <li> He suffers with very dry skin and this helped to make him feel smoother and not so worried about his skin problems.</li>
            <li> To tell the truth I was tired of spending hard earned money on name brand products were a dissapointment.</li>
            <li> I write frequently and hate how lotions leave my hands greasy to the point that I cannot grip my pen.  </li>
            <li> I could care less about the smell because I have no more painful cracking skin.</li>
            <li> For over a year, I was having the absolute WORST dry hands: painfully sore cracks, even rashes and blisters.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but I was desperate for something that would heal my very dry hands.</li>
            <li> Im addicted to this hand cream.</li>
            <li> We live in Minnesota and my wife get&#x27;s terrible splits in her fingers during the winter.  </li>
            <li> Why the dramatic result: it&#x27;s all in the Aloe.</li>
            <li> It smells bad, doesn&#x27;t work, smells like the worst cheap perfume ever, and I just can&#x27;t get over the smell.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it!&lt;br /&gt;(This line to fulfill the stupid 20 character requirement, which is why I don&#x27;t usually write these reviews unless the purchase is really disappointing)</li>

            <li> (I use crazy glue to repair them which, if you haven&#x27;t tried it, works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> On the one hand, I&#x27;m grateful that this doesn&#x27;t include any artificial dyes.  </li>
            <li> I am very skeptical about products and their ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It is too bad that you can&#x27;t get this across into Canada.  </li>
            <li> bad looking but hurt all the time.  </li>
            <li> i resigned myself to the fact that i would always have this painful and embarassing condition until i tried miracle hand repair.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people who gets those truly painful thumb and finger splits in the winter.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this daily at my desk at work. I work with papers and at a computer and my hands get super dry. This lotion absorbs quick so I don&#x27;t have to worry about greasy feeling on my keyboard or papers. I highly suggest this item.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my father, whom suffers from chronic dry skin on his hands.  We had tried other lotions/creams in the past, with poor results.  This does the job.  Highly recommended to diabetics</li>
            <li> We live in Minnesota and my wife get&#x27;s terrible splits in her fingers during the winter.  Over the years she&#x27;s tried just about every lotion and cream out there, and had even gone the route of Udder Balm and other &amp;#34;working hands&amp;#34; products with only moderate improvement.  I&#x27;m not sure how she came upon Miracle Hand Repair, but it has been her savior.  Recently she went to buy another at our local Walgreen&#x27;s and couldn&#x27;t find it anymore...which is probably better because buying the cream through Amazon was surely cheaper.  She still gets a crack now and then, but nothing compared to before.  She&#x27;s happy.</li>
            <li> The best hand cream out there! I have severely chapped hands and I have tried many many creams. They all take too long to dry and they leave my hand greasy. Miracle hand repair dries very quickly and does not leave my hands greasy at all! I told my mom and friends about it and they all love it. Great product. The only problem is I can only get them online, no stores near me carry it.</li>
            <li> My husband swears this is the best hand cream he has ever used.  I have also used it and it&#x27;s not greasy and really makes hands smooth.  We have put it in several smaller bottles and put them in every vehicle we drive.</li>
            <li> I called myself the hang~nail queen because I had such a problem with them all my life - however, this product took care of the problem and I no longer have any hang~nails ! What an awesome cream !</li>
            <li> This is one great product.  I &amp; lots of my co-workers, used it in Iraq, too.  It&#x27;s not oily or runny &amp; it&#x27;s absence of scent means it won&#x27;t clash with my cologne. They also make a travel size that fits in my purse. So, I highly recommend this product for both men &amp; women.</li>
            <li> The skin on the sides of my fingernails crack in the winter (I live in Michigan). I spent a lot of money trying this cream and that. Miracle Hand Cream is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works. Given time (used several times daily for about a week) it will heal the cracks. If you rub it into your hands most nights before you go to bed, you will not develop any dry skin cracks.   There is no pain killer in it, so additionally, you&#x27;ll have to use hydrocortisone on the cracks till they stop hurting. But the hydrocortisone by itself won&#x27;t heal anything. Miracle Hand Repair Cream will.</li>
            <li> I am a 86 year old man and my hands hurt from all that hard work in my life&lt;br /&gt;BUT this product really helps my hands.&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered my second tube....Bob.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months now, inspired by the same manufacturer&#x27;s Miracle Foot Repair, which I&#x27;ve used ever since it first appeared in the 1990s (truly fabulous!). Unlike the brilliant foot cream, I did not initially think there was anything particularly miraculous about this. A nice thick cream, not greasy but no dramatic, overnight results. However, after using MHR several times daily (I keep a tube at home and one at work where I&#x27;m handling lots of paper and books) for a couple of months, I have noticed a minor miracle: the skin on my 50+ yr old hands is no longer \\&quot;crepey\\&quot;, my hands look younger than they&#x27;ve looked in years. I&#x27;ve never had that experience with any other hand cream, so I&#x27;m very pleased and will continue to use this faithfully.</li>
            <li> Miracle Hand Repair is the best for dry hands.  My hands get so dry, they will crack.  This is the only thing I have found that makes them feel soft and not dried out.</li>
            <li> My hands are especially dry during the winter months. I was tired of dry, cracked, rough skin that snagged on delicate fabrics. When the clerk at the check-out register of a local store offered to let me try out a bit of Miracle Hand Repair Cream I figured it was just another gimmick, but I tried a sample of the cream as I left the store. The store was smart offering to let customers try a bit of the product for free, because it&#x27;s a wonderful product and it&#x27;s a great way to get you hooked. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of lotions &amp; creams that were less expensive (and some that were more expensive) that either don&#x27;t work or left me with a greasy mess on my hands. To tell the truth I was tired of spending hard earned money on name brand products were a dissapointment. I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;m not enthusiastic about spending nearly ten dollars for this product, but it&#x27;s a big tube of cream that goes a long way so I figure I&#x27;m really getting my moneys worth out of the purchase. Even my husband who&#x27;s a rough &amp; tumble guy has a tube of Miracle Hand Repair Cream in his work tool box. It&#x27;s a product that really improves my dry hands and doesn&#x27;t leave me with a greasy mess so I&#x27;m hooked on the product.</li>
            <li> i have tried so many lotions and hand creams to help heal my hands from cracked skin that i thought nothing would actually work. i resigned myself to the fact that i would always have this painful and embarassing condition until i tried miracle hand repair. i noticed a change in the first few days and after about 10 days,my hands were clear. i use it every night and will continue to do so. i highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from this condition.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the local BedBath&amp;Beyond in a sample size desperate for hand lotion while Christmas shopping and instantly fell in love with how soft and ungreasy my hands were.  I write frequently and hate how lotions leave my hands greasy to the point that I cannot grip my pen.  This stuff made my hands soft and gorgeous, which made me try using it on my face.  I have struggled with adult acne for years and have a cabinet full of expensive products that claim a lot, but don&#x27;t work, so I had nothing to lose.  Miracle Hand Repair has completely cleared up my skin within about a few weeks of use.  I love how it completely absorbs into the skin so my face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy either.  Only a small dab about the size of a dime and it heals and takes away the redness and minimizes any scarring!  It&#x27;s cheap and I now refuse to buy pricy promises that don&#x27;t deliver! It&#x27;s no secret that aloe is simply fantastic for the skin, but who woulda thought for this purpose.  I also noticed there is salicylic acid in it too, but it doesn&#x27;t indicate how much since it isn&#x27;t near the top of the ingredient list.  Furthermore, I burned my hand with boiling water while canning 2 days ago; I immediately slathered Miracle Hand Cream on it and later that same day I had already forgotten about it since the pain was nearly gone and my skin still hasn&#x27;t blistered.  I cannot express enough how much I love this stuff, and the price, to me, is the cherry on top.  Also saving money by not having to buy concealers and heavy foundations; I don&#x27;t need them anymore &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hand cream I have ever used.  My profession requires that I wash my hands several dozen times a day.  Using this cream just twice a day has gotten rid of my cracked, dry skin.  I will definitely purchase more of this product!</li>
            <li> As an RN, I wash my hands constantly, to the point of extreme dryness.  In fact, by the end of the shift, our computer often can no longer read my fingerprints, when I try to access controlled items, because my hands are so dry.  And, while on duty, we are NOT permitted to use hand lotion, because it interferes with proper hand washing. So, my hands are screaming for care by the time I get home; definitely presenting a special challenge. So, keep in mind, this product may work splendidly for those who have not abused their hands to such an extreme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a long-term fan of Kiehl&#x27;s Ultimate Strength Hand Salve. It has been the only thing to keep my hand&#x27;s hydrated, with a healthy appearance.  However, my curiosity was piqued when I saw the great reviews for the Miracle Hand Repair Cream.  Kiehl&#x27;s is terribly expensive, while the MHRC provides a lot of product, for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict: back to the Kiehl&#x27;s for me. I found the hydrating properties of the Miracle Cream to be average, at best, although it does absorb well and is not greasy.  Oddly, after a few days of use, though, my hands actually felt a little dryer. I also could not tolerate the smell of the cream.  It has a strong &#x27;baby-powderish&#x27; scent, that smells so institutional---think hospital, or convalescent center, or that nasty powder odor inside the hospital latex gloves (if you happen to be familiar), that you can&#x27;t even wash off. It just makes me think &#x27;hospital&#x27; when I&#x27;m not there, which isn&#x27;t a good thing, for me.  This again, may not bother others without such an association. I definitely won&#x27;t be using this on my hands again.  I&#x27;ll probably just delegate the product to my feet, if at all.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I am very skeptical about products and their ingredients.  I found this to be a safe product to use.  It truly will work miracles on your hands, elbows, knees etc.  I am 43 years old and I am back to having youthful hands.  I also swear by Miracle Foot Cream.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product.  He uses it on his hand and elbows.  It clears up his chapped hands and ruff elbows.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  My husband works with drywall, concrete, lots of materials that dry and crack his hands.  We both use it to prevent cracking.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle and it feels great on your skin. I have not been able to use other hand creams but this one is great and my whole family loves it.</li>
            <li> Best hand lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle- and just using one takes a LONG time. Big bottle, and the lotion works so well that you only need, at most, a dime sized blob. First time I bought this was at a drugstore, I was working as a cook/dishwasher/barback, so my hands were cracked and bleeding. Within 24 hours (4-5 applications) my hands were smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt. No joke.&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff- the name is no lie, it works miracles.</li>
            <li> So far, no chapped hands this winter. Granted it&#x27;s been a mild winter but even when I feel the slightest bit of dryness coming on, usually after power cleaning the house or a walk with the dog at the park, I zap my hands with this stuff and they are good as new again.  (BTW - The foot cream is equally great stuff.)</li>
            <li> The sample product I tried was much better than the product I purchased.  It feels greasy.</li>
            <li> Before getting this, have tried more than a dozen of other products including whatever my dermatologist prescribed which did not work.  This miracle hand repair worked better than any other before but won&#x27;t cure.  However, for a temporary relief it works best among other creams.</li>
            <li> good product! it makes my skin very soft</li>
            <li> I first purchased this hand cream in my local area for 20.00 a tube. Expensive, but I was desperate for something that would heal my very dry hands. Well. this does the job well!  It leaves my hands silky soft and if applied last thing at night by morning you won&#x27;t believe the difference!  So, needless to say, I was thrilled to be able to buy this cream through Amazon for half the price I had paid for it!  This is the only cream I use now and love it!  I also use the same brand foot cream which has made my dry heels disappear!  I hope you continue to carry these products as I am a customer for life!</li>
            <li> In the winter, my husband constantly had cracked finger areas. Immediately upon using this hand repair, the cracks began to heal. He has had no problems for over two years (using once each morning after shower). We will continue to use Miracle Hand Repair for as long as it is made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and in the winter the end of my fingers along the outside of the fingernail crack.  Its very painful and unsightly.  I have tried various treatments in the past including the white greasy one and one made out lamb fat.  That didn&#x27;t work so I was resorting to an antibacterial ointment and band aids which provided only temporary relief.  I was in BB&amp;B shopping for Christmas presents and came across MHR.  Bought a 1 oz. tube figuring I had nothing to lose.  The results were immediate and without all the greasiness or band aids. MHR cream is a miracle.  It is the only thing I have ever found that works.  I could care less about the smell because I have no more painful cracking skin.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what it claims to be: a miracle! For over a year, I was having the absolute WORST dry hands: painfully sore cracks, even rashes and blisters. I was at a complete loss, nothing worked! I was using every type of moisturizer on the market, to no avail. Finally, I found the \\&quot;Miracle Hand Repair Cream\\&quot; in a 1 oz. sample size at Bed, Bath and Beyond. I figured, \\&quot;What the heck!\\&quot; and gave it a try. The results were immediate: soothing of the pain in my hands from the dryness and in about 10 days or so, complete and total healing and repair of my hands. After a year of agony, it really was a miracle! Why the dramatic result: it&#x27;s all in the Aloe. Look at the ingredients for most moisturizers and what&#x27;s the primary ingredient: water. Look at MHR: the main ingredient is Aloe, 60% of it! Got dry hands? Buy \\&quot;Miracle Hand Repair\\&quot; right now! You will not regret it, I promise!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every hand cream in the world because my hands were starting to look really old.  None of them did anything other than moisture.  Then I tried this cream after a read a lol rave review about it on a skincare blog.   [...]  This is the only cream that made a drastic difference (I&#x27;m talking my hands now look like someone 10 years younger&#x27;s.)</li>
            <li> I love this cream - it&#x27;s great for the price, non-greasy, very moisturizing.  I also love the foot cream they make.</li>
            <li> My fiancee and I love this hand cream. I do a lot of tree work and outdoor labor which is very rough on my hands, and this makes all the difference in the world. Smells nice, and keeps my hands soft for the lady! Slightly scented but smells nice.</li>
            <li> I got a little tube from my local drug store. It was the best handcream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this hand cream, and after reading the reviews I decided to try it.  My skin is very dry and this cream is very good for moisturizing my hands.  At first I was afraid it would be too greasy, but it isn&#x27;t.  It is absorbed fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any signs of itself on paper or anything else.  I&#x27;m using it on my arms and also massaging it into my nails and cuticles.  The fragrance is nice, but very light.  This is a much thicker cream than many I&#x27;ve used, and can be used on legs and knees as well.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, and I think I need another tube for upstairs, too.  This one is in the kitchen.  I wish I&#x27;d discovered it sooner.</li>
            <li> We have been using this stuff for quite a while.  It really works for dry skin in this desert environment.  Non-greasy.  Instant relief.  We have this stuff at work, in the cars, bathroom, kitchen, living room, etc.  I have tried other stuff, like bag balm--nasty and greasy.  Most hand lotions don&#x27;t seem to have much residual effect.  This one seems to stay with you even through a hand washing or  two.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast &amp; as described.  No complaints!  Great Stuff!!</li>
            <li> This product soaks into skin quickly. My hands felt moisturized immediately and stayed feeling moisturized thoughout the day. I noticed improvements in my skin by the second day.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I \\&quot;really\\&quot; like this hand cream.  We both use it at least twice a day. Highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Hand cream very effective in moisturing extremely dry hands; absorbs well into skin leaving no noticeable residue; pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have a severe problem with rough, dry hands that crack open all the time. I used Miracle Hand Cream for years and found that it was the only one on the market, including precription creams,that really do heal my hands. I was also lucky enough to find this cream on Amazon.Com and saved a lot of money, probably half of what I was paying in other stores. &lt;br /&gt;Thank You &lt;br /&gt;Chat M Hollis</li>
            <li> My chapped hands adore it.</li>
            <li> I love using this lotion from Fall to Spring.  I also used it on a friend in the nursing home and she loved the feel of her hands and arms afterwards.</li>
            <li> this product does not work like it is advertised on tv. i would not buy it again. it does not repair your hands like it says it will do !</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product from a friend who sells cosmetics and accessories. I have issues with my cuticles getting really dry from working with tons of papers and labels and dusty bottles in a pharmacy. They are so dry that I will pick at them all the time and mangle my cuticles.     I do like the cream. The product is great! Not greasy at all. Leaves on a nice thick-kind of feeling without the oily feel the hands that I don&#x27;t like. I&#x27;m only a little disappointed that the cream did not take care of the dryness I experience daily. I would say that it has made a slight improvement on the dryness of my cuticles, but I don&#x27;t apply it regularly either. If I can get to it, I may apply the cream 1-2 times a day at most. And it seems that I wash my hands so frequently that I can feel it washing off half of the time. It&#x27;s worth a try if you have dry hands, just not cuticles!</li>
            <li> I have bought this cream before and really love it.  Soothes my winter dry hands.  Quickly repairs badly cracked fingertips.  No scents, so great for men as well as women.</li>
            <li> Best Hand and Foot repair creme we have found.  And priced right.  Non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Helps with my eczema on my hand</li>
            <li> very good product. scaly hands are in good condition now</li>
            <li> It is without a doubt the best hand (face and body) lotion I ever used. It has a nice fragrance and does not feel heavy or greasy! Amazon sell this without tax or shipping cost, that&#x27;s a real bonus on top of finding such a great product.</li>
            <li> This cream is good but not amazing. It helps me just a little bit. My hands gets cracked with the first cold day and it&#x27;s so hard to find the cram to heal them and keep them nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is not the best choice</li>
            <li> Love this deep lotion! Makes hands feel great!</li>
            <li> I have severe dry skin, especially in the winter months, that affects my elbows and knees.  After following the directions, and about 2 to 3 days, my skin is soft and has that natural color.  There is a light fragrance so it doesn&#x27;t make one have an overpowering scent.  The lotion is soft and not &#x27;oily&#x27;.  It works better than other more expensive premium lotion out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is really worth a try.</li>
            <li> The best hand cream ever!!! My hands peel so bad from cleaning and doing dishes and this cream has worked magically!!</li>
            <li> I have bought this hand cream before and left it in my drawer at work, everybody keeps dipping in and using it so it is now a constant.  Even the men like to use it because the smell is not too feminine and it is really effective.</li>
            <li> i am a diabetic and have very dry feet and hands this works great for me. i also have dyshydrosis  (my hands and feet dont sweat)</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt one of the best hand (or anywhere you have dry skin) creams I have ever used.  It lasts, it&#x27;s not greasy or watered down, and it gets results.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Im addicted to this hand cream. It is really a miracle! I have eczema really bad on my hands and after trying many different creams this is the only one that has releaved the itching and dryness.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any mirracle after I regiously used this. This is a total waste of money if you are expecting miracle. But if you are just using it for instant moisturizer, it work good</li>
            <li> My hands split often when working outside.  I keep super glue to close up these &amp;#34;paper cut&amp;#34; type injuries but after using this for a week, no more irritating splits</li>
            <li> Downfall of the container tho.  The lid doesn&#x27;t work. So if you poke a hole in the top to use normal...&lt;br /&gt;the lid won&#x27;t lock, so if it comes out, you are SOL.&lt;br /&gt;We won&#x27;t poke a hole in the lid, but seems strange to have a top that doesn&#x27;t click to lock.</li>
            <li> Miracle Hand Repair, is the best of the best! If your hands are dry and crack, definitely try this lotion! You WILL NOT be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The product was just as we expected and we use it all the time. We are satisfied with the product :)</li>
            <li> very pleased wtih this product...</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product, ladies it seriously works, I bought one from Ross Yesterday, tried it at night and this morning as I woke up, I felt my hands are SUPER soft, fresh, clean. I never liked my hands before for they were always dry, but I guess I love them now. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why am writing this review on Amazon is that I came in to check if I can buy more after running out of it.</li>
            <li> Works very very well .... I&#x27;ve used a lot of different hand lotions and nothing worked... I had cracked bleeding hands very painful used this for about a week at least 6 or more times at first ( because my hands were so bad ) and this healed them wonderful</li>
            <li> good item.good job.thanks</li>
            <li> My finger tips crack during he winter from all the hand washing I do(to avoid flu).  Most hand lotions leave my hands very greasy, while this product, in reasonable amounts, doesn&#x27;t.  Still get a few cracks now and then but It&#x27;s because I forget to use the lotion sometimes.  Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with the product, the price could be a bit lower but it is quite a bit of lotion.</li>
            <li> Miracle Hand Repair is an excellent product.  My hands are very dry as are my feet and Miracle Hand keeps the skin on my hands and feet flexible and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pat Wilkinson</li>
            <li> It helps somewhat.  I can&#x27;t say it does what it says.  My fingers crack and bleed in the cold winter weather.  It does not stop that.  Other than that, it absorbs really well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and just keep buying it</li>
            <li> After this very long, dry winter, I found my favorite hand cream was not working to keep my finger tips from cracking. I remembered a few year ago I had tried Miracle Hand Repair and my fingers were protected. I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in the store anymore, so I looked it up online and was so happy to find it. I ordered some for my daughter too.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hand lotion and I have very dry hands.  It lasts all day and you only need a little bit of it.  One order of this lasted me 2 years and I applied it every day, that is how little you need to apply.</li>
            <li> My wife depends on it for a skin condition.  She has been using for quite some time.</li>
            <li> It is too bad that you can&#x27;t get this across into Canada.  I originally bought it at Bed Bath and Beyond and then they quit stocking it due to customs.  Now I have to wait til I go to the States and I stock up.  Best Hand Cream I have ever used and there has been a lot!</li>
            <li> Good delivery. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Works as needed! Great product</li>
            <li> The best product of it&#x27;s kind on the market. 60% aloe vera</li>
            <li> working , and using the chemicals to clean, my hand crack all the time, and are very sensitive to cleaning products. This is the ONLY product I have found that heals the cracks and dryness. Plus, keeps them healthy looking. Totally worth the money, and lasts a while.  Wonderful, product!....and Great Price</li>
            <li> Hand cream is certainly one of those things that is very personal on whether you like it or not, however both my wife and I LOVE this hand cream!  We live in the second driest State in the Nation (for humidity) and this stuff does the job. We put it on while watching a little TV at night and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> Living in Nevada&#x27;s dry air something extraordinary is required to keep my hands from cracking. I tried so many different grocery and drug store products that didn&#x27;t work. Then I found this product. This is the only one I have used for some number of years. But it is equally great on arms, legs and even feet.</li>
            <li> it is a good product for this price</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Will make your hands as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> Bought this first at Bed, Bath and Beyond since I worked in Preschool and washing hands a lot made them dry out.  So, I tried this and it works great.  I even gave small ones to my co-workers as gifts.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve never really gone on a mission for the perfect hand cream, I will say that for me this is as close as any has come thus far. Hence my purchase of an 8oz bottle. Of hand cream. That&#x27;s a lot of hand cream for one person. I only really use it in winter or after doing lots of dishes, but I have become so attached that I fear being without it. What makes this one so special? It moisturizers without leaving a greasy film - no frills, no calming/sexy/energizing/etc scent. No real scent to speak of, certainly not one that lingers. It just quietly does the job well. It allows me to actually use my hands within seconds of application. However silly, that was previously my biggest gripe with creams -- my hands would be rendered unusable for minutes, if not longer, unless I was okay with leaving greasy fingerprints on anything I touched. In sum: highly recommended</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  My elbows felt like sandpaper and I have used this a little over a week.  I purchased 4 of these and gave one to my sister. It is good on the hands too.</li>
            <li> Absolutely best for repairing hands.  Gave it to most of my friends.  Not just for the gals.  The guys really loves it, too.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it!&lt;br /&gt;(This line to fulfill the stupid 20 character requirement, which is why I don&#x27;t usually write these reviews unless the purchase is really disappointing)</li>
            <li> Aloe has been a &amp;#34;wonder&amp;#34;  additive for years. This product has found a great use for this ingredient. My wife loves it and I have started to use it with winter approaching and humidity dropping. Great job, price, excellent product.</li>
            <li> I had very bad hand. Ordered this product to see what it can do. I figured that I got nothing to lose. Anyway, this lotion is ok. I still like the o&#x27;keeffe&#x27;s working hands much better as it stays in your hand longer keeping my hand (palm) moist.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find a product that works on dry hands better than this stuff.  Even helps heal an occasional acne blemish in no time.</li>
            <li> This product works!  During the cold months I suffer from dry cracked skin Miracle Hand Repair keeps my skin moist, no signs of cracking. You don&#x27;t need to use much. I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I really like the product. I give it as a gift for my husband and my son. They work outdoors, and that&#x27;s really hard on the hands. The consistency seems to have changed slightly. Not as thick as the last tubes I purchased. So far the husband and son are using it and no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, and yes, I will buy it again!&lt;br /&gt;Connie</li>
            <li> This is great for dry, chapped, cracked hands. Not to greasy and not much scent.  I use it every night before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hand cream for the last three years.  I discovered it by accident in a gift shop, bought a tube there, and have been purchasing it from Amazon ever since!  (Need I say-- the price is much better on Amazon) I cannot live without this- nor will I.  The fragrance is extremely pleasant and not overbearing and the texture is thick, but absorbs and quickly dissipates. I put it on everynight just before bed when my hands seem most thirsty.  I have to have this product to get me through our cold winters.</li>
            <li> Glad to have found more than a sample 1oz size. That&#x27;s how I was introduced to this product.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for very dry hands or just as &amp;#34;upkeep&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;liquidy&amp;#34; or greasy, and it soaks in well. This can be used by men and women.&lt;br /&gt;Note: the smell isn&#x27;t the most pleasant on your hands after use, but it hydrates very dry and/or calloused hands! It&#x27;s not awful. You could always use a little scented lotion after if you have a tendency to put them near your nose.</li>
            <li> Very light scent, very moisturizing and non-greasy. LOVE!</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be good for my hands! it is just like any other lotion! But it is way more pricier. I have really dry hands!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of problems with the skin on my fingers cracking, drying, and hang nails. After about 2 weeks using this product, the cracks and peeling have gone away. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> It smells bad, doesn&#x27;t work, smells like the worst cheap perfume ever, and I just can&#x27;t get over the smell. IT made me wanna puke.</li>
            <li> Nothing works as good.  I&#x27;ve tried all the other products.</li>
            <li> Very,very Nice!Great Item&#x3D;Great Seller+Fast Shipping+Great Communication.Thank U</li>
            <li> Fast ship, works as expected just like the foot one.  Bought for my Mom, AGAIN, best price onthe web.  Buy</li>
            <li> Good Stuff. I have used it before..</li>
            <li> I only bought this out of shear desperation, and thinking once again - throwing my money away.  I work in health care and was my hand over 30+ times a day.  Every day (during the winter) I come home and my skin is literally cracked on my knuckles and on my fingers.  So....... having it in a box I decided to try it, thinking it would do nothing.  I - was - wrong!!  By a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; it worked. I put it on when I went to sleep, and woke up and my hands were great!  My hands were still a little dry but my knuckles felt GREAT, they were no longer cracked, hurting, or bleeding!  But I was still pessimistic.  But night after night it worked!  I don&#x27;t know how, but it does.  Defiantly worth a try!</li>
            <li> the best hand cream ever! I had knuckle problem. I play violin and my knuckle stretched out. it looked horrible I  tried to hide my knuckle and tried every cream. only this one worked for me.</li>
            <li> Very rich nourishing hand cream.  Bought specifically for my Dad who suffers from severe atopic dermatitis.  Steroid creams had left his skin so very dry and scaly.  This cream made quite a difference.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the other big namers, and the only one that used to help was Udder Balm.  Now, this is the only repair for my dry, cracked, and bleeding hands.  No joke, a liberal amount before bed, and overnight better than 50% improvement.  I cannot say everyone will have the safe good fortune that I do with this stuff, but being a big tough guy, it hurts to have cracked and bleeding hands, and this stuff doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling like you rubbed female lotion all over, non greasy, and smell is pleasant.  Only thing I have noticed is that my nails will grow faster the more I consistently use this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dry hands - I&#x27;m a very outdoorsy person - always around horses, dogs, the garden. My hands get dry very quickly and the skin above my nails painfully cracks. This hand cream has helped me no end.</li>
            <li> my dad burned his hand years ago it stays chapped I found this hand cream for him a few years ago he wanted more.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because my family and I have always had a problem with dry skin on our hands and also eczema on our bodies and this product works Fantasticly!!!  You don&#x27;t need at a time and it works Great and last a long time!!  This is the Best stuff we&#x27;ve found!!</li>
            <li> This hand lotion was a gift to my mom who has a cleaning job, hard on the hands.  She says its awesome!  My hands get dry and irritated too from winter and frequent hand washing.  This product is great for me too.  Thanks amazon.  Priced better than local stores.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, rubs in wonderfully and is the best for a person with hand and foot issues (like a diabetic)</li>
            <li> Okay, I am not sure I would classify this hand cream as a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; because that would be a bit of a stretch.  But it is darn good cream.  I am one of those people who gets those truly painful thumb and finger splits in the winter.  If you get them too, you know I am not exaggerating when I talk about the pain.  So I am always on the prowl for good hand cream.  For me a good hand cream is one that moisturizes without feeling greasy.  This cream does exactly that.  It feels like good penetrating moisture and it leaves my hands feeling soft, not greasy.  It really is wonderful stuff.  I am deducting a star simply because for me it hasn&#x27;t been the miracle hand repair that its name suggests.  I have had two pesky thumb splits for the past 6 weeks that go away only temporarily (I use crazy glue to repair them which, if you haven&#x27;t tried it, works like a charm.  Its a little trick I learned from a surgeon) but the cream doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping to repair them fully.  Its good cream and its cream that I don&#x27;t mind using several times a day because as I said it leaves my hands feeling soft and not greasy and for me that is very important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:  I would definitely recommend this cream but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say that your split fingers will get healed,  But if what you want is a good skin softening hand cream, this is very good stuff.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  Good value.</li>
            <li> Heals like Pure Aloe right out of the plant!  Thanks for the amazing product.  Nice creamy texture in an easy to use tube.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s hands crack and bleed in the winter, and this hand cream has not only repaired his hands but it has helped prevent further cracking and bleeding.  I&#x27;ve been using the hand cream on my feet, and that works well too.  I am going to try the foot repair, and see if that works as well.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands 10-15 times a day (I am a teacher) so they&#x27;re always very dry. My knuckles crack and bleed every winter. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of hand creams, but none of them healed my extremely dry skin. I bought this cream at Bed Bath and Beyond, and the next day my hands were much softer! I use it every morning and before I go to bed, and my hands are always soft and smooth now. I highly recommend this hand cream for anyone who washes their hands a lot, and who wants a daily treatment for their hands. This cream will protect your hands, and the high Aloe content heals very dry skin quickly.</li>
            <li> Miracle Hand Repair cream is truly quite miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week I was in a drug store waiting for a prescription for my daughter.  To pass the time, I poked around looking at various products.  Since my fingers crack and peel, I am always on the hunt for hand creams that really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across Miracle Hand Repair cream in a convenient 1 oz tube and purchased it, hoping for the best.  Well, I was not disappointed.  This is a superior product that leaves my hands and finger tips feeling smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it.  You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Very slightly scented of aloe (which is great, because not overpowering), absorbs quickly and shows results quickly. Good buy for the price</li>
            <li> Its a little  expensive  but its working, no as fast as i thought but its working</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a flight attendant and I&#x27;ve tried almost everything to help my super dry hands.I have cuticles that cracks and it hurts bad specially in the winter time so I gave this cream a try and to my surprise it worked. It really is a miracle. I have eczema too and it helped me a lot I&#x27;m on my 4th container and would continue on purchasing this item. As a person w eczema I&#x27;ve tried all the body butters, lotions etc. They work also but this 1 works the best. I always have a small container in my pocket so I can use it right away when I need it. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hand creams I have tried! Pleasant, light scent, and the cream works wonders on dry hands!</li>
            <li> This cream works so well on my over worked hands.  Helps with those nasty cracks etc.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t completely remove dry skin.</li>
            <li> A waste of money. I doesn&#x27;t help my dry hands at all.</li>
            <li> This product also arrived fairly quickly this was packed in the same box as the Neutrogena facial cleanser. This was not damaged and is a very good product. I wish I could buy it from the UK and not have to go through the USA</li>
            <li> I use this daily.  Wonderful product and now I see it is carried in a lot of stores, too.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001BKTIOM Miracle Of Aloe Miracle Hand Repair Cream Travel Size]]  Excellent product. My hands were cracked and rough, but after applying Miracle of Aloe, they are without the little cracks and cuts that were not only bad looking but hurt all the time.  I highly recommend this cream to everyone that has rough and cracked hands.</li>
            <li> I have a drawer full of partially used hand creams. This is because I can never find one that does a good job but doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling greasy. While staying at a friend&#x27;s house, she had this hand cream and I was astonished at how well it worked. I went home and ordered some for myself.</li>
            <li> There is nothing to compare to this hand cream.  The main ingredient, aloe, helps to heal and soften dry, cracked hands.  We can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t heal my skin problems but the cream is very thick and doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance, good or bad.</li>
            <li> refuse to use anything else.. this cream/lotion is NOT greasy and does everything it promises and more! I had a cast on my leg for 12 weeks so needless to say when it came off my leg had more scales than a fish (eeewwwww)  This cream took care of the problwm with-in 2 application</li>
            <li> I used to use Cutemol but went with this because it&#x27;s larger. I&#x27;m a nervous cuticle picker so this really repairs my fingers overnight. It&#x27;s a thick, greasy formula; not something I would use regularly during the day. Might be better to use with gloves to prevent leaving grease marks everywhere. But the product itself is excellent.</li>
            <li> I really love this foot cream but the hand cream has this smell to it that I really can&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer but did not resolve my dry hand issue</li>
            <li> I use this at the job because I work with with cardboard and in cold conditions which are very drying for my hands. The bottle easily fits in my bag and does not leak when I take it with me. This cream absorbs quickly and is long lasting. My hands look and feel immediately better after just one application.</li>
            <li> Great !! This is very good hand cream.  Does not have a smell.  I have highly sensitive skin and allergies, and this product is awesome.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but it works on my dry calloused and cracked hands.&lt;br /&gt;A larger size would due to the amount I have to use on 1 application.</li>
            <li> I looooove this hand cream! My hands are disgustingly dry during the winter. This is the only cream that will help my dry, cracked hands! I need to carry it with me everywhere for immediate relief! Well worth every cent!</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; daily foot cream. It IS like a miracle. Nothing like it anywhere else!</li>
            <li> LOVE this cream....helps my aging hands a lot.</li>
            <li> Easiest review to write for Miracle of Aloe as I am a long time user because the product works. Purchased my first hand and feet repair cream on QVC several years back. My husband and I have been faithful users since. Apply twice a day for a week and you will agree. This is a wonderful product for anyone that suffers from dry hands, which crack and peel.</li>
            <li> My hands get very cracked from the work I do. This cream keeps them from feeling that dry and rough feeling.</li>
            <li> I keep this by my bed and use it as a nighttime hand cream (one of the only times I seem to remember to use hand cream or lotion).  I love that it&#x27;s thick, and I find it generally non-greasy and fast-absorbing.  I know it&#x27;s summer right now, but this week, I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of heavy-duty cleaning, so my hands are getting some pretty harsh treatment.  And yet they feel soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I recently burned a couple of fingers.  It wasn&#x27;t bad enough to go to the doctor, but there are some sensitive areas where the blistered skin peeled away.  I think that using this cream has helped speed the healing (probably because of the aloe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are in one of the product images.  I don&#x27;t care for the fact that this includes a paraben.  Also, I find it odd that this includes tolnaftate (an antifungal, the active ingredient in Tinactin athlete&#x27;s foot medication).  I suppose that reduces the likelihood that you&#x27;ll get fungal infections in the skin on your hands?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I really don&#x27;t care for the smell of this product.  I&#x27;m not sure which ingredient is responsible for the odor and the odor is proving difficult to describe.  It may be an individual preference only.  On the one hand, I&#x27;m grateful that this doesn&#x27;t include any artificial dyes.  But since it does contain fragrance, I rather wish they&#x27;d chosen a different or stronger one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I find this effective at keeping my hands in good shape even when I&#x27;m not so good to my hands, and it additionally seems to be helping my burned fingers heal.</li>
            <li> Nice cooling lotion won&#x27;t sting if hands are too dry and chapped hands looked normal after a couple weeks if dry and cold winter should buy a few tubes because you&#x27;ll probably need it</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever!! Especially in the winter!</li>
            <li> Best hand cream for rough hands. Not greasy. It does what it says.</li>
            <li> I have tried many hand creams before this one, but they are either too oily or smelly. This hand cream doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance smell but like the herb. It feels oily at the beginning but it fades away after 2-3 minutes, and you will never feel dry until you wash it away. And it&#x27;s easy to wash off. Once I had burnt in my hand, but the scar is hardly seen after about a month using this hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have is this hand cream is a little thin, and maybe not thick for winter.</li>
            <li> This works great on elbow&#x27;s and summertime feet!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this cream for her hands.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Well kinda...  It really does make them look and feel better.  Maybe not like they once did but close.  Great product.  So is its companion, the Miracle Foot Repair.</li>
            <li> Like this because it isn&#x27;t greasy and seems to really make my hands soft. My mom also loves it and she is picky about lotion being greasy.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders and has helped my hands especially in the winter months. It was a great price as well.</li>
            <li> My favorite...AS SEEN ON TV MHRCD12 Miracle Hand Repair Cream....works really well absorbs my daughter also loves it as well.</li>
            <li> After moving to New Mexico I tried all kinds of lotions to combat the dry climate. This stuff works. Both ;my husband and I use it every day. It is AWESOME. Especially on dry hands and feet . But we use it for face as well. I keep stocked up on it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grand son and he just loves it. He suffers with very dry skin and this helped to make him feel smoother and not so worried about his skin problems. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Only thing I&#x27;ve found that works in the winter.</li>
            <li> I foolishly sandpapered my fingers to get rid of hard skin and they ended up with cracks in them that were bleeding, I couldn&#x27;t pick anything up, my fingers were so sore.  After using the cream for one day the pain has gone, I can pick things up and the cracks are healing beautifully.  I would recommend this cream to everyone who has sore hands.&lt;br /&gt;It is indeed a miracle cream that does what it says!!!!</li>
            <li> This one seems to be helpful, but not as good as some other products.</li>
            <li> As a nurse I wash my hands non stop. My hands crack and bleed every winter. I bought this cream at the store. When I first put it on, I thought I had truly found a miracle cream....not so much. 10 minutes later my knuckles were rough and dry. I will be returning this cream to the store. Crabtree and Evelyn&#x27;s hand therapy is much much better. Miracle hand repair probably would work for someone with mildly dry hands.</li>
            <li> Great product - less expensive online</li>
            <li> Best hand cream for dry cracked hands.</li>
            <li> I like this is cream!</li>
