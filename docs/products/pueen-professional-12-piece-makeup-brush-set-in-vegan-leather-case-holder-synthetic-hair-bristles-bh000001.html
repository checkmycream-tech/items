            <li>Cute and came in handy for traveling</li>
            <li>Some of my favorite makeup brushes that I own.</li>
            <li>there super soft  .. and like anything else u have to use them a couple times for them to work perfect.. and thats for all makeup brushes .. they work good..</li>
            <li>When I got it in the mail I thought it was cute but had a very strong like paint odor to it.</li>
            <li>I am an avid makeup collector, and I know a GREAT deal when I see one.</li>
            <li>but I washed them and they work just fine!</li>
            <li>I loved the pretty case!  </li>
            <li>and as I continued brushing my finger against it, more fell out.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
            <li>The stippling brush is okay.</li>

            <li>More words superfluous.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes.</li>
            <li>I can deal with that, the case still looks cute.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly washed them an wasn&#x27;t able to get the smell out all the way.</li>
            <li>So far, i loved them, and i loved the price as well :)</li>
            <li>Love the storage cup it comes along with,no warping or misshapen area&#x27;s on it.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>they some in is just adorable.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>not as sturdy as i hope but ok</li>
            <li>I have used them numerous times to do her make-up, they are excellent quality.</li>
            <li>I love the color, case, and the quality.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that the case doubles as cup to display them in.</li>
            <li>Love the chunky handels that&#x27;s are not tapered at the ends</li>
            <li>Good purchase and worth the cash.</li>
            <li>I would taotally recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li>But, They are ok quality for the price I guess.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Have had them about two months now and love them.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love these brushes.</li>
            <li>these brushes are beautiful and very high quality and easy to wash</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited to use these.</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft and work great!</li>
            <li>Look good, and compatible with higher end ones.</li>
            <li>very nice and presentable case, do not complain about the price, but for my budget was somewhat high.</li>
            <li>Love it, I use it all the time, and it is easy to clean!</li>
            <li>I love the color but honestly these are really cheap they broke too quick @ and aren&#x27;t that sturdy,</li>
            <li>Very good quality for a low price</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s actually my first time using Pueen products, but i most say it is amazing.</li>
            <li>A great budget friendly brush set, washes well, the pink is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Great variety, you get all you need, very soft, apply everything smoothly.</li>
            <li>They fall apart easily</li>
            <li>Brushes are cute and the case is handy, but the brushes don&#x27;t hold powder pigments very well at all.</li>
            <li>The chemical smell is overwhelming to begin with and had to clean them twice to remove it.</li>
            <li>the smell of the brushes is strong .</li>
            <li>I had to wash them in alcohol and soap to get the strong smell off, but I had already read that in reviews.  </li>
            <li>Strong chemical smell when received, but</li>
            <li>I was VERY pleased with these brushes, and I&#x27;m very picky.</li>
            <li>For anyone who doesnt have makup brushes, is beginning with makeup or honestly just isnt willing to shell out 100</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>it was fine.</li>
            <li>they do have a very strong rubber/plastic smell to them when first opening</li>
            <li>Overall, I am VERY pleased with this purchase and do intend to buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li>They are really easy to clean and the case</li>
            <li>The tube allows you to pack the brushes up with ease and the case also helps keep the brushes free of dust when they are not being used.</li>
            <li>Overall though it&#x27;s a great buy</li>
            <li>Quality is awesome and they&#x27;ve lasted months of harsh use and vigorous washes.</li>
            <li>They came within a few days and were in great condition!</li>
            <li>I was very happy with promptness of shipping, the way it was packed and the overall set as a whole.</li>
            <li>Surprised by all the good reviews I decided to order them.  </li>
            <li>I was originally saving my money for a sigma brush set, but found these.</li>
            <li>I have several sets of brushes, but I don&#x27;t feel like an expert, all I know is quality when I see it, so for the price I was expecting something more than what I got, the brushes are fine and do not shed, and the variety you get is good, however, most of the head came off the moment I open the case, I super glued them and they are fine, but I believe for the price the quality should be better, I would not recommend this purchase</li>
            <li>these are really beautiful and soft and of high quality appearance though.</li>
            <li>The look, and feel of the brushes are really nice from what she tells me, and she said they&#x27;re better than the brushes she currently uses that are affordable but the quality isn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li>Like it:) really soft and cute.</li>
            <li>Good overall.</li>
            <li>She has enjoyed these so much</li>
            <li>They are cute, the holders are much smaller than expected but still awesome.</li>
            <li>They feel super soft and smooth I love it.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re the best quality you are ever going to get for such a low price.</li>
            <li>Brushes are smooth, no fallouts and works amazing especially for this unbeatable price!</li>
            <li>I love them they are cute great quality very soft and the brushes are thick</li>
            <li>Good basic or first starter brush kit to learn how to apply the makeup.</li>
            <li>These are pretty nice, soft.</li>
            <li>My niece even gasped when seeing them for the first time!</li>
            <li>Love love these brushes not only are they a beautiful pink they are so soft and luxurious on my skin.</li>
            <li>Nice brushes but color was mixed</li>
            <li>I loved that they were an even prettier pink</li>
            <li>The only reason why I am not giving 5 stars is because the largest brush that I received had a nice sized dent in the handle.  </li>
            <li>They did have a distinct odor to them</li>
            <li>its a great starter kit for a young girl who is just starting in makeup.</li>
            <li>It will be worth it.</li>
            <li>Also it would have been nice of them to put the protective piece on each big brush and not just the biggest one.</li>
            <li>This make brush set is nice, but they look different from the pictures.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>They come in a cute travel case and I just love the pink!</li>
            <li>I loved how once they all had their first bath, they didn&#x27;t shed a single hair!  </li>
            <li>I know right?</li>
            <li>Most sets just have the same brush over and over, but these actually have a nice variety to choose from.</li>
            <li>Great solid case is goood protection for home and especially b travel.</li>
            <li>They are very silky and soft to the touch, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the product so far.</li>
            <li>Like a good little girl, I took them to my sink and washed them with some of my suave professionals shampoo.  </li>
            <li>They look exactly like they did when they were first purchased, but we made sure to clean them with shampoo on a regular basis which really helps keep brushes looking fresh and new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still use the brushes I like, but I&#x27;ll be investing money on some top quality brushes such as sigma.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend these to a friend!</li>
            <li>so I had to hot glue them to star.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I also noticed a nice amount of shedding the first wash, which is expected.  </li>
            <li>sigma obviously lil better...</li>
            <li>I did wash them first because A)</li>
            <li>but if ur willing to work with them they will do the job eventually.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t come exactly as shown .</li>
            <li>The brushes are so pretty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smell funny</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked about them were that they were pretty brushes and soft as well.</li>
            <li>but they are good for what they cost and soft, but they&#x27;re pink</li>
            <li>This has super soft bristles and convenient packaging for travel!</li>
            <li>this set of brushes, are super soft, and has a variety of brushes.</li>
            <li>My favorite has got to be the loose powder brush.</li>
            <li>She also likes that this set has everything you need, and you can easily travel with them because they come in a nice case that can also double up as a everyday brush holder.</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and soft, I haven&#x27;t had any shedding, and they have held up through a couple washings without bleeding or the ferrule coming loose from the handle.</li>
            <li>so I was happy about that, and nothing seems to be broken or damaged.</li>
            <li>I decided I wouldn&#x27;t use it much</li>
            <li>makeup brushes, I know high quality when I see it!</li>
            <li>mostly these are face brushes not really for the eyes, my opinion .</li>
            <li>but when testing them I found that they didn&#x27;t blend very well and</li>
            <li>The foundation stippling brush did not apply my foundation to my face very well.</li>
            <li>Plus the color pink is her favorite.</li>
            <li>They really do the job quite well.</li>
            <li>but i dont really like the way the brushes for the eye shadow work</li>
            <li>so much is wort to buy this&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cute with pueen liable on brush handles.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>These are good brushes, and the case is cute, but the color is a disappointment.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s very soft, pretty, and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Pro: Very soft brushes, pretty color,</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with them other then the initial stink issue!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this set if you&#x27;re looking for a decent quality brush set.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t high quality whatsoever, but the travel carrier is decent.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend these.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them highly</li>
            <li>The case could be a little more spacious.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft, and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>The hair fibers are really soft and apply the make up and shadows very well.</li>
            <li>I feel like it wastes more product than it should.</li>
            <li>FIRST OF ALL, these are NOT pink.</li>
            <li>ok for the beginner to use .The leather for Package smells when i first open but after 3 days i left it open, odor stopped.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft and show no signs of shedding even after a year of daily use.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I was in need of a new make up brush set.</li>
            <li>Brushes are soft and handles are nice and thick.</li>
            <li>Im a 17 year old high school student.  </li>
            <li>if you want buy these brush do it because are very soft</li>
            <li>The fibers are very soft for synthetic fibers.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and there is no shedding.</li>
            <li>When you first open them, they do have a slight stench, but just wash them and they will be fine, nothing unordinary.</li>
            <li>These brushes are soft !</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re shiny, well made, and the contrast of black and red looks way better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft.  </li>
            <li>That only brushes I really use out of this set is the eyeliner brush, and all of the eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li>The brush that broke can be fixed with some superglue.</li>
            <li>Soft to the touch and against my skin.</li>
            <li>the larger brushes picked up to much makeup to my liking.</li>
            <li>Soft and plush brushes, comparable to Sedona Lace.</li>
            <li>no shedding so far</li>
            <li>I bought these brushes for my daughter last year for Christmas, she really loves them.</li>
            <li>I decided to get the PUEEN professional 18 piece set for myself just because hers have held up so well.</li>
            <li>i recive this brushes early n</li>
            <li>I started to use them and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>the picture, top of all brush set color are pink, but half of my brush set.....</li>
            <li>The only reason I give this four stars is because when putting the top of the case on if your not careful you&#x27;ll bend the bristles back and mess the brush up.</li>
            <li>I opened the pretty pink case it comes in and immediately got hit of the Oder of the brushes.</li>
            <li>and there it was, a pretty pink faux leather case.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>a little bit of super glue will do the trick of fixing them.</li>
            <li>They estimated 2-5 business days, which I initially thought was too EARLY!</li>
            <li>I was extremely excited for them to come, BUT the size was a little smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li>soft brushes but had to glue a couple back together.</li>
            <li>Very misleading and not what I expected or wanted.</li>
            <li>About only half the brushes were worth the money.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast well at least faster than what I expected.</li>
            <li>and I will absolutely recommend to others and purchase this again and other items in the future!</li>
            <li>Shed slightly first few uses.</li>

            <li> The price is remarkable and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Yes, the brushes are surprisingly softer than I had thought it would be, and it does not look cheap or plastic.</li>
            <li> My wife is so impressed with the Pueen Professional 12 Piece Makeup Brushes.</li>
            <li> Cute and came in handy for traveling</li>
            <li> Some of my favorite makeup brushes that I own.</li>
            <li> there super soft  .. and like anything else u have to use them a couple times for them to work perfect.. and thats for all makeup brushes .. they work good..</li>
            <li> When I got it in the mail I thought it was cute but had a very strong like paint odor to it.</li>
            <li> I am an avid makeup collector, and I know a GREAT deal when I see one.</li>
            <li> but I washed them and they work just fine!</li>
            <li> I loved the pretty case!  </li>
            <li> and as I continued brushing my finger against it, more fell out.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
            <li> The stippling brush is okay.</li>

            <li> Hope this helped your decision. :-)</li>
            <li> More words superfluous.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.</li>
            <li> I can deal with that, the case still looks cute.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly washed them an wasn&#x27;t able to get the smell out all the way.</li>
            <li> So far, i loved them, and i loved the price as well :)</li>
            <li> Love the storage cup it comes along with,no warping or misshapen area&#x27;s on it.</li>

            <li> they some in is just adorable.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> not as sturdy as i hope but ok</li>
            <li> I have used them numerous times to do her make-up, they are excellent quality.</li>
            <li> I love the color, case, and the quality.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that the case doubles as cup to display them in.</li>
            <li> Love the chunky handels that&#x27;s are not tapered at the ends</li>
            <li> Good purchase and worth the cash.</li>
            <li> I would taotally recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li> But, They are ok quality for the price I guess.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Have had them about two months now and love them.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes.</li>
            <li> these brushes are beautiful and very high quality and easy to wash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited to use these.</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft and work great!</li>
            <li> Look good, and compatible with higher end ones.</li>
            <li> very nice and presentable case, do not complain about the price, but for my budget was somewhat high.</li>
            <li> Love it, I use it all the time, and it is easy to clean!</li>
            <li> I love the color but honestly these are really cheap they broke too quick @ and aren&#x27;t that sturdy,</li>
            <li> Very good quality for a low price</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually my first time using Pueen products, but i most say it is amazing.</li>
            <li> A great budget friendly brush set, washes well, the pink is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Great variety, you get all you need, very soft, apply everything smoothly.</li>
            <li> They fall apart easily</li>
            <li> Brushes are cute and the case is handy, but the brushes don&#x27;t hold powder pigments very well at all.</li>
            <li> The chemical smell is overwhelming to begin with and had to clean them twice to remove it.</li>
            <li> the smell of the brushes is strong .</li>
            <li> I had to wash them in alcohol and soap to get the strong smell off, but I had already read that in reviews.  </li>
            <li> Strong chemical smell when received, but</li>
            <li> I was VERY pleased with these brushes, and I&#x27;m very picky.</li>
            <li> For anyone who doesnt have makup brushes, is beginning with makeup or honestly just isnt willing to shell out 100</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> it was fine.</li>
            <li> they do have a very strong rubber/plastic smell to them when first opening</li>
            <li> Overall, I am VERY pleased with this purchase and do intend to buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> They are really easy to clean and the case</li>
            <li> The tube allows you to pack the brushes up with ease and the case also helps keep the brushes free of dust when they are not being used.</li>
            <li> Overall though it&#x27;s a great buy</li>
            <li> Quality is awesome and they&#x27;ve lasted months of harsh use and vigorous washes.</li>
            <li> They came within a few days and were in great condition!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with promptness of shipping, the way it was packed and the overall set as a whole.</li>
            <li> Surprised by all the good reviews I decided to order them.  </li>
            <li> I was originally saving my money for a sigma brush set, but found these.</li>
            <li> I have several sets of brushes, but I don&#x27;t feel like an expert, all I know is quality when I see it, so for the price I was expecting something more than what I got, the brushes are fine and do not shed, and the variety you get is good, however, most of the head came off the moment I open the case, I super glued them and they are fine, but I believe for the price the quality should be better, I would not recommend this purchase</li>
            <li> these are really beautiful and soft and of high quality appearance though.</li>
            <li> The look, and feel of the brushes are really nice from what she tells me, and she said they&#x27;re better than the brushes she currently uses that are affordable but the quality isn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> Like it:) really soft and cute.</li>
            <li> Good overall.</li>
            <li> She has enjoyed these so much</li>
            <li> They are cute, the holders are much smaller than expected but still awesome.</li>
            <li> They feel super soft and smooth I love it.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re the best quality you are ever going to get for such a low price.</li>
            <li> Brushes are smooth, no fallouts and works amazing especially for this unbeatable price!</li>
            <li> I love them they are cute great quality very soft and the brushes are thick</li>
            <li> Good basic or first starter brush kit to learn how to apply the makeup.</li>
            <li> These are pretty nice, soft.</li>
            <li> My niece even gasped when seeing them for the first time!</li>
            <li> Love love these brushes not only are they a beautiful pink they are so soft and luxurious on my skin.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes but color was mixed</li>
            <li> I loved that they were an even prettier pink</li>
            <li> The only reason why I am not giving 5 stars is because the largest brush that I received had a nice sized dent in the handle.  </li>
            <li> They did have a distinct odor to them</li>
            <li> its a great starter kit for a young girl who is just starting in makeup.</li>
            <li> It will be worth it.</li>
            <li> Also it would have been nice of them to put the protective piece on each big brush and not just the biggest one.</li>
            <li> This make brush set is nice, but they look different from the pictures.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> They come in a cute travel case and I just love the pink!</li>
            <li> I loved how once they all had their first bath, they didn&#x27;t shed a single hair!  </li>
            <li> I know right?</li>
            <li> Most sets just have the same brush over and over, but these actually have a nice variety to choose from.</li>
            <li> Great solid case is goood protection for home and especially b travel.</li>
            <li> They are very silky and soft to the touch, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the product so far.</li>
            <li> Like a good little girl, I took them to my sink and washed them with some of my suave professionals shampoo.  </li>
            <li> They look exactly like they did when they were first purchased, but we made sure to clean them with shampoo on a regular basis which really helps keep brushes looking fresh and new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still use the brushes I like, but I&#x27;ll be investing money on some top quality brushes such as sigma.</li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend these to a friend!</li>
            <li> so I had to hot glue them to star.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> I also noticed a nice amount of shedding the first wash, which is expected.  </li>
            <li> sigma obviously lil better...</li>
            <li> I did wash them first because A)</li>
            <li> but if ur willing to work with them they will do the job eventually.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t come exactly as shown .</li>
            <li> The brushes are so pretty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smell funny</li>
            <li> The only thing I liked about them were that they were pretty brushes and soft as well.</li>
            <li> but they are good for what they cost and soft, but they&#x27;re pink</li>
            <li> This has super soft bristles and convenient packaging for travel!</li>
            <li> this set of brushes, are super soft, and has a variety of brushes.</li>
            <li> My favorite has got to be the loose powder brush.</li>
            <li> She also likes that this set has everything you need, and you can easily travel with them because they come in a nice case that can also double up as a everyday brush holder.</li>
            <li> The bristles are nice and soft, I haven&#x27;t had any shedding, and they have held up through a couple washings without bleeding or the ferrule coming loose from the handle.</li>
            <li> so I was happy about that, and nothing seems to be broken or damaged.</li>
            <li> I decided I wouldn&#x27;t use it much</li>
            <li> makeup brushes, I know high quality when I see it!</li>
            <li> mostly these are face brushes not really for the eyes, my opinion .</li>
            <li> but when testing them I found that they didn&#x27;t blend very well and</li>
            <li> The foundation stippling brush did not apply my foundation to my face very well.</li>
            <li> Plus the color pink is her favorite.</li>
            <li> They really do the job quite well.</li>
            <li> but i dont really like the way the brushes for the eye shadow work</li>
            <li> so much is wort to buy this&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cute with pueen liable on brush handles.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast.</li>
            <li> These are good brushes, and the case is cute, but the color is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s very soft, pretty, and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Pro: Very soft brushes, pretty color,</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with them other then the initial stink issue!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this set if you&#x27;re looking for a decent quality brush set.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t high quality whatsoever, but the travel carrier is decent.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend these.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them highly</li>
            <li> The case could be a little more spacious.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> The hair fibers are really soft and apply the make up and shadows very well.</li>
            <li> I feel like it wastes more product than it should.</li>
            <li> FIRST OF ALL, these are NOT pink.</li>
            <li> ok for the beginner to use .The leather for Package smells when i first open but after 3 days i left it open, odor stopped.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft and show no signs of shedding even after a year of daily use.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was in need of a new make up brush set.</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft and handles are nice and thick.</li>
            <li> Im a 17 year old high school student.  </li>
            <li> if you want buy these brush do it because are very soft</li>
            <li> The fibers are very soft for synthetic fibers.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and there is no shedding.</li>
            <li> When you first open them, they do have a slight stench, but just wash them and they will be fine, nothing unordinary.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft !</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re shiny, well made, and the contrast of black and red looks way better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft.  </li>
            <li> That only brushes I really use out of this set is the eyeliner brush, and all of the eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li> The brush that broke can be fixed with some superglue.</li>
            <li> Soft to the touch and against my skin.</li>
            <li> the larger brushes picked up to much makeup to my liking.</li>
            <li> Soft and plush brushes, comparable to Sedona Lace.</li>
            <li> no shedding so far</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for my daughter last year for Christmas, she really loves them.</li>
            <li> I decided to get the PUEEN professional 18 piece set for myself just because hers have held up so well.</li>
            <li> i recive this brushes early n</li>
            <li> I started to use them and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> the picture, top of all brush set color are pink, but half of my brush set.....</li>
            <li> The only reason I give this four stars is because when putting the top of the case on if your not careful you&#x27;ll bend the bristles back and mess the brush up.</li>
            <li> I opened the pretty pink case it comes in and immediately got hit of the Oder of the brushes.</li>
            <li> and there it was, a pretty pink faux leather case.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> a little bit of super glue will do the trick of fixing them.</li>
            <li> They estimated 2-5 business days, which I initially thought was too EARLY!</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited for them to come, BUT the size was a little smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> soft brushes but had to glue a couple back together.</li>
            <li> Very misleading and not what I expected or wanted.</li>
            <li> About only half the brushes were worth the money.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast well at least faster than what I expected.</li>
            <li> and I will absolutely recommend to others and purchase this again and other items in the future!</li>
            <li> Shed slightly first few uses.</li>
            <li> I looked all around and most sets came with a bunch of big brushes, a bunch of small brushes, but hardly any in between.  </li>
            <li> The next day after they were dry I tested them out.</li>
            <li> I checked back in about 30 minutes and the larger brushes were soaking wet still.</li>
            <li> The tips of the bricels are pink shown in the picture and the bricels are red when they show up , which isn&#x27;t a big deal .</li>
            <li> I gently pulled on the other brushes to get the loose hairs out and only a few came out.</li>
            <li> A little too soft and flimsy</li>
            <li> The brush hairs feel too synthetic and the holder is smaller than i expected.</li>
            <li> They are soft, yet firm, and they are not scratchy.  </li>
            <li> I rinsed them out and let them dry.  </li>
            <li> So now that they are dry</li>
            <li> but after I was shampoo it and let it air dry</li>
            <li> The smaller where not the proper fluffy or hardness</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish that the case holder was little wider.</li>
            <li> i ordered pink some where pink and others were fussia.</li>
            <li> I actually had to go over it a few times to make it even.</li>
            <li> but then for the price it was to be expected.</li>
            <li> Was delivered before I expected them.</li>
            <li> The photo shows pale pink brushes, but the brushes we received are all red with only one pale pink brush.</li>
            <li> As stated in previous reviews, they do have a slight smell when u just open it up.</li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is the second I ran my finger over the foundation brush, little hairs came out with it</li>
            <li> Also, the brushes came in BEFORE their due date.</li>
            <li> it shouldn&#x27;t have been other then</li>
            <li> The brushes came on the expected date!</li>
            <li> Not too big or too small.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any smell that the other reviews mentioned when I opened them.</li>
            <li> but thankfully i have other brushes!</li>
            <li> They hardly smell, and guess what the smell goes away in a few short hours of unpackaging them.</li>
            <li> and I love a few,  hate others.</li>
            <li> It did have a slight odor</li>
            <li> Hopefully after a few washes the smell will go away.</li>
            <li> Becuz I was in need of a few brushes that it offered.</li>
            <li> And use it everyday.</li>
            <li> By the way, they hardly had any sort of smell to them at all.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re buying newley made synthetic brushes that come in a faux leather bag, duh</li>
            <li> One con is the powder brush doesn&#x27;t let go of the powder like it sucks up all of the makeup.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re going to smell slightly like, well, FAKE LEATHER.</li>
            <li> But the fake leather case reeks so bad I had to spray it down with disinfectant</li>
            <li> and it still stinks.</li>
            <li> Not very good at applying the make up and is horrible at distributing my foundation in tricky spots</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too bad, but it was noticeable.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t smell that bad.</li>
            <li> they smelled bad from being in the case.</li>
            <li> the odor was just from the leather but not that bad as i read on review before i bought it..</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They fall apart easily</li>
            <li> Im a 17 year old high school student.  I bought this because I was in need of a new make up brush set.They came on time so I was happy about that, and nothing seems to be broken or damaged. (Note: I never write reviews). I opened the pretty pink case it comes in and immediately got hit of the Oder of the brushes. It&#x27;s not too bad, but it was noticeable. Hopefully after a few washes the smell will go away. I haven&#x27;t tried these out yet, and I will make an update as soon as I do. They are very silky and soft to the touch, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the product so far. Only complaint I have is the second I ran my finger over the foundation brush, little hairs came out with it and as I continued brushing my finger against it, more fell out. Id say a total of 6. No biggy. But the shedding did stop. I gently pulled on the other brushes to get the loose hairs out and only a few came out. I&#x27;m very excited to use these. Updates coming soon.    UPDATE: 1/12/14  So, I finally figured out how to edit my posts, or else the update would&#x27;ve came sooner. The shedding did continue a bit but it&#x27;s not horrible. I tried out every brush for you guys and I love a few,  hate others. My favorite has got to be the loose powder brush. It&#x27;s so soft.  The contour brush, I have no complaints. Probably the only one that hasn&#x27;t lost any hairs yet. The foundation/ concealer brush isn&#x27;t that great. I feel like it wastes more product than it should. Not very good at applying the make up and is horrible at distributing my foundation in tricky spots so I tend to use my fingers or the stippling brush. The stippling brush is okay. A little too soft and flimsy but it&#x27;s fine. I recently bought a \\&quot;dupe\\&quot; make up beauty sponge and I&#x27;ve been using that. That only brushes I really use out of this set is the eyeliner brush, and all of the eyeshadow brushes. The angled eyeshadow brush fell apart the second I went to pick it up. I decided I wouldn&#x27;t use it much so I didn&#x27;t make a big deal out of it. Very disappointing. Definitely dropping my rating from a 4 star to a 3. I&#x27;ll still use the brushes I like, but I&#x27;ll be investing money on some top quality brushes such as sigma. I&#x27;d recommend this set if you&#x27;re looking for a decent quality brush set. The brush that broke can be fixed with some superglue. Good luck, and Hopefully this helped!(:  Btw, the smell did fade</li>
            <li> FIRST OF ALL, these are NOT pink. They are red. only one brush is soft baby pink and its the blush one. Second, they do not shed what so ever. I&#x27;ve tested them all out, no shedding. They may not be 100 dollar brushed but they&#x27;re the best quality you are ever going to get for such a low price. last of all the smell. They don&#x27;t smell that bad. Like, at all. You&#x27;re buying newley made synthetic brushes that come in a faux leather bag, duh they&#x27;re going to smell slightly like, well, FAKE LEATHER. They hardly smell, and guess what the smell goes away in a few short hours of unpackaging them. I highly reccomend these. They&#x27;re shiny, well made, and the contrast of black and red looks way better in my opinion. For anyone who doesnt have makup brushes, is beginning with makeup or honestly just isnt willing to shell out 100+ dollars for some face brushes, these are for you.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. The bristles are nice and soft, I haven&#x27;t had any shedding, and they have held up through a couple washings without bleeding or the ferrule coming loose from the handle. Great value for the money.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes but color was mixed i ordered pink some where pink and others were fussia.</li>
            <li> I was VERY pleased with these brushes, and I&#x27;m very picky. I own Sigma, Mac, Etc. makeup brushes, I know high quality when I see it! Also, the brushes came in BEFORE their due date. When you first open them, they do have a slight stench, but just wash them and they will be fine, nothing unordinary. Overall, I am VERY pleased with this purchase and do intend to buy from this seller again! I would most definitely recommend these to a friend!</li>
            <li> They kept falling apart so I had to hot glue them to star. I do love the case.</li>
            <li> The brush hairs feel too synthetic and the holder is smaller than i expected. Lastly , they arrived in different color not like the picture!</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loves it.</li>
            <li> This has super soft bristles and convenient packaging for travel! I love it! It&#x27;s exactly as pictured. Will definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The brushes are okay. They aren&#x27;t high quality whatsoever, but the travel carrier is decent.</li>
            <li> Adorable, high-quality, and convenient to carry around. They are not my favorite brushes, but they are close! I am an avid makeup collector, and I know a GREAT deal when I see one.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough great things about these brushes! I ordered from inbeauty. They estimated 2-5 business days, which I initially thought was too EARLY! I know right? I just wanted the suspense to last a teeny bit longer. :-P Anyway, they were at my door in 2 days. I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I opened my box and there it was, a pretty pink faux leather case. I immediately took the brushes out and started to play.  By the way, they hardly had any sort of smell to them at all.  Like a good little girl, I took them to my sink and washed them with some of my suave professionals shampoo.  I rinsed them out and let them dry.  I checked back in about 30 minutes and the larger brushes were soaking wet still. My fault! I did not rinse them well enough.  I also noticed a nice amount of shedding the first wash, which is expected.  So now that they are dry and I have used them, what is my opinion? Fantastic!  I love that they are vegan brushes and no animals were harmed in the making of this review!  I loved that they were an even prettier pink then the pictures show!  I loved how once they all had their first bath, they didn&#x27;t shed a single hair!  I loved how they handled the makeup and didn&#x27;t leave residue all over my vanity or places it shouldn&#x27;t have been other then where I wanted!  I loved the pretty case!  Most of all, I loved the variety in size of these brushes.  I looked all around and most sets came with a bunch of big brushes, a bunch of small brushes, but hardly any in between.  This set is the opposite!  Every brush, that I was looking for was here!  All in all, I am one HAPPY customer.  The only reason why I am not giving 5 stars is because the largest brush that I received had a nice sized dent in the handle.  It doesn&#x27;t burden what the use is for, but I was just expecting perfection.  And if it wasn&#x27;t for that, it would totally be 5 across the board!!! Hope this helped your decision. :-)</li>
            <li> Good quality for price. Shed slightly first few uses. Good overall. Would recommend to those on budget. More words superfluous.</li>
            <li> the smell of the brushes is strong . but it does go away so deal with it...mostly these are face brushes not really for the eyes, my opinion . there super soft  .. and like anything else u have to use them a couple times for them to work perfect.. and thats for all makeup brushes .. they work good.. sigma obviously lil better... but no complaints here..</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. Looks just as pictured. No unwanted surprises here.  Soft to the touch and against my skin. No shedding of the brush fibers. And they clean very nicely with my Brush Egg. Carrying case comes in handy to transport for my vacations and perfect way to store them on my vanity. I use both ends to hold my additional brushes.</li>
            <li> It took 5 days for the brushes to come in. I was extremely excited for them to come, BUT the size was a little smaller than I thought. I can deal with that, the case still looks cute. Yet when I opened it, the brushes smelled a bit foul and when I was picking some up, a tip broke off. Checking all of the brushes, FIVE out of TWELVE tips broke off so I had to superglue it back on. Washing it got rid of the smell too. Yes, the brushes are surprisingly softer than I had thought it would be, and it does not look cheap or plastic. BUT I don&#x27;t think I should have paid $20.</li>
            <li> if you want buy these brush do it because are very soft&lt;br /&gt;I can compare with sigma brushes because both are good</li>
            <li> I am so happy I got these.  I had to wash them in alcohol and soap to get the strong smell off, but I had already read that in reviews.  I have lost none of the bristles in washing and they apply beautifully.  I use them every day.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. But the fake leather case reeks so bad I had to spray it down with disinfectant and it still stinks. The brushes are super soft and work great! I did wash them first because A) your supposed to and B) they smelled bad from being in the case. They haven&#x27;t she&#x27;d at all. They also did not bleed when washed. I am very satisfied with them other then the initial stink issue! You should re think the fabric used on the cases...</li>
            <li> ok for the beginner to use .The leather for Package smells when i first open but after 3 days i left it open, odor stopped.  the odor was just from the leather but not that bad as i read on review before i bought it..</li>
            <li> I bought this product Becuz I was in need of a few brushes that it offered. When I got it in the mail I thought it was cute but had a very strong like paint odor to it. I thoroughly washed them an wasn&#x27;t able to get the smell out all the way. The next day after they were dry I tested them out. I already knew the brushes were a medium size but I always use larger brushes so that was a no no on my part but when testing them I found that they didn&#x27;t blend very well and the larger brushes picked up to much makeup to my liking. The foundation stippling brush did not apply my foundation to my face very well. I actually had to go over it a few times to make it even. These brushes weren&#x27;t for me at all but others seem to like them a lot. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them highly but if ur willing to work with them they will do the job eventually. The only thing I liked about them were that they were pretty brushes and soft as well.</li>
            <li> They where just what I wanted and they looked like the do in the pictures. I may get a hair out of them here and there but then for the price it was to be expected.</li>
            <li> Brushes are cute and the case is handy, but the brushes don&#x27;t hold powder pigments very well at all.</li>
            <li> The brushes came on the expected date! They did have a distinct odor to them but I washed them and they work just fine! I love the case it comes with too!</li>
            <li> Very good quality for a low price,  I bought this as a gift but now I want one for myself</li>
            <li> The quality is amazing, and the case is sturdy! I would recommend to anyone! Love it, I use it all the time, and it is easy to clean!</li>
            <li> this set of brushes, are super soft, and has a variety of brushes. I didn&#x27;t had any problems with the brushes breaking, yet, i only have had them for a month. So far, i loved them, and i loved the price as well :)</li>
            <li> Good basic or first starter brush kit to learn how to apply the makeup.Love the storage cup it comes along with,no warping or misshapen area&#x27;s on it.Love the eye brushes the kit includes,they pack on the color superbly and blend very well.One con is the powder brush doesn&#x27;t let go of the powder like it sucks up all of the makeup.Just worried with the face brushes won&#x27;t work as well as the eye brushes.</li>
            <li> I have several sets of brushes, but I don&#x27;t feel like an expert, all I know is quality when I see it, so for the price I was expecting something more than what I got, the brushes are fine and do not shed, and the variety you get is good, however, most of the head came off the moment I open the case, I super glued them and they are fine, but I believe for the price the quality should be better, I would not recommend this purchase</li>
            <li> My wife is so impressed with the Pueen Professional 12 Piece Makeup Brushes. I saw that they were in her wish list and decided to buy them for her. The look, and feel of the brushes are really nice from what she tells me, and she said they&#x27;re better than the brushes she currently uses that are affordable but the quality isn&#x27;t there. The brushes are soft, and very sturdy. She also likes that this set has everything you need, and you can easily travel with them because they come in a nice case that can also double up as a everyday brush holder. Plus the color pink is her favorite. She will like to get another set for backup. These brushes make a nice gift for any makeup lover.</li>
            <li> About only half the brushes were worth the money. The smaller where not the proper fluffy or hardness</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. 1 its a great starter kit for a young girl who is just starting in makeup. The fibers are very soft for synthetic fibers. They are really easy to clean and the case they some in is just adorable. They really do the job quite well.</li>
            <li> soft brushes but had to glue a couple back together. a little bit of super glue will do the trick of fixing them.</li>
            <li> Very good set of brushes on a budget. Great variety, you get all you need, very soft, apply everything smoothly. Great buy. The only thing I wish that the case holder was little wider.</li>
            <li> these brushes are beautiful and very high quality and easy to wash but i dont really like the way the brushes for the eye shadow work but thankfully i have other brushes! these are really beautiful and soft and of high quality appearance though.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually my first time using Pueen products, but i most say it is amazing. i love it.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft ! They don&#x27;t come exactly as shown . The tips of the bricels are pink shown in the picture and the bricels are red when they show up , which isn&#x27;t a big deal . I have a purpose for all these brushes , they are beautiful and applys product beautifully</li>
            <li> Great texture, cute case holder</li>
            <li> good seller, I recommend</li>
            <li> Soft and plush brushes, comparable to Sedona Lace. Amazing value for the price.</li>
            <li> Love them!!! Great brushes</li>
            <li> Good quality! The only problem is that instead of receiving 12 pieces of brushes, I received only 10 brushes.</li>
            <li> I just got my package ab</li>
            <li> I liked these when they came, but they fell apart after a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I needed a travel brush set and this was perfect!!! The tube allows you to pack the brushes up with ease and the case also helps keep the brushes free of dust when they are not being used.</li>
            <li> Great set for the prize. It will be worth it.</li>
            <li> not as sturdy as i hope but ok</li>
            <li> gooooood very fine nice thank you.. good company</li>
            <li> Like it:) really soft and cute. Does a great job, I like how it blends!!!! And looks great on my vanity table:)</li>
            <li> Purchased for my tween niece for Christmas.  She will love it!  I do!  I wouldn&#x27;t mind having a set.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> These are pretty nice, soft. The chemical smell is overwhelming to begin with and had to clean them twice to remove it.</li>
            <li> Pro: Very soft brushes, pretty color, good size&lt;br /&gt;Con: Strong chemical smell when received, but it&#x27;s gone after washed.&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy this product again? YES</li>
            <li> I love this great value and do the job</li>
            <li> AWESOME! Love these brushes!! Was delivered before I expected them. The brushes are so pretty. My niece even gasped when seeing them for the first time! Most sets just have the same brush over and over, but these actually have a nice variety to choose from. The only reason I give this four stars is because when putting the top of the case on if your not careful you&#x27;ll bend the bristles back and mess the brush up. The case could be a little more spacious. Also it would have been nice of them to put the protective piece on each big brush and not just the biggest one. Overall though it&#x27;s a great buy and I will absolutely recommend to others and purchase this again and other items in the future! I give them 100% on shipping! Wonderful!</li>
            <li> A great budget friendly brush set, washes well, the pink is gorgeous. no shedding so far and I use the heck out of my makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for my daughter last year for Christmas, she really loves them. I have used them numerous times to do her make-up, they are excellent quality. They look exactly like they did when they were first purchased, but we made sure to clean them with shampoo on a regular basis which really helps keep brushes looking fresh and new. The brushes are very soft and there is no shedding. She has enjoyed these so much I decided to get the PUEEN professional 18 piece set for myself just because hers have held up so well. The price is remarkable and worth every penny! I would recommend these to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a good quality brush set!!</li>
            <li> I love the color, case, and the quality. they do have a very strong rubber/plastic smell to them when first opening so I let the case air out. I washed them and the smell went away.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for a family member who LOVED it!!! I was very happy with promptness of shipping, the way it was packed and the overall set as a whole.</li>
            <li> These are good brushes, and the case is cute, but the color is a disappointment. The photo shows pale pink brushes, but the brushes we received are all red with only one pale pink brush. Very misleading and not what I expected or wanted.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  They are soft, yet firm, and they are not scratchy.  These are all the brushes I need to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> great make up brushes im in LOvE with them &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;thank u so much is wort to buy this&lt;br /&gt;plus i recive this brushes early n really great :))</li>
            <li> Love love these brushes not only are they a beautiful pink they are so soft and luxurious on my skin. I love the fact that the case doubles as cup to display them in. Love the chunky handels that&#x27;s are not tapered at the ends do you think it makes them easier to use.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Not too big or too small. Great solid case is goood protection for home and especially b travel. Brushes are soft and handles are nice and thick. Cute with pueen liable on brush handles. Good purchase and worth the cash. Great too add to  collection.</li>
            <li> good brushes and good quality. very nice and presentable case, do not complain about the price, but for my budget was somewhat high.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great for the brush. They are the perfect size and just the perfect color. I was really impressed with these brushes. They feel super soft and smooth I love it. The shipping was super fast well at least faster than what I expected. I would taotally recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li> Feel great, hold up well. Look good, and compatible with higher end ones. Gave them as a gift and there are loved.</li>
            <li> Vegan and cruelty free!! The brushes are super soft and show no signs of shedding even after a year of daily use. Comes with a great variety of brushes for the face and eyes.</li>
            <li> Cute and came in handy for traveling</li>
            <li> Some of my favorite makeup brushes that I own. I would recommend these to beginners and professionals alike! Quality is awesome and they&#x27;ve lasted months of harsh use and vigorous washes. This is the second set I&#x27;ve purchased from peen.  Love my Pueen brushes!</li>
            <li> These brushes are very good. As stated in previous reviews, they do have a slight smell when u just open it up. But that can be taken care of with a wash, or even conditioner. The hair fibers are really soft and apply the make up and shadows very well. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the color but honestly these are really cheap they broke too quick @ and aren&#x27;t that sturdy,😒😒😒</li>
            <li> This make brush set is nice, but they look different from the pictures. This is the reason for three stars...&lt;br /&gt;in the picture, top of all brush set color are pink, but half of my brush set.....They have red color.... I did not like the red color...But, They are ok quality for the price I guess.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes, wont shed , takes a couple of days for foul smell to wear off . Good for the price happy customer :)</li>
            <li> I love it. And use it everyday. Also it&#x27;s very soft, pretty, and shipping was fast. It did have a slight odor but after I was shampoo it and let it air dry it was fine. Great investment.</li>
            <li> I love them they are cute great quality very soft and the brushes are thick I&#x27;m very very happy with these brushes and the case they come in is cute and perfect for setting them up on a vanity table or taking them with me</li>
            <li> Very cute brushes. Well worth the price. I did not notice any smell that the other reviews mentioned when I opened them. Use them every day and have not had any problems. Have had them about two months now and love them.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes. They are cute, the holders are much smaller than expected but still awesome. Brushes are smooth, no fallouts and works amazing especially for this unbeatable price!</li>
            <li> Great set for the price. Does not shed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smell funny and they aren&#x27;t the best quality but they are good for what they cost and soft, but they&#x27;re pink so who cares.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast. Quality brushes for the price</li>
            <li> I was originally saving my money for a sigma brush set, but found these. Surprised by all the good reviews I decided to order them.  They came within a few days and were in great condition! I started to use them and was pleasantly surprised. They come in a cute travel case and I just love the pink! These are amazing brushes that I would reccomend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!</li>
