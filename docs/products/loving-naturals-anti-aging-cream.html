    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>&quot; with this cream is the best thing I can do</li>
            <li>The price is also very fair.</li>
            <li>and when I saw some friends they said my skin looked beautiful, just radiant.  </li>
            <li>It is a GREAT moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great rating on EWG.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are great.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>This face cream is amazing!  </li>
            <li>It smells so wonderfully earthy/minty and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Cruelty-free too; just makes this product even more perfect--THANK YOU Loving Naturals!!!!</li>
            <li>Healthy glowing ladies look wonderful, wrinkles and all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>its not oily, good for oily skin, smell like plants.</li>
            <li>I love this company!</li>
            <li>and it feels nice.</li>
            <li>It is nice to find something that does not have lots of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>my skin burnt like hell as if i have applied some kind of acid on my face</li>
            <li>I have been using Aubrey Organics aloe vera for over a year with good results, but was scared to try a moisturizer in fear of more break outs.</li>
            <li>May be nice in terms of texture and moisturizing qualities, but the smell is too pungent for me to use on my face.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cream and love this company! ...</li>
            <li>Thank you Loving Naturals.  :)</li>
            <li>and I am very happy to use a natural product that scores zero with EWG</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since found something else with great ratings on EWG that I like very much.</li>
            <li>it is a good moisturizer and absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>But more concerning, the safety seal was not attached...</li>
            <li>Wish the smell was more neutral.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well and has a \\&quot;seaweed\\&quot; or \\&quot;algae\\&quot; scent to it, but that&#x27;s what I also love about it..</li>
            <li>and my skin is getting better..</li>
            <li>Just be forewarned about the smell! :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell.</li>
            <li>I was researching on the Cosmetic Database for a safe moisturizer and this one got a 0 score I believe.</li>
            <li>my skin looks better since using it, but I can&#x27;t prove that.</li>
            <li>the smell is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I hope this product is available again soon because I&#x27;m almost out!</li>
            <li>more even complexion of skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thankyou so much Loving Naturals for producing such wonderful guilt free products.</li>
            <li>Better stuff out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be looking for something else that is not toxic and smells a bit better.</li>
            <li>I decided to give it a shot with the smaller size and am happy to report that I love it!</li>
            <li>Great affordable &amp; natural product!</li>
            <li>lotion is such a great price, rich but not greasy and is full of good things that the biggest porous organ of your body (your skin!)will love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used other anti-aging face products and I must say this is one of the best!  </li>
            <li>I am familiar with carott seed oil and personally love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great non-greasy moisturizer that is featured on the EWG Skin Deep Cosmetics database as a safe cosmetic.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like those creams that have a strong perfume smells either.</li>
            <li>The consistency is very good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy at all and glides on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>which the company also acknowledged and offered to ship another jar for free.</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy, light</li>
            <li>Seller upgraded to 2oz for free.</li>
            <li>This cream is not greasy, not too light, it&#x27;s just right!  </li>
            <li>My only hope is that Loving Naturals doesn&#x27;t stop selling this or change the formula!</li>
            <li>After using Loving Naturals body lotion, and not being able to find a face cream made without potentially toxic chemicals, I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li>After checking the EWG (Environmental Working Group) website for safe cosmetics, I was ready to go.    </li>
            <li>.. thought my skin was not taken care properly so it was damaged, reading all the postive reviews and good ratings at EWG</li>
            <li>I still love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I am sooooooooooo glad to have found an all natural product that is affordable and is easy to apply on the face.  </li>
            <li>This product is priced right and goes on smoothly without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t noticed any real changes in skin but knowing the products are all natural makes me feel good about using it.</li>
            <li>Loving Naturals has the highest rating from the Environmental Working Group, Skin Deep.  </li>
            <li>And I love that it is a natural product.  </li>
            <li>However, once it&#x27;s absorbed into the skin I don&#x27;t notice the smell.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a gardener who appreciates the pleasure of pulling fresh carrots from the soil, you might even like the scent.  </li>
            <li>But there are definitely som fragrance free creams that smell much better than this.</li>
            <li>But the best part is, my skin was actually complimented the other day.  </li>
            <li>At first, I was turned off to the smell of this product--sort of like earthy carrots, but the smell quickly dissipates and does not remain on your skin.  </li>
            <li>It kind of made my face feel dry, not moisturised.</li>
            <li>First of all, it took forever to come here.</li>
            <li>I have been using it consistently for about two weeks</li>
            <li>When i applied this cream for the first time..</li>
            <li>I definitely feel better using it, though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, 6/17/12:</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like the lipoic acid capsules but alot stronger.</li>
            <li>the cream has a different smell to others as it contains carrot seed oil, which has a strong earthy smell (as you would expect coming from a carrot!)but I wouldnt exactly say its offensive as others have suggested.</li>
            <li>I do have dry skin and this cream makes my face look more radiant</li>
            <li>and I have not broken out with any reaction or pimples.  </li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>But I will keep using it because I really like the results.  </li>
            <li>I have used the whole jar up</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>The cream does have a very transient earthy smell that probably comes from the carrot oil.  </li>
            <li>really like the cream</li>
            <li>The EWG gives it a zero rating and it works really well on diminishing wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Do you really care about anti-aging?</li>
            <li>Finding a paraben free, cruelty -free, non-toxic cream is quite hard.  </li>
            <li>I suppose it could be that I&#x27;ve gotten used to it, but immediately upon opening the new one, I thought that it had a much lighter scent.</li>
            <li>As it is now, I take a deep breath and quickly put it on because the fragrance is overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Users should be realistic about a product&#x27;s ability to \\&quot;reverse</li>
            <li>had high hopes that THIS IS THE ONE that will repair my dmaged skin..</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>price is high.</li>
            <li>There is a slight unusual smell at first, but it quickly goes away.  </li>
            <li>The odor, immediately after applying it, is perhaps the one thing I don&#x27;t love about it, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me after a few seconds.</li>
            <li>in few days skin was more moisturized&lt;</li>
            <li>I purchased a new tub of this product, and it seems that the odor is improved.</li>
            <li>Those who complain about the smell of the cream have to understand that most products contain artificial fragrances, many of which are endocrine-disruptors.  </li>
            <li>It is non-irritating on very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well it works!  </li>
            <li>I usually use neutrogena light night cream and love how moisturising and gentle it is but wanted to switch to a natural product, but i think just plain olive oil is gonna have to do from now on as i cannot use this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering and smells natural.</li>
            <li>Even my young son said to me \\&quot;gee mom, what&#x27;s that smell??\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>red patches are still visibile but not worst and no more</li>
            <li>BUT, human nature dictates, we get older, and things change...</li>
            <li>, it works, but I will have to think whether I order it next time, b/c of the high price.</li>
            <li>and I believe that in itself may hopefully slow down the whole process :)  </li>
            <li>I agree with all of the other positive comments.</li>
            <li>I waited 3 weeks to give it this review because I was half expecting my skin to start acting crazy from it, but so far so good!</li>

            <li> and I believe that in itself may hopefully slow down the whole process :)  </li>
            <li> I agree with all of the other positive comments.</li>
            <li> I waited 3 weeks to give it this review because I was half expecting my skin to start acting crazy from it, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> I compared the price of other natural creams and for example Calendula Cream from California Baby is only $15 for 2 oz.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only apply it at night because it seems a little too greasy for using under foundation (I use Bare Minerals powders).</li>
            <li> Not sure if that is normal or not.</li>
            <li> When you apply it it takes a long time for the smell to go away.</li>
            <li> I do not mind the smell; it is very subtle and fades quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have noticeable wrinkles yet, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working in that respect (under my eyes do look a little different).</li>
            <li> I am always on the lookout for real natural products and they are truly hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my face &amp; my very dry, cracked hands.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> My face has a rosy pink glow.  </li>
            <li> It also was not very moisturising.</li>

            <li> This face cream is amazing!  I have very sensitive dry skin, and every product I have ever used has broken me out.  Not this one--not one breakout!  I have been using it for about 2 months now, both in the morning under my makeup and at night.  It is a GREAT moisturizer.  It smells so wonderfully earthy/minty and refreshing.  Cruelty-free too; just makes this product even more perfect--THANK YOU Loving Naturals!!!!</li>
            <li> I am always on the lookout for real natural products and they are truly hard to find. I do have dry skin and this cream makes my face look more radiant and it feels nice. I absolutely love it. I have only been using it for a few weeks now. It is not greasy at all and glides on so smoothly. A little is all it takes. I do not mind the smell; it is very subtle and fades quickly. Did not cause my skin to breakout. Hope this helped.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream after reading about it&#x27;s great rating on EWG. However, I no longer use it. First of all, it took forever to come here. The company did acknowledge this and said it was due to a backlog of orders. But more concerning, the safety seal was not attached...which the company also acknowledged and offered to ship another jar for free. But I didn&#x27;t take them up on it because I don&#x27;t want to use the cream. It smells like dirt - literally. I don&#x27;t want a fragrance, but I don&#x27;t want it to be unpleasant - which this odor definitely was. Wish the smell was more neutral. In addition, there are small yellow \\&quot;spots\\&quot; in the cream. I&#x27;m not sure what they are, but it is throughout the product. Not sure if that is normal or not. It just makes me nervous to use. I&#x27;ve since found something else with great ratings on EWG that I like very much.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find organic facial moisturizer for a while now.  There always seemed to be something that was missing or didn&#x27;t work or worse--caused breakouts.  Finding a paraben free, cruelty -free, non-toxic cream is quite hard.  After checking the EWG (Environmental Working Group) website for safe cosmetics, I was ready to go.    At first, I was turned off to the smell of this product--sort of like earthy carrots, but the smell quickly dissipates and does not remain on your skin.  It is non-greasy, light and I have not broken out with any reaction or pimples.  But the best part is, my skin was actually complimented the other day.  I have been using it consistently for about two weeks and when I saw some friends they said my skin looked beautiful, just radiant.  Thank you Loving Naturals.  :)</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer.  It is nice to find something that does not have lots of chemicals.  I have used it on my face &amp; my very dry, cracked hands.  It is non-irritating on very sensitive skin.  There is a slight unusual smell at first, but it quickly goes away.  Great affordable &amp; natural product!</li>
            <li> I like this product its not oily, good for oily skin, smell like plants. I only use it at night.</li>
            <li> I am sooooooooooo glad to have found an all natural product that is affordable and is easy to apply on the face.  It absorbs well and has a \\&quot;seaweed\\&quot; or \\&quot;algae\\&quot; scent to it, but that&#x27;s what I also love about it..It&#x27;s not overpowering and smells natural.</li>
            <li> I used this cream for one and half weeks, I used to apply  twice a day (morning and bed time) .. When i applied this cream for the first time.. my skin burnt like hell as if i have applied some kind of acid on my face .. thought my skin was not taken care properly so it was damaged, reading all the postive reviews and good ratings at EWG had high hopes that THIS IS THE ONE that will repair my dmaged skin.. started using this product contiously there after..every time i applied my skin used to burn. after a week i could see red patches on my face.. no matter what i apply (cream, thermal water, mosturizer) it used to burn and now it is messed up.. even if i wash my face with plain drinking water it burns and skin has become hard and patches are red and big on my face -  now it looks like i have peeled skin on my face. I stopped using this and started using baby mosturizer, its a week now and my skin is getting better..red patches are still visibile but not worst and no more skin burn sensation..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if something is worng with the jar of cram i got as it was not pakced proplery. when i got it, cream of jar there was very little in the jar..</li>
            <li> After using Loving Naturals body lotion, and not being able to find a face cream made without potentially toxic chemicals, I decided to try this product. Most face creams are outrageously expensive and include questionable ingredients.  This product is priced right and goes on smoothly without feeling greasy. Loving Naturals has the highest rating from the Environmental Working Group, Skin Deep.  I love this company!</li>
            <li> I have used other anti-aging face products and I must say this is one of the best!  I was pleasantly surprised at how well it works!  And I love that it is a natural product.  However, I hate the smell!  If there was a way to tone down the fragrance, I would give it 5 stars.  As it is now, I take a deep breath and quickly put it on because the fragrance is overpowering.  Even my young son said to me \\&quot;gee mom, what&#x27;s that smell??\\&quot;.  But I will keep using it because I really like the results.  Just be forewarned about the smell! :)</li>
            <li> The ingredients are great. The consistency is very good for dry skin. I don&#x27;t love the smell. It is very similar to burt&#x27;s bees carrot night cream. However, once it&#x27;s absorbed into the skin I don&#x27;t notice the smell. Seller upgraded to 2oz for free.</li>
            <li> it smells like alphalpha and hay and menthol. it has a watery texture. it is a good moisturizer and absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> I have dealt with acne for a couple years (in my late 20&#x27;s) and was unable to find a moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t break me out. I have been using Aubrey Organics aloe vera for over a year with good results, but was scared to try a moisturizer in fear of more break outs. I&#x27;ve tried different things off and on and my skin has not reacted well to it. I was researching on the Cosmetic Database for a safe moisturizer and this one got a 0 score I believe. I decided to give it a shot with the smaller size and am happy to report that I love it! I only apply it at night because it seems a little too greasy for using under foundation (I use Bare Minerals powders). I don&#x27;t really have noticeable wrinkles yet, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working in that respect (under my eyes do look a little different). But it&#x27;s definitely made a difference in the overall appearance of my skin and I don&#x27;t believe it has caused any break outs. I waited 3 weeks to give it this review because I was half expecting my skin to start acting crazy from it, but so far so good! I&#x27;m actually going to order the next size up this week! My only hope is that Loving Naturals doesn&#x27;t stop selling this or change the formula!</li>
            <li> I agree with all of the other positive comments. This cream is not greasy, not too light, it&#x27;s just right!  The odor, immediately after applying it, is perhaps the one thing I don&#x27;t love about it, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me after a few seconds. I *think* my skin looks better since using it, but I can&#x27;t prove that. I definitely feel better using it, though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, 6/17/12: I purchased a new tub of this product, and it seems that the odor is improved. I suppose it could be that I&#x27;ve gotten used to it, but immediately upon opening the new one, I thought that it had a much lighter scent. I still love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have used the whole jar up and I really like it.  My face has a rosy pink glow.  It does not cause redness or tingling as I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> the smell is overwhelming. I put it on at night and it was horrible smelling.It smells exactly like the lipoic acid capsules but alot stronger. that smell did not fade away as i hoped it would and i kept smelling my face ..yucky stinky smelling cream. I did not know it contained this and worse than the smell it stung my face as i had been using a retinol product a few times a week. It also was not very moisturising. It kind of made my face feel dry, not moisturised. I usually use neutrogena light night cream and love how moisturising and gentle it is but wanted to switch to a natural product, but i think just plain olive oil is gonna have to do from now on as i cannot use this stuff. I would not advise using it if you alternativley use any type of retinol or glycolic products, or vitamin c type creams. and definitly stay away from this stuff if you have a sun or wind burn as the lipoic acid ingredient will sting your face.</li>
            <li> May be nice in terms of texture and moisturizing qualities, but the smell is too pungent for me to use on my face.</li>
            <li> use it nightly on my skin, keeps it hydrated and smell is very low key. haven&#x27;t noticed any real changes in skin but knowing the products are all natural makes me feel good about using it. would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a great non-greasy moisturizer that is featured on the EWG Skin Deep Cosmetics database as a safe cosmetic.  It doesn&#x27;t contain seemingly ubiquitous silicone (dimethicone,  polydimethylsiloxane, etc.), an environmental toxin that can cause milia (small, hard, white bumps) on the face.  Users should be realistic about a product&#x27;s ability to \\&quot;reverse aging.\\&quot;  Those who complain about the smell of the cream have to understand that most products contain artificial fragrances, many of which are endocrine-disruptors.  The cream does have a very transient earthy smell that probably comes from the carrot oil.  By the time I leave the bathroom in the morning, the scent has disappeared.  If you&#x27;re a gardener who appreciates the pleasure of pulling fresh carrots from the soil, you might even like the scent.  I hope this product is available again soon because I&#x27;m almost out!</li>
            <li> Positives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. in few days skin was more moisturized&lt;br /&gt;2. more even complexion of skin&lt;br /&gt;3. I observed reduction of wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;4. all natural&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. smell is not nice. I tried to use it as a day-cream, but I was not able to, that is why I use it only as a night-cream and I do not care about the smell.&lt;br /&gt;2. price is high. I was disappointed when I got this cream, and it was only 1oz (30 ml) for ~$10. I compared the price of other natural creams and for example Calendula Cream from California Baby is only $15 for 2 oz.&lt;br /&gt;3. lack of the seal (?!). Was it only in case of my cream or producer does not close the jars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the cream, it works, but I will have to think whether I order it next time, b/c of the high price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream and love this company! ...the cream has a different smell to others as it contains carrot seed oil, which has a strong earthy smell (as you would expect coming from a carrot!)but I wouldnt exactly say its offensive as others have suggested. Just different. I am familiar with carott seed oil and personally love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is such a great price, rich but not greasy and is full of good things that the biggest porous organ of your body (your skin!)will love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In response to other reviewers disappointment, I personally dont expect any lotion to reduce any wrinkles I already have...Im 39 and definitely see some differences in my skin over the years BUT, human nature dictates, we get older, and things change...&lt;br /&gt;To have my skin feel \\&quot;fed and nourished\\&quot; with this cream is the best thing I can do and I believe that in itself may hopefully slow down the whole process :)  Healthy glowing ladies look wonderful, wrinkles and all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou so much Loving Naturals for producing such wonderful guilt free products. You have a permanent repeat customer xxx</li>
            <li> This product has an offensive odor on skin. I see no reduction in wrinkles after week of use. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product.  The EWG gives it a zero rating and it works really well on diminishing wrinkles.  The price is also very fair.</li>
            <li> Nope. Better stuff out there. Do you really care about anti-aging? Then, choose something else.</li>
            <li> I like the cream and I am very happy to use a natural product that scores zero with EWG but it really smells weird and I have almost stopped using it because of the smell. When you apply it it takes a long time for the smell to go away. So I used it only at night but it still bothers me. and I don&#x27;t like those creams that have a strong perfume smells either. But there are definitely som fragrance free creams that smell much better than this. Too bad. I&#x27;ll be looking for something else that is not toxic and smells a bit better.</li>
