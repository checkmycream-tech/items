            <li>Beautiful Browns color-depositing shampoo and conditioner are an inexpensive way to control hair color at home.  </li>
            <li>Great shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Tressa Watercolors is a great color depositing shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I so glad this one still is !!</li>
            <li>A good replacement for the discontinued conditioner by Biosilk.</li>
            <li>The product is OK</li>
            <li>However, it leaves my hair so loaded with goo that I have to wash it much more often than I would like.</li>
            <li>Smell is pleasant and makes your hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>very good for between regular coloring&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Fantastic product &amp; quick sale.</li>
            <li>Not an overly sweet smell.</li>
            <li>I have used and liked this shampoo for several years.  </li>
            <li>Just right.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly as quoted on bottle.  </li>
            <li>just okay, because i actually was searching for the conditioner for this brand and that is what I thought i ordered.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t change my haircolor much</li>
            <li>I really rely on Amazon to save me frustrations when trying to get what I want and feel I save money as well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling clean, but it didn&#x27;t add the shade of ash</li>
            <li>So, as usual I check Amazon and sure enough you carry it.  </li>
            <li>smells like chocolate, lathers extremely well and leaves my greying hair with just a slight hint of color that&amp;#34;s not shocking!</li>

            <li> I have been using this this product for quite a while. Not an overly sweet smell. Just right.  Also like the way my hair feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> Beautiful Browns color-depositing shampoo and conditioner are an inexpensive way to control hair color at home.  Both the shampoo and conditioner noticeably change the color of hair gradually -- without dying your hands. A good replacement for the discontinued conditioner by Biosilk.</li>
            <li> The product is OK but I received the wrong one. I ordered conditioner and received shampoo. It is not at all what I wanted or needed.</li>
            <li> smells like chocolate, lathers extremely well and leaves my greying hair with just a slight hint of color that&amp;#34;s not shocking!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo.  Does exactly as quoted on bottle.  Brown color begins to show up after several shampoos.  Smell is pleasant and makes your hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product &amp; quick sale.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  When I could no longer get at the local store I ordered several bottles just to have a reserve.</li>
            <li> There are very few color enhancing shampoos still on the market .  I so glad this one still is !! And while the effects only last a couple of days it does the job if used regularly !</li>
            <li> It is a color depositing shampoo - so I no longer have my hair colored.  However it is way too brassy.  Turned my hair orange/red.  I have to use Fanci-full to tone down.  There needs to be a brown with ash tones.  As it stands I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Extremely drying to my hair, burns the eyes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t change my haircolor much but it did make my hands and my bathtub brown. I tried using it for a couple weeks with little results.  I ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> This hides just a little gray hair which makes just enough difference to maintain my vanity.  However, it leaves my hair so loaded with goo that I have to wash it much more often than I would like.</li>
            <li> just okay, because i actually was searching for the conditioner for this brand and that is what I thought i ordered. thank you i</li>
            <li> I have used and liked this shampoo for several years.  It used to be carried by Sally&#x27;s and isn&#x27;t being sold there anymore.  So, as usual I check Amazon and sure enough you carry it.  I really rely on Amazon to save me frustrations when trying to get what I want and feel I save money as well.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this shampoo.  Tressa Watercolors is a great color depositing shampoo.  This made my hair frizzy, probably due to the ammonium sulfate in it (not a good ingredient for colored hair) I would pass this one up next time.</li>
            <li> very good for between regular coloring&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Works well in keeping your hair color brownish until your next salon visit. I haven&#x27;t found anything else that has done the trick since Loreil got rid of the Coco Bean Conditioner a while back.  (Loreal Colorist Collection ARTec Color Depositing Shampoos &amp; Moisturizers).</li>
            <li> This product was not for me. It left my hair feeling clean, but it didn&#x27;t add the shade of ash I wanted it too, therefore I didn&#x27;t continue the product.</li>
