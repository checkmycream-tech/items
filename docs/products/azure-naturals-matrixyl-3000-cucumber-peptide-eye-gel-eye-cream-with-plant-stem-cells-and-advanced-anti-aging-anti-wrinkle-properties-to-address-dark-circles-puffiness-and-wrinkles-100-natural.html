            <li>Contains no alcohol, no parabens, no GMO&#x27;s, and their products are cruelty free and never tested on animals!</li>
            <li>It has kept my face hydrated and moisturized, which has been quite challenging during the colder months.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels when applying.</li>
            <li>giving the eye a smiother and radient look making the eyes appear more vugorous and appealing.</li>
            <li>This company is outstanding.</li>
            <li>It is a lightweight gel-like substance which has a nice light scent of cucumbers.</li>
            <li>Leaving you with more youthful and firmer looking skin around your eyes and face.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it twice a day</li>
            <li>received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>So I suppose the next best thing for my eyes is this cucumber-infused eye serum!</li>
            <li>and I have not had any more flare ups since using these 2 creams..</li>
            <li>It is not sticky or greasy, just smooth and cooling!</li>
            <li>/&gt;She said that it was ok.</li>
            <li>, I been use in gut every day, I love the cucumber scent.</li>
            <li>but my skin feels so much better around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I love the texture of this product.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and makeup goes on beautifully.</li>
            <li>My first time buying any kind of Eye cream, but so far I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>so when I apply it in the a.m. it helps wake me up and feels super refreshing!</li>
            <li>very cool and refreshing cucumber.</li>
            <li>Product smells great and works great in reducing my dark circles!</li>
            <li>Yet this item had helped heal this area and reduced the redness significantly!</li>
            <li>Great for new moms.</li>
            <li>Love that this can be packed easily</li>
            <li>Love the light cucumber scent.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is nothing like that and is a great companion to the mud for a complete barrier against Father Time&#x27;s wrath.</li>
            <li>This eye gel comes in a beautiful pump container with a bright green label and a silver cap.</li>
            <li>It was a free product, so that made it even better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The gentle firming and coolness feels good around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It truly delivers the results that it promises and I can honestly say that it’s worth trying and purchasing!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels very light and cool</li>
            <li>and it dries very quickly</li>
            <li>so i easily apply makeup.</li>
            <li>This formula is very soothing and offers great relief to this issue!</li>
            <li>product does have a fairly strong cucumber scent, which did not bother me</li>
            <li>All natural and always my face feel nice and refreshed!</li>
            <li>It eases my puffiness, brightens the dark areas, and feels amazingly cool and refreshing; that is the best part: it truly feels cool and refreshing for hours after I apply it.</li>
            <li>but I love the lightweight cool gel texture.</li>
            <li>Kind of sticky at first, but dries on your skin just fine.</li>
            <li>than it does since it smells so good, but it disappears pretty quickly, which I suppose is good for those with sensitive noses and people who don&#x27;t like the scent of their perfume to clash!  </li>
            <li>This gel goes on easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>Works fine under primer and concealer.</li>
            <li>but it also helps reduce the appearance of my fine lines.</li>
            <li>The product i received for testing purposes is a good gel, that is very light weight and goes on smooth and absorbs pretty fast and dd not interfere with my make up application.</li>
            <li>Took a little while to receive the shipment but very happy once I got it.</li>
            <li>that is a HUGE plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Try Vitamin C serum and really anything they sell you really should be happy.</li>
            <li>but she didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li>This is fabulous.  </li>

            <li>I really enjoy using it.</li>

            <li>No GMO&#x27;s, Cruelty Free</li>
            <li>Smells fresh like cucumber too :)</li>
            <li>I was sent this product for free to review.</li>
            <li>great my second order</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used it on a client with sensitive eyes and they absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>It has a light fresh cucumber scent that I love.</li>
            <li>It is a nice eye gel, with non-greasy texture, smell&#x27;s great, and when applying on eye skin, can feel the skin is immediately hydrated and soothing, and it&#x27;s price is reasonable compared to similar products on the market, I will keep use it.</li>
            <li>what better time to try out the gel, right?</li>
            <li>Made the skin under my eyes look bright and young and fresh!</li>
            <li>She likes the easy pump bottle and the cool, soothing effect around her eyes.</li>
            <li>I highly reckmmend this priduct!!!!</li>
            <li>My skin as improved so much!!!  </li>
            <li>It smells very fresh and has an immediate cooling effect on my undereye area.  </li>
            <li>My verdict is that this is an amazing product and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and cucumber-like!  </li>
            <li>And I can apply this above AND below my eyes - SPECTACULAR!</li>
            <li>This cream is pretty magical.</li>
            <li>This is very good at brightening the under eye area, but I really wanted it for puffiness, and it didn&#x27;t work too well on that for me; but I started using it around my mouth and above my lip and it seems to be helping there with wrinkles and skin brightening.</li>
            <li>old eyes more than anything I tried, yet (which is many).</li>
            <li>This priduct us light weight and asorbs rather quick.</li>
            <li>My pores are hug now and I look super oily in my tzone when it was perfect combination with small almost invisible pores.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe because it&#x27;s gel and the air hitting it makes it feel cool.</li>
            <li>This product feels really cool (no pun intended).  </li>
            <li>This works so well and makes my eyes look so nice with the cucumber cooling clear gel  </li>
            <li>It also helps reduce my bags under my eyes and the all-around puffiness that I can get on both the top and bottom.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>Once applied under your eyes you feel a cool sensation and immediately know it is working.</li>
            <li>When I put it on my eyes, it is cool just like a cucumber</li>
            <li>I ordered the full line - for morning</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not really bad</li>
            <li>The good thing about this was that it made me look more awake and tightened the skin slightly.</li>
            <li>Went into my skin quickly.</li>
            <li>using the two together has greatly improved my dark bags under my eyes and I have noticed my acne problem seems to be clearing up</li>
            <li>I think if you left it in the fridge and used it in the morning to get rid of your sleepy eyes, you&#x27;d have an even better result!</li>
            <li>Most products that claim they will get rid of that usually never work.</li>
            <li>Would give it 5 stars if it really helped my puffiness!!</li>
            <li>It comes in an attractive silver and glass pump bottle with a lime green label.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and makes around my eyes feel brighter and younger.</li>
            <li>I have been using this eye brightening cream for about 2 weeks now and it is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>Although a male, I found this product to be a nice &amp;#34;pick up&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Love natural eye cream.</li>
            <li>so it does feel safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant light scent and a small amount is all one needs.</li>
            <li>and I can feel it moisterizing my eyes right away.</li>
            <li>(and I have very large pores so this almost always is an issue with products).&lt;br</li>
            <li>is natural works easy.</li>
            <li>My skin looks young, fresh and blemish free.</li>
            <li>gel when applied to the skin is cooling and slightly tingles, but in a good feeling way.</li>
            <li>It was mailed out very fast to me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This Eye Gel will diminish dark circles, eye bags, puffiness, crow&#x27;s feet, fine lines, and sagginess for firmer more youthful skin around the eyes and all over the face.</li>
            <li>One pump was more than enough do do both eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m starting to have more of an issue with under eye circles and puffiness, so when I got the oppertunity to try this product from Azure Naturals</li>

            <li>The pump does give out a lot more gel than you need so just put some of it back in the bottle by unscrewing the pump.</li>
            <li>I love the ultimate Vitamin C and the Retinol serum</li>
            <li>This product left many lines under my eyes&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Plain and simple - I am pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like I said, I like to keep it in my fridge for that extra refreshing feeling in the morning.  </li>
            <li>with all Azure Naturals products (one of the reasons why I LOVE this company) they make all of their products in the USA with only the highest quality natural and organic ingredients available.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>It really smells like cucumber!</li>
            <li>Going pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>Makes eyes feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>love how this product has different uses.  </li>
            <li>love how they offer you a one year money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>She felt like it worked pretty</li>
            <li>I never really understood the concept of putting cucumber slices on your eyes -- they&#x27;re far too delicious to have sitting on my eyelids for that long.</li>
            <li>It feels so refreshing to rub on my eyes after a long day at work.</li>
            <li>There are companies that boast that they have certain ingredients in their products but sometimes the smell doesn&#x27;t come through in their products.</li>
            <li>The pump bottle is nice to have because i dont worry about making a mess.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this one as much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it has really done anything to improve my under eye area.</li>
            <li>I was given an oppertunity to try and review Ultimate Peptide Eye Brightening Gel by Azure Naturals free of charge for review</li>
            <li>Very firming.</li>
            <li>and I get very leery of apply products around this area.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get too much smell of cucumber</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m very allergic to products, and my skins seems to take this product quite well.</li>
            <li>beyond that I don&#x27;t notice much difference.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I have already placed a gift order for a friend…</li>
            <li>Used for 2 weeks didnt see much of a change</li>
            <li>my eyes look so much lighter than they did.</li>
            <li>Felt gentle on my skin with no stcky or greasy feel.</li>
            <li>Very soothing to under eye area.</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing has ever worked, until now.</li>
            <li>Like the texture, no smell really.  </li>
            <li>Very cooling and not greasy, seems to have an immediate affect.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find something that really works on the circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>face feels very moisturized and looks radiant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>am absolutely speechless with this product.</li>
            <li>I thought it would help stop aging in skin before it really starts, but bigggg mistake.</li>
            <li>Being a senior citizen, I find I don&#x27;t sleep very well anymore.  </li>
            <li>It works very well on my eyes.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>As a man this product is nice without heavy fragrance smell and also texture not greasy.</li>
            <li>Since starting probiotics my eyes aren&#x27;t red and watery anymore, but the puffiness still exists so I was excited to try this product for free for review purposes.  </li>
            <li>Wow, right?</li>
            <li>Great product and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>Only using it twice a day under my eyes are smoother and the fine lines are blending more everyday.</li>
            <li>It had an off putting smell of cucumbers which normally I do like, but not so much with this one.</li>
            <li>The dark circles are lighter and the under eye puffiness is much better.  </li>
            <li>but I am sure with continued use I will see diminishment in my dark circles.</li>
            <li>I love how I can feel it working on my skin, and my eyes do look less pronounced.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the slight cucumber scent.</li>
            <li>Puffiness actually subsides rather quickly using this product.</li>
            <li>Those lotions in the mainstream markets are mainly greasy or smell like my wife&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>before photo is &#x27;scary&#x27; so please no gasps or cries of alarm, lol.</li>
            <li>Very soothing on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would say I recommend this product; it&#x27;s pricey at its current listing of $19.99, but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>This gel smells just like a freshly cut cucumber and has the same benefits.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so refreshed and the skin under my eyes feels more firm since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>I have to say I was also surprised to see while using this that a slight scar that looks more like a wrinkle but truly is a scar started to diminish while using this.</li>
            <li>It really helps with overall eye puffiness, circles, and those tiny laugh lines around the eyes!</li>
            <li>product itself......been using for 4 days now and am alreay on market for something new.</li>
            <li>It will diminish dark circles, eye bags, crow&#x27;s feet, puffiness and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin around my eyes</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes and skin</li>
            <li>and you can clearly feel the difference when you put it on.</li>
            <li>The instructions are clearly printed on, but the sticker doesn&#x27;t seem to be 100% adhered or centered onto the bottle.</li>
            <li>Professional strength.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a natural organic eye cream then this may be the one for you.</li>
            <li>skin is soft and feels refreshed all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for 2 weeks so far.</li>
            <li>and it was not made for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The fact that this product is natural and organic Ingredients,97% Natural, 72% Organic and contains no alcohol, no parabens.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe my eyes sensitive</li>
            <li>have not tried this as an all over face treatment because I want to save it for my delicate eye area that has more issues.</li>
            <li>With The Highest Quality Natural and Organic Ingredients</li>
            <li>97% Natural, 72% Organic.</li>
            <li>I bought this about 4 weeks ago with Azure Natural&#x27;s Guaranteed Strongest Wrinkle Eraser 2.5% and 22% Vitamin C serums.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive but I have not had any problems using this on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I have not received any compensation for writing this post.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been a few weeks, but I really love this Eye gel.</li>
            <li>Easy hold bottle with a small pump, so that you can get the rigth amount of product out, without over pouring.</li>
            <li>I usually do two pumps and focus on my eyes and then pump another serum straight into the same fingers and smooth that all over.</li>
            <li>I also got busy and forgot to use it the past week or so and have also noticed a huge difference in reverse.</li>
            <li>The dryness is much improved with no more flakes, texture is better, wrinkles are reducing due to improved hydration.  </li>
            <li>First I must disclose that I have been provided this product to test with the understanding that I will write a product review that is accurate and completely honest.&lt;br /&gt;For years I have had bags under my eyes - a result of a very stressful job that demands hours behind a computer, overdoing my daily intake of coffee, inadequate sleep, the occasional wearing of contacts, and advancing age.</li>
            <li>I just want my skin to go back to normal.</li>
            <li>I used this for a few weeks and noticed a huge different.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating in these dry winter months.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite morning eye products lately!  </li>
            <li>I do like that this product is made in the USA not a foreign country.  </li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin all over, but using things around my eyes can often irritate both my skin and eyeballs without getting it in my actual eyes just close.</li>
            <li>I can barely tell that it is there now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it has only depuffed my eyes</li>
            <li>there were a few minor blemishes at first as my skin got used to the new products.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out on my skin and “pull” and it does not look like “makeup” on my skin.</li>
            <li>have large dark circles which did not improve when using the gel.</li>
            <li>The formula isn&#x27;t too thick or thin and goes on very nicely.  </li>
            <li>I use it every morning and before bed at night, and it has really helped with the dark circles</li>
            <li>i have dark circles under my eyes and been looking for something to help this product helped so much</li>
            <li>Look at the price is reasonable compared to other similar products on the market.</li>
            <li>She says she cant really tell a difference yet as she doesn&#x27;t use it daily other than it definitely moisturizes her face and it feels fresher after using this product.</li>
            <li>I am 61 with dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>With each use subtle but significant improvements were actually happening.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly have dark circles</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s neither good nor bad, but I just see no change in the area around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I love the texture of this product.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and makeup goes on beautifully.</li>
            <li> My first time buying any kind of Eye cream, but so far I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> so when I apply it in the a.m. it helps wake me up and feels super refreshing!</li>
            <li> very cool and refreshing cucumber.</li>
            <li> Product smells great and works great in reducing my dark circles!</li>
            <li> Yet this item had helped heal this area and reduced the redness significantly!</li>
            <li> Great for new moms.</li>
            <li> Love that this can be packed easily</li>
            <li> Love the light cucumber scent.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is nothing like that and is a great companion to the mud for a complete barrier against Father Time&#x27;s wrath.</li>
            <li> This eye gel comes in a beautiful pump container with a bright green label and a silver cap.</li>
            <li> It was a free product, so that made it even better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The gentle firming and coolness feels good around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It truly delivers the results that it promises and I can honestly say that it’s worth trying and purchasing!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels very light and cool</li>
            <li> and it dries very quickly</li>
            <li> so i easily apply makeup.</li>
            <li> This formula is very soothing and offers great relief to this issue!</li>
            <li> product does have a fairly strong cucumber scent, which did not bother me</li>
            <li> All natural and always my face feel nice and refreshed!</li>
            <li> It eases my puffiness, brightens the dark areas, and feels amazingly cool and refreshing; that is the best part: it truly feels cool and refreshing for hours after I apply it.</li>
            <li> but I love the lightweight cool gel texture.</li>
            <li> Kind of sticky at first, but dries on your skin just fine.</li>
            <li> than it does since it smells so good, but it disappears pretty quickly, which I suppose is good for those with sensitive noses and people who don&#x27;t like the scent of their perfume to clash!  </li>
            <li> This gel goes on easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li> Works fine under primer and concealer.</li>
            <li> but it also helps reduce the appearance of my fine lines.</li>
            <li> The product i received for testing purposes is a good gel, that is very light weight and goes on smooth and absorbs pretty fast and dd not interfere with my make up application.</li>
            <li> Took a little while to receive the shipment but very happy once I got it.</li>
            <li> that is a HUGE plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Try Vitamin C serum and really anything they sell you really should be happy.</li>
            <li> but she didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference.</li>

            <li> No GMO&#x27;s, Cruelty Free</li>
            <li> Smells fresh like cucumber too :)</li>
            <li> I was sent this product for free to review.</li>
            <li> great my second order</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used it on a client with sensitive eyes and they absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> It has a light fresh cucumber scent that I love.</li>
            <li> It is a nice eye gel, with non-greasy texture, smell&#x27;s great, and when applying on eye skin, can feel the skin is immediately hydrated and soothing, and it&#x27;s price is reasonable compared to similar products on the market, I will keep use it.</li>
            <li> what better time to try out the gel, right?</li>
            <li> Made the skin under my eyes look bright and young and fresh!</li>
            <li> She likes the easy pump bottle and the cool, soothing effect around her eyes.</li>
            <li> I highly reckmmend this priduct!!!!</li>
            <li> My skin as improved so much!!!  </li>
            <li> It smells very fresh and has an immediate cooling effect on my undereye area.  </li>
            <li> My verdict is that this is an amazing product and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and cucumber-like!  </li>
            <li> And I can apply this above AND below my eyes - SPECTACULAR!</li>
            <li> This cream is pretty magical.</li>
            <li> This is very good at brightening the under eye area, but I really wanted it for puffiness, and it didn&#x27;t work too well on that for me; but I started using it around my mouth and above my lip and it seems to be helping there with wrinkles and skin brightening.</li>
            <li> old eyes more than anything I tried, yet (which is many).</li>
            <li> This priduct us light weight and asorbs rather quick.</li>
            <li> My pores are hug now and I look super oily in my tzone when it was perfect combination with small almost invisible pores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe because it&#x27;s gel and the air hitting it makes it feel cool.</li>
            <li> This product feels really cool (no pun intended).  </li>
            <li> This works so well and makes my eyes look so nice with the cucumber cooling clear gel  </li>
            <li> It also helps reduce my bags under my eyes and the all-around puffiness that I can get on both the top and bottom.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> Once applied under your eyes you feel a cool sensation and immediately know it is working.</li>
            <li> When I put it on my eyes, it is cool just like a cucumber</li>
            <li> I ordered the full line - for morning</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not really bad</li>
            <li> The good thing about this was that it made me look more awake and tightened the skin slightly.</li>
            <li> Went into my skin quickly.</li>
            <li> using the two together has greatly improved my dark bags under my eyes and I have noticed my acne problem seems to be clearing up</li>
            <li> I think if you left it in the fridge and used it in the morning to get rid of your sleepy eyes, you&#x27;d have an even better result!</li>
            <li> Most products that claim they will get rid of that usually never work.</li>
            <li> Would give it 5 stars if it really helped my puffiness!!</li>
            <li> It comes in an attractive silver and glass pump bottle with a lime green label.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and makes around my eyes feel brighter and younger.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye brightening cream for about 2 weeks now and it is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> Although a male, I found this product to be a nice &amp;#34;pick up&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Love natural eye cream.</li>
            <li> so it does feel safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant light scent and a small amount is all one needs.</li>
            <li> and I can feel it moisterizing my eyes right away.</li>
            <li> (and I have very large pores so this almost always is an issue with products).&lt;br</li>
            <li> is natural works easy.</li>
            <li> My skin looks young, fresh and blemish free.</li>
            <li> gel when applied to the skin is cooling and slightly tingles, but in a good feeling way.</li>
            <li> It was mailed out very fast to me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This Eye Gel will diminish dark circles, eye bags, puffiness, crow&#x27;s feet, fine lines, and sagginess for firmer more youthful skin around the eyes and all over the face.</li>
            <li> One pump was more than enough do do both eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m starting to have more of an issue with under eye circles and puffiness, so when I got the oppertunity to try this product from Azure Naturals</li>
            <li> it gives you when you first apply it.</li>
            <li> a/o August 3, 2015;)</li>
            <li> The pump does give out a lot more gel than you need so just put some of it back in the bottle by unscrewing the pump.</li>
            <li> I love the ultimate Vitamin C and the Retinol serum</li>
            <li> This product left many lines under my eyes&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Plain and simple - I am pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like I said, I like to keep it in my fridge for that extra refreshing feeling in the morning.  </li>
            <li> with all Azure Naturals products (one of the reasons why I LOVE this company) they make all of their products in the USA with only the highest quality natural and organic ingredients available.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> It really smells like cucumber!</li>
            <li> Going pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> Makes eyes feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> love how this product has different uses.  </li>
            <li> love how they offer you a one year money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> She felt like it worked pretty</li>
            <li> I never really understood the concept of putting cucumber slices on your eyes -- they&#x27;re far too delicious to have sitting on my eyelids for that long.</li>
            <li> It feels so refreshing to rub on my eyes after a long day at work.</li>
            <li> There are companies that boast that they have certain ingredients in their products but sometimes the smell doesn&#x27;t come through in their products.</li>
            <li> The pump bottle is nice to have because i dont worry about making a mess.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this one as much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it has really done anything to improve my under eye area.</li>
            <li> I was given an oppertunity to try and review Ultimate Peptide Eye Brightening Gel by Azure Naturals free of charge for review</li>
            <li> Very firming.</li>
            <li> and I get very leery of apply products around this area.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get too much smell of cucumber</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m very allergic to products, and my skins seems to take this product quite well.</li>
            <li> beyond that I don&#x27;t notice much difference.</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I have already placed a gift order for a friend…</li>
            <li> Used for 2 weeks didnt see much of a change</li>
            <li> my eyes look so much lighter than they did.</li>
            <li> Felt gentle on my skin with no stcky or greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Very soothing to under eye area.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing has ever worked, until now.</li>
            <li> Like the texture, no smell really.  </li>
            <li> Very cooling and not greasy, seems to have an immediate affect.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find something that really works on the circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> face feels very moisturized and looks radiant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> am absolutely speechless with this product.</li>
            <li> I thought it would help stop aging in skin before it really starts, but bigggg mistake.</li>
            <li> Being a senior citizen, I find I don&#x27;t sleep very well anymore.  </li>
            <li> It works very well on my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> As a man this product is nice without heavy fragrance smell and also texture not greasy.</li>
            <li> Since starting probiotics my eyes aren&#x27;t red and watery anymore, but the puffiness still exists so I was excited to try this product for free for review purposes.  </li>
            <li> Wow, right?</li>
            <li> Great product and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Only using it twice a day under my eyes are smoother and the fine lines are blending more everyday.</li>
            <li> It had an off putting smell of cucumbers which normally I do like, but not so much with this one.</li>
            <li> The dark circles are lighter and the under eye puffiness is much better.  </li>
            <li> but I am sure with continued use I will see diminishment in my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I love how I can feel it working on my skin, and my eyes do look less pronounced.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the slight cucumber scent.</li>
            <li> Puffiness actually subsides rather quickly using this product.</li>
            <li> Those lotions in the mainstream markets are mainly greasy or smell like my wife&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> before photo is &#x27;scary&#x27; so please no gasps or cries of alarm, lol.</li>
            <li> Very soothing on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would say I recommend this product; it&#x27;s pricey at its current listing of $19.99, but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> This gel smells just like a freshly cut cucumber and has the same benefits.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so refreshed and the skin under my eyes feels more firm since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was also surprised to see while using this that a slight scar that looks more like a wrinkle but truly is a scar started to diminish while using this.</li>
            <li> It really helps with overall eye puffiness, circles, and those tiny laugh lines around the eyes!</li>
            <li> product itself......been using for 4 days now and am alreay on market for something new.</li>
            <li> It will diminish dark circles, eye bags, crow&#x27;s feet, puffiness and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin around my eyes</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes and skin</li>
            <li> and you can clearly feel the difference when you put it on.</li>
            <li> The instructions are clearly printed on, but the sticker doesn&#x27;t seem to be 100% adhered or centered onto the bottle.</li>
            <li> Professional strength.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a natural organic eye cream then this may be the one for you.</li>
            <li> skin is soft and feels refreshed all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for 2 weeks so far.</li>
            <li> and it was not made for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The fact that this product is natural and organic Ingredients,97% Natural, 72% Organic and contains no alcohol, no parabens.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe my eyes sensitive</li>
            <li> have not tried this as an all over face treatment because I want to save it for my delicate eye area that has more issues.</li>
            <li> With The Highest Quality Natural and Organic Ingredients</li>
            <li> 97% Natural, 72% Organic.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 4 weeks ago with Azure Natural&#x27;s Guaranteed Strongest Wrinkle Eraser 2.5% and 22% Vitamin C serums.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive but I have not had any problems using this on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I have not received any compensation for writing this post.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few weeks, but I really love this Eye gel.</li>
            <li> Easy hold bottle with a small pump, so that you can get the rigth amount of product out, without over pouring.</li>
            <li> I usually do two pumps and focus on my eyes and then pump another serum straight into the same fingers and smooth that all over.</li>
            <li> I also got busy and forgot to use it the past week or so and have also noticed a huge difference in reverse.</li>
            <li> The dryness is much improved with no more flakes, texture is better, wrinkles are reducing due to improved hydration.  </li>
            <li> First I must disclose that I have been provided this product to test with the understanding that I will write a product review that is accurate and completely honest.&lt;br /&gt;For years I have had bags under my eyes - a result of a very stressful job that demands hours behind a computer, overdoing my daily intake of coffee, inadequate sleep, the occasional wearing of contacts, and advancing age.</li>
            <li> I just want my skin to go back to normal.</li>
            <li> I used this for a few weeks and noticed a huge different.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating in these dry winter months.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite morning eye products lately!  </li>
            <li> I do like that this product is made in the USA not a foreign country.  </li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin all over, but using things around my eyes can often irritate both my skin and eyeballs without getting it in my actual eyes just close.</li>
            <li> I can barely tell that it is there now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far it has only depuffed my eyes</li>
            <li> there were a few minor blemishes at first as my skin got used to the new products.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out on my skin and “pull” and it does not look like “makeup” on my skin.</li>
            <li> have large dark circles which did not improve when using the gel.</li>
            <li> The formula isn&#x27;t too thick or thin and goes on very nicely.  </li>
            <li> I use it every morning and before bed at night, and it has really helped with the dark circles</li>
            <li> i have dark circles under my eyes and been looking for something to help this product helped so much</li>
            <li> Look at the price is reasonable compared to other similar products on the market.</li>
            <li> She says she cant really tell a difference yet as she doesn&#x27;t use it daily other than it definitely moisturizes her face and it feels fresher after using this product.</li>
            <li> I am 61 with dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> With each use subtle but significant improvements were actually happening.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly have dark circles</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s neither good nor bad, but I just see no change in the area around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle pump dispensed the product unevenly and seemed like it was not full;  however, would purchase it again (just open the bottle from the start to insure its full and dispense manually to eliminate waste when too much comes out of the pump).</li>
            <li> I personally have seen a quick reduction in my dark circles after a few days of using this.</li>
            <li> I am not old or have excessive sagging of facial features but Father Time has begun the process of making me look more like an AARP member over the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it makes a big difference or not, but it certainly feels like it does.</li>
            <li> just incase the puffiness creeps back in later on in the day if I happen to be outside for long periods of time.  </li>
            <li> Reminds me of putting on cucumber slices when young for dark circles.</li>
            <li> This still isn’t 100% as it doesn’t work completely on the dark area, however I did notice that there was a decrease in the darkness and size of the area.</li>
            <li> The pump bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if its making a difference or anything</li>
            <li> It keeps the swelling down in my eyes do to allergies and it keeps my skin around my eyes soft.</li>
            <li> I was honestly shocked, and I am still giving this 5 stars because I figure if it mostly works on my hard to improve allergy irritated eyes that it must work better for the average person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took about 3 minutes to fully dry and left sort of a sticky feeling to it.</li>
            <li> Plus it goes a long way...</li>
            <li> It really brought immediate relief and toned the redness down within a few hours.  </li>
            <li> have only been using this product a few days so far and already notice my dark circles and puffiness around my eyes</li>
            <li> but she didn&#x27;t like it due to personal preference.</li>
            <li> Although I have not been using it for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The gel seem to dry out the skin when used persistently - this is what made me stop using it all together although I gave it a chance for 3-4 weeks, applying morning and evening.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Adds</li>
            <li> at night, and it does take a bit to dry, so keep that mind mind.</li>
            <li> I use one squirt of this product on my cheeks, eyes, and nose for dry climates.</li>
            <li> I apply twice a day in the morning and at night after i wash my face and pat it dry.</li>
            <li> no alcohol means the product won&#x27;t dry out your face.</li>
            <li> I have deep dark circles and bags under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product has starting to diminish the dark lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It definitely helped get rid of dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> I’m usually very skeptical and find most things don’t work for me.</li>
            <li> I can say after a couple of weeks there is NOTICEABLE difference in sun-related pigmentation/discoloration and a rough patch of skin that formed on my cheek a few months ago (and didn&#x27;t go away with any other skin products is now completely gone.</li>
            <li> The amount of lotion given isn&#x27;t a staggering amount, but it&#x27;s sufficient to last a couple months at least if you put it on once daily.</li>
            <li> I have only used for a few days now</li>
            <li> I do not really see any results what so ever</li>
            <li> Worked as expected.</li>
            <li> I did not really care for this product.</li>
            <li> I found that it did not really work</li>
            <li> I will continue to use until the bottle is empty</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few days</li>
            <li> Results for dark circles takes a few weeks, but this product will work with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount of gel applied to the eye area morning, noon, or night.</li>
            <li> product arrived broke and all over other items I purchased.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount since it spreads quite well.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> So, due to the fact I can see no improvement in my skin, and deceptive packaging</li>
            <li> I have used other products from this brand</li>
            <li> and ive tried other products</li>
            <li> I began using a mud mask and while it does well, the face it a little dry.</li>
            <li> It was ok - a little disappointed with the product</li>
            <li> I have notice my dark circles started to lighten up a bit since using this product.</li>
            <li> It has helped rid the dark circles around my eyes somewhat and I am thankful for that.</li>
            <li> I can see the differences in my dark circles.</li>
            <li> It has helped me with my morning bags and dark rings under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried a lot of eye gels and creams hoping that they would help my allergy induced bags, puffiness and dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li> This eye gel de-puffed my eyes and has helped to reduce the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR ABOUT 3 WEEKS,DON&#x27;T SEE ANY DIFFERENCE IN MY DARK CIRCLES, WHICH I HAVE BECAUSE OF ALLERGIES,</li>
            <li> Being a mom of 2 children, I have dark circles under my eyes and they sometimes look puffy.</li>
            <li> It helps with Dark circles, wrinkles, puffing, sagging and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really dark around my eyes</li>
            <li> The end result is puffy eyes and dark circles under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> for dark under eye circles.  </li>
            <li> The gel is similar to the consistency and color of Aloe Vera in that it is opaque colored and thick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get very bad bags under my eyes, but in the mornings underneath my eye tends to get puffy (usually because of allergens) and not look as good as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> One morning when my eyes were extremely pufffy, I used it and did see a little difference.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles are getting less noticeable but nothing to brag about.</li>
            <li> I still have dark circles but they seem less pronounced</li>
            <li> And the price of this gel is one-quarter the price of the one I previously tried.</li>
            <li> I used the gel on my eyelids, under my eyes and on the corners of my eyes similar to how you would use a highlighting pen and definitely saw a brightening around my eyes and the bags weren&#x27;t quite as scary looking, no?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My eyes feel smoother and I have less puffiness.</li>
            <li> so I get limited sleep and the dark circles are fairly common for me</li>
            <li> This eye brightening gel gave my sensitive skin a weird burning feeling under my eyes three times and the other times it didn&#x27;t bother my skin.  </li>
            <li> , as always, the first thing I want to know about a product is how it looks: this lotion comes in a bottle about 4 inches tall, and has a base of about the size of a quarter, slightly larger.</li>
            <li> I did notice that it was a little sticky, but that goes away as it soaks in.</li>
            <li> but I did break out a little around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my eyes are getting brighter and the dark circles are diminishing!</li>
            <li> so I feel there is a little waste.</li>
            <li> She actually leaves it in the fridge so its extra cold.</li>
            <li> Within just a few days of using the Azure Naturals Cucumber</li>
            <li> I can apply in morning and seem to see a difference in the morning puffiness within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This cream does not sting or have a harsh smell.</li>
            <li> I usually use this the day after a long night or minimal sleep to avoid that tired look.</li>
            <li> realize there isn&#x27;t any miracle product out (no fantastic repair)  </li>
            <li> I always look exhausted which is a buzzkill when I am out with friends - and especially in pictures.</li>
            <li> so it is something that you would use everyday</li>
            <li> I was tired and you can definitely see the bags under my eyes but</li>
            <li> Azure Naturals sent me this Eye Brightening Gel to review for them a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> I have been using this everyday on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any drastic changes (I am 27).If you put on a small amount under your eyes, you can wear makeup over it.</li>
            <li> Skeptic no more.</li>
            <li> Seem to help with some small wrinkles around my eyes as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what ingredient it was?</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen an improvement after 6 weeks, but on the other hand, hasn&#x27;t been any worse.</li>
            <li> If you think I’m overhyping this go read some of my other reviews about skincare…I take this stuff seriously!</li>
            <li> Also, the pump is hard to disperse I small amount.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin under my eyes dry and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> and I can not just put anything on it without putting a very small portion to test it for a reaction.  </li>
            <li> the way I am or was a serious LANCOME&lt;br /&gt;USER .</li>
            <li> Bags under the eyes and that horrid tired eye look.</li>
            <li> It smells just like cucumber and helps revive my tired eyes.  </li>
            <li> It is made with all natural and organic ingredients without all the nasty man made chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I promise it isn&#x27;t nearly as scary looking, lol.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So where can you possibly go wrong with this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels cold when I put it on</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have tried one very expensive product like this about a year ago that I was very unhappy with, so I was skeptical about this one.</li>
            <li> I have bad sinuses</li>
            <li> Somewhat disappointed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve applied this to a bad sunburn on my nose too!</li>

            <li> Within just a few days of using the Azure Naturals Cucumber Infused Ultimate Peptide I could already see results. With each use subtle but significant improvements were actually happening. Only using it twice a day under my eyes are smoother and the fine lines are blending more everyday. This makes your under eye concealer glide like you have skin of a baby. Puffiness actually subsides rather quickly using this product. - See more at: http://www.frugalmomandwife.com/2015/01/azure-naturals-cucumber-infused.html</li>
            <li> This is fabulous.  I use it every morning and before bed at night, and it has really helped with the dark circles I&#x27;ve always been prone to.  As an added bonus, you can definitely feel and smell the cucumber content.  I swear, it&#x27;s so soothing...like getting a facial twice a day!  Plus it goes a long way...one pump can take care of both eyes and then some.  I definitely plan to use this regularly going forward.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Feels so cooling when applied. Love the light cucumber scent.  I have only used for a few days now but I think I can see a difference in the puffiness and lines. I can apply in morning and seem to see a difference in the morning puffiness within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I am currently using this Azure Naturals Ultimate Peptide Eye Brightening Gel. Professional strength. 1 fl oz pump bottle.  Discover natures brilliance with this Plant stem Cells, Jojoba Oil, and many more. Made in the USA and not tested on animals. I have been using this eye brightening cream for about 2 weeks now and it is my favorite so far. I love how I can feel it working on my skin, and my eyes do look less pronounced. This cream does not sting or have a harsh smell. The pump bottle will last a long time. It only takes a bit. I use this twice a day. It only takes a small amount of gel applied to the eye area morning, noon, or night. Anytime you need a lift. Can be used under makeup and as an all over treatment. Sounds good to me, and it is working. I am using this product for a product review, I got this free for my opinion on the product. My view only. If you are looking for a natural organic eye cream then this may be the one for you. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this one as much. It comes in an attractive silver and glass pump bottle with a lime green label. It had an off putting smell of cucumbers which normally I do like, but not so much with this one. One pump was more than enough do do both eyes. It took about 3 minutes to fully dry and left sort of a sticky feeling to it. The good thing about this was that it made me look more awake and tightened the skin slightly.</li>
            <li> This product smells so good and is so moisturizing .The cucumber scent is really delightful .My skin is soft and feels refreshed all day.I apply this product once a day and it dries very quickly so i easily apply makeup.The pump bottle is nice to have because i dont worry about making a mess.Love that this can be packed easily and i can travel with no concerns .</li>
            <li> I am happy enough with this product&lt;br /&gt;always looking for products to help&lt;br /&gt;with puffy eyes especially in warmer months&lt;br /&gt;because of allergies.This does the job.Very&lt;br /&gt;light and not oiley or greasy.In fact I will be&lt;br /&gt;ordering more OZ PRODUCTS.Do not need to&lt;br /&gt;spend a lot of money for quality products.&lt;br /&gt;By the way I am or was a serious LANCOME&lt;br /&gt;USER .</li>
            <li> I do not really see any results what so ever and I have beed using this gel for the last 6 weeks. I use it now for my entire face to use the bottle quicker.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and cucumber-like!  The bottle pump dispensed the product unevenly and seemed like it was not full;  however, would purchase it again (just open the bottle from the start to insure its full and dispense manually to eliminate waste when too much comes out of the pump).</li>
            <li> product arrived broke and all over other items I purchased. product itself......been using for 4 days now and am alreay on market for something new. If your looking for a tightening/lifing effect....buy something else</li>
            <li> This eye gel smells so good. It feels cold when I put it on and it is very refreshing. I have been using it for about 2 months, every morning and every night. I don&#x27;t see any drastic changes (I am 27).If you put on a small amount under your eyes, you can wear makeup over it. Don&#x27;t put on a lot or your makeup peel off. Hopefully this helps keep those wrinkles away!</li>
            <li> Although a male, I found this product to be a nice &amp;#34;pick up&amp;#34; of the area under my eyes. I usually use this the day after a long night or minimal sleep to avoid that tired look. Worked as expected.</li>
            <li> can tell a difference, not as amazing as i would like but still really good.</li>
            <li> This product does not seem to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I have large dark circles which did not improve when using the gel. The gel seem to dry out the skin when used persistently - this is what made me stop using it all together although I gave it a chance for 3-4 weeks, applying morning and evening.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Adds freshness to the skin, so it feels somewhat more elastic.&lt;br /&gt;Other:&lt;br /&gt;Has cucumber odor which is okay, I suppose...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> So far so good. It appears to be working, it just takes time I guess. My dark circles are getting less noticeable but nothing to brag about. I give it 4 stars because it didn&#x27;t irritate my under eye area.</li>
            <li> This is great eye cream. I like the consistency and the ingredients. Reminds me of putting on cucumber slices when young for dark circles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it has really done anything to improve my under eye area.</li>
            <li> very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I was given an oppertunity to try and review Ultimate Peptide Eye Brightening Gel by Azure Naturals free of charge for review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m starting to have more of an issue with under eye circles and puffiness, so when I got the oppertunity to try this product from Azure Naturals I couldn&#x27;t let it pas me by. I really enjoyed the slight cucumber scent. I did notice that it was a little sticky, but that goes away as it soaks in. It wasn&#x27;t an overpowering scent, but just a hint. I&#x27;ve even used it on a client with sensitive eyes and they absolutely loved it. I also liked the cooling feeling it gives you when you first apply it. I&#x27;m not sure if it makes a big difference or not, but it certainly feels like it does. I used this for a few weeks and noticed a huge different. It feels amazing in the morning, and makes a great pick me up on a busy salon afternoon. I also got busy and forgot to use it the past week or so and have also noticed a huge difference in reverse. I would definitely suggest this product to someone looking for a cucumber eye treatment</li>
            <li> Best eye serum I&#x27;ve every found. a/o August 3, 2015;) My 3rd time ordering! It really helps with overall eye puffiness, circles, and those tiny laugh lines around the eyes! And I can apply this above AND below my eyes - SPECTACULAR! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!  It lasts and lasts and lasts.... And, for me, it WORKS!</li>
            <li> Product smells great and works great in reducing my dark circles!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the cucumbers and the cooling affect that it has when I apply it. That said, I haven&#x27;t noticed any benefits to this product yet. I&#x27;ve been using for 2 weeks so far. I will continue to use and will update my review later. I was provided this product for free, in exchange that I&#x27;d give it a fair review after trying it.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Has helped 60 yr. old eyes more than anything I tried, yet (which is many).</li>
            <li> This has helped incredibly with my eye puffiness.  I don&#x27;t get very bad bags under my eyes, but in the mornings underneath my eye tends to get puffy (usually because of allergens) and not look as good as I&#x27;d like.  Since starting probiotics my eyes aren&#x27;t red and watery anymore, but the puffiness still exists so I was excited to try this product for free for review purposes.  This formula is very soothing and offers great relief to this issue! It smells very fresh and has an immediate cooling effect on my undereye area.  I almost wish the scent lasted longer than it does since it smells so good, but it disappears pretty quickly, which I suppose is good for those with sensitive noses and people who don&#x27;t like the scent of their perfume to clash!  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with putting this on under foundation either.  It doesn&#x27;t make my foundation sink into my pores at all (and I have very large pores so this almost always is an issue with products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve applied this to a bad sunburn on my nose too! It really brought immediate relief and toned the redness down within a few hours.  The formula isn&#x27;t too thick or thin and goes on very nicely.  You only need a small amount since it spreads quite well.  I really love how it works and keep it in my bag just incase the puffiness creeps back in later on in the day if I happen to be outside for long periods of time.  Since the bottle is smaller it fits in my purse quite well!</li>
            <li> great for your skin, i love it,</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the cucumber and I use it under my eyes .  It glides on smoothly and I wear it under my makeup.  I received it as a gift but I will purchase it once it&#x27;s used.  The application process is flawless.</li>
            <li> Impressed! It has a really light scent so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or my skin. I think if you left it in the fridge and used it in the morning to get rid of your sleepy eyes, you&#x27;d have an even better result! I don&#x27;t particularly have dark circles so I can&#x27;t comment on how great it works for that but I am definitely using it for all-nighters!</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of the AzureNaturals Cucumber Infused ULTIMATE PEPTIDE Eye Brightening Gel from Azure Naturals for reviewing purposes. I really enjoy using it. The gel is a great consistency and absorbs very easily.  This Gel has a great scent and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe because it&#x27;s gel and the air hitting it makes it feel cool. The scent is really great. It has a light fresh cucumber scent that I love. It definitely reduces puffiness quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use at night, and it does take a bit to dry, so keep that mind mind. It&#x27;s great for tightening the skin</li>
            <li> Its great that all I have to say. Very firming.</li>
            <li> One of the best eye cream I&#x27;ve tried!!</li>
            <li> The product i received for testing purposes is a good gel, that is very light weight and goes on smooth and absorbs pretty fast and dd not interfere with my make up application. I have very sensitive skin around my eyes and I get very leery of apply products around this area. Most of the time products may my eyes water. But this one did not do that. I experienced no irritation in the area. I didn&#x27;t get too much smell of cucumber but it did have a pleasant smell and not overly perfume scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product every day since I received it. Unfortunately I have not been able to tell a difference. That&#x27;s neither good nor bad, but I just see no change in the area around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does have a fairly strong cucumber scent, which did not bother me but if you do not like that, then you may not like this. Also, the pump is hard to disperse I small amount. When using the pump you get a bit more than needed so I feel there is a little waste.</li>
            <li> Azure Naturals cucumber eye gel is a nice product. It keeps the swelling down in my eyes do to allergies and it keeps my skin around my eyes soft.</li>
            <li> I like the thickness of the gel. Seems to work well.</li>
            <li> I have puffy eyes, and this worked wonders. I&#x27;m very happy with how it went on, not greasy at all, and no after residue. You can use it twice a day, that is what is recommended, and I like especially using it after the day is done because it feels soothing as I lay in bed.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. I can feel the tightening of my eye area. I have deep dark circles and bags under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I realize there isn&#x27;t any miracle product out (no fantastic repair)  but this is a over good product for me. Love the cucumber fragrance!</li>
            <li> This product feels really cool (no pun intended).  It has a nice easy texture to it and you can clearly feel the difference when you put it on.</li>
            <li> This eye brightening gel gave my sensitive skin a weird burning feeling under my eyes three times and the other times it didn&#x27;t bother my skin.  The pump does give out a lot more gel than you need so just put some of it back in the bottle by unscrewing the pump. I use this product day and night. I have notice my dark circles started to lighten up a bit since using this product. This eye gel smells like a freshly peeled cucumber which is a very nice smell. I got this eye gel for free to review as part of a promotion.</li>
            <li> This is a nice silky cream and feels good.  I have used this gel faithfully since I received it.  One morning when my eyes were extremely pufffy, I used it and did see a little difference.  Other than that, I cannot see where my under eye area is any different.  Also, the bottom inch of the bottle is solid--there is no product there.  The taller bottle makes it look like you are getting more, when you&#x27;re not.  I consider this deceptive.  So, due to the fact I can see no improvement in my skin, and deceptive packaging, I will not recommend this and I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen an improvement after 6 weeks, but on the other hand, hasn&#x27;t been any worse. Also, I&#x27;m very allergic to products, and my skins seems to take this product quite well.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this line of products! All natural and always my face feel nice and refreshed!</li>
            <li> Think of this as a mini cucumber session at the spa except in bottle form. This stuff is amazing and makes around my eyes feel brighter and younger. It has helped rid the dark circles around my eyes somewhat and I am thankful for that. Most products that claim they will get rid of that usually never work. I plan on continuing to use it and see where I end up once the bottle is gone. *Received for review purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I really love this product! I can see the differences in my dark circles.</li>
            <li> is natural works easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a soothing feel around the eye but beyond that I don&#x27;t notice much difference. I&#x27;ve used it morning and night for several weeks and do not see the brightening effect that this is supposed to deliver. It&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> I did not really care for this product. I found that it did not really work and it was not made for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> First I must disclose that I have been provided this product to test with the understanding that I will write a product review that is accurate and completely honest.&lt;br /&gt;For years I have had bags under my eyes - a result of a very stressful job that demands hours behind a computer, overdoing my daily intake of coffee, inadequate sleep, the occasional wearing of contacts, and advancing age. I always look exhausted which is a buzzkill when I am out with friends - and especially in pictures. This gel goes on easily and smoothly. It feels great. It does not dry out on my skin and “pull” and it does not look like “makeup” on my skin. It eases my puffiness, brightens the dark areas, and feels amazingly cool and refreshing; that is the best part: it truly feels cool and refreshing for hours after I apply it. I have tried one very expensive product like this about a year ago that I was very unhappy with, so I was skeptical about this one. Skeptic no more. And the price of this gel is one-quarter the price of the one I previously tried. I like it so much that I have already placed a gift order for a friend…</li>
            <li> Made the skin under my eyes look bright and young and fresh! Didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and I have very sensitive skin. Has a great smell and isn&#x27;t oily. Made the bag under my eyes go away for the day so it is something that you would use everyday but it does to do the job!</li>
            <li> Used for 2 weeks didnt see much of a change</li>
            <li> I love the ultimate Vitamin C and the Retinol serum so I decided to try this product.  The dark circles are lighter and the under eye puffiness is much better.  i will continue to use this gel 2 x per day since I have gotten great results.</li>
            <li> This works so well and makes my eyes look so nice with the cucumber cooling clear gel  I will order this again for sure.</li>
            <li> Sticky and did nothing that it said it would</li>
            <li> This product along with the Vitamin C toner, cleanser, and moisturizer is fantastic. My skin looks young, fresh and blemish free. I use one squirt of this product on my cheeks, eyes, and nose for dry climates. The moisturizer was not enough until I started doing this. They all feel so light like I am not using anything.</li>
            <li> Working good- send me another!</li>
            <li> Really nice product.  It has helped me with my morning bags and dark rings under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any improvement as yet.  I will continue to use until the bottle is empty an then write another review.</li>
            <li> Received free for review, this product is amazing i have dark circles under my eyes and been looking for something to help this product helped so much my eyes look so much lighter than they did.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product for free for an honor review. This product has starting to diminish the dark lines under my eyes. I love cooling feel when I apply it around my eyes and the cucumber scent...great. I apply twice a day in the morning and at night after i wash my face and pat it dry. The fact that this product is natural and organic Ingredients,97% Natural, 72% Organic and contains no alcohol, no parabens. It is  plant based with no GMO&#x27;&#x27;s and there were not animals use to test this product, makes me feel safer and guilt free for using this product.The packaging of the products is nice also. Easy hold bottle with a small pump, so that you can get the rigth amount of product out, without over pouring.Great product and works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Felt gentle on my skin with no stcky or greasy feel. Went into my skin quickly. Got high hopes because its gots somw awesome ingredients  in it. I recieved this product for my unbised review</li>
            <li> Love natural eye cream. Great lightweight but had some substance in your fingers. I love that it. You can also use all over your face. I usually do two pumps and focus on my eyes and then pump another serum straight into the same fingers and smooth that all over. It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t clump up when combined.</li>
            <li> This product left many lines under my eyes&lt;br /&gt;Maybe my eyes sensitive</li>
            <li> I saw immediate results with diminishing morning puffiness. Results for dark circles takes a few weeks, but this product will work with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that I can put this around my eyes and then put my makeup on without the makeup caking - that is a HUGE plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gentle firming and coolness feels good around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plain and simple - I am pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Azure Naturals provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
            <li> Very soothing to under eye area. Smells awesome, exactly like cucumbers! It definitely helped get rid of dark circles and puffiness. Works fine under primer and concealer. Immediately cools and soothes irritated under eye area. Great product and a little goes a long way so the product will last you a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW. MY OPINIONS OF THIS PRODUCT ARE BASED ON MY OWN HONEST AND UNBIASED EXPERIENCE USING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I received this eye gel for free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion. I’ve tried a lot of eye gels and creams hoping that they would help my allergy induced bags, puffiness and dark under eye circles. Absolutely nothing has ever worked, until now. This still isn’t 100% as it doesn’t work completely on the dark area, however I did notice that there was a decrease in the darkness and size of the area. It also helps reduce my bags under my eyes and the all-around puffiness that I can get on both the top and bottom. I was honestly shocked, and I am still giving this 5 stars because I figure if it mostly works on my hard to improve allergy irritated eyes that it must work better for the average person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel when applied to the skin is cooling and slightly tingles, but in a good feeling way. I do have sensitive skin all over, but using things around my eyes can often irritate both my skin and eyeballs without getting it in my actual eyes just close. This does not irritate my skin or my eyes so it does feel safe for sensitive skin. I have to say I was also surprised to see while using this that a slight scar that looks more like a wrinkle but truly is a scar started to diminish while using this. I can barely tell that it is there now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried this as an all over face treatment because I want to save it for my delicate eye area that has more issues. I also like this enough that I told my husband who likes to also try my eye gels that this one is mine. He really liked this as well. I’m usually very skeptical and find most things don’t work for me. If you think I’m overhyping this go read some of my other reviews about skincare…I take this stuff seriously! When this bottle runs out I would consider purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I have tried several of azure products now I like this I like how it take the puffiness that is under my eye it smooth it not greasy looking or chalky it doesn&#x27;t even like you have put it on I would recommend this</li>
            <li> I love this eye product!!!</li>
            <li> Azure Naturals Cucumber Infused Eye-Brightening Gel. Again, the same problems. Bags under the eyes and that horrid tired eye look. So this time when Tomoson generously offered to let me test out Azure Naturals&#x27; eye brightening gel, I said yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This before photo is &#x27;scary&#x27; so please no gasps or cries of alarm, lol. I was tired and you can definitely see the bags under my eyes but what better time to try out the gel, right? So bear with the before photo in anticipation of the after photo. I promise it isn&#x27;t nearly as scary looking, lol.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously this is only after one use of Azure Naturals&#x27; Cucumber infused eye brightening gel but I can already see a difference. Can you? I used the gel on my eyelids, under my eyes and on the corners of my eyes similar to how you would use a highlighting pen and definitely saw a brightening around my eyes and the bags weren&#x27;t quite as scary looking, no?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application process couldn&#x27;t be easier. You squirt and rub - absorbs into your skin with great ease - and that&#x27;s that. For optimal results, they recommend two doses a day (once in the AM and again in the PM) and even suggest using it all over your face if you so desire but since I was pairing this with OZ Naturals I didn&#x27;t see the need to do so. Again, no irritation and my skin didn&#x27;t feel like a cake being overly frosted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel incredibly has a 1 Year Money-Back Guarantee! Wow, right? So where can you possibly go wrong with this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: My gel was comped by Azure Naturals BUT the reviews and opinions are ALL my own. I hope they were helpful!</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a man who bought this for his girlfriend, so your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, as always, the first thing I want to know about a product is how it looks: this lotion comes in a bottle about 4 inches tall, and has a base of about the size of a quarter, slightly larger. The packaging it arrived in was spacious, with lots of bubble wrap to make sure the product wasn&#x27;t damaged. Opening it up, you get a good smell of cucumbers, which is always a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head of the bottle has an applicator under a lid, simply press to get out some lotion. The instructions are clearly printed on, but the sticker doesn&#x27;t seem to be 100% adhered or centered onto the bottle. The lotion itself has a pleasant smell and goes smoothly onto the skin, and the fragrance fades in about 10-15 minutes. While I personally haven&#x27;t seen a difference in the before and after, it&#x27;s only been about a week, but my girlfriend claims it&#x27;s working well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say I recommend this product; it&#x27;s pricey at its current listing of $19.99, but it&#x27;s worth the money. The amount of lotion given isn&#x27;t a staggering amount, but it&#x27;s sufficient to last a couple months at least if you put it on once daily. The photos attached are of the bottle and its applicator so you get a better sense of what I was talking about.</li>
            <li> This works wonders on under eye puffiness and circles. Nice cool and refreshing and has a nice smell to it. Seem to help with some small wrinkles around my eyes as well. Great for new moms.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite morning eye products lately!  Azure Naturals sent me this Eye Brightening Gel to review for them a few weeks ago and I love it!  I have been keeping it in my fridge so when I apply it in the a.m. it helps wake me up and feels super refreshing! LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;I use the Eye Gel as part of my a.m. skincare routine and apply it all around my eyes.  If there is any left over I also apply it to my neck.  Like I said, I like to keep it in my fridge for that extra refreshing feeling in the morning.  Not only does it help wake me up but it also helps reduce the appearance of my fine lines. smooths my skin texture and leaves it feeling well moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;As with all Azure Naturals products (one of the reasons why I LOVE this company) they make all of their products in the USA with only the highest quality natural and organic ingredients available.  Contains no alcohol, no parabens, no GMO&#x27;s, and their products are cruelty free and never tested on animals! Love this Eye Gel!! :)</li>
            <li> I have used other products from this brand and I have been quite happy with the results that I have gotten! I use this product for my eye area and also use it on spots where I have fine lines – and it works beautifully! It has kept my face hydrated and moisturized, which has been quite challenging during the colder months. It truly delivers the results that it promises and I can honestly say that it’s worth trying and purchasing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> This eye brightening gel is amazing. It really smells like cucumber! There are companies that boast that they have certain ingredients in their products but sometimes the smell doesn&#x27;t come through in their products. When you pump out this eye gel&#x27;s contents you immediately smell the cucumber in it. The gel is similar to the consistency and color of Aloe Vera in that it is opaque colored and thick. Once applied under your eyes you feel a cool sensation and immediately know it is working. This Eye Gel will diminish dark circles, eye bags, puffiness, crow&#x27;s feet, fine lines, and sagginess for firmer more youthful skin around the eyes and all over the face. So far it has only depuffed my eyes but I am sure with continued use I will see diminishment in my dark circles. Best of all is that this eye gel contains no alcohol, no parabens, no GMO&#x27;s, and is cruelty free and never tested on animals! This means this is a company that delivers great quality products that are safe for us to use without causing any harm to others and no alcohol means the product won&#x27;t dry out your face. My verdict is that this is an amazing product and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is very good at brightening the under eye area, but I really wanted it for puffiness, and it didn&#x27;t work too well on that for me; but I started using it around my mouth and above my lip and it seems to be helping there with wrinkles and skin brightening. I don&#x27;t notice a smell, but it does feel cool (and good) when I put it on. Would give it 5 stars if it really helped my puffiness!!</li>
            <li> I like this eye serum a lot...but I did break out a little around my eyes. I think it is good for those whose skin can tolerate it better than mine.</li>
            <li> Going pretty well.  I have been using for 2 months now.  It works great, if I keep to a good sleep schedule.  Like the texture, no smell really.  Works for me.  I recommend it.  I have stopped wearing concealer a month after use, so that says a lot.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels when applying. Very cooling and not greasy, seems to have an immediate affect.</li>
            <li> It is a nice eye gel, with non-greasy texture, smell&#x27;s great, and when applying on eye skin, can feel the skin is immediately hydrated and soothing, and it&#x27;s price is reasonable compared to similar products on the market, I will keep use it. I was given this product for a review.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this item since it has many good reviews. I am not old or have excessive sagging of facial features but Father Time has begun the process of making me look more like an AARP member over the past couple of years. I began using a mud mask and while it does well, the face it a little dry. Those lotions in the mainstream markets are mainly greasy or smell like my wife&#x27;s perfume. They are inexpensive for a good reason. This stuff is nothing like that and is a great companion to the mud for a complete barrier against Father Time&#x27;s wrath. It has a pleasant light scent and a small amount is all one needs. I like this this item from Azure Naturals and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This cream is pretty magical. I personally have seen a quick reduction in my dark circles after a few days of using this. I wake up at 4 AM and go to sleep at around 11 PM so I get limited sleep and the dark circles are fairly common for me but this is helping them go away.</li>
            <li> Very nice eye treatment. It smells just like cucumber and helps revive my tired eyes.  Great price and and happy with the quality of ingredients.</li>
            <li> it started to brighten around my eyes on the 3rd day!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin under my eyes dry and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this everyday on my eyes. It helps keep my skin plump. It smells nice. Its not sticky nor greasy. Its on my vanity to stay!</li>
            <li> Really works! Took a little while to receive the shipment but very happy once I got it.</li>
            <li> I have not seen a noticeable difference since I began using it.  I might need more time -- it has a good consistency and is easy to apply.  I have yet to find something that really works on the circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few weeks, but I really love this Eye gel. My first time buying any kind of Eye cream, but so far I&#x27;m very happy with it. Kind of sticky at first, but dries on your skin just fine. Leaves my skin supple</li>
            <li> Makes eyes feel soft and smooth.  That is the area around the eyes!  very cool and refreshing cucumber.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using this product, I have&#x27;t noticed an eye-ota of difference.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes and skin and I can not just put anything on it without putting a very small portion to test it for a reaction.  This product I put it all the way around my eyes, lid, brow area and ynderneath giving the eye a smiother and radient look making the eyes appear more vugorous and appealing. This priduct us light weight and asorbs rather quick. The smell has a light cucumber scent to it, just wished it was alot mord stringer. But regardless of the smell component it has a great feel to ut and yes your eyes will look remarkably renewed. I highly reckmmend this priduct!!!!</li>
            <li> great products it works and smells great.  This company is outstanding. I have tried 4 of there products. and gave a couple to my sister.  My skin looks great.  Try Vitamin C serum and really anything they sell you really should be happy.</li>
            <li> This gel is just like putting a cucumber on your eyes without having to actually sit with cucumbers on your eyes. This gel smells just like a freshly cut cucumber and has the same benefits. This eye gel de-puffed my eyes and has helped to reduce the dark circles under my eyes. It feels so refreshing to rub on my eyes after a long day at work. This is by far one of the best eye gels that I have used.</li>
            <li> This eye gel comes in a beautiful pump container with a bright green label and a silver cap. It is a lightweight gel-like substance which has a nice light scent of cucumbers. I like how it just glides on my eye area skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any irritation afterwards. My skin feels so refreshed and the skin under my eyes feels more firm since I&#x27;ve been using it. I&#x27;m really happy with this product!</li>
            <li> My eyes look rejuvenated, youthful and rested!</li>
            <li> After I read the reviews I decided to give it a try. I have noticed my eyes are getting brighter and the dark circles are diminishing! I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR ABOUT 3 WEEKS,DON&#x27;T SEE ANY DIFFERENCE IN MY DARK CIRCLES, WHICH I HAVE BECAUSE OF ALLERGIES, THIS DID NOT LIGHTEN AT ALL, WILL NOT BE PURCHASING AGAIN, I&#x27;M SURE ITS A GREAT PRODUCT JUST NOT FOR ME.</li>
            <li> Being a mom of 2 children, I have dark circles under my eyes and they sometimes look puffy. I have been looking for a good product to try and decided to order this one.  It was mailed out very fast to me.&lt;br /&gt;I started off by washing my face and then applied it around my eyes. Very easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I love how this product has different uses.  It helps with Dark circles, wrinkles, puffing, sagging and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Ultimate Peptide Eye Brightening Gel will help restore your skin back to looking youthful and will help reverse the signs of aging.  It will diminish dark circles, eye bags, crow&#x27;s feet, puffiness and fine lines.  Leaving you with more youthful and firmer looking skin around your eyes and face.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it twice a day and I&#x27;ve been using it as an all over face treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face feels very moisturized and looks radiant.&lt;br /&gt;I love how they offer you a one year money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s Made in the USA With The Highest Quality Natural and Organic Ingredients Available: 97% Natural, 72% Organic. Contains No Alcohol, No Parabens, Plant Based, No GMO&#x27;s, Cruelty Free and it&#x27;s Never Tested On Animals which is very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this product a few days so far and already notice my dark circles and puffiness around my eyes diminishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I was given this product in exchange of a review. As aging with wrinkles. my wife suggests me to also use eye gel. As a man this product is nice without heavy fragrance smell and also texture not greasy. Look at the price is reasonable compared to other similar products on the market.</li>
            <li> I never really understood the concept of putting cucumber slices on your eyes -- they&#x27;re far too delicious to have sitting on my eyelids for that long. So I suppose the next best thing for my eyes is this cucumber-infused eye serum! It was a free product, so that made it even better. It feels very light and cool so I actually use it as an all-over thing for my face. So I basically get to have my cucumber and eat it, too.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating in these dry winter months. Very soothing on my sensitive skin. Definitely has a place in my skincare lineup!</li>
            <li> am absolutely speechless with this product. It does what its inttended to do. I seen the difference in just 2 uses! I have really dark around my eyes and ive tried other products but they didnt seem to work , until i came across this one. I love it! Disclaimer : i was given this product at no cost for ny honest and unbiased oppinion . I did the review based on ny personal oppinions ans experiences.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my fianc&amp;eacute; to try and she loves it. She likes the easy pump bottle and the cool, soothing effect around her eyes. She actually leaves it in the fridge so its extra cold. I don&#x27;t know if that helps, but she likes it. She says she cant really tell a difference yet as she doesn&#x27;t use it daily other than it definitely moisturizes her face and it feels fresher after using this product.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if its making a difference or anything but I love the lightweight cool gel texture. Smells fresh like cucumber too :)</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T USE AS AN ALLOVER FACE TREATMENT LIKE IT SAYS YOU CAN DO. I should have left well enough alone. My skin looked good before. I thought it would help stop aging in skin before it really starts, but bigggg mistake. I&#x27;m not sure what ingredient it was? Will never use on skin again, but may try only on the eye area. I just want my skin to go back to normal. My pores are hug now and I look super oily in my tzone when it was perfect combination with small almost invisible pores.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 4 weeks ago with Azure Natural&#x27;s Guaranteed Strongest Wrinkle Eraser 2.5% and 22% Vitamin C serums.  I use all three.  I start with Vitamin C, then the Cucumber and finish with the Retinol 2.5%.  My skin as improved so much!!!  I am 61 with dry, sensitive skin.  The dryness is much improved with no more flakes, texture is better, wrinkles are reducing due to improved hydration.  Great results at a fantastic value!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream along with &amp;#34;LIME infused 2.5% organic retinol mosturizer and I can&#x27;t say that using this cream alone would be as good but I do know that I have noticed a big difference in my skin.. using the two together has greatly improved my dark bags under my eyes and I have noticed my acne problem seems to be clearing up and I have not had any more flare ups since using these 2 creams..</li>
            <li> Although I have not been using it for a very long time. I cannot say if it brightens under my eyes. I have bad sinuses, I&#x27;m constantly blowing my nose cause redness around my nose. As a thought this was permanent, I always tried to cover with concealer, but it would rub off anyways. Yet this item had helped heal this area and reduced the redness significantly! I&#x27;m so happy its going away now!</li>
            <li> Not the best I have used. It&#x27;s ok...but won&#x27;t purchase again. Somewhat disappointed.  O</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! When I put it on my eyes, it is cool just like a cucumber and I can feel it moisterizing my eyes right away. It is not sticky or greasy, just smooth and cooling! I would reccamend this product to everyone!! My eyes are also awake after applying the cucumber gel. Just love it!!</li>
            <li> Being a senior citizen, I find I don&#x27;t sleep very well anymore.  The end result is puffy eyes and dark circles under the eyes.  I have only used this a few days but I have noticed a decrease in the puffiness around my eyes.  I still have dark circles but they seem less pronounced and I hope with continued use this will also lessen.  I may try it all over my face but for now I am concentrating on my eyes.  I do like that this product is made in the USA not a foreign country.  It is made with all natural and organic ingredients without all the nasty man made chemicals.  My skin is sensitive but I have not had any problems using this on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I have not received any compensation for writing this post.

            <li> I was sent this product for free to review. I did not personally use it but I let my sister use it for a week and let me know how it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said that it was ok. She felt like it worked pretty but she didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference. You may or may not like the smell, it&#x27;s not really bad but she didn&#x27;t like it due to personal preference.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, I been use in gut every day, I love the cucumber scent. I even have my husband using it</li>
            <li> great my second order</li>
            <li> Amazing eye care. Have only used for three days but my skin feels so much better around my eyes. It truly is so wonderful.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product in an exchange for a review. It works very well on my eyes. My eyes feel smoother and I have less puffiness.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this product. I see difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This product was so cooling, and the smell was nice and cucumber like. My eye felt nice and the puffy areas went away. I even used on the rest of my face and it did make my face glow.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. It&#x27;s beyond great it works perfectly and is a great buy</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my husband and he tried it for a month. for dark under eye circles.  It has not worked so now I&#x27;m shopping for something else for him.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> It was ok - a little disappointed with the product</li>
            <li> I ordered the full line - for morning I use the Vitamin C toner, Vitamin C serum and Vitamin C moisturizer, plus the cucumber eye. in the evening I use the Vitamin C toner, Retinol serum and Retinol moisturizer plus the cucumber eye. I also purchased the Vitamin C cleanser but I haven&#x27;t been using it yet as I finish up another cleanser. there were a few minor blemishes at first as my skin got used to the new products. I can say after a couple of weeks there is NOTICEABLE difference in sun-related pigmentation/discoloration and a rough patch of skin that formed on my cheek a few months ago (and didn&#x27;t go away with any other skin products is now completely gone. I use a Clarisonic daily. there&#x27;s been no issue with irritation or dryness. My skin feels very soft and makeup goes on beautifully. My forehead lines appear to be smoothing out and my eye crinkles do as well. for the affordable price I am REALLY IMPRESSED. I will keep ordering.</li>
