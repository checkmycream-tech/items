            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had my dryer almost a month now, and LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>(Be sure and check your filter for blockage now and then!)</li>
            <li>Nice quality, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s efficient and the temperature options as nice.</li>
            <li>I use the diffuser all the time for my curly hair to avoid frizzing and it locks on nicely.</li>
            <li>I like its 3 settings of amount of heat and amount of air.. nice attachments.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with the way the product was packed, in it&#x27;s new and unused packaging.</li>
            <li>My hair is now soft shiny and the volume is amazing!!!</li>
            <li>It is also more effective...</li>
            <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5-17-12: Still going strong!</li>
            <li>The handle is very comfortable to hold, with either hand.  </li>
            <li>It also straightens my hair very quickly, defrizzing it and leaving a nice shine.   </li>
            <li>He paid attention and researched and voila -- a wonderful and very thoughtful Christmas present!  </li>
            <li>The power, the smooth sounds, the quality and results are amazing.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this hair dryer...</li>
            <li>I recommend the TRESemme Flawless Curls Defining Gel if you have thick curly hair and need a great dryer with a fantastic diffuser!</li>
            <li>I love this dryer...</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>, I love it -</li>
            <li>He works in Hollywood and does the hair and wigs of many ladies you have heard of.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments.  </li>
            <li>i absolutely love the look and feel of my hair.</li>
            <li>The best quality dryer I can definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>It works as advertised and the power is sufficient to straighten even the most curly hair.  </li>
            <li>My beautician and many of her colleagues use it.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.  </li>
            <li>After years of having a long magnificent mane...</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s working great so far.</li>
            <li>Also, the diffuser is nicely shaped so you can get it right on your scalp because it is curved, and it won&#x27;t fall off all the time like it might with another brand.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair very quickly and the attachments stay put and do not fall off.  </li>
            <li>but I have easily adjusted how I hold the dryer so this no longer happens.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for about 3 weeks now and the airflow on the lowest settings is too strong.  </li>
            <li>I love how you press the cool shot button</li>
            <li>3-temperatures and a cool button which I love.  </li>
            <li>I dropped mine one too many times and had to buy another one which I quickly did.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t leave me a sweaty mess when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much quieter than the Sally&#x27;s dryer I bought (that cost more than the FHI by the way!).</li>
            <li>so flyaways and frizzies are usually a huge issue..but not with this dryer...</li>
            <li>My hair came out so smooth</li>
            <li>It does leave hair smooth and shiny as promised</li>
            <li>I will never settle for a cheap hair dryer again.</li>
            <li>It made my hair smooth, with shine, no fizz, it didn&#x27;t have the fried look to it</li>
            <li>Just consider another product if you are ready to spend this kind of money.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a fabulous hair dryer that tames all of my hair!</li>
            <li>I love this dryer so much.  </li>
            <li>I was using a T3 tourmaline dryer and loved it, but I thought I&#x27;d try something different this time.  </li>
            <li>The dryer is great -- high heat setting, powerful, cuts drying time by about 30%, leaves hair super shiny and soft, and I noticed that hair stayed that way for longer.  </li>
            <li>i recently purchased this dryer, and its the best dryer to straighten my coarse relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste more time or money on frustrating hair blowers, be good to yourself and buy this awesome hair blower.      </li>
            <li>The FHI Nano hair dryer that I purchased through this seller was exactly what was advertised and what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and smooth after using this blow-dryer and dries fast too.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>After weeks of research I was finally between the FHI nano and the T3 featherweight deluxe...</li>
            <li>Its a one-time purchase and so worth it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
            <li>it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>The price was right on the FHI Nano</li>
            <li>It dries my hair quickly and my hair has a nice shine and is silky...not fried or dry looking!</li>
            <li>Great power as usual.</li>
            <li>The medium (warm) setting is hot enough that I have used the &#x27;hot&#x27; setting maybe once or twice in the year</li>
            <li>The blow dryer has a long cord which is nice.</li>
            <li>it made it absolutely straight that i didn&#x27;t even have to use my solia flat iron, which is the best flat iron EVER, i had to add (I LOVE MY FLAT IRON).</li>
            <li>I really do get such nice compliments.  </li>
            <li>When I had to replace the first one, I tried several different blow dryers (all highly recommended and between $130-200) but this one is by far the best!  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m really pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li>The first one lasted me 3 years before the motor gave out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be going back to the T3 because it&#x27;s better in every way.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because my stylist uses it, and i love the final results.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t know how long  it will last me but hair stylists are happy with it.</li>
            <li>Has separate heat levels (cool, warm, hot) and speed levels...vs the cheaper ones that have only off, low, high control.  </li>
            <li>Keeping in mind what others have said about the cool shot button, I&#x27;ve been careful not to hit it, and my dryer is working fine.  </li>
            <li>I rarely leave reviews, but I have used my new hairdryer 4 times now</li>
            <li>The selectors are on the back of the handle and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have nearly more long, curly hair than Shakira herself...and this dryer does the job very well on the low setting and quickly!</li>
            <li>I thought that perhaps I put too much product in my hair, and I almost thought that the product made my hair a tad oily.  </li>
            <li>it really does take away the frizzies.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have very curly/frizzy hair</li>
            <li>(I have very curly frizzy hair).  </li>
            <li>makes her hair really shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing unusual.  </li>
            <li>and it stays cool, then push it again and it goes back to hot.  </li>
            <li>When I first starting using the dryer, I accidentally hit the cool button</li>
            <li>It is very powerful though so make sure you use Mocorran Oil or at least a comparable oil to mosturize your hair.</li>
            <li>Very powerful and incredibly silent for all the air that it blows.</li>
            <li>I have fine, relatively straight, long hair.</li>
            <li>Now I have to buy a whole new dryer since FHI won&#x27;t fix it because I purchased it through amazon!</li>
            <li>Not only does it dry my hair in a fraction of the time but it leaves nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>shoulder feels better because it&#x27;s so much lighter, and it takes about half the time.  </li>
            <li>But it works so much better than average.  </li>
            <li>Was my first time buying a professional dryer (had used drug store brands before).  </li>
            <li>The technology of this dryer not only dries my hair quickly, but also leaves it hydrated with lots of moisture.  </li>
            <li>Almost exactly the same setup as the first.</li>
            <li>dryer is also exceedingly lightweight, a real plus if you are doing a full blowout on your long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the filter on the back of the dryer; you can just twist off the end, rinse the filter, and put it back on!</li>
            <li>Oh, and I love that it has three different heat settings with low and high setting.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I recommend the product highly.</li>
            <li>The Salon quality at an affordable price with a SOLID DIFFUSER that wouldn&#x27;t lose grip on the dryer is what I sought, and it&#x27;s exactly what I got!</li>
            <li>So...my girlfriend has this really super thick, straight, shiny, enviable mane of dark red, beautiful butt-length hair.  </li>
            <li>: I paid $89 for mine, so you might compare current pricing to decide if it&#x27;s right for</li>
            <li>the cord is super long.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and a bit wavy, and I have a LOT of it, so I really need a dryer that can get in there and start drying out the hair, especially in the back and at the crown, before I start sleeking it down with the concentrator, and this dryer can do it in minutes without me sitting around air-drying it for 20-30 minutes first.    </li>
            <li>but I found the high heat setting too hot and usually left it on the \\&quot;warm\\&quot; heat setting.  </li>
            <li>our old \\&quot;high end\\&quot; hair dryer I started referring to this ritual of hers as \\&quot;Hairnobyl\\&quot;</li>
            <li>If you have really thin hair, the heat on this dryer maybe too much and burn or frizz your hair, but if you have thick hair, it is the BEST.</li>
            <li>It is heavier to hold - but not excessively so</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure if its still safe to use it.</li>
            <li>I can wash and dry my hair and be ready for makeup in so much less time than I&#x27;ve ever been able.  </li>
            <li>The hair dryer was great at first, but just after I had it for a year it broke and would only blow cold air.  </li>
            <li>I can understand why some of the other reviews say the cool button gets in the way.  </li>
            <li>and I can dry my hair right after the shower,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had expensive dryers before but this little wonder is truly awesome!!</li>
            <li>Nope that&#x27;s just the natural shine.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I had it professional styled.</li>
            <li>I had the last one for four years before it broke (thanks to my husband).  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t really like that the controls are on the back of the handle.  </li>
            <li>My old T3 lasted four years before it started shooting out sparks.  </li>
            <li>and it is so loud my ears ring for an hour after I shut it off.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and shiny even after color treatments.</li>
            <li>Right away I noted it was at least twice as quiet as my old Revlon Quiet Tone, more a low rumbling than high pitched blast.  </li>
            <li>I have accidentally pressed it a time or two, but so easy to press it back and move my hand down a smidge.   </li>
            <li>my hair looks great, it takes me much less time to dry my hair, and it&#x27;s not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>I have long straight brown hair</li>
            <li>this dryer and have high hopes of long term use and satisfaction from it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other thing I should mention is that I had the first version for over 3 years before the motor finally gave in.</li>
            <li>which weighs next to nothing and is so quiet I can actually have a normal conversation with my kids while using it.  </li>
            <li>You can get the same great results from a less expensive dryer.  </li>
            <li>As an African American who has natural hair, I was looking for a product that would not dry-out my hair.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>and it had great reviews (other than the folks who said it blew cold air...)</li>
            <li>I decided that perhaps the bare minimum for the curls wasn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the air speed, or the well-designed air flow and concentrator, but even though it can blast some HOT air (I actually have to back it down to medium heat when I have the concentrator on)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair as fast as I expected it to either.  </li>
            <li>it takes me 15 min from wet to straight or 10 min to blow out dry curly hair...</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s working great so far.</li>
            <li> Also, the diffuser is nicely shaped so you can get it right on your scalp because it is curved, and it won&#x27;t fall off all the time like it might with another brand.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair very quickly and the attachments stay put and do not fall off.  </li>
            <li> but I have easily adjusted how I hold the dryer so this no longer happens.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for about 3 weeks now and the airflow on the lowest settings is too strong.  </li>
            <li> I love how you press the cool shot button</li>
            <li> 3-temperatures and a cool button which I love.  </li>
            <li> I dropped mine one too many times and had to buy another one which I quickly did.  </li>
            <li> The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t leave me a sweaty mess when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much quieter than the Sally&#x27;s dryer I bought (that cost more than the FHI by the way!).</li>
            <li> so flyaways and frizzies are usually a huge issue..but not with this dryer...</li>
            <li> My hair came out so smooth</li>
            <li> It does leave hair smooth and shiny as promised</li>
            <li> I will never settle for a cheap hair dryer again.</li>
            <li> It made my hair smooth, with shine, no fizz, it didn&#x27;t have the fried look to it</li>
            <li> Just consider another product if you are ready to spend this kind of money.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a fabulous hair dryer that tames all of my hair!</li>
            <li> I love this dryer so much.  </li>
            <li> I was using a T3 tourmaline dryer and loved it, but I thought I&#x27;d try something different this time.  </li>
            <li> The dryer is great -- high heat setting, powerful, cuts drying time by about 30%, leaves hair super shiny and soft, and I noticed that hair stayed that way for longer.  </li>
            <li> i recently purchased this dryer, and its the best dryer to straighten my coarse relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste more time or money on frustrating hair blowers, be good to yourself and buy this awesome hair blower.      </li>
            <li> The FHI Nano hair dryer that I purchased through this seller was exactly what was advertised and what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and smooth after using this blow-dryer and dries fast too.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> After weeks of research I was finally between the FHI nano and the T3 featherweight deluxe...</li>
            <li> Its a one-time purchase and so worth it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
            <li> it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> The price was right on the FHI Nano</li>
            <li> It dries my hair quickly and my hair has a nice shine and is silky...not fried or dry looking!</li>
            <li> Great power as usual.</li>
            <li> The medium (warm) setting is hot enough that I have used the &#x27;hot&#x27; setting maybe once or twice in the year</li>
            <li> The blow dryer has a long cord which is nice.</li>
            <li> it made it absolutely straight that i didn&#x27;t even have to use my solia flat iron, which is the best flat iron EVER, i had to add (I LOVE MY FLAT IRON).</li>
            <li> I really do get such nice compliments.  </li>
            <li> When I had to replace the first one, I tried several different blow dryers (all highly recommended and between $130-200) but this one is by far the best!  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m really pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> The first one lasted me 3 years before the motor gave out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be going back to the T3 because it&#x27;s better in every way.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because my stylist uses it, and i love the final results.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t know how long  it will last me but hair stylists are happy with it.</li>
            <li> Has separate heat levels (cool, warm, hot) and speed levels...vs the cheaper ones that have only off, low, high control.  </li>
            <li> Keeping in mind what others have said about the cool shot button, I&#x27;ve been careful not to hit it, and my dryer is working fine.  </li>
            <li> I rarely leave reviews, but I have used my new hairdryer 4 times now</li>
            <li> The selectors are on the back of the handle and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have nearly more long, curly hair than Shakira herself...and this dryer does the job very well on the low setting and quickly!</li>
            <li> I thought that perhaps I put too much product in my hair, and I almost thought that the product made my hair a tad oily.  </li>
            <li> it really does take away the frizzies.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have very curly/frizzy hair</li>
            <li> (I have very curly frizzy hair).  </li>
            <li> makes her hair really shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing unusual.  </li>
            <li> and it stays cool, then push it again and it goes back to hot.  </li>
            <li> When I first starting using the dryer, I accidentally hit the cool button</li>
            <li> It is very powerful though so make sure you use Mocorran Oil or at least a comparable oil to mosturize your hair.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and incredibly silent for all the air that it blows.</li>
            <li> I have fine, relatively straight, long hair.</li>
            <li> Now I have to buy a whole new dryer since FHI won&#x27;t fix it because I purchased it through amazon!</li>
            <li> Not only does it dry my hair in a fraction of the time but it leaves nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> shoulder feels better because it&#x27;s so much lighter, and it takes about half the time.  </li>
            <li> But it works so much better than average.  </li>
            <li> Was my first time buying a professional dryer (had used drug store brands before).  </li>
            <li> The technology of this dryer not only dries my hair quickly, but also leaves it hydrated with lots of moisture.  </li>
            <li> Almost exactly the same setup as the first.</li>
            <li> dryer is also exceedingly lightweight, a real plus if you are doing a full blowout on your long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the filter on the back of the dryer; you can just twist off the end, rinse the filter, and put it back on!</li>
            <li> Oh, and I love that it has three different heat settings with low and high setting.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I recommend the product highly.</li>
            <li> The Salon quality at an affordable price with a SOLID DIFFUSER that wouldn&#x27;t lose grip on the dryer is what I sought, and it&#x27;s exactly what I got!</li>
            <li> So...my girlfriend has this really super thick, straight, shiny, enviable mane of dark red, beautiful butt-length hair.  </li>
            <li> : I paid $89 for mine, so you might compare current pricing to decide if it&#x27;s right for</li>
            <li> the cord is super long.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and a bit wavy, and I have a LOT of it, so I really need a dryer that can get in there and start drying out the hair, especially in the back and at the crown, before I start sleeking it down with the concentrator, and this dryer can do it in minutes without me sitting around air-drying it for 20-30 minutes first.    </li>
            <li> but I found the high heat setting too hot and usually left it on the \\&quot;warm\\&quot; heat setting.  </li>
            <li> our old \\&quot;high end\\&quot; hair dryer I started referring to this ritual of hers as \\&quot;Hairnobyl\\&quot;</li>
            <li> If you have really thin hair, the heat on this dryer maybe too much and burn or frizz your hair, but if you have thick hair, it is the BEST.</li>
            <li> It is heavier to hold - but not excessively so</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if its still safe to use it.</li>
            <li> I can wash and dry my hair and be ready for makeup in so much less time than I&#x27;ve ever been able.  </li>
            <li> The hair dryer was great at first, but just after I had it for a year it broke and would only blow cold air.  </li>
            <li> I can understand why some of the other reviews say the cool button gets in the way.  </li>
            <li> and I can dry my hair right after the shower,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had expensive dryers before but this little wonder is truly awesome!!</li>
            <li> Nope that&#x27;s just the natural shine.  </li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I had it professional styled.</li>
            <li> I had the last one for four years before it broke (thanks to my husband).  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t really like that the controls are on the back of the handle.  </li>
            <li> My old T3 lasted four years before it started shooting out sparks.  </li>
            <li> and it is so loud my ears ring for an hour after I shut it off.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and shiny even after color treatments.</li>
            <li> Right away I noted it was at least twice as quiet as my old Revlon Quiet Tone, more a low rumbling than high pitched blast.  </li>
            <li> I have accidentally pressed it a time or two, but so easy to press it back and move my hand down a smidge.   </li>
            <li> my hair looks great, it takes me much less time to dry my hair, and it&#x27;s not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have long straight brown hair</li>
            <li> this dryer and have high hopes of long term use and satisfaction from it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other thing I should mention is that I had the first version for over 3 years before the motor finally gave in.</li>
            <li> which weighs next to nothing and is so quiet I can actually have a normal conversation with my kids while using it.  </li>
            <li> You can get the same great results from a less expensive dryer.  </li>
            <li> As an African American who has natural hair, I was looking for a product that would not dry-out my hair.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> and it had great reviews (other than the folks who said it blew cold air...)</li>
            <li> I decided that perhaps the bare minimum for the curls wasn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the air speed, or the well-designed air flow and concentrator, but even though it can blast some HOT air (I actually have to back it down to medium heat when I have the concentrator on)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair as fast as I expected it to either.  </li>
            <li> it takes me 15 min from wet to straight or 10 min to blow out dry curly hair...</li>
            <li> My only complaint, just like the model before, is that the hot air comes out of the separation between the buttons and the frame and can bother my hands.</li>
            <li> She mantains it so thoroughly and with so much detail, her daily routine usually takes substantial effort and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> since all the reviews said T3 didn&#x27;t last long...</li>
            <li> My hair comes out smooth and shiny from this dryer, and it only takes me a few minutes to get my thick hair to the point that I want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty thick</li>
            <li> Worked fine the first few days, now it only blows cold air.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t click the blue button unless you want it locked on the cold temperature -- I almost thought I had a defective product because I didn&#x27;t know I had clicked it by accident.</li>
            <li> it only took me about 5 minutes to dry the hair.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I&#x27;m out a pretty expensive professional dryer that only lasted a year.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> Less time, less frustration and feeling a little bit prettier in the mornings is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair SO much faster than any other dryer - even some pricier ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I color my hair (to cover gray) and blow drying always takes too long and hair looks dry and have some sticking up all over.  </li>
            <li> What can I say, oh it is not all that heavy, regular weight as other unless you want a little blow and a lot of noise from a much cheaper hair blower.  </li>
            <li> But if you feel your hair is getting too dry and/or frizzy, fly-away hair --- this will take care of it.</li>
            <li> I have lot of hair so it does take some time to dry</li>
            <li> It worked as described for almost a year and suddenly the plastic covering the shaft started to melt down.</li>
            <li> I only use it twice a week for a half hour,</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s less than 100 hours of total use.</li>
            <li> I searched and researched for a new hairdryer to replace my sad, old, held-together-with-tape dryer, and based on reviews, put this one on my wish list.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> and I have had my second one for a few months.</li>
            <li> I only wish it wasn&#x27;t quite so heavy, although I have used dryers that were heavier.</li>
            <li> Hair dried in 1/3 the time as usual and is soft and silky...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the diffuser or other attachments at this point.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It took half the time to dry and no fly-away hair!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no louder than average.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no heavier than average.  </li>
            <li> That would be my only complaint with the dryer.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money...</li>
            <li> I use this for my daughter&#x27;s hair as well, who has thick, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit on the heavy side, and doesn&#x27;t have that grip coating that some of the other brands have.</li>
            <li> The FHI Nano Salon Pro 2000 Hair Dryer - Onyx Black was shipped soon after i ordered it.</li>
            <li> I will never buy anything less that than 2000 Watt again.</li>
            <li> I am even using less product.  </li>
            <li> I had it less than two years before it started shooting out sparks and died.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair, and this dryer drys my hair in 10 mins or less.</li>
            <li> I have actually never had any hair dryer actually fail and for the price this dryer should last a few years.  </li>
            <li> but it is a bit heavy and</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on an FHI.</li>
            <li> Besides that, it&#x27;s so heavy</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this garbage.</li>
            <li> This dryer is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> because it raised the temperature of the bathroom 20 degrees, dimmed the lights, made me turn up the TV really loud, the dogs would hide in other rooms and communication was impossible (her mouth would move...but...).  </li>
            <li> if you are tired of wasting your money on dryers, this is your final stop, buy it, seriously.</li>
            <li> I really wanted a Chi, everyone said, \\&quot;You need the Chi!\\&quot; but the bad reviews about quality over Amazon, Folica, etc.</li>
            <li> it now only blows cold air.</li>
            <li> Thick gray smoke with a burnt plastic smell.  </li>
            <li> No more holding it down awkwardly.  </li>
            <li> and she indicated that she has been through 3 FHI hair dryers in a few months--the heating element always fails.  </li>
            <li> Very expensive blow dryer for such poor quality.</li>
            <li> and I was admiring the expensive hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer is a piece of crap.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I rarely leave reviews, but I have used my new hairdryer 4 times now and I am amazed.  The power, the smooth sounds, the quality and results are amazing.  My hair came out so smooth I thought that perhaps I put too much product in my hair, and I almost thought that the product made my hair a tad oily.  Nope that&#x27;s just the natural shine.  Wow.  My husband did a great job when he overheard me shopping at Bed and Beyond one day and I was admiring the expensive hair dryers.  He paid attention and researched and voila -- a wonderful and very thoughtful Christmas present!  Less time, less frustration and feeling a little bit prettier in the mornings is well worth the money.  Thank you FHI!</li>
            <li> The FHI Nano hair dryer that I purchased through this seller was exactly what was advertised and what I was looking for! I was very happy with the way the product was packed, in it&#x27;s new and unused packaging. It works perfectly and I would absolutely purchase through this seller again!! :) Thanks for a fabulous hair dryer that tames all of my hair!</li>
            <li> After years of having a long magnificent mane...I decided that perhaps the bare minimum for the curls wasn&#x27;t enough. I LOVE this hair dryer...I have nearly more long, curly hair than Shakira herself...and this dryer does the job very well on the low setting and quickly! I recommend the TRESemme Flawless Curls Defining Gel if you have thick curly hair and need a great dryer with a fantastic diffuser! The Salon quality at an affordable price with a SOLID DIFFUSER that wouldn&#x27;t lose grip on the dryer is what I sought, and it&#x27;s exactly what I got!</li>
            <li> I love this dryer...it really does take away the frizzies. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but it is a bit heavy and the cord is super long.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it&#x27;s pretty thick and this is a great blow dryer for my hair. It dries my hair quickly and my hair has a nice shine and is silky...not fried or dry looking! The blow dryer has a long cord which is nice. Overall, I&#x27;m really pleased with this purchase and if you have the money to spend on the blow dryer...I think it&#x27;s worth it. I haven&#x27;t used the diffuser or other attachments at this point. Once I do, I will post a comment about them.</li>
            <li> I like the three temp. and three levels of air pressure. It makes a big difference I can use it for myself and for my daughter who does not like heat.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! I highly recommend this blow dryer. Not only does it dry my hair in a fraction of the time but it leaves nice and shiny. I feel like I had it professional styled. I have long straight brown hair so flyaways and frizzies are usually a huge issue..but not with this dryer...</li>
            <li> This dryer definitely lives up to its claims.  As an African American who has natural hair, I was looking for a product that would not dry-out my hair.  The technology of this dryer not only dries my hair quickly, but also leaves it hydrated with lots of moisture.  I use this for my daughter&#x27;s hair as well, who has thick, coarse hair.  This dryer also provides moisture and helps with the manageability of her hair. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this hairdryer 6 months ago to replace her T3 and it now only blows cold air. The heating element does not function. We contacted the seller for warranty information and never received a reply. We&#x27;d give it zero stars if that was possible.</li>
            <li> The FHI Nano Salon Pro 2000 Hair Dryer - Onyx Black was shipped soon after i ordered it. I am a happy customer. I will never buy anything less that than 2000 Watt again. It does not dry out my hair. It is very powerful though so make sure you use Mocorran Oil or at least a comparable oil to mosturize your hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer 5 months ago and have used it once daily, if that.  It does leave hair smooth and shiny as promised but I found the high heat setting too hot and usually left it on the \\&quot;warm\\&quot; heat setting.  Yesterday durning my regular drying routine, the heating element died.  I have actually never had any hair dryer actually fail and for the price this dryer should last a few years.  I mentioned it to my hair dresser and she indicated that she has been through 3 FHI hair dryers in a few months--the heating element always fails.  You can get the same great results from a less expensive dryer.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on an FHI.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this hairdryer twice. The first one lasted me 3 years before the motor gave out and I have had my second one for a few months. I have long thick hair, and this dryer drys my hair in 10 mins or less. I have tried the drug store brands and they just don&#x27;t work that great for my type hair. If you have really thin hair, the heat on this dryer maybe too much and burn or frizz your hair, but if you have thick hair, it is the BEST. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Very powerful and incredibly silent for all the air that it blows. Works great and I can dry my hair right after the shower, no need to wait anymore. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I searched and researched for a new hairdryer to replace my sad, old, held-together-with-tape dryer, and based on reviews, put this one on my wish list.  Finally, on Christmas, it was mine!  I love this dryer so much.  It dries my hair SO much faster than any other dryer - even some pricier ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.  The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t leave me a sweaty mess when I&#x27;m done.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the air speed, or the well-designed air flow and concentrator, but even though it can blast some HOT air (I actually have to back it down to medium heat when I have the concentrator on), I am not dripping in sweat when I&#x27;m done blowing it straight section-by-section with my round brush.  This makes me so happy!  I can wash and dry my hair and be ready for makeup in so much less time than I&#x27;ve ever been able.  It&#x27;s no louder than average.  It&#x27;s no heavier than average.  But it works so much better than average.  I love how you press the cool shot button and it stays cool, then push it again and it goes back to hot.  No more holding it down awkwardly.  I have accidentally pressed it a time or two, but so easy to press it back and move my hand down a smidge.   My hair is very fine and a bit wavy, and I have a LOT of it, so I really need a dryer that can get in there and start drying out the hair, especially in the back and at the crown, before I start sleeking it down with the concentrator, and this dryer can do it in minutes without me sitting around air-drying it for 20-30 minutes first.    Happy customer here!  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this blow dryer for about 2 months now and I love it.  It dries my hair very quickly and the attachments stay put and do not fall off.  I can understand why some of the other reviews say the cool button gets in the way.  When I first starting using the dryer, I accidentally hit the cool button but I have easily adjusted how I hold the dryer so this no longer happens.  That would be my only complaint with the dryer.  Other than that, I love it - my hair looks great, it takes me much less time to dry my hair, and it&#x27;s not too heavy.  I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Ordered this dryer about a year ago from another site.  Was my first time buying a professional dryer (had used drug store brands before).  The dryer is great -- high heat setting, powerful, cuts drying time by about 30%, leaves hair super shiny and soft, and I noticed that hair stayed that way for longer.  It&#x27;s a bit on the heavy side, and doesn&#x27;t have that grip coating that some of the other brands have. I give it one star because I was using it two weeks ago and it caught on fire.  Thick gray smoke with a burnt plastic smell.  I contacted customer service through their website but they didn&#x27;t respond at all.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s designed to handle the heat it puts out.  Nevertheless, I&#x27;m out a pretty expensive professional dryer that only lasted a year.  Will not buy this one again, but will look for one that&#x27;s comparable.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer was great at first, but just after I had it for a year it broke and would only blow cold air.  Not worth the money...</li>
            <li> I love this blow-dryer!  What a great purchase...you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  It makes my hair shiny and smooth after using this blow-dryer and dries fast too.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Hair dryer arrived a week ago, so I&#x27;ve given it a good trial.  Right away I noted it was at least twice as quiet as my old Revlon Quiet Tone, more a low rumbling than high pitched blast.  It is heavier to hold - but not excessively so and it makes it feel like there is actually something in there for the money!  The handle is very comfortable to hold, with either hand.  Has separate heat levels (cool, warm, hot) and speed levels...vs the cheaper ones that have only off, low, high control.  Hair dried in 1/3 the time as usual and is soft and silky...I am even using less product.  I will never settle for a cheap hair dryer again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the FHI&#x27;s nano pro 2000!  This is my second one.  I had the last one for four years before it broke (thanks to my husband).  It works wondefully! I have very curly/frizzy hair and it&#x27;s the best diffuser I&#x27;ve found.  It also straightens my hair very quickly, defrizzing it and leaving a nice shine.   When I had to replace the first one, I tried several different blow dryers (all highly recommended and between $130-200) but this one is by far the best!  Oh, and I love that it has three different heat settings with low and high setting.  AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Nice quality, you get what you pay for. It&#x27;s efficient and the temperature options as nice. I use the diffuser all the time for my curly hair to avoid frizzing and it locks on nicely. Also, the diffuser is nicely shaped so you can get it right on your scalp because it is curved, and it won&#x27;t fall off all the time like it might with another brand. Make sure you don&#x27;t click the blue button unless you want it locked on the cold temperature -- I almost thought I had a defective product because I didn&#x27;t know I had clicked it by accident. Otherwise it&#x27;s working great so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for about 3 weeks now and the airflow on the lowest settings is too strong.  Even with the diffuser on, my hair frizzes every time.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair as fast as I expected it to either.  I also don&#x27;t really like that the controls are on the back of the handle.  I end up changing the settings without knowing it.  I was using a T3 tourmaline dryer and loved it, but I thought I&#x27;d try something different this time.  I&#x27;ll be going back to the T3 because it&#x27;s better in every way.  I&#x27;m giving the FHI to my niece who straightens her hair.  I&#x27;m sure it would be great for her.</li>
            <li> After weeks of research I was finally between the FHI nano and the T3 featherweight deluxe... Similar price, features (ceramic, tourmaline, ionic, lightweight)...  Finally bought FHI nano since all the reviews said T3 didn&#x27;t last long... This dryer is amazing!! It used to take me 45 min - 1 hour to blow out and straighten my hair and it would still be frizzy (I have very curly frizzy hair).  This dryer it takes me 15 min from wet to straight or 10 min to blow out dry curly hair... My hair is now soft shiny and the volume is amazing!!! I&#x27;ve had expensive dryers before but this little wonder is truly awesome!! Highly recommend!!! Buy buy buy!!</li>
            <li> This is the second version of this dryer ive had. Almost exactly the same setup as the first. Great power as usual. I have a LOT of hair so power is essential to speed up my morning routine.  My only complaint, just like the model before, is that the hot air comes out of the separation between the buttons and the frame and can bother my hands. It&#x27;s manageable, and again I&#x27;ll take it because of the power. The other thing I should mention is that I had the first version for over 3 years before the motor finally gave in. So good purchase as it lasted a while.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is a piece of crap.  I had it less than two years before it started shooting out sparks and died. For the price, it should have lasted way longer.  My old T3 lasted four years before it started shooting out sparks.  I only use it twice a week for a half hour, that&#x27;s less than 100 hours of total use. Besides that, it&#x27;s so heavy my arms always feel like they&#x27;re going to fall off and it is so loud my ears ring for an hour after I shut it off.  I replaced it with the Babyliss ($60!) which weighs next to nothing and is so quiet I can actually have a normal conversation with my kids while using it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this garbage.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this dryer.  He works in Hollywood and does the hair and wigs of many ladies you have heard of.  This dryer is AWESOME.  Does a great job.  Just don&#x27;t drop it.  I dropped mine one too many times and had to buy another one which I quickly did.  Now I put a towel in the sink and put the dryer in the sink while I&#x27;m futzing with my hair so it won&#x27;t slip off the counter.  It&#x27;s so great I am getting my mom one for Christmas whether she needs it or not.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the great reviews.  I color my hair (to cover gray) and blow drying always takes too long and hair looks dry and have some sticking up all over.  I bought this and OMG!!!  It took half the time to dry and no fly-away hair!!  I have gotten so many compliments.  I loved it but never thought anyone would notice.  I really do get such nice compliments.  Remember I am over the hill and hair seems to get dryer with the years and coloring doesn&#x27;t help that \\&quot;except cover the gray\\&quot; which I am so happy for that.  But if you feel your hair is getting too dry and/or frizzy, fly-away hair --- this will take care of it. Its a one-time purchase and so worth it.  3-temperatures and a cool button which I love.  What can I say, oh it is not all that heavy, regular weight as other unless you want a little blow and a lot of noise from a much cheaper hair blower.  Been there done that... this is the BOMB!!!  Don&#x27;t waste more time or money on frustrating hair blowers, be good to yourself and buy this awesome hair blower.      Take care and you will not regret it for one second.</li>
            <li> I really wanted a Chi, everyone said, \\&quot;You need the Chi!\\&quot; but the bad reviews about quality over Amazon, Folica, etc. convinced me to look elsewhere. The price was right on the FHI Nano and it had great reviews (other than the folks who said it blew cold air...) so I jumped in and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my dryer almost a month now, and LOVE IT! It&#x27;s so much quieter than the Sally&#x27;s dryer I bought (that cost more than the FHI by the way!). The selectors are on the back of the handle and are easy to use. Keeping in mind what others have said about the cool shot button, I&#x27;ve been careful not to hit it, and my dryer is working fine.  My hair comes out smooth and shiny from this dryer, and it only takes me a few minutes to get my thick hair to the point that I want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is also exceedingly lightweight, a real plus if you are doing a full blowout on your long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this dryer and have high hopes of long term use and satisfaction from it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I paid $89 for mine, so you might compare current pricing to decide if it&#x27;s right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5-17-12: Still going strong! Love the filter on the back of the dryer; you can just twist off the end, rinse the filter, and put it back on! (Be sure and check your filter for blockage now and then!) The medium (warm) setting is hot enough that I have used the &#x27;hot&#x27; setting maybe once or twice in the year I&#x27;ve had this dryer. It just keeps on working and working, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> i recently purchased this dryer, and its the best dryer to straighten my coarse relaxed hair. It made my hair smooth, with shine, no fizz, it didn&#x27;t have the fried look to it, it left my hair moisturized. it made it absolutely straight that i didn&#x27;t even have to use my solia flat iron, which is the best flat iron EVER, i had to add (I LOVE MY FLAT IRON). it only took me about 5 minutes to dry the hair. I purchased this because my stylist uses it, and i love the final results. it&#x27;s worth buying. if you are tired of wasting your money on dryers, this is your final stop, buy it, seriously. it is worth the money. i absolutely love the look and feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and shiny even after color treatments. The best quality dryer I can definitely recommend. I have lot of hair so it does take some time to dry but it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It works as advertised and the power is sufficient to straighten even the most curly hair.  I recommend the product highly.</li>
            <li> I had this item for about 4 days.  Worked fine the first few days, now it only blows cold air.  Very expensive blow dryer for such poor quality.</li>
            <li> So...my girlfriend has this really super thick, straight, shiny, enviable mane of dark red, beautiful butt-length hair.  She mantains it so thoroughly and with so much detail, her daily routine usually takes substantial effort and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With our old \\&quot;high end\\&quot; hair dryer I started referring to this ritual of hers as \\&quot;Hairnobyl\\&quot; because it raised the temperature of the bathroom 20 degrees, dimmed the lights, made me turn up the TV really loud, the dogs would hide in other rooms and communication was impossible (her mouth would move...but...).  After the 30 minutes of excruciating noise I was climbing the wall...not to mention a repetitive-use shoulder pain she developed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I bought her this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her shoulder feels better because it&#x27;s so much lighter, and it takes about half the time.  It is also more effective...makes her hair really shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We now own two of these...they are great!  She&#x27;s an expert, and when she raves about a hair product...trust me...it is WIN!</li>
            <li> I have fine, relatively straight, long hair. I bought this hair dryer a year ago, thinking that it would last for a while. I use it every other day to dry my hair. Nothing unusual.  It worked as described for almost a year and suddenly the plastic covering the shaft started to melt down. It still works but I&#x27;m not sure if its still safe to use it. Just consider another product if you are ready to spend this kind of money.</li>
            <li> This dryer is not too heavy. My beautician and many of her colleagues use it. I like its 3 settings of amount of heat and amount of air.. nice attachments. Just got it so don&#x27;t know how long  it will last me but hair stylists are happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.  I only wish it wasn&#x27;t quite so heavy, although I have used dryers that were heavier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser. I bought this dryer thinking it would last and it broke after only 7 months!!! It was great while it lasted! Now I have to buy a whole new dryer since FHI won&#x27;t fix it because I purchased it through amazon!</li>
