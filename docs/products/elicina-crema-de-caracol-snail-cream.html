            <li>this snail cream is excellent -- it&#x27;s really more of a gel than a cream.  </li>

            <li>This also good for my face too.</li>

            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li>This product is great if you need a light moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily after use.</li>
            <li>Amazing cream.</li>
            <li>i cant wait to see what happens in six months.i am the kind of guy who usualy doesnt use cream for anything.</li>
            <li>How nice it will be to not have to wear tons of makeup and worry about covering every inch of my face before leaving the house every day.  </li>
            <li>I have to be honest..</li>
            <li>This product is really nice, it doesnt works inmediatly</li>
            <li>I honestly did not notice one bit of a difference on my skin, and would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>Elicina flattens the bumps nicely...</li>
            <li>Honestly, I saw no changes in the appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the directions because you can get good results.</li>
            <li>I did not find this product to be effective at all.</li>
            <li>im told i have AMAZING CLEAR FLAWLESS SKIN???  </li>
            <li>Best stuff out there by far!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, I have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>when my perception change completely, I couldn&#x27;t believe this slime of snail is like magic because is sincerely close to perfect, ooh gosh</li>
            <li>Another great thing about it is that it is not difficult to use.</li>
            <li>On his skin more so, clean and spotless it was incredible what the cream did so fast!</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for 2 years now, and my skin is better than ever.  </li>
            <li>On top of that he started shaving and it does not help.</li>
            <li>and he kept saying \\&quot;I am okay mom, guys do not think like that about their skin.</li>
            <li>I try many hand cream and nothing workd.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have noticeable wrinkes and my skin is healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>Those are the Big 3 - best things I buy.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve tried many things.</li>
            <li>Snail slime is the way to go, and I will be using it until I find something better, which I doubt with be soon.</li>
            <li>RESULTS WERE FASTER AND BETTER WITH THE INCREASED USE.  </li>
            <li>IT APPEARS TO HELP THE SKIN ELIMINATE DAMAGED CELLS MORE RAPIDLY.  </li>
            <li>Glad to see</li>
            <li>it made me get more acne.it can not removal scar.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t want to buy any more</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and my face is getting better and better.</li>
            <li>and I am SO glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not embarrassed of my skin anymore :)     </li>
            <li>I have suffered from problem skin for the majority of my life and this product has helped me the most.</li>
            <li>And no, I am not selling this product, just using it :)</li>
            <li>but I figured since I&#x27;ve tried eveything else including prescriptions from my dermatologist, that I would try one more thing.</li>
            <li>i find that this product should be a lil better for the price and size that it is.</li>
            <li>its an ok cream</li>
            <li>MORE trips for Botox for over 2 yrs</li>
            <li>i love this elicina cream</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to stick with Missha because it&#x27;s got a addicting scent and works better than this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and my skin looks a lot better.</li>
            <li>and I love the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li>But once a a while when I use it, it does give me a glowing effect, makes my skin feels tighter, more lifting and the scars are faded.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any better results and its almost like my play</li>
            <li>Pretty impressive so far.</li>
            <li>)t, smooth and supple skin you get, you will love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it was unexpected how great it would make my skin look.</li>
            <li>I love this cream, I have mild acne and it always seem to get better when I&#x27;m using this cream, I stop using it for a couple weeks and then started again</li>
            <li>goes easy on the skin, no residue.</li>
            <li>MY UN SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATION IS MORE CONSISTENT SKIN REGENERATION YIELDS MORE RAPIDLY VISIBLE RESULTS</li>
            <li>and i have noticed fine Lines</li>
            <li>Exelent product it works perfect with the acne also work with the scars I haven&#x27;t seen another product that in less time u cann see results ...</li>
            <li>use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTOX works best on new wrinkles forming or medium wrinkles, but  i found a regime that naturally reduced my wrinkles and scars to almost not visible or invisible and to get BOTOX</li>
            <li>and it goes on lightly without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>Cuticura is just like elicina to me - indispensable.  </li>
            <li>The above combination has been great for me.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>I hope it&#x27;s always available.</li>
            <li>one of my arms is nearly completely smooth now.</li>
            <li>amazing, soft, smooth and supple skin you get, you will love this product.</li>
            <li>She just kept saying \\&quot;I can&#x27;t believe how fantastic your skin looks.\\</li>
            <li>I am acne free because of Elicina.  </li>
            <li>FANTASTIC stuff.</li>
            <li>BASED ON MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, THE PICTURES ON THE ELICINAUSA WEBSITE FAIRLY REPRESENT THE REULTS MOST PEOPLE CAN EXPECT.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I ALSO USED IT ON A SIGNIFICANT BURN.  </li>
            <li>and I am excited to see what the end result is gonna be.</li>
            <li>I began using ORIGINAL Snail Elicina Cream 2x</li>
            <li>After researching various all natural snail gel/creme products, I found Elicina Snail Creme to be the best price.</li>
            <li>EXCEPT FOR THE BURN, ONCE DAILY IS BEST FOR MY SENSITIVE SKIN.    </li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be more creamy and rich, but it feels much lighter and doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin well.</li>
            <li>but ive used better for a much cheaper price</li>
            <li>For this price point, there are so many better similar products that have additional benefits to the skin as well.</li>
            <li>This has faded my stretch marks tremendously.</li>
            <li>light without too much oil, good for daily skin care</li>
            <li>This product really works BUT make sure you are consistent.</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t want to gamble more money on another, hopefully less smelly jar, I&#x27;ve decided to try out one of South Korea&#x27;s many perfume, colorant, and paraben free snail creams.</li>
            <li>It also has a very smoothing texture and makes your skin feel smooth when you put it on.</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey but worth it in my estimation.  </li>
            <li>Neither did I like the way it absorbed....</li>
            <li>and have far fewer wrinkles than many people in my age group.  </li>
            <li>Is only minimally effective for pitted acne scars, however.</li>
            <li>I promise it&#x27;s worth taking a chance on this stuff.</li>
            <li>I will be buying this for the rest of my life, thank you for the super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice skin softener and helps remove dead skin.</li>
            <li>I did try the plus cream and don&#x27;t like it as much as the original.  </li>
            <li>For keratosis, it is much more gentle than products with high levels of glycolic acid and it seems to help control redness.</li>
            <li>The cream goes right into the skin - not sticky or oily.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I do believe in the effectiveness of snail products in general and have had better luck with Korean products.</li>
            <li>I am so thankful for this magic cream and those magic little snails.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive oily/combination skin (chin, nose, and cheeks are oily, but the rest of my face is dry) with hormonal acne on top of that and the first use of Elicina brought with it a notable softness.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>the first like 3 or 4 weeks I saw no difference.</li>
            <li>This has been staying consistent for two weeks.</li>
            <li>RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO USE MORE THAN TWICE DAILY</li>
            <li>PURCHASE FROM REPUTABLE VENDORS ONLY.  </li>
            <li>But I remembered that another persons review stated that it first broke out her skin</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and absorbs completely into the skin.</li>
            <li>First of all, the cream had spilled out of the jar when I got it.</li>
            <li>One finished jar later, I totally regret the purchase, and feel like I should have known better than to buy into all the hype about snail secretions working their magic on skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought $150 and higher products that do nothing for wrinkles and acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought $150 and higher products that do nothing for wrinkles and acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We have been amazed at how much better her skin has gotten and she has only been using Elicina for about a month.</li>
            <li>/&gt;ME the one time 20 yr old with ACNE filled Skin and scars,</li>
            <li>/&gt;You need to be Consistent and if and when  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be 36 in a couple months and most people guess me to be 10-15 years younger.</li>
            <li>should most definitely try this product out and for 25 USD</li>
            <li>I use it every other day right before i go to sleep, the bad thing is that i move a lot when i fall sleep, and it gets stuck in my pillow, but it doesnt leave any stains or anything, thats a good thing, overall its a good product, i do recommend it,,but it would be awesome if you can get more cream for less money...</li>
            <li>I use a BufPuf and Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Acne Control every day, too.</li>
            <li>You need to wait until you get that first exfoliation after one month, and you see that fresh, new skin.</li>
            <li>You need to wait until you get that first exfoliation after one month, and you see that fresh, new skin.</li>
            <li>Stuff really works first</li>
            <li>I am not sure if this is having any affect on my wrinkles, but I like to use it at night as a good overnight moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This may dry your face out so make sure you put a moisturizer on your face after if you start to notice drying.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the one for acne-prone skin; just the regular version, and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>It does not fix wrinkles, but your face will be so smooth overall, the wrinkles won&#x27;t stand out so much.</li>
            <li>i did not take care of my face much.</li>
            <li>and It really helped raise the skin and started to fade the marks after using the cream after 5 days , by 7 days</li>
            <li>Cons: I really wish this product lasted longer since I used it for about 2 times a day.     </li>
            <li>this is fast absorbency and soaks in Diskin really well.</li>
            <li>Yet constantly have people compliment me on my smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>I tried the whole jar of Ellicina, and I like the softness that it gave my skin.</li>
            <li>, I was being very stubborn thinking one of us will give up eventualy.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>thanks god</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my second jar now, and I&#x27;m enjoy of the benefits of this cream day by day.</li>
            <li>It really helped speed up the healing process for me and started to fade the redness of my scars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this cream for a couple of years and it really works.</li>
            <li>and it does REALLY</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, but not really for me.</li>
            <li>It helps my whole family with any skin issues.  </li>
            <li>This cream worked better than I expected and helped with acne too.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t blend in your skin and it feels really oily,</li>
            <li>, doesn&#x27;t really do much else.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even moisturize very well.</li>
            <li>To other buyers, Elicina does dry your skin out somewhat, but if you have naturally oily skin like me, this is actually a good thing!</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft right now</li>
            <li>/&gt;You need to get it off so it does not clog pores, your NEW baby wrinkle less is revealed , glowing , smooth and zit FREE and wrinkle FREE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now,  I use only all-natural products (except for my Aveeno Positively Radiant lotion-tried and true).  </li>
            <li>Based on the other reviews, I decided to try this snail cream and am soooo glad I did.  </li>
            <li>A TYPE I&#x27;VE HAD BEFORE, SHED AND RE-SHED ITS SURFACE OVER THE COURSE OF A WEEK UNTIL THE SKIN WAS SMOOTH AND FLAT AGAIN</li>
            <li>But I read reviews on other sites and most of them seemed to sing Elicina&#x27;s praises, so I decided to give it a try</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for products but this one was so amazing that I had to share.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face and the first thing I noticed was how soft my skin was.</li>
            <li>I applied Elicina twice daily on clean skin until my jar ran out for a little more than one month.</li>
            <li>The descrpition of the product is somewhat misleading, I thought I was getting a very natural product without any chemical ingredients, but found out this wasn&#x27;t the case, there are actually more than one type of paraben and other toxic ingredients in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, I put this on, blow dry my face for one minute, and then I put a light coat of Maximum Strength Clearasil over it because it&#x27;s a bit greasy for me.</li>
            <li>Also, I put this on, blow dry my face for one minute, and then I put a light coat of Maximum Strength Clearasil over it because it&#x27;s a bit greasy for me.</li>
            <li>and i wanted to try it because it has more content and is less the cost,</li>
            <li>So use this regularly to look better and younger.</li>
            <li>This will not change your skin texture overnight, it will take months, but so easy to put a little on at night after washing face and applying my moisturizer first.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly, highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The snails secrete glycolic acid and collagen naturally, and that is very pricey at any plastic surgeon&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>cream turns clear and smells like absolutely nothing.</li>

            <li>cream turns clear and smells like absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Have only been using for a few days but so far so good.</li>
            <li>; cream really feels like snail slime, but now found that Elicina is no comparison to snail white, though Elicina claimed to have 80% snail discretion, its sliminess is not even close to snail white, and now I really doubt if this is true.  </li>
            <li>I liked the first jar of that a lot, but when I re-ordered, the cream in the second jar seemed to have less of the active ingredient and more moisturizing products, so I wanted to try a different brand.  </li>
            <li>As long as I use it consistently, this product really improves my skin!</li>
            <li>it doesnt do what it says it does- wasted my money ON THIS PRODUCT - LEARNED MY LESSON FOR SURE</li>
            <li>The most significant development has been the disappearance of a red spot on my forehead that I have had for at least one year.  </li>
            <li>I have Dry Skin- it absorbs quickly and no residue for me.</li>
            <li>His face got very sensitive, inflamed, with acne and whatnot</li>
            <li>To my dismay, not all of the ingredients were natural!</li>
            <li>When you first use it you may experience some exfoliation on areas of your skin, but not a big deal.</li>
            <li>My skin got soft and glowy and is not clogged!</li>
            <li>but the Fine lines around eys are Less-</li>
            <li>I have been using this exact brand and product for three years and have had cystic acne my entire life.</li>
            <li>i rub in cream,  top it  off with small amount of  AHA 12% night soufflé cream sold here,</li>
            <li>It did not get rid of my acne, but I noticed that any outbreak would heal up before it could really get started and it reduced a lot of the red pigment from much older outbreaks that just wouldn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li>and I am a very light toned black woman that has been suffering from acne since my teenage years</li>
            <li>I am planning on sending it back, and I hope the company honestly portrays their ingredients, so people who are for using products without harmful artificial preservatives can easily do so.</li>
            <li>I use it to maintain a clear and younger-looking complexion.  </li>
            <li>and THEN it started to clear out her skin.</li>
            <li>it did was make my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this cream because I have breakouts near &#x27;that time of the month&#x27; and my skin gets out of control and oily.  </li>
            <li>then I developed cystic acne</li>
            <li>I also dab it directly on an incoming pimple, which occurs around that time of the month.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 18 year old for acne scars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using almost a month so far</li>
            <li>This product was completely ineffective but since I was swayed by all the glowing reviews I read on amazon, I fell for it.</li>
            <li>I use Elicina for both adult acne and keratosis.</li>
            <li>For adult acne, Elicina doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it keeps my skin clear and minimizes redness.</li>
            <li>For keratosis, be sure to give it at least a month before you pass judgement on its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, especially on my forehead, nose area and chin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>so for international customers is really a pain.</li>
            <li>AT IT, remember we didn&#x27;t get wrinkles or scars over night and cant expect ANY natural treatments to work</li>
            <li>I had been using some very pricey big name brands</li>
            <li>I am 62 years old</li>
            <li>Most people think I am in my late 40&#x27;s-early 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that there was no smell at all, and the second was that although it was thick and creamy, it spread far and absorbed fast.</li>
            <li>acne,,,now after a month is not bad at all, but it seems to take a while to get all the black spots on my skin to dissapear.</li>
            <li>I ordered a second jar a couple days before my first one ran up and that second jar is not odorless.</li>
            <li>My skin is not very sensitive and reacts very well and almost immediately to AHA or Vitamin C products</li>
            <li>So my thought is, if it rids you of the acne and leaves no dark spots to fade then this product is also a preventative cream as well.  </li>
            <li>The first time I purchased this product, I was simply curious as to whether or not it would help control/improve my skin and acne.</li>
            <li>This is important, especially for those who see sagging skin on their cheeks (mine are literally as tight as a drum when you pat them!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product for those with oily skin, since i have semi oily skin not to dry or to oily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just getting over a lovely case of poison ivy and now that it&#x27;s dried up, I&#x27;m applying the cream to the rough patches (face and neck)</li>
            <li>product significantly keeps my skin very firm and wrinkles at bay, and it forces my skin to renew and slough off once a month.</li>
            <li>After countless attempts to achieve clear skin, I still haven&#x27;t found what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>Also it will last me a long time because you dont have to use to much.</li>
            <li>it was starting to fade away the mark completely</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searcing for a cream that would help fade acne scars that developed over the last two years.  </li>
            <li>So far Elicina and Caracol are about equal.</li>
            <li>During her senior year, she developed deep acne on her cheeks and was prescribed accutane by her dermatologist.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whether I smiled or not I had faint lines at eye edges and have been using the SMOOTHIE WRINKLE STRIPS EACH NIGHT FOR 3 MONTHS, I wish I knew of in these in my 20s or 30s  ,but</li>
            <li>Only a small amount is needed and well worth the price!</li>
            <li>At first I noticed that my skin was starting to clear up a little and was definetely softer.</li>
            <li>I am a 22 year old male and have acne scars from my teen years.</li>
            <li>I have been buying this for years and really works on minimizing scars, wrinkles, dark spots and sun damage when used faithfully</li>
            <li>I have been using the Elicina Crema de Caracol for only a few weeks, so it&#x27;s still a bit early to tell how much it&#x27;s helping wrinkles and age spots.  </li>
            <li>I live in Utah and the air is very dry here, so this isn&#x27;t moisturizing like I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>Lastly for topical make up I use Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>I had no new breakouts, my skin was so clear and even and kept improving.</li>
            <li>buy from SKIN Store rx, or google glycolic home peel, rnages from 20% to 50%, start at 20% as i ddi and you will flake off old dead skin and wrinkles and reveal new smoother skin.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> this snail cream is excellent -- it&#x27;s really more of a gel than a cream.  </li>
            <li> It is also really do really good on not us adults but children.</li>
            <li> This also good for my face too.</li>

            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> This product is great if you need a light moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily after use.</li>
            <li> Amazing cream.</li>
            <li> i cant wait to see what happens in six months.i am the kind of guy who usualy doesnt use cream for anything.</li>
            <li> How nice it will be to not have to wear tons of makeup and worry about covering every inch of my face before leaving the house every day.  </li>
            <li> I have to be honest..</li>
            <li> This product is really nice, it doesnt works inmediatly</li>
            <li> I honestly did not notice one bit of a difference on my skin, and would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Elicina flattens the bumps nicely...</li>
            <li> Honestly, I saw no changes in the appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the directions because you can get good results.</li>
            <li> I did not find this product to be effective at all.</li>
            <li> im told i have AMAZING CLEAR FLAWLESS SKIN???  </li>
            <li> Best stuff out there by far!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, I have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> when my perception change completely, I couldn&#x27;t believe this slime of snail is like magic because is sincerely close to perfect, ooh gosh</li>
            <li> Another great thing about it is that it is not difficult to use.</li>
            <li> On his skin more so, clean and spotless it was incredible what the cream did so fast!</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for 2 years now, and my skin is better than ever.  </li>
            <li> On top of that he started shaving and it does not help.</li>
            <li> and he kept saying \\&quot;I am okay mom, guys do not think like that about their skin.</li>
            <li> I try many hand cream and nothing workd.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have noticeable wrinkes and my skin is healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> Those are the Big 3 - best things I buy.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried many things.</li>
            <li> Snail slime is the way to go, and I will be using it until I find something better, which I doubt with be soon.</li>
            <li> RESULTS WERE FASTER AND BETTER WITH THE INCREASED USE.  </li>
            <li> IT APPEARS TO HELP THE SKIN ELIMINATE DAMAGED CELLS MORE RAPIDLY.  </li>
            <li> Glad to see</li>
            <li> it made me get more acne.it can not removal scar.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t want to buy any more</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and my face is getting better and better.</li>
            <li> and I am SO glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not embarrassed of my skin anymore :)     </li>
            <li> I have suffered from problem skin for the majority of my life and this product has helped me the most.</li>
            <li> And no, I am not selling this product, just using it :)</li>
            <li> but I figured since I&#x27;ve tried eveything else including prescriptions from my dermatologist, that I would try one more thing.</li>
            <li> i find that this product should be a lil better for the price and size that it is.</li>
            <li> its an ok cream</li>
            <li> MORE trips for Botox for over 2 yrs</li>
            <li> i love this elicina cream</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how I love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stick with Missha because it&#x27;s got a addicting scent and works better than this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and my skin looks a lot better.</li>
            <li> and I love the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li> But once a a while when I use it, it does give me a glowing effect, makes my skin feels tighter, more lifting and the scars are faded.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any better results and its almost like my play</li>
            <li> Pretty impressive so far.</li>
            <li> )t, smooth and supple skin you get, you will love this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it was unexpected how great it would make my skin look.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, I have mild acne and it always seem to get better when I&#x27;m using this cream, I stop using it for a couple weeks and then started again</li>
            <li> goes easy on the skin, no residue.</li>
            <li> MY UN SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATION IS MORE CONSISTENT SKIN REGENERATION YIELDS MORE RAPIDLY VISIBLE RESULTS</li>
            <li> and i have noticed fine Lines</li>
            <li> Exelent product it works perfect with the acne also work with the scars I haven&#x27;t seen another product that in less time u cann see results ...</li>
            <li> use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTOX works best on new wrinkles forming or medium wrinkles, but  i found a regime that naturally reduced my wrinkles and scars to almost not visible or invisible and to get BOTOX</li>
            <li> and it goes on lightly without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> Cuticura is just like elicina to me - indispensable.  </li>
            <li> The above combination has been great for me.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I hope it&#x27;s always available.</li>
            <li> one of my arms is nearly completely smooth now.</li>
            <li> amazing, soft, smooth and supple skin you get, you will love this product.</li>
            <li> She just kept saying \\&quot;I can&#x27;t believe how fantastic your skin looks.\\</li>
            <li> I am acne free because of Elicina.  </li>
            <li> FANTASTIC stuff.</li>
            <li> BASED ON MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, THE PICTURES ON THE ELICINAUSA WEBSITE FAIRLY REPRESENT THE REULTS MOST PEOPLE CAN EXPECT.  </li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I ALSO USED IT ON A SIGNIFICANT BURN.  </li>
            <li> and I am excited to see what the end result is gonna be.</li>
            <li> I began using ORIGINAL Snail Elicina Cream 2x</li>
            <li> After researching various all natural snail gel/creme products, I found Elicina Snail Creme to be the best price.</li>
            <li> EXCEPT FOR THE BURN, ONCE DAILY IS BEST FOR MY SENSITIVE SKIN.    </li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be more creamy and rich, but it feels much lighter and doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin well.</li>
            <li> but ive used better for a much cheaper price</li>
            <li> For this price point, there are so many better similar products that have additional benefits to the skin as well.</li>
            <li> This has faded my stretch marks tremendously.</li>
            <li> light without too much oil, good for daily skin care</li>
            <li> This product really works BUT make sure you are consistent.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t want to gamble more money on another, hopefully less smelly jar, I&#x27;ve decided to try out one of South Korea&#x27;s many perfume, colorant, and paraben free snail creams.</li>
            <li> It also has a very smoothing texture and makes your skin feel smooth when you put it on.</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey but worth it in my estimation.  </li>
            <li> Neither did I like the way it absorbed....</li>
            <li> and have far fewer wrinkles than many people in my age group.  </li>
            <li> Is only minimally effective for pitted acne scars, however.</li>
            <li> I promise it&#x27;s worth taking a chance on this stuff.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this for the rest of my life, thank you for the super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice skin softener and helps remove dead skin.</li>
            <li> I did try the plus cream and don&#x27;t like it as much as the original.  </li>
            <li> For keratosis, it is much more gentle than products with high levels of glycolic acid and it seems to help control redness.</li>
            <li> The cream goes right into the skin - not sticky or oily.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I do believe in the effectiveness of snail products in general and have had better luck with Korean products.</li>
            <li> I am so thankful for this magic cream and those magic little snails.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive oily/combination skin (chin, nose, and cheeks are oily, but the rest of my face is dry) with hormonal acne on top of that and the first use of Elicina brought with it a notable softness.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li> the first like 3 or 4 weeks I saw no difference.</li>
            <li> This has been staying consistent for two weeks.</li>
            <li> RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO USE MORE THAN TWICE DAILY</li>
            <li> PURCHASE FROM REPUTABLE VENDORS ONLY.  </li>
            <li> But I remembered that another persons review stated that it first broke out her skin</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and absorbs completely into the skin.</li>
            <li> First of all, the cream had spilled out of the jar when I got it.</li>
            <li> One finished jar later, I totally regret the purchase, and feel like I should have known better than to buy into all the hype about snail secretions working their magic on skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought $150 and higher products that do nothing for wrinkles and acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought $150 and higher products that do nothing for wrinkles and acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We have been amazed at how much better her skin has gotten and she has only been using Elicina for about a month.</li>
            <li> /&gt;ME the one time 20 yr old with ACNE filled Skin and scars,</li>
            <li> /&gt;You need to be Consistent and if and when  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be 36 in a couple months and most people guess me to be 10-15 years younger.</li>
            <li> should most definitely try this product out and for 25 USD</li>
            <li> I use it every other day right before i go to sleep, the bad thing is that i move a lot when i fall sleep, and it gets stuck in my pillow, but it doesnt leave any stains or anything, thats a good thing, overall its a good product, i do recommend it,,but it would be awesome if you can get more cream for less money...</li>
            <li> I use a BufPuf and Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Acne Control every day, too.</li>
            <li> You need to wait until you get that first exfoliation after one month, and you see that fresh, new skin.</li>
            <li> You need to wait until you get that first exfoliation after one month, and you see that fresh, new skin.</li>
            <li> Stuff really works first</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is having any affect on my wrinkles, but I like to use it at night as a good overnight moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This may dry your face out so make sure you put a moisturizer on your face after if you start to notice drying.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the one for acne-prone skin; just the regular version, and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> It does not fix wrinkles, but your face will be so smooth overall, the wrinkles won&#x27;t stand out so much.</li>
            <li> i did not take care of my face much.</li>
            <li> and It really helped raise the skin and started to fade the marks after using the cream after 5 days , by 7 days</li>
            <li> Cons: I really wish this product lasted longer since I used it for about 2 times a day.     </li>
            <li> this is fast absorbency and soaks in Diskin really well.</li>
            <li> Yet constantly have people compliment me on my smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> I tried the whole jar of Ellicina, and I like the softness that it gave my skin.</li>
            <li> , I was being very stubborn thinking one of us will give up eventualy.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> thanks god</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my second jar now, and I&#x27;m enjoy of the benefits of this cream day by day.</li>
            <li> It really helped speed up the healing process for me and started to fade the redness of my scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for a couple of years and it really works.</li>
            <li> and it does REALLY</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible, but not really for me.</li>
            <li> It helps my whole family with any skin issues.  </li>
            <li> This cream worked better than I expected and helped with acne too.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t blend in your skin and it feels really oily,</li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t really do much else.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even moisturize very well.</li>
            <li> To other buyers, Elicina does dry your skin out somewhat, but if you have naturally oily skin like me, this is actually a good thing!</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft right now</li>
            <li> /&gt;You need to get it off so it does not clog pores, your NEW baby wrinkle less is revealed , glowing , smooth and zit FREE and wrinkle FREE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now,  I use only all-natural products (except for my Aveeno Positively Radiant lotion-tried and true).  </li>
            <li> Based on the other reviews, I decided to try this snail cream and am soooo glad I did.  </li>
            <li> A TYPE I&#x27;VE HAD BEFORE, SHED AND RE-SHED ITS SURFACE OVER THE COURSE OF A WEEK UNTIL THE SKIN WAS SMOOTH AND FLAT AGAIN</li>
            <li> But I read reviews on other sites and most of them seemed to sing Elicina&#x27;s praises, so I decided to give it a try</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for products but this one was so amazing that I had to share.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and the first thing I noticed was how soft my skin was.</li>
            <li> I applied Elicina twice daily on clean skin until my jar ran out for a little more than one month.</li>
            <li> The descrpition of the product is somewhat misleading, I thought I was getting a very natural product without any chemical ingredients, but found out this wasn&#x27;t the case, there are actually more than one type of paraben and other toxic ingredients in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I put this on, blow dry my face for one minute, and then I put a light coat of Maximum Strength Clearasil over it because it&#x27;s a bit greasy for me.</li>

            <li> and i wanted to try it because it has more content and is less the cost,</li>
            <li> So use this regularly to look better and younger.</li>
            <li> This will not change your skin texture overnight, it will take months, but so easy to put a little on at night after washing face and applying my moisturizer first.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Highly, highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The snails secrete glycolic acid and collagen naturally, and that is very pricey at any plastic surgeon&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> cream turns clear and smells like absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> The snails secrete glycolic acid and collagen naturally, and that is very pricey at any plastic surgeon&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> cream turns clear and smells like absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Have only been using for a few days but so far so good.</li>
            <li> ; cream really feels like snail slime, but now found that Elicina is no comparison to snail white, though Elicina claimed to have 80% snail discretion, its sliminess is not even close to snail white, and now I really doubt if this is true.  </li>
            <li> I liked the first jar of that a lot, but when I re-ordered, the cream in the second jar seemed to have less of the active ingredient and more moisturizing products, so I wanted to try a different brand.  </li>
            <li> As long as I use it consistently, this product really improves my skin!</li>
            <li> it doesnt do what it says it does- wasted my money ON THIS PRODUCT - LEARNED MY LESSON FOR SURE</li>
            <li> The most significant development has been the disappearance of a red spot on my forehead that I have had for at least one year.  </li>
            <li> I have Dry Skin- it absorbs quickly and no residue for me.</li>
            <li> His face got very sensitive, inflamed, with acne and whatnot</li>
            <li> To my dismay, not all of the ingredients were natural!</li>
            <li> When you first use it you may experience some exfoliation on areas of your skin, but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> My skin got soft and glowy and is not clogged!</li>
            <li> but the Fine lines around eys are Less-</li>
            <li> I have been using this exact brand and product for three years and have had cystic acne my entire life.</li>
            <li> i rub in cream,  top it  off with small amount of  AHA 12% night soufflé cream sold here,</li>
            <li> It did not get rid of my acne, but I noticed that any outbreak would heal up before it could really get started and it reduced a lot of the red pigment from much older outbreaks that just wouldn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> and I am a very light toned black woman that has been suffering from acne since my teenage years</li>
            <li> I am planning on sending it back, and I hope the company honestly portrays their ingredients, so people who are for using products without harmful artificial preservatives can easily do so.</li>
            <li> I use it to maintain a clear and younger-looking complexion.  </li>
            <li> and THEN it started to clear out her skin.</li>
            <li> it did was make my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because I have breakouts near &#x27;that time of the month&#x27; and my skin gets out of control and oily.  </li>
            <li> then I developed cystic acne</li>
            <li> I also dab it directly on an incoming pimple, which occurs around that time of the month.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 18 year old for acne scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using almost a month so far</li>
            <li> This product was completely ineffective but since I was swayed by all the glowing reviews I read on amazon, I fell for it.</li>
            <li> I use Elicina for both adult acne and keratosis.</li>
            <li> For adult acne, Elicina doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it keeps my skin clear and minimizes redness.</li>
            <li> For keratosis, be sure to give it at least a month before you pass judgement on its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, especially on my forehead, nose area and chin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> so for international customers is really a pain.</li>
            <li> AT IT, remember we didn&#x27;t get wrinkles or scars over night and cant expect ANY natural treatments to work</li>
            <li> I had been using some very pricey big name brands</li>
            <li> I am 62 years old</li>
            <li> Most people think I am in my late 40&#x27;s-early 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that there was no smell at all, and the second was that although it was thick and creamy, it spread far and absorbed fast.</li>
            <li> acne,,,now after a month is not bad at all, but it seems to take a while to get all the black spots on my skin to dissapear.</li>
            <li> I ordered a second jar a couple days before my first one ran up and that second jar is not odorless.</li>
            <li> My skin is not very sensitive and reacts very well and almost immediately to AHA or Vitamin C products</li>
            <li> So my thought is, if it rids you of the acne and leaves no dark spots to fade then this product is also a preventative cream as well.  </li>
            <li> The first time I purchased this product, I was simply curious as to whether or not it would help control/improve my skin and acne.</li>
            <li> This is important, especially for those who see sagging skin on their cheeks (mine are literally as tight as a drum when you pat them!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product for those with oily skin, since i have semi oily skin not to dry or to oily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting over a lovely case of poison ivy and now that it&#x27;s dried up, I&#x27;m applying the cream to the rough patches (face and neck)</li>
            <li> product significantly keeps my skin very firm and wrinkles at bay, and it forces my skin to renew and slough off once a month.</li>
            <li> After countless attempts to achieve clear skin, I still haven&#x27;t found what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> Also it will last me a long time because you dont have to use to much.</li>
            <li> it was starting to fade away the mark completely</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searcing for a cream that would help fade acne scars that developed over the last two years.  </li>
            <li> So far Elicina and Caracol are about equal.</li>
            <li> During her senior year, she developed deep acne on her cheeks and was prescribed accutane by her dermatologist.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whether I smiled or not I had faint lines at eye edges and have been using the SMOOTHIE WRINKLE STRIPS EACH NIGHT FOR 3 MONTHS, I wish I knew of in these in my 20s or 30s  ,but</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed and well worth the price!</li>
            <li> At first I noticed that my skin was starting to clear up a little and was definetely softer.</li>
            <li> I am a 22 year old male and have acne scars from my teen years.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for years and really works on minimizing scars, wrinkles, dark spots and sun damage when used faithfully</li>
            <li> I have been using the Elicina Crema de Caracol for only a few weeks, so it&#x27;s still a bit early to tell how much it&#x27;s helping wrinkles and age spots.  </li>
            <li> I live in Utah and the air is very dry here, so this isn&#x27;t moisturizing like I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> Lastly for topical make up I use Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> I had no new breakouts, my skin was so clear and even and kept improving.</li>
            <li> buy from SKIN Store rx, or google glycolic home peel, rnages from 20% to 50%, start at 20% as i ddi and you will flake off old dead skin and wrinkles and reveal new smoother skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;About every 28 days, your skin will get tight and develop a layer of skin and you will look a bit older, because that skin needs to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> If you put it on when you took all that skin off, your face will burn some and start to build up again, so use a little less when you have fresh, renewed skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks straight and the difference is very little.</li>
            <li> Completely eliminated a dark \\&quot;age spot\\&quot; on my face within two weeks+/-.  </li>
            <li> I also use Retin a 0.1% cream and thick face lotion at bedtime with Elicina, so Retin a is helping my acne too, but once that Elicina kicked in it took my skin to another level of pretty.</li>
            <li> use Derma new home microbrasion cream or the neutrogena kits to slough off DEAD SKIN .&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get those products naturally here, for thousands less over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get those products naturally here, for thousands less over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> use and belevie in ARGAN pure oil and use it after each peel adn skin sucks it</li>
            <li> If you exfoliate too hard, as I do sometimes, your skin will be very tender.</li>
            <li> It left a white film which was hard to rub in completely.</li>
            <li> PAST BURNS HAVE TAKEN OVER A MONTH TO BEGIN RETURNING TO NORMAL COLOR.   </li>
            <li> You have to use any moisturizer with this, because it&#x27;s could exfoliate your skin, it doesn&#x27;t matter what type of skin do you have even if it is too oily at long term</li>
            <li> As another reviewer commented, it does stay white on the skin for a bit longer than expected.  </li>
            <li> I like this product, not heavy and doesnt have a heavy smell to it.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin fresher and small wrinkles are gone and new wrinkles do not appear.</li>
            <li> Then after 3-4 days it started bothering me as my face felt very dry and like stretched to such an extreme</li>
            <li> But I put this cream on my dry hand and this saved my hand.  </li>
            <li> A RESULT UNDER MY EYES BECAME DRY AND PAPER LIKE</li>
            <li> and you start to get dry skin, in 3 days</li>
            <li> wait till dry, then apply</li>
            <li> I have had a vertical line between my eyebrows for the past few years that was getting worse and is now completely gone  as well as the fine lines below the corners of my mouth extending to my jaw.</li>
            <li> This cream keeps my cystic acne at bay when I use it every single day.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over half year and it really can remove my acne marks and some of the small acne scar.</li>
            <li> It has a strange chemical/slightly tea tree smell to it and the one time I used it before I noticed the smell, it left my skin feeling dry and tight.</li>
            <li> and when the acne subsides, I am usually left with dark spots.</li>
            <li> The acne is clearing, the dark red spots are getting lighter, and the skin has a visible smoothness.</li>
            <li> Plus they don&#x27;t have insurance in case the product is not delivered so you basically can ended up to loose money.</li>
            <li> In just under one week my red scars are much less noticeable and</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this hoping that his would replace my usual Asian brand snail cream since this one is relatively cheaper and ships faster.</li>
            <li> However, during these 2 weeks, she was outside a lot and had a slight tan, even using sunscreen.</li>
            <li> at mid 40s, NO ONE  believes  my age and guesses me at 10-15 yrs  less</li>
            <li> I am 48 and trying to stay away from botox and other forms of surgery as long as I can.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over 2 weeks on my stretch marks that are on my inner thighs and the tops of my thighs.</li>
            <li> I had a few pimples starting and it took care of those almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> For facial soap, I use Cuticura (drugstore.com; a few dollars per bar).  </li>
            <li> Buy a gift for my mother, but she spent a week to say to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money without results but</li>
            <li> You know when it starts to get harder</li>
            <li> careful about using it close to the under eye area, as it might burn a bit and will turn harder and slough off as well.</li>
            <li> i had trouble with my skin and break  outs since teen yrs found this on EBAY in 2000 used it 2x day</li>
            <li> once a week then after bottle empty go to 30% then</li>
            <li> I don’t use it everyday since its not moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li> I heard about Elicina through the grapevine, and honestly, I was doubtful.</li>
            <li> What I noticed first was that it eliminated the dry flakey patches I had been experiencing the last couple of years during the cold weather months.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way)</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Also a little bit goes a LONG way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> THAN I&#x27;VE SEEN FROM OTHER FADE/ REPAIR PRODUCTS.  </li>
            <li> You only need to use a small amount each time.  </li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s the other way around.</li>
            <li> It helps to dramatically reduce scarring from burns, and other types of injuries to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I was also diagnosed with PCOS which makes my acne even worse than normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if Amazon has a different policy</li>
            <li> She has suffered with acne for years and the only thing that helped in the past was antibiotics.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s about half empty, so</li>
            <li> In conjuction with Elicina, I use 2 other products that I depend on and that have not let me down.  </li>
            <li> it DOES IS  LIFTS the SCAR or Wrinkle UP,  from being de-pressed down in to the skin and brings it up  to surface matching your other skin that is not scarred or wrinkled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She suffered through her worst acne ever for the next 4 months as numerous pimples under the skin came to the surface with huge whiteheads.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for acne, wrinkles (crows feet) or dark spots/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth $25.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I started noticing changes on my skin the first week, then my skin got dried and peeling(I&#x27;m not sure if thats bad) but new skin started to show up.....</li>
            <li> that much I&#x27;ve definitely learned in the past!  </li>
            <li> Previously I had used Caracol brand Cream.  </li>
            <li> Accordingly, I searched long and hard for a product void of parabens.</li>
            <li> I have tried Ambi, Esoterica, Palmers, Black&amp;White, Black Opal, Clinique and a few others but the spots would slightly fade in six weeks.</li>
            <li> Thank you little</li>
            <li> I like this stuff I still need to use it a little longer.</li>
            <li> I use it on my neck and chest as well, and my sister (sorry, sis!) has a really wrinkled neck (she is 48)!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put it that close often, but once in a while I put a little bit there to exfoliate it</li>
            <li> hmmm, a little oily to me</li>
            <li> AND it has faded the dark spots on my face!</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> it surprised me the price....too expensive.</li>
            <li> I know that it didn&#x27;t work for a few people - not everything works for everyone -</li>
            <li> If you are looking to help problem skin, I wouldn&#x27;t waste the $$.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was a waste of money &amp; would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and my skin is firm</li>
            <li> But your skin will become smoother after a few months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I might get a pimple once every few months</li>
            <li> I might get a pimple once every few months</li>
            <li> FIRM  </li>
            <li> and i use it everyday, it truly does what it says too, it definitaly has reduced my acne scars and also prevents them from occurring.</li>
            <li> i had pretty bad</li>
            <li> wrote this to help those with unrealistic expectations and for those who have patience and have spent a fortune like me who will know that in 6 months, you will look at least 5 years younger!</li>

            <li> I was desperate to try anything, yet hesitant at the same time as I have extremely sensitive skin that will break out even worse depending on what I use.  </li>
            <li> I live in a dorm and my skin was so bad that I used to have to put make up on before walking down the hall to the bathroom to avoid embarrassment.</li>
            <li> I am one of the many acne sufferer&#x27;s looking for relief from this horrible disease.</li>
            <li> I use elicina without fail at night before bed, and occasionally in the morning.</li>
            <li> it did nothing or a small Spot on my face-</li>
            <li> If one uses small amounts and anticipates that it will take a couple of minutes to work into the skin, this is not a problem.  </li>
            <li> I went through my usual routine of washing my face with castile soap then applied my aloe vera juice as a toner and then used the Elicina cream  </li>
            <li> use it every day and one small container lasts over a year.</li>
            <li> I just received this cream this past week</li>
            <li> Not really sure about this product ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy for a moisturizer</li>
            <li> /&gt;BECAUSE my wrinkles have diminished to the point that i don&#x27;t hardly have any so it will be to use it preventively to ward off muscles re creating what i just worked on removing naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> at least close to it.  </li>
            <li> at least it helped some others.</li>
            <li> at least I know I am getting the snail discretion that I paid</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for at least 15 yrs.</li>
            <li> I recommend that everyone suffering from these skin problems at least give Elicina a try.</li>
            <li> The thought of snail extract on my skin was kinda icky</li>
            <li> acne continued as a late bloomer and</li>
            <li> Scars slowly fading away.</li>
            <li> so I was very sad to see the utter lack of any effect from this product.</li>
            <li> Overall, I feel like it isn&#x27;t a bad product, but if you want to buy it for moisture, then buy something else.</li>
            <li> It was frustrating to say the least</li>
            <li> YOU&#x27;VE GOT SKIN AS TOUGH AS LEATHER.  </li>
            <li> anything used to treat acne just makes it worse for me.  </li>
            <li> His skin was getting worse by day.</li>
            <li> I thought it was making my scars worse</li>
            <li> For me the worst part is the high shipping charges.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not good !</li>
            <li> After a bad bruise, or a cut scabs over, apply a little over the area and the healing quickens.</li>
            <li> I used to have really bad skin until I cleared it with Accutane a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I am 20 years old and have been plagued with horrible acne since I was 14.</li>
            <li> Those who expect a dramatic result in 1 day or 1 week are unrealistic.</li>
            <li> Those who expect a dramatic result in 1 day or 1 week are unrealistic.</li>
            <li> so it was really annoying to find the mess that was inside.</li>

            <li> After use for three week and twice a day. It doesn&#x27;t work for my scar at my chest. This product is useless.</li>
            <li> I have been using elcina for about a week now and it works wonders. I am a 22 year old male and have acne scars from my teen years. i also had a big wrinkle on my forhead. well in a week it got rid of my wrinkle and my acne scars are fading away. i cant wait to see what happens in six months.i am the kind of guy who usualy doesnt use cream for anything. the only thing i ever used cream for was in my teen years to get ride of my pimples. i did not take care of my face much. i was hesitant about trying this cream sinnce it is made out of snail extract . but i tried it because i wanted to have my face cleared like i did before i had acne. i hope this works all the way. i will keep posted in six months</li>
            <li> After researching various all natural snail gel/creme products, I found Elicina Snail Creme to be the best price. To my dismay, not all of the ingredients were natural! This product contains TWO PARABENS, listed in the ingredients, only on the box-not on the website. Accordingly, I searched long and hard for a product void of parabens. I am planning on sending it back, and I hope the company honestly portrays their ingredients, so people who are for using products without harmful artificial preservatives can easily do so. If you do not mind such unnatural chemicals on your body, this would probably be a beneficial product for you.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for acne, wrinkles (crows feet) or dark spots/scars.&lt;br /&gt;All it did was make my skin soft. It&#x27;s not worth $25.</li>
            <li> I am one of the many acne sufferer&#x27;s looking for relief from this horrible disease. I just knew this would be it. After countless attempts to achieve clear skin, I still haven&#x27;t found what I&#x27;m looking for. This did not work at all, not even on the scars that I have. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Pros:    This product is really great I had some Acne post marks (scars) and It really helped raise the skin and started to fade the marks after using the cream after 5 days , by 7 days it was starting to fade away the mark completely I really recommend this product for those with oily skin, since i have semi oily skin not to dry or to oily so it worked great for me !    Cons: I really wish this product lasted longer since I used it for about 2 times a day.     after 2 weeks it was almost all gone &#x3D;(     I recommend going to their website and buying the tubes instead of the jars they will last longer buy 2 if you like the product after trying it out.</li>
            <li> I love this this is fast absorbency and soaks in Diskin really well. It is also really do really good on not us adults but children. My daughter had a horrible scar on her chin within two months of using this this car was gone.</li>
            <li> I started noticing changes on my skin the first week, then my skin got dried and peeling(I&#x27;m not sure if thats bad) but new skin started to show up.....i had pretty bad acne,,,now after a month is not bad at all, but it seems to take a while to get all the black spots on my skin to dissapear. I use it every other day right before i go to sleep, the bad thing is that i move a lot when i fall sleep, and it gets stuck in my pillow, but it doesnt leave any stains or anything, thats a good thing, overall its a good product, i do recommend it,,but it would be awesome if you can get more cream for less money...it surprised me the price....too expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searcing for a cream that would help fade acne scars that developed over the last two years.  I was desperate to try anything, yet hesitant at the same time as I have extremely sensitive skin that will break out even worse depending on what I use.  Based on the other reviews, I decided to try this snail cream and am soooo glad I did.  I know that it didn&#x27;t work for a few people - not everything works for everyone - that much I&#x27;ve definitely learned in the past!  Thank goodness it worked for me.  In just under one week my red scars are much less noticeable and the best part... I didn&#x27;t break out!  (I even react to salicylic acid.)  I had a few pimples starting and it took care of those almost immediately.  There&#x27;s no odor and it goes on lightly without feeling greasy.  (I even react to salicylic acid!)  I can&#x27;t wait for my skin to go back to the way it used to be... or at least close to it.  How nice it will be to not have to wear tons of makeup and worry about covering every inch of my face before leaving the house every day.  Going swimming this summer will actually be something to look forward to.  Thank you little snails!...just an update - I&#x27;ve been using the cream for about 8 months now and still love it!  I did try the plus cream and don&#x27;t like it as much as the original.  Best stuff out there by far!</li>
            <li> I go back to this product time and time again.  I hesitate to say \\&quot;miracle cream\\&quot; but it&#x27;s as close to that as I&#x27;ve ever found.  I&#x27;m 50 and have rosacea.  Yet constantly have people compliment me on my smooth skin.  This will not change your skin texture overnight, it will take months, but so easy to put a little on at night after washing face and applying my moisturizer first.  When you first use it you may experience some exfoliation on areas of your skin, but not a big deal. It does not fix wrinkles, but your face will be so smooth overall, the wrinkles won&#x27;t stand out so much. I&#x27;ve been using for 2 years now, and my skin is better than ever.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest..the first like 3 or 4 weeks I saw no difference. But then all of a sudden every time I woke up in the morning I had no new breakouts, my skin was so clear and even and kept improving. This has been staying consistent for two weeks. I also use Retin a 0.1% cream and thick face lotion at bedtime with Elicina, so Retin a is helping my acne too, but once that Elicina kicked in it took my skin to another level of pretty.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because I have breakouts near &#x27;that time of the month&#x27; and my skin gets out of control and oily.  I used to have really bad skin until I cleared it with Accutane a few years ago.  Now,  I use only all-natural products (except for my Aveeno Positively Radiant lotion-tried and true).  I also stay away from anything with salycilic acid or benzoyl peroxide-anything used to treat acne just makes it worse for me.  I tried the whole jar of Ellicina, and I like the softness that it gave my skin. However, it did not help the breakouts or the oiliness of my skin.  If you are looking to help problem skin, I wouldn&#x27;t waste the $$.  My sister tried it and wasn&#x27;t overjoyed either.</li>
            <li> Hi! I am 46 and have a son of 15 years of age. His skin was getting worse by day. He is unfortunate to inherit my skin type (prone to spotting) with his additional dose of testosterones. On top of that he started shaving and it does not help. His face got very sensitive, inflamed, with acne and whatnot and he kept saying \\&quot;I am okay mom, guys do not think like that about their skin. I do not care.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out about Elicina by chance and have ordered 2 - one for my son and one for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only days (3-4) you could see the difference! On his skin more so, clean and spotless it was incredible what the cream did so fast! It is a month now since we both started using it and he might forget to brush his teeth but DOES NOT forget the cream :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me - at the start it felt like nothing. Then after 3-4 days it started bothering me as my face felt very dry and like stretched to such an extreme I waited for it to crack open. But I endured and kept using it daily, I was being very stubborn thinking one of us will give up eventualy. After about 3 weeks my skin started producing I do not know what - oil? or liquid of sorts? and I do not care what as it feels good! My skin got soft and glowy and is not clogged! It feels like it is feeding itself from inside and cleaning itself too - sounds creepy I know but I am elated with how it feels and looks now, at this point in time when I thought nothing short of surgery could help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion - very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I have used this about 3 or 4 times now and I&#x27;m just amazed I have suffered of severe acne since I was 12 then I developed cystic acne, my skin hasn&#x27;t felt this soothed or painless in more then 2 decades!!!! I will be buying this for the rest of my life, thank you for the super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I try many hand cream and nothing workd.  But I put this cream on my dry hand and this saved my hand.  This also good for my face too.</li>
            <li> For those of you who think the process of making this product is harmless to the snails - the secretion is extracted from the snails by mechanically stressing them repeatedly throughout their lifetime.</li>
            <li> I have been using Elicina for almost 10 years now.  I use it to maintain a clear and younger-looking complexion.  I had acne prone skin all my life, but the problem disappeared long-term when I started using Elicina. I am 47 now, and I am often told I don&#x27;t look my age.  I don&#x27;t have noticeable wrinkes and my skin is healthy looking.  I use elicina without fail at night before bed, and occasionally in the morning. I also dab it directly on an incoming pimple, which occurs around that time of the month. In conjuction with Elicina, I use 2 other products that I depend on and that have not let me down.  I use Cerave as a moisturizer in the morning, under make up.  For facial soap, I use Cuticura (drugstore.com; a few dollars per bar).  Cuticura is just like elicina to me - indispensable.  I don&#x27;t use the one for acne-prone skin; just the regular version, and it works just fine.  I use Cuticura all over my body as well.  Those are the Big 3 - best things I buy.  And I&#x27;ve tried many things. Lastly for topical make up I use Bare Minerals. The above combination has been great for me.  I hope this helps.      [...]</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  Completely eliminated a dark \\&quot;age spot\\&quot; on my face within two weeks+/-.  I&#x27;m just getting over a lovely case of poison ivy and now that it&#x27;s dried up, I&#x27;m applying the cream to the rough patches (face and neck) and I see daily improvement.  It is a bit pricey but worth it in my estimation.  For me the worst part is the high shipping charges.</li>
            <li> Elicina is a miracle 👍</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple of days, but let me tell you... I SEE AND FEEL A DIFFERENCE AND I AM SO HAPPY!!! Snail slime is the way to go, and I will be using it until I find something better, which I doubt with be soon. My mom loves it too! I have already ordered my second jar &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> ELICINA WORKS AS DESCRIBED IN SPITE OF MY INCONSISTENCY IN APPLYING IT.  I BOUGHT THE PRODUCT FROM ELICINA USA TO ADDRESS MELASMA,DARK SPOTS,AND SCARRING.  I ALSO USED IT ON A SIGNIFICANT BURN.  I SAW RESULTS WITHIN A WEEK TO TEN DAYS FOR EACH SKIN CONDITION EVEN WHEN I DID NOT USE IT DAILY.    WITH THE BURN, I SPOT TREATED THREE TO FOUR TIMES DAILY.  RESULTS WERE FASTER AND BETTER WITH THE INCREASED USE.  THE BURN, A TYPE I&#x27;VE HAD BEFORE, SHED AND RE-SHED ITS SURFACE OVER THE COURSE OF A WEEK UNTIL THE SKIN WAS SMOOTH AND FLAT AGAIN (IT ALSO EASED THE PAIN).  WITHIN TEN DAYS THE PIGMENT STARTED TO RETURN ALTHOUGH I RAN OUT OF THE PRODUCT AFTER SEVEN DAYS.  PAST BURNS HAVE TAKEN OVER A MONTH TO BEGIN RETURNING TO NORMAL COLOR.   THIS IS NOT A \\&quot;MIRACLE\\&quot; CREAM.  IT APPEARS TO HELP THE SKIN ELIMINATE DAMAGED CELLS MORE RAPIDLY.  MY UN SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATION IS MORE CONSISTENT SKIN REGENERATION YIELDS MORE RAPIDLY VISIBLE RESULTS THAN I&#x27;VE SEEN FROM OTHER FADE/ REPAIR PRODUCTS.  BASED ON MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, THE PICTURES ON THE ELICINAUSA WEBSITE FAIRLY REPRESENT THE REULTS MOST PEOPLE CAN EXPECT.  WARNING: RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO USE MORE THAN TWICE DAILY UNLESS YOU&#x27;VE GOT SKIN AS TOUGH AS LEATHER.  THE ELICINA USA (ELICINAUSA.COM) WEBSITE WARNS ABOUT OVER USE AND SUGGESTS YOU FOLLOW EACH USE WITH A MOISTURIZER FOR YOUR SKIN TYPE.  I WENT FROM UNDER USE TO OVER USE TO TREAT MELASMA.  AS A RESULT UNDER MY EYES BECAME DRY AND PAPER LIKE UNTIL I REDUCED THE FREQUENCY OF USE TO ONCE DAILY.  EXCEPT FOR THE BURN, ONCE DAILY IS BEST FOR MY SENSITIVE SKIN.    ONE LAST NOTE: THERE ARE FAKES USING THE ELICINA BRAND THAT HAVE NO RELATIONSHIP WITH ELICINA COSMETICS LTD (ELICINA.COM).  PURCHASE FROM REPUTABLE VENDORS ONLY.

            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my skin in any way - waste of money as I used the whole jar just to see if it would work. Glad to see at least it helped some others.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not good !it&#x27;s  useless!!! it made me get more acne.it can not removal scar. i don&#x27;t like it. i don&#x27;t want to buy any more</li>
            <li> I have only been using this creme for about 3 weeks.  The most significant development has been the disappearance of a red spot on my forehead that I have had for at least one year.  Pretty impressive so far.</li>
            <li> I used this cream for several weeks &amp; did not notice any difference or improvement in my skin.  Neither did I like the way it absorbed.... It left a white film which was hard to rub in completely. It did not soften my skin whatsoever. I thought it was a waste of money &amp; would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month and i have noticed fine Lines Fading.  it did nothing or a small Spot on my face- dare i say it? An AGE SPOT!! ??  i wish it would have worked for that.  but the Fine lines around eys are Less- so for that I gave 4 stars!  I have Dry Skin- it absorbs quickly and no residue for me. i then use a moisturerizer also after i Apply this.  I dont feel it is Oily at all.  i would reccomend it</li>
            <li> Great product. Have only been using for a few days but so far so good. I ll rate it as a 5  star for now</li>
            <li> This product is really nice, it doesnt works inmediatly but after a week using it every day you can see it does its work. I just use it in the morning and I dont regret.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, I have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> At first I noticed that my skin was starting to clear up a little and was definetely softer. But I remembered that another persons review stated that it first broke out her skin and THEN it started to clear out her skin. Which after using for a couple of days my skin started breaking out too!:( Then I just stopped using it because it one pimple after another.</li>
            <li> This product is great if you need a light moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily after use. It goes on smooth and absorbs completely into the skin. You only need to use a small amount each time.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Works for sunburns and helps to cleanse. Love this product, it&#x27;s worth the price. Thanks a lot. Z z z</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for years and really works on minimizing scars, wrinkles, dark spots and sun damage when used faithfully</li>
            <li> I love this cream, I have mild acne and it always seem to get better when I&#x27;m using this cream, I stop using it for a couple weeks and then started again and I could see the difference.</li>
            <li> Stuff really works first I thought it was making my scars worse but after a while they started filling in the pot marks</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over half year and it really can remove my acne marks and some of the small acne scar. I use it twice a day and my face is getting better and better. I am glad that I found this cream!</li>
            <li> I like this stuff I still need to use it a little longer. It does lock in the moisture so your skin stays hydrated</li>
            <li> I live in Utah and the air is very dry here, so this isn&#x27;t moisturizing like I hoped it would be. I was hoping it would be more creamy and rich, but it feels much lighter and doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin well. That being said, I think this is a great lotion to use in place of a primer since it feels like it covers pores and gives a nice even skin texture. Plus it isn&#x27;t greasy, and I think it has been helping with blemishes. Overall, I feel like it isn&#x27;t a bad product, but if you want to buy it for moisture, then buy something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every day for months and my age spots are still there. My skin isn&#x27;t any clearer than when I started. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my item thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks straight and the difference is very little.</li>
            <li> Took a 1week to received.</li>
            <li> Buy a gift for my mother, but she spent a week to say to me. Nothing worked. Well, I listen to her. Perhaps it is differ from man to man.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed with this product for 2 reasons. 1) I have been using &amp;#34;Snail White&amp;#34; (made in Thailand), the consistency of this &amp;#34;Snail White&amp;#34; cream really feels like snail slime, but now found that Elicina is no comparison to snail white, though Elicina claimed to have 80% snail discretion, its sliminess is not even close to snail white, and now I really doubt if this is true.  2) The descrpition of the product is somewhat misleading, I thought I was getting a very natural product without any chemical ingredients, but found out this wasn&#x27;t the case, there are actually more than one type of paraben and other toxic ingredients in it.&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I stopped using snail white is because I don&#x27;t know all the ingredients used in this product because I don&#x27;t read Thai. After trying Elcina, I would probably switch back to snail white, at least I know I am getting the snail discretion that I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely disappointed with this product, and even feeling reluctant to use it. I will definitely not recommend this product to anyone else. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this hoping that his would replace my usual Asian brand snail cream since this one is relatively cheaper and ships faster. I totally regret this decision after receiving the product. First of all, the cream had spilled out of the jar when I got it. The seal on the box packaging was intact so I don&#x27;t think it was tampered so it was really annoying to find the mess that was inside. They claim that it contains 80% snail mucin and 20% cream but I think it&#x27;s the other way around. The product is not at all mucus-like as it should be if it does contain 80% mucin. It also contains Methylparaben, Popylparaben &amp; Sodium laurisulphate. So yeah, I&#x27;ll be just sticking to Asian made snail creams.</li>
            <li> Didnt do the trick as i have acne scars, but may work well as anti-aging cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed with Elicina Snail Cream. The truth is that I&#x27;ve used it without any hopes, because before I&#x27;ve tested a lot of different brands, but when all begins was the lasts weeks when my perception change completely, I couldn&#x27;t believe this slime of snail is like magic because is sincerely close to perfect, ooh gosh my pores, my acne scars, are almost fade at all, it seems like it throw back the time when I was without acne.  I was fighting with acne 10 entire years of my life. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money without results but thanks god I find the cure at last. My advice is to prove this, you won&#x27;t regret. I&#x27;m in my second jar now, and I&#x27;m enjoy of the benefits of this cream day by day. You have to use any moisturizer with this, because it&#x27;s could exfoliate your skin, it doesn&#x27;t matter what type of skin do you have even if it is too oily at long term it will be dryer, so I recommend you to moisturize before or after with a lightweight face lotion.

            <li> I am not sure if this is having any affect on my wrinkles, but I like to use it at night as a good overnight moisturizer. I&#x27;m still weirded out by putting snail slime on my face but I will use whatever for the sake of beauty.</li>
            <li> Amazing cream. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I have been using the Elicina Crema de Caracol for only a few weeks, so it&#x27;s still a bit early to tell how much it&#x27;s helping wrinkles and age spots.  As another reviewer commented, it does stay white on the skin for a bit longer than expected.  If one uses small amounts and anticipates that it will take a couple of minutes to work into the skin, this is not a problem.  It was shipped promptly and arrived in good condition.    Previously I had used Caracol brand Cream.  I liked the first jar of that a lot, but when I re-ordered, the cream in the second jar seemed to have less of the active ingredient and more moisturizing products, so I wanted to try a different brand.  So far Elicina and Caracol are about equal.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 18 year old for acne scars. During her senior year, she developed deep acne on her cheeks and was prescribed accutane by her dermatologist. She suffered through her worst acne ever for the next 4 months as numerous pimples under the skin came to the surface with huge whiteheads. By June of this year, she no longer had pimples, but she was left with several red scars from the breakouts. I looked everywhere to find something to reduce the redness of the scars. I knew time would eventually heal them, but I was hoping there was something that would speed up the recovery. This looked like it may work, based on the reviews and the video of its effectiveness. After 2 weeks, the redness did not seem as noticeable. However, during these 2 weeks, she was outside a lot and had a slight tan, even using sunscreen. Now, 2 months later, her tan has faded and the scars are just as red as ever, despite using the snail cream as directed every day for 2 1/2 months.   Considering these were fairly recent scars, I was hoping the cream would work. It did not.</li>
            <li> Bought this cream to use for acne and acne scarring. It really helped speed up the healing process for me and started to fade the redness of my scars. It&#x27;s also improved the overall texture of my skin. It&#x27;s no miracle product, but it does turn over skin cells quicker. I&#x27;ve been using almost a month so far and I plan to purchase again. I&#x27;ve had moderate acne for about six years and the prescription creams don&#x27;t work well with my skin. I use an acne scrub once a day and toner and elicinia cream twice a day. As long as I use it consistently, this product really improves my skin!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for at least 15 yrs. and have far fewer wrinkles than many people in my age group.  This also does a great job in helping to heal burns (although would not put on an open wound).  It helps to dramatically reduce scarring from burns, and other types of injuries to the skin.  Is only minimally effective for pitted acne scars, however.</li>
            <li> this snail cream is excellent -- it&#x27;s really more of a gel than a cream.  Not greasy at all.  I hope it&#x27;s always available.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results and it&#x27;s been 2 weeks I&#x27;ve applied it night and day</li>
            <li> I am 20 years old and have been plagued with horrible acne since I was 14. I was also diagnosed with PCOS which makes my acne even worse than normal. I&#x27;ve tried Clearasil, Neutrogina, Proactiv, birth control and even homemade treatments and NOTHING worked. I heard about Elicina through the grapevine, and honestly, I was doubtful. But I read reviews on other sites and most of them seemed to sing Elicina&#x27;s praises, so I decided to give it a try and I am SO glad that I did. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and my skin is the best it&#x27;s looked in years. My acne is dramatically reduced (and getting better every day) and my acne scars are disappearing too! I live in a dorm and my skin was so bad that I used to have to put make up on before walking down the hall to the bathroom to avoid embarrassment. Now I don&#x27;t have to do that!!! I&#x27;m not embarrassed of my skin anymore :)     To other buyers, Elicina does dry your skin out somewhat, but if you have naturally oily skin like me, this is actually a good thing! It also has a very smoothing texture and makes your skin feel smooth when you put it on. Another great thing about it is that it is not difficult to use. With proactiv, it requires 3-4 steps every morning and night, and with Elicina, you just rub it into your face twice a day after washing.     Also, I&#x27;ve had my jar for a month and it&#x27;s about half empty, so I think it should last about 2 months.     Highly, highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Have been using for one month and see a smoother skin.</li>
            <li> This product was completely ineffective but since I was swayed by all the glowing reviews I read on amazon, I fell for it. One finished jar later, I totally regret the purchase, and feel like I should have known better than to buy into all the hype about snail secretions working their magic on skin. I honestly did not notice one bit of a difference on my skin, and would not recommend this product to anyone. It&#x27;s all hype and there are no studies to back this claim.</li>
            <li> Good Product! goes easy on the skin, no residue. It soften the appearance of the scar.</li>
            <li> I use Elicina for both adult acne and keratosis. I have suffered from problem skin for the majority of my life and this product has helped me the most. For keratosis, it is much more gentle than products with high levels of glycolic acid and it seems to help control redness. I used to use Glytone retexturizing body lotion and it made my skin really red and itchy. Elicina flattens the bumps nicely...one of my arms is nearly completely smooth now. For adult acne, Elicina doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it keeps my skin clear and minimizes redness. I recommend that everyone suffering from these skin problems at least give Elicina a try. For keratosis, be sure to give it at least a month before you pass judgement on its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I have been using this exact brand and product for three years and have had cystic acne my entire life. I have been on Accutane four times before it was banned as well. This cream keeps my cystic acne at bay when I use it every single day. I am now 47 and my skin is firm and I do not have a lot of wrinkles because of this cream. I have very oily skin, especially on my forehead, nose area and chin. I use it on my neck and chest as well, and my sister (sorry, sis!) has a really wrinkled neck (she is 48)! I have none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does NOT get rid of hyperpigmentation! This product will NOT get rid of pitted scars, either. But your skin will become smoother after a few months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About every 28 days, your skin will get tight and develop a layer of skin and you will look a bit older, because that skin needs to exfoliate. You know when it starts to get harder and you start to get dry skin, in 3 days, it will begin to come off. I use a BufPuf and Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Acne Control every day, too. When that skin comes off, your skin is softer than a baby&#x27;s bottom and you look 5-10 years younger. If you exfoliate too hard, as I do sometimes, your skin will be very tender. If you put it on when you took all that skin off, your face will burn some and start to build up again, so use a little less when you have fresh, renewed skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product significantly keeps my skin very firm and wrinkles at bay, and it forces my skin to renew and slough off once a month. This is important, especially for those who see sagging skin on their cheeks (mine are literally as tight as a drum when you pat them!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful about using it close to the under eye area, as it might burn a bit and will turn harder and slough off as well. I don&#x27;t put it that close often, but once in a while I put a little bit there to exfoliate it (but I shouldn&#x27;t) and it helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who don&#x27;t mind the build up of skin 3 days a month and amazing, soft, smooth and supple skin you get, you will love this product. Use it every day for 30 days, without fail before you make any decisions. You need to wait until you get that first exfoliation after one month, and you see that fresh, new skin. It&#x27;s just like having a mini-acid peel every month, but a lite version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for 3 years and hope they don&#x27;t ever stop making it, because there is literally nothing like it on the market over the counter or through a prescription. But give it time. Those who expect a dramatic result in 1 day or 1 week are unrealistic. The snails secrete glycolic acid and collagen naturally, and that is very pricey at any plastic surgeon&#x27;s office. You get those products naturally here, for thousands less over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream turns clear and smells like absolutely nothing. I am oily already, so I don&#x27;t get the one with the lotion. Also, I put this on, blow dry my face for one minute, and then I put a light coat of Maximum Strength Clearasil over it because it&#x27;s a bit greasy for me. I might get a pimple once every few months and that&#x27;s it! I&#x27;ve bought $150 and higher products that do nothing for wrinkles and acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote this to help those with unrealistic expectations and for those who have patience and have spent a fortune like me who will know that in 6 months, you will look at least 5 years younger! And no, I am not selling this product, just using it :)t, smooth and supple skin you get, you will love this product. Use it every day for 30 days, without fail before you make any decisions.

            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for products but this one was so amazing that I had to share. The thought of snail extract on my skin was kinda icky but I figured since I&#x27;ve tried eveything else including prescriptions from my dermatologist, that I would try one more thing. I have sensitive skin and I am a very light toned black woman that has been suffering from acne since my teenage years and when the acne subsides, I am usually left with dark spots. I have tried Ambi, Esoterica, Palmers, Black&amp;White, Black Opal, Clinique and a few others but the spots would slightly fade in six weeks. But when I would get another breakout....more spots would appear!!! It was frustrating to say the least and I had to keep putting on the products longer than suggested use. THIS CREAM, THIS WONDERFUL CREAM!!! Though I literally just started using it lastnight can definately say that I will never stop using this cream. I had a forest of acne on my forehead lastnight. I went through my usual routine of washing my face with castile soap then applied my aloe vera juice as a toner and then used the Elicina cream  a little goes a long way) I woke up this morning and went into the bathroom to wash my face and noticed that the acne forest was gone. So my thought is, if it rids you of the acne and leaves no dark spots to fade then this product is also a preventative cream as well.  My skin feels so soft right now and I am excited to see what the end result is gonna be. I will definately be keeping stock and suggest that everyone does the same. I&#x27;m really shocked!!!</li>
            <li> The Elicina USA has a terrible customer service in terms of delivery. They basically do not care if your package gets lost or you never received. If you have any issue with the delivery you have to contact yourself US Post - so for international customers is really a pain. Plus they don&#x27;t have insurance in case the product is not delivered so you basically can ended up to loose money. I&#x27;m not sure if Amazon has a different policy but the Elicina website doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> i find that this product should be a lil better for the price and size that it is. its an ok cream but ive used better for a much cheaper price</li>
            <li> light without too much oil, good for daily skin care</li>
            <li> Honestly, I saw no changes in the appearance of my skin.  This bottle really was a waste of time.  I tried it and now I know. Snail cream products are nothing but hype.</li>
            <li> I ordered Elicina for my daughter. She has suffered with acne for years and the only thing that helped in the past was antibiotics.  We have been amazed at how much better her skin has gotten and she has only been using Elicina for about a month. The acne is clearing, the dark red spots are getting lighter, and the skin has a visible smoothness. The cream goes right into the skin - not sticky or oily.  This product is wonderful and we will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> This product really works BUT make sure you are consistent. Make sure you follow the directions because you can get good results. Hope it does good for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for a couple of years and it really works. It makes my skin fresher and small wrinkles are gone and new wrinkles do not appear. So use this regularly to look better and younger.</li>
            <li> i had trouble with my skin and break  outs since teen yrs found this on EBAY in 2000 used it 2x day and then I got laser resurfacing for scars but the procedure scarred me in one area on my cheek in a line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where I wasn&#x27;t scarred !  HE messed up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO MAD. !!&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was doomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I began using ORIGINAL Snail Elicina Cream 2x -3x a day , I  rub it on the area affected AND on my forehead horizontal wrinkles and AFTER using this ALONG with my \\&quot;NEVER BE  WITHOUT  \\&quot;SMOOTHIE WRINKLE REMOVER Strips\\&quot; SOLD HERE , 2 of  3  deep Forehead wrinkles ARE FULLY Gone!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO MORE trips for Botox for over 2 yrs now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR SCARs..i rub in cream,  top it  off with small amount of  AHA 12% night soufflé cream sold here, wait till dry, then apply&lt;br /&gt;my Smoothie wrinkle remover strips on the scars or wrinkles i want to not get again and keep Smoothie on forhead each night though thye are gone so they don&#x27;t return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it DOES IS  LIFTS the SCAR or Wrinkle UP,  from being de-pressed down in to the skin and brings it up  to surface matching your other skin that is not scarred or wrinkled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IVE  started back using this over a week and ALREADY the SCAR made by plastic surgeon from laser resurfacing  is almost gone!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND Forehead deepest wrinkles, 2 of 3 are GONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s result of Using the \\&quot;Smoothie Wrinkle Strips and using AHA \\&quot;  before applying the strips on eye corners and forehead wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH!!!  AND I don&#x27;t have CROWS FEET ANY MORE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether I smiled or not I had faint lines at eye edges and have been using the SMOOTHIE WRINKLE STRIPS EACH NIGHT FOR 3 MONTHS, I wish I knew of in these in my 20s or 30s  ,but at mid 40s, NO ONE  believes  my age and guesses me at 10-15 yrs  less and im in mid 40s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strangers  too, not friends who try to tell you what you want to hear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go by what strangers say when i get asked about what  i use on my skin cause they say its FLAWLESS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ME the one time 20 yr old with ACNE filled Skin and scars, WELL NO MORE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now im told i have AMAZING CLEAR FLAWLESS SKIN???

            <li> i love this elicina cream and i use it everyday, it truly does what it says too, it definitaly has reduced my acne scars and also prevents them from occurring. Great customer service too. i also recieved it on time. thanks.</li>
            <li> This product contains parabens, which have been linked to breast cancer. This ingredient is not listed on the Elicina website. I returned it.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s good. It&#x27;s lightning sunburn spot in my face. I gave it 4 star because I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s organic or not. We will see.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible, but not really for me. It&#x27;s very heavy for a moisturizer and I didn&#x27;t see any of the advertised effects at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 18 months and it&#x27;s effect has been noticed by friends and family. I use it on my face and the first thing I noticed was how soft my skin was. I have rosacea and was hoping it would help fight against that, but I can&#x27;t say that it has.&lt;br /&gt;However, it was unexpected how great it would make my skin look. I&#x27;ll be 36 in a couple months and most people guess me to be 10-15 years younger. My mother flipped out the last time I saw her. She just kept saying \\&quot;I can&#x27;t believe how fantastic your skin looks.\\&quot; She uses it now and so does my sister.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day and one small container lasts over a year. A little goes a long way. And for 25 bucks... I promise it&#x27;s worth taking a chance on this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 5 years and think it keeps the wrinkles away</li>
            <li> I am a user of Elicina since 2002.  That&#x27;s how I love this product. It helps my whole family with any skin issues.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am acne free because of Elicina.  Only a small amount is needed and well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Someone recommond this to me... I just start using it... hmmm, a little oily to me</li>
            <li> I definitely have seen an improvement!!! Best cream I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve only had it for about a month or so.</li>
            <li> The best face cream there is!!!!!</li>
            <li> This cream worked better than I expected and helped with acne too.  It&#x27;s a very nice skin softener and helps remove dead skin.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to support all the &#x27;benefits&#x27; that I read before buying this product. I used it for a few weeks, didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin, and even feel disgusted of the thoughts of slug on my face</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t blend in your skin and it feels really oily, i started using missha snail cream and i wanted to try it because it has more content and is less the cost, but it&#x27;s not worth it. It has parabens or whatever and it smells weird, and it makes me break out, doesn&#x27;t really do much else. I&#x27;m going to stick with Missha because it&#x27;s got a addicting scent and works better than this.</li>
            <li> Exelent product it works perfect with the acne also work with the scars I haven&#x27;t seen another product that in less time u cann see results ...</li>
            <li> I did not find this product to be effective at all. That being said, I do believe in the effectiveness of snail products in general and have had better luck with Korean products. This product did not break me out but it did not improve my scarring or healing of acne. It also had no skin brightening effects considering its supposed to help with skin cell turnover and what not. It didn&#x27;t even moisturize very well. I have acne prone combination skin with lots of scarring. My skin is not very sensitive and reacts very well and almost immediately to AHA or Vitamin C products so I was very sad to see the utter lack of any effect from this product. For this price point, there are so many better similar products that have additional benefits to the skin as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and my skin looks a lot better. It reduces wrinkles, but is not oily and you do not need to use a lot of it. I use it twice daily and I love the way my skin looks. I am 48 and trying to stay away from botox and other forms of surgery as long as I can.</li>
            <li> I don’t use it everyday since its not moisturizing enough. But once a a while when I use it, it does give me a glowing effect, makes my skin feels tighter, more lifting and the scars are faded. Goodd product and good price!</li>
            <li> I just received this cream this past week and I started using it at night.  I still have to use it to see the results.  Will update later.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC stuff. Scars slowly fading away. After a bad bruise, or a cut scabs over, apply a little over the area and the healing quickens.</li>
            <li> I like this product, not heavy and doesnt have a heavy smell to it. Also it will last me a long time because you dont have to use to much.</li>
            <li> Not really sure about this product ...I haven&#x27;t seen any better results and its almost like my play, why should I spend double on same product or similar.</li>
            <li> The first time I purchased this product, I was simply curious as to whether or not it would help control/improve my skin and acne. I have very sensitive oily/combination skin (chin, nose, and cheeks are oily, but the rest of my face is dry) with hormonal acne on top of that and the first use of Elicina brought with it a notable softness. The first thing I noticed was that there was no smell at all, and the second was that although it was thick and creamy, it spread far and absorbed fast. It did not get rid of my acne, but I noticed that any outbreak would heal up before it could really get started and it reduced a lot of the red pigment from much older outbreaks that just wouldn&#x27;t go away. I applied Elicina twice daily on clean skin until my jar ran out for a little more than one month. I ordered a second jar a couple days before my first one ran up and that second jar is not odorless. It has a strange chemical/slightly tea tree smell to it and the one time I used it before I noticed the smell, it left my skin feeling dry and tight. Since I don&#x27;t want to gamble more money on another, hopefully less smelly jar, I&#x27;ve decided to try out one of South Korea&#x27;s many perfume, colorant, and paraben free snail creams.</li>
            <li> I order this form my mother in law and she loves this product shes been using this product for years.</li>
            <li> I have had chronic acne on my chin all my life, I&#x27;m 37, I have used this now for two weeks at bedtime and haven&#x27;t had one pimple.  My skin feels and looks great.  I think it makes your pores smaller.  I highly recommend it.  It works for me!</li>
            <li> No that creme not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Was slightly skeptical before trying this but read that many celebrities were using snail exudate on their faces so thought I would try it since I admired the way their skin looked. Within a month the condition and appearance of my skin improved to the point that I was actually looking younger. What I noticed first was that it eliminated the dry flakey patches I had been experiencing the last couple of years during the cold weather months. I had been using some very pricey big name brands but my skin never improved. The next thing I noticed is that the lines were literally not there/greatly reduced on my face. I have had a vertical line between my eyebrows for the past few years that was getting worse and is now completely gone  as well as the fine lines below the corners of my mouth extending to my jaw. These lines have lessened a lot also. I am 62 years old so I think that is saying a lot about my appearance. Most people think I am in my late 40&#x27;s-early 50&#x27;s. Even my esthetician is quite impressed.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF! I have been using this for a little over 2 weeks on my stretch marks that are on my inner thighs and the tops of my thighs. This has faded my stretch marks tremendously. I also have a good sized scar all the way across my abdomen from a surgery and a scar on my thigh as well and it has faded them! AND it has faded the dark spots on my face! I am so thankful for this magic cream and those magic little snails. I have been using a big amount obviously and I am still not out, though I did just order another thing of it. This may dry your face out so make sure you put a moisturizer on your face after if you start to notice drying. Also a little bit goes a LONG way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should most definitely try this product out and for 25 USD how could you beat that? I order from SOON LLC</li>
            <li> it doesnt do what it says it does- wasted my money ON THIS PRODUCT - LEARNED MY LESSON FOR SURE</li>
