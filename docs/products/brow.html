            <li>I was happy with delivery and service of provider.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a great price too.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>I am happy.</li>
            <li>; if you need a good product for ur brows try revitabrow it is incredible ...</li>
            <li>Use it as if your life depends on it lol .</li>
            <li>In my family body hair is scarce which is great, but we have almost no lash or brow.</li>
            <li>For anybody who has unruly eyebrows, this also works great for taming them.</li>
            <li>Great for the price.</li>
            <li>SO GREAT.</li>
            <li>But the end result is very nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really amazing!</li>
            <li>Buy at your own risk!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a really good brand (26.00 a bottle)</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I call a good lash conditioner.</li>
            <li>Good Product but not for me, it cause my eyes to burn, but I do have an allergy to gluten so that could be the reason.</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;ve been looking for a good replacement for both brows and lashes.  </li>
            <li>(I use it twice a day and saw good results in a month).</li>
            <li>but I am super happy with the results!</li>
            <li>After a month of, inconsistently, using this gel I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>It worked so well, that I ordered more and shipped it to my mom!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>love this stuff!</li>
            <li>are more of them!</li>
            <li>And I love my eyebrows!</li>
            <li>This is a great product and will order more for sure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it on my brows and notice that they are thicker and the sparse areas are filling in nicely.  </li>
            <li>so I was hoping to see some kind of results</li>
            <li>Honestly, i should have known.</li>
            <li>I started out using this just as treatment gel for night, but I liked the way it made my lashes look</li>
            <li>Worked at department store cosmetic counters and sold cosmetics on my own.</li>
            <li>kind of in shock and super happy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll post more updates if I get totally thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li>of course they looked great at first</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to someone who already has beautiful lashes and wants to maintain them or someone that maybe tried extensions or for whatever reason has lost lashes.</li>
            <li>bought some more for me and some for my mom.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s the mascara that&#x27;s making my lashes look better.</li>
            <li>Maybe it takes more time.</li>
            <li>I needed it because Maybelline Falsies Mascara made me lose so many lashes.</li>
            <li>I did not see any more results.  </li>
            <li>Also be sure you are not allergic to this product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li>Still waiting as I probably need to give it more time.  </li>
            <li>I guess I am seeing a bit of more eyelash and eyebrow...but still working on it...</li>
            <li>(Yes Just Kidding) we love it.</li>
            <li>then more and more..crazy.</li>
            <li>you will see:)</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>I also asked my eye doctor if these kinds of products were safe.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>but my eyelashes were more nourished once I started using this product.</li>
            <li>I have had better results in thickening my eyebrows and growing my eyelashes with my organic grapeseed oil every night.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotta say that I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>worked so much better.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Still using it and hoping to see more results.</li>
            <li>it was okay</li>
            <li>I want to have eyelashes where genetics neglected to give and not be embarrassed that my boyfriend has better eyelashes than I do.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>does a good job when used consistently</li>
            <li>I am getting married and I want my lashes to look fabulous!!</li>
            <li>No irritation and easy application.</li>
            <li>But thats easy to avoid.</li>
            <li>This gel is easy to use -</li>
            <li>but the application is easy</li>
            <li>My search continues, yet this product was decent and a good price</li>
            <li>Besides that, sometimes if and when the product gets into my eye, my eye gets incredibly irritated and very dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve already recommended this to several friends and they too are happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It filled in the gaps, made my eye lashes longer, and I even put it on my eyebrows and they have thickened up a bit too.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it grew my lashes either, but as aforementioned there have been benefits since my beginning using this, as well as it being a great lash primer, and</li>
            <li>So happy something is finally working for me.</li>
            <li>have even tried to fit my RIMMEL eyelash brush into the BROW &amp; LASH accelerator bottle</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t fit ???</li>
            <li>This Ardell Brow &amp; lash growth accelerator is fantastic.</li>
            <li>You should try it , it;s cheap and works.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and have seen great results, especially in my eyebrows...</li>
            <li>Worth the price and the product for sure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap because it does nothing.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how long and beautiful my eyelashes are.</li>
            <li>Therefore I have a tendency to use the RIMMEL product more often and feel I have much more productivity with Rimmel brush &amp;  product than the Brow &amp; Lash; The Rimmel eyelash brush is much easier to use and apply the gel</li>
            <li>and you can apply mascara right over top of it no clunking</li>
            <li>It was then that I would have given anything to go back to my original lashes and be happy with that.  </li>
            <li>Very effective product, definitely buying it again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I still put this on my lashes under my mascara, and can honestly say my lashes are longer than they&#x27;ve ever been before, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super happy to have my lashes back after I had lost them after removing my lash extensions.</li>
            <li>I noticed a significant difference in about two weeks.</li>
            <li>My lashes are long and look great.  </li>
            <li>ITS WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>its definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>This product is pleasant to use but, after several weeks, I cannot tell if it is working.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good idea to put a good amount onto the eyebrows and let them dry completely before applying eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to use, is a great value and REALLY DOES WORK (when used properly).</li>
            <li>and my eyes flamed and turned bright red</li>
            <li>It does nit cost much and u wont lose out on most if it does not work for you.  </li>
            <li>Actually I use two coats of this every morning before mascara as a primer, for which I would say this is good for.  </li>
            <li>I loved this product because my eyelashes grew back</li>
            <li>No amount of long lashes is worth that kind of worth that kind of pain.</li>
            <li>(Not gobs and gobs, but a full application amount per eyebrow.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used other products that worked great for lengthening my lashes.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve mostly taken putting on makeup out of my routine and have come to face the fact that I have pretty much no eyelashes!</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is ON your eyes, maybe it was safe new but who knows what it does expired.</li>
            <li>This product seems really conditioning and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>First, if it gets in your eyes watch out!</li>
            <li>IF YOU SUFFER FROM THE SAME PROBLEM I&#x27;VE HAD FOR MANY YEARS!</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really complain about anything when it&#x27;s this cheap and does what it says it will.</li>
            <li>But, for the price it&#x27;s worth a shot, seeing as how the RX&#x27;s out there are 100&#x27;s of dollars a month.</li>
            <li>, my first is still full.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re over-plucked and sparsely-lashed.</li>
            <li>It took a little while for it to start working, but I love it!!</li>
            <li>noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lash growth accelerators in the past that have worked, especially Revitalash, but the original formula is no longer available (probably for good reason!)</li>
            <li>a couple of years ago I had individual lashes put on, they looked great and were very addictive, but after using them for a couple of months</li>
            <li>If you use this consistently, twice a day, it does work after three weeks.  </li>
            <li>I started using in hopes that it will work and work fast!  </li>
            <li>A week later I was able to wear mascara alone</li>
            <li>Overall, I find it to be an OKAY product...</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li>This really does make your lashes grow!</li>
            <li>I would love my over-plucked eyebrows to grow back</li>
            <li>Started seeing results the THIRD DAY and today is the 4th day and it grew even more.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much of a difference it has made!</li>
            <li>Works well when you use it exactly as directed.</li>
            <li>When I first used it, it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>I did the top and bottom the same way</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than purchasing from the store, plus you get two!</li>
            <li>My formerly scanty eyebrows are back in full bloom and my eyes are nicely framed by thicker lashes.</li>
            <li>just because something cost MORE doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that formula is any better than the cheaper stuff.</li>
            <li>I was super skeptical at first because it seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li>This definitely worked a lot better than other products I&#x27;ve used for a lot more money.</li>
            <li>It is inexpensive, easy to use and fast acting.</li>
            <li>The best way I would describe it would be thick eyebrows where there was already hair but not much new hair.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I didn&#x27;t have very high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>This is not a false eyelash look, but a noticable change.  </li>
            <li>No false advertisements.</li>
            <li>It really made my eyebrow hair grow faster,</li>
            <li>someone doesn&#x27;t break out into a rash or anything after using this product, this review won&#x27;t really help you.</li>
            <li>and i didn&#x27;t realize what it was from since i had read this was supposed to be \\&quot;really safe.\\</li>
            <li>and you feel like you&#x27;re not getting much on your lashes.</li>
            <li>nothing too much to gush about.</li>
            <li>It really does.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I got this product not expecting much out of it, but I was very dedicated to it and one day - within a week..</li>
            <li>It does not work, it turns white on your eyebrows and flakes off as if you used a cheap hairspray on them.</li>
            <li>As the instructions state that you have to apply it at night, I recommend not using too much on your eyelashes because my eyes started to water</li>
            <li>If you use too much, you&#x27;ll have crust around the corners of your eyes when you wake up.</li>
            <li>This used to be available at a local retailer.  </li>
            <li>I was wasting my money the whole time.</li>
            <li>Over time however, it didn&#x27;t grow as fast or as much.</li>
            <li>I think that really helps too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to work</li>
            <li>The most I&#x27;ve spent on brow growth was $25 for Brow Boost and that stuff didn&#x27;t do anything...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear much makeup so this well for me.</li>
            <li>i guess didnt do much what it had said so</li>
            <li>that all this product really does is let your lashes grow to</li>
            <li>We loved how it made our lashes grow at least 4 inches in length  </li>
            <li>I love using this product because not only was it not expensive, but it actually works.</li>
            <li>Overall, worth a try!</li>
            <li>think if the brush was smaller I could apply the product much better to my upper and lower lashes., but being that the brush is large</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s full potential.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it made my lashes any longer or more voluminous, but it did make them look healthier and they fell out less</li>
            <li>My top eyelashes bore no difference except for a slight curl caused by the mascara type brush from the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a month of using this</li>
            <li>My top lashes seemed slightly fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Although my brows are already decent, I tried this product hoping to fill in some of the patchier bits.</li>
            <li>But it definitely works and I&#x27;m starting to grow more lashes and they&#x27;re healthier (which is aweeeeeeeewsomeeee.)</li>
            <li>Actually works on making your lashes and eyebrows grow quickly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll most likely come back to it one day.</li>
            <li>The product makes eyebrows little darker wich i love, do not fall</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really recommend putting that anywhere near your eyes.</li>
            <li>I started using this for my eye brows and they grew back pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Works great and with the precision combs causes for little mess.</li>
            <li>I have a new mascara</li>
            <li>&quot; I haven&#x27;t been using anything new on my face except this brow and lash growth.</li>
            <li>I have never had such an intense itching in my eye!</li>
            <li>Olive oil, does EXACTLY the same thing.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve been using this product pretty religiously for about 5 weeks now</li>
            <li>WOW !</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product first as it was low cost.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m part Asian and that wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was going for.</li>
            <li>If someone use it everyday I guess it grows fast and full.  </li>
            <li>Again do to MY much smaller and shorter eyelashes than most average length</li>
            <li>just be super careful and not get it in your eyes!</li>
            <li>I used it nightly and started to notice some change after about 21/2 weeks, but now that it&#x27;s been over 4 weeks I can see a clear difference.</li>
            <li>so I started wearing it as a clear mascara for the day as well.</li>
            <li>Accelerator seemed like clear mascara .</li>
            <li>So far have not seen any results.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t usually sensitive</li>
            <li>The only product that really works is Latisse, and you need a doctor&#x27;s prescription for that.</li>
            <li>Try it you will be surprised.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, I don&#x27;t need as much brow pencil or mascara now, so I will definitely keep using this product!</li>
            <li>hope that in the future Brow &amp; Lash will take inconsideration to produce a much SLIMMER Lined Brush because not every women already have lengthy and or fuller eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I could get rid of it fast enough</li>
            <li>So far no difference.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, enough to write a review.</li>
            <li>I have been tweezing my eyebrows since I was 11 years old.</li>
            <li>As a 35 year old, I have decided that I want my eyebrows to be a bit thicker, which seems to be the trend these days.  </li>
            <li>but low and behold the much cheaper stuff</li>
            <li>Drug store product&#x27;s w/ mascara promising longer looking lashes are not only costly but they are  temporary</li>
            <li>This product works just as well as the more costly ones, if not better!</li>
            <li>Okay, so I was skeptical at first....</li>
            <li>and darker.i have lots of little hairs that are growing in, but for the most part it seems to only enhance the parts of my eyebrow that already have hair.ive been putting it on my eyebrows every morning and night and brush it through them and then take off some of the product off the wand and spread it on the skin where i want the hairs to grow back..</li>
            <li>my brows are back to normal in just 3 weeks of using the product every night.</li>
            <li>but this product just worth the money ... not much!!</li>
            <li>After the first couple of weeks, the bottom lashes toward my inner eye were much darker and slightly longer.</li>
            <li>I am finally starting to see some new hairs sprout on my over-plucked eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>, I rub the applicator back and forth over the eyebrow and the over plucked areas that I want to stimulate new hair growth.</li>
            <li>I saw no other way to contact seller.</li>
            <li>As far as growing my brows, no such luck.</li>
            <li>The lashes in the lower inner eye had relatively stayed the same since the first initial weeks.</li>
            <li>i thought 25 was expensive and kind of didn&#x27;t want to spend that...</li>
            <li>Although it does not grow extremely fast &amp; thick like when I first began using it, this product STILL WORKS.</li>
            <li>One thing that I hate about this is the fact that you have to put it on consistently to see a good results...</li>
            <li>for some reason my brow lashes were falling off easily and growing back slowly, as soon as I started using this product</li>
            <li>But, other than that, it really does help your lashes grow.</li>
            <li>i was extremely skeptical of this stuff...i&#x27;m a big fan of rapid lash and had AMAZING results with that.</li>
            <li>I was very sceptical about this product because of the price compared to other similar products.  </li>
            <li>I have a bare spot on my left eyebrow and nothing has grown since using this product every night as directed.  </li>
            <li>Like, within the first few days.</li>
            <li>My eyes are dry and sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I have super thick lashes again.</li>
            <li>I have bought some of the expensive kinds of growth accelerator and it did not work half as good as this stuff.</li>
            <li>As for my eyebrows, I noticed that I was getting little pimples if I used too much.</li>
            <li>I tried it as my eyebrows and eyelashes had thinned out tremendously, I suppose due to stress or hormones, and after a few days I was starting to see a difference...</li>

            <li> I am happy.</li>

            <li> Use it as if your life depends on it lol .</li>
            <li> In my family body hair is scarce which is great, but we have almost no lash or brow.</li>
            <li> For anybody who has unruly eyebrows, this also works great for taming them.</li>
            <li> Great for the price.</li>
            <li> SO GREAT.</li>
            <li> But the end result is very nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really amazing!</li>
            <li> Buy at your own risk!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a really good brand (26.00 a bottle)</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I call a good lash conditioner.</li>
            <li> Good Product but not for me, it cause my eyes to burn, but I do have an allergy to gluten so that could be the reason.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;ve been looking for a good replacement for both brows and lashes.  </li>
            <li> (I use it twice a day and saw good results in a month).</li>
            <li> but I am super happy with the results!</li>
            <li> After a month of, inconsistently, using this gel I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> It worked so well, that I ordered more and shipped it to my mom!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> love this stuff!</li>
            <li> are more of them!</li>
            <li> And I love my eyebrows!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and will order more for sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on my brows and notice that they are thicker and the sparse areas are filling in nicely.  </li>
            <li> so I was hoping to see some kind of results</li>
            <li> Honestly, i should have known.</li>
            <li> I started out using this just as treatment gel for night, but I liked the way it made my lashes look</li>
            <li> Worked at department store cosmetic counters and sold cosmetics on my own.</li>
            <li> kind of in shock and super happy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll post more updates if I get totally thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> of course they looked great at first</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to someone who already has beautiful lashes and wants to maintain them or someone that maybe tried extensions or for whatever reason has lost lashes.</li>
            <li> bought some more for me and some for my mom.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the mascara that&#x27;s making my lashes look better.</li>
            <li> Maybe it takes more time.</li>
            <li> I needed it because Maybelline Falsies Mascara made me lose so many lashes.</li>
            <li> I did not see any more results.  </li>
            <li> Also be sure you are not allergic to this product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li> Still waiting as I probably need to give it more time.  </li>
            <li> I guess I am seeing a bit of more eyelash and eyebrow...but still working on it...</li>
            <li> (Yes Just Kidding) we love it.</li>
            <li> then more and more..crazy.</li>
            <li> you will see:)</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> I also asked my eye doctor if these kinds of products were safe.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> but my eyelashes were more nourished once I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I have had better results in thickening my eyebrows and growing my eyelashes with my organic grapeseed oil every night.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotta say that I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> worked so much better.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Still using it and hoping to see more results.</li>
            <li> it was okay</li>
            <li> I want to have eyelashes where genetics neglected to give and not be embarrassed that my boyfriend has better eyelashes than I do.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> does a good job when used consistently</li>
            <li> I am getting married and I want my lashes to look fabulous!!</li>
            <li> No irritation and easy application.</li>
            <li> But thats easy to avoid.</li>
            <li> This gel is easy to use -</li>
            <li> but the application is easy</li>
            <li> My search continues, yet this product was decent and a good price</li>
            <li> Besides that, sometimes if and when the product gets into my eye, my eye gets incredibly irritated and very dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve already recommended this to several friends and they too are happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It filled in the gaps, made my eye lashes longer, and I even put it on my eyebrows and they have thickened up a bit too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it grew my lashes either, but as aforementioned there have been benefits since my beginning using this, as well as it being a great lash primer, and</li>
            <li> So happy something is finally working for me.</li>
            <li> have even tried to fit my RIMMEL eyelash brush into the BROW &amp; LASH accelerator bottle</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t fit ???</li>
            <li> This Ardell Brow &amp; lash growth accelerator is fantastic.</li>
            <li> You should try it , it;s cheap and works.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and have seen great results, especially in my eyebrows...</li>
            <li> Worth the price and the product for sure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap because it does nothing.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how long and beautiful my eyelashes are.</li>
            <li> Therefore I have a tendency to use the RIMMEL product more often and feel I have much more productivity with Rimmel brush &amp;  product than the Brow &amp; Lash; The Rimmel eyelash brush is much easier to use and apply the gel</li>
            <li> and you can apply mascara right over top of it no clunking</li>
            <li> It was then that I would have given anything to go back to my original lashes and be happy with that.  </li>
            <li> Very effective product, definitely buying it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I still put this on my lashes under my mascara, and can honestly say my lashes are longer than they&#x27;ve ever been before, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m super happy to have my lashes back after I had lost them after removing my lash extensions.</li>
            <li> I noticed a significant difference in about two weeks.</li>
            <li> My lashes are long and look great.  </li>
            <li> ITS WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> its definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> This product is pleasant to use but, after several weeks, I cannot tell if it is working.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea to put a good amount onto the eyebrows and let them dry completely before applying eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to use, is a great value and REALLY DOES WORK (when used properly).</li>
            <li> and my eyes flamed and turned bright red</li>
            <li> It does nit cost much and u wont lose out on most if it does not work for you.  </li>
            <li> Actually I use two coats of this every morning before mascara as a primer, for which I would say this is good for.  </li>
            <li> I loved this product because my eyelashes grew back</li>
            <li> No amount of long lashes is worth that kind of worth that kind of pain.</li>
            <li> (Not gobs and gobs, but a full application amount per eyebrow.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used other products that worked great for lengthening my lashes.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve mostly taken putting on makeup out of my routine and have come to face the fact that I have pretty much no eyelashes!</li>
            <li> Thank you so very much!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is ON your eyes, maybe it was safe new but who knows what it does expired.</li>
            <li> This product seems really conditioning and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> First, if it gets in your eyes watch out!</li>
            <li> IF YOU SUFFER FROM THE SAME PROBLEM I&#x27;VE HAD FOR MANY YEARS!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really complain about anything when it&#x27;s this cheap and does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> But, for the price it&#x27;s worth a shot, seeing as how the RX&#x27;s out there are 100&#x27;s of dollars a month.</li>
            <li> , my first is still full.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re over-plucked and sparsely-lashed.</li>
            <li> It took a little while for it to start working, but I love it!!</li>
            <li> noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lash growth accelerators in the past that have worked, especially Revitalash, but the original formula is no longer available (probably for good reason!)</li>
            <li> a couple of years ago I had individual lashes put on, they looked great and were very addictive, but after using them for a couple of months</li>
            <li> If you use this consistently, twice a day, it does work after three weeks.  </li>
            <li> I started using in hopes that it will work and work fast!  </li>
            <li> A week later I was able to wear mascara alone</li>
            <li> Overall, I find it to be an OKAY product...</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> This really does make your lashes grow!</li>
            <li> I would love my over-plucked eyebrows to grow back</li>
            <li> Started seeing results the THIRD DAY and today is the 4th day and it grew even more.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much of a difference it has made!</li>
            <li> Works well when you use it exactly as directed.</li>
            <li> When I first used it, it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> I did the top and bottom the same way</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than purchasing from the store, plus you get two!</li>
            <li> My formerly scanty eyebrows are back in full bloom and my eyes are nicely framed by thicker lashes.</li>
            <li> just because something cost MORE doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that formula is any better than the cheaper stuff.</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical at first because it seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li> This definitely worked a lot better than other products I&#x27;ve used for a lot more money.</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive, easy to use and fast acting.</li>
            <li> The best way I would describe it would be thick eyebrows where there was already hair but not much new hair.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I didn&#x27;t have very high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> This is not a false eyelash look, but a noticable change.  </li>
            <li> No false advertisements.</li>
            <li> It really made my eyebrow hair grow faster,</li>
            <li> someone doesn&#x27;t break out into a rash or anything after using this product, this review won&#x27;t really help you.</li>
            <li> and i didn&#x27;t realize what it was from since i had read this was supposed to be \\&quot;really safe.\\</li>
            <li> and you feel like you&#x27;re not getting much on your lashes.</li>
            <li> nothing too much to gush about.</li>
            <li> It really does.  </li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I got this product not expecting much out of it, but I was very dedicated to it and one day - within a week..</li>
            <li> It does not work, it turns white on your eyebrows and flakes off as if you used a cheap hairspray on them.</li>
            <li> As the instructions state that you have to apply it at night, I recommend not using too much on your eyelashes because my eyes started to water</li>
            <li> If you use too much, you&#x27;ll have crust around the corners of your eyes when you wake up.</li>
            <li> This used to be available at a local retailer.  </li>
            <li> I was wasting my money the whole time.</li>
            <li> Over time however, it didn&#x27;t grow as fast or as much.</li>
            <li> I think that really helps too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to work</li>
            <li> The most I&#x27;ve spent on brow growth was $25 for Brow Boost and that stuff didn&#x27;t do anything...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear much makeup so this well for me.</li>
            <li> i guess didnt do much what it had said so</li>
            <li> that all this product really does is let your lashes grow to</li>
            <li> We loved how it made our lashes grow at least 4 inches in length  </li>
            <li> I love using this product because not only was it not expensive, but it actually works.</li>
            <li> Overall, worth a try!</li>
            <li> think if the brush was smaller I could apply the product much better to my upper and lower lashes., but being that the brush is large</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s full potential.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it made my lashes any longer or more voluminous, but it did make them look healthier and they fell out less</li>
            <li> My top eyelashes bore no difference except for a slight curl caused by the mascara type brush from the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a month of using this</li>
            <li> My top lashes seemed slightly fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Although my brows are already decent, I tried this product hoping to fill in some of the patchier bits.</li>
            <li> But it definitely works and I&#x27;m starting to grow more lashes and they&#x27;re healthier (which is aweeeeeeeewsomeeee.)</li>
            <li> Actually works on making your lashes and eyebrows grow quickly.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll most likely come back to it one day.</li>
            <li> The product makes eyebrows little darker wich i love, do not fall</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really recommend putting that anywhere near your eyes.</li>
            <li> I started using this for my eye brows and they grew back pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Works great and with the precision combs causes for little mess.</li>
            <li> I have a new mascara</li>
            <li> &quot; I haven&#x27;t been using anything new on my face except this brow and lash growth.</li>
            <li> I have never had such an intense itching in my eye!</li>
            <li> Olive oil, does EXACTLY the same thing.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve been using this product pretty religiously for about 5 weeks now</li>
            <li> WOW !</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product first as it was low cost.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m part Asian and that wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was going for.</li>
            <li> If someone use it everyday I guess it grows fast and full.  </li>
            <li> Again do to MY much smaller and shorter eyelashes than most average length</li>
            <li> just be super careful and not get it in your eyes!</li>
            <li> I used it nightly and started to notice some change after about 21/2 weeks, but now that it&#x27;s been over 4 weeks I can see a clear difference.</li>
            <li> so I started wearing it as a clear mascara for the day as well.</li>
            <li> Accelerator seemed like clear mascara .</li>
            <li> So far have not seen any results.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t usually sensitive</li>
            <li> The only product that really works is Latisse, and you need a doctor&#x27;s prescription for that.</li>
            <li> Try it you will be surprised.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, I don&#x27;t need as much brow pencil or mascara now, so I will definitely keep using this product!</li>
            <li> hope that in the future Brow &amp; Lash will take inconsideration to produce a much SLIMMER Lined Brush because not every women already have lengthy and or fuller eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I could get rid of it fast enough</li>
            <li> So far no difference.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, enough to write a review.</li>
            <li> I have been tweezing my eyebrows since I was 11 years old.</li>
            <li> As a 35 year old, I have decided that I want my eyebrows to be a bit thicker, which seems to be the trend these days.  </li>
            <li> but low and behold the much cheaper stuff</li>
            <li> Drug store product&#x27;s w/ mascara promising longer looking lashes are not only costly but they are  temporary</li>
            <li> This product works just as well as the more costly ones, if not better!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I was skeptical at first....</li>
            <li> and darker.i have lots of little hairs that are growing in, but for the most part it seems to only enhance the parts of my eyebrow that already have hair.ive been putting it on my eyebrows every morning and night and brush it through them and then take off some of the product off the wand and spread it on the skin where i want the hairs to grow back..</li>
            <li> my brows are back to normal in just 3 weeks of using the product every night.</li>
            <li> but this product just worth the money ... not much!!</li>
            <li> After the first couple of weeks, the bottom lashes toward my inner eye were much darker and slightly longer.</li>
            <li> I am finally starting to see some new hairs sprout on my over-plucked eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> , I rub the applicator back and forth over the eyebrow and the over plucked areas that I want to stimulate new hair growth.</li>
            <li> I saw no other way to contact seller.</li>
            <li> As far as growing my brows, no such luck.</li>
            <li> The lashes in the lower inner eye had relatively stayed the same since the first initial weeks.</li>
            <li> i thought 25 was expensive and kind of didn&#x27;t want to spend that...</li>
            <li> Although it does not grow extremely fast &amp; thick like when I first began using it, this product STILL WORKS.</li>
            <li> One thing that I hate about this is the fact that you have to put it on consistently to see a good results...</li>
            <li> for some reason my brow lashes were falling off easily and growing back slowly, as soon as I started using this product</li>
            <li> But, other than that, it really does help your lashes grow.</li>
            <li> i was extremely skeptical of this stuff...i&#x27;m a big fan of rapid lash and had AMAZING results with that.</li>
            <li> I was very sceptical about this product because of the price compared to other similar products.  </li>
            <li> I have a bare spot on my left eyebrow and nothing has grown since using this product every night as directed.  </li>
            <li> Like, within the first few days.</li>
            <li> My eyes are dry and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I have super thick lashes again.</li>
            <li> I have bought some of the expensive kinds of growth accelerator and it did not work half as good as this stuff.</li>
            <li> As for my eyebrows, I noticed that I was getting little pimples if I used too much.</li>
            <li> I tried it as my eyebrows and eyelashes had thinned out tremendously, I suppose due to stress or hormones, and after a few days I was starting to see a difference...</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on other recommendations but didn&#x27;t expect anywhere near the results I got.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I actually use this product as a clear mascara as I have dark eyelashes already--</li>
            <li> this is really strange especially since I only use this on my eye lashes..</li>
            <li> I have single eye lid, so when I open my eyes, my lashes looked short because my lashes were hide into the skins.</li>
            <li> My brows were really skimpy and unbelievably, this item helped.</li>
            <li> My lashes took longer but the tube lasts a long time, even using it on brows and lashes daily.</li>
            <li> I think some people are not waiting long enough to get visible results.  </li>
            <li> I put it on pretty thick, at night.  </li>
            <li> Nothing crazy but enough to notice more hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim after reading other reviews, both good and bad.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this that long</li>
            <li> we had to trim them with the scissors we couldn&#x27;t sleep at night because they were so long.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> I havent been using it for long enought to see results yet</li>
            <li> I am a daily mascara wearer and also due to aging my eyelashes became sparse.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I would dry it.</li>
            <li> It does dry and scratch if you get it in your eye.</li>
            <li> I did, in the past, use it for what it is meant for and yes, I do admit my lashes looked much fuller, broke off a lot less, and since I use  waterproof mascara, on occasion I dealt with lash loss.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used every single day but yet have seen results!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it three stars is that when you use it in the morning and then put your mascara over it, the lash treatment tends to dry and then it&#x27;s hard to feather your lashes out with regular mascara.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes are a little fuller but definitely longer.</li>
            <li> This actually made my eyelashes grow a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really looking to have big fake looking eyelashes, I&#x27;m really just wanting some.</li>
            <li> and I can see no real difference.</li>
            <li> I used this product as directed buy saw absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> U can&#x27;t get much lotion on the brush and if u get it in your eyes,It&#x27;s the worse I ever used</li>
            <li> once I closed my eyes.</li>
            <li> they worked as expected over time.</li>
            <li> Be careful when applying and don&#x27;t rub your eyes, when you are wearing it.  </li>
            <li> lashes aren&#x27;t &#x27;thick&#x27; as such, but they are definitely longer!  </li>
            <li> hard to tell if this stuff really works - not sure I would order it again...</li>
            <li> I really like this product and have achieved dramatic results,I will continue to use this product and will recommend anyone to use.</li>
            <li> only because I am the type to forget or get lazy.</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars to counteract other reviews that say it burns.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with the product of the eyelash Brow &amp; Lash treatment gel, however,  I am disappointed with the Brow &amp; Lash eyelash</li>
            <li> As for the brows I just brushed it on as usual.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried other products that were unsuccessful until this one.</li>
            <li> I will order other ones and I will rate also.</li>
            <li> Only way to get a return is to ship the stuff back, ridiculous waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> my eyebrows and lashes are back and thick and it seems every morning when I wake up</li>
            <li> ** Being that I have very thin and short eyelashes, I feel that the eyelash brush is too thick and too large for my eyelashes and the gel doesn&#x27;t coat my  eyelashes the way I would like for it to</li>
            <li> My lashes are longer, and slightly thicker.  </li>
            <li> As a result, I&#x27;m using much less mascara.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my real lashes were short, sparse and ugly.  </li>
            <li> There is less lash fall-out, they are langer and fuller.  </li>
            <li> use about 3 times a week to just maintain my thick long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my eyelashes were ever that thick or long!</li>
            <li> I used it less than one month, and I&#x27;ve used it almost everyday night.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to see even a little bit of improvement in my eyelashes, but saw none.</li>
            <li> All our eyelashes needs is moisture and a little oil.  </li>
            <li> I started seeing a little difference..</li>
            <li> I started to see results in a little over a week and my lashes are still growing.</li>
            <li> Also, the existing brows are getting a little thicker.  </li>
            <li> I used this for a few months and didn&#x27;t see any difference in either my eyebrows or my lashes.  </li>
            <li> I used it everyday for 30 days and no thicker lashes or eyebrows</li>
            <li> but there are a few issues I have had.</li>
            <li> it looks cheap - and i hate that it&#x27;s a mascara type wand</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m in my fifties my eyebrows and lashes are starting to thin.</li>
            <li> but talking with a few esthetician friends convinced me to give a try.  </li>
            <li> With this you will see results in a few days.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money..</li>
            <li> i will update in a few weeks</li>
            <li> I applied it everyday or night dependindung on if I remembered.</li>
            <li> This product works if you use it everyday as directed.</li>
            <li> You will see results after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> and I notice that there is less fallout!</li>
            <li> I accidentally trimmed part of my lashes on the left eye a few weeks ago to the point that it was difficult to hide even with mascara.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month ever since I got my eyebrows down and the lady made them super thin :(</li>
            <li> its unbelievable (-:</li>
            <li> EVERYDAY!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product work or not</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually take the time to write a review, but always read reviews when looking for a product.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure this is doing it.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased expensive products in the past that do the same thing this item claims to do.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for at least 3 wks.</li>
            <li> at least for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in late Oct/Nov 2013.</li>
            <li> Have not had any negative side effects whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Therefore I cannot judge this product in a negative way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in cosmetics for at least 25 years.</li>
            <li> I read lots of reviews and found that this brand had the least negative.</li>
            <li> Hey, I gave this 2 stars because I really don&#x27;t want to &#x27;hate&#x27; anything, but this product just didn&#x27;t work for me-- at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always disliked my thin eyelashes.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t apply everyday because I have some seasonal allergies already irritating my eyes and don&#x27;t want to get worse.  </li>
            <li> No more fake lashes or penciling in brows.</li>
            <li> I used other very expensive lash growth that was about $100 to $160</li>
            <li> If that wasn&#x27;t the expiration date then THERE ISN&#x27;T ONE, which is even worse in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my thin, sparse lashes.  </li>
            <li> I decreased the amount that I was using and the pimples went away.</li>
            <li> So I resorted to gluing on false eyelashes</li>
            <li> After two weeks a couple of friends asked if I was wearing false eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also found that if I got it in my eyes, it was uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I was also skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about this</li>
            <li> This product is inexpensive but works well as expensive one.  </li>
            <li> Afraid to use them on my lashes again &#x3D;0(</li>
            <li> It burns like crazy and takes forever to wash out.  </li>
            <li> it took a month or so for my lashes to start filling out again, during which time I used strips, cause my lashes looked that bad.  </li>
            <li> It burns :(</li>
            <li> DANGEROUS!</li>
            <li> I always had problem my lashes falling off :(</li>
            <li> disappointed ):</li>
            <li> But I was very desperate.  </li>
            <li> 1st on the base of the lashes, using the pointy end of the brush.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is so bad!</li>
            <li> It was horrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this for a few months and didn&#x27;t see any difference in either my eyebrows or my lashes.  Wasn&#x27;t that upset since the price was so low, but would probably save my money for something that actually works.</li>
            <li> It really made my eyebrow hair grow faster, its unbelievable (-:</li>
            <li> No need in wasting any $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ on this because it do not work.... I used it everyday for 30 days and no thicker lashes or eyebrows</li>
            <li> I bought one tube to try. . . It made such a noticable difference that people were commenting on it without knowing I had been using this. . .&lt;br /&gt;I use it faithfully-every night- after washing my face, before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;My lashes are not only longer, but thicker too!&lt;br /&gt;I bought some more for me and some for my mom. This stuff is really great. . . just be super careful and not get it in your eyes! It burns :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been usining this twice daily for a month now.  I&#x27;m still undecided as to if it helped at all.  I have a new mascara and it&#x27;s a really good brand (26.00 a bottle) I think it&#x27;s the mascara that&#x27;s making my lashes look better.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this works for me as well as it has for others who have given 5 star reviews, but everyone&#x27;s different and I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve used this product every day religiously.. But, for the price it&#x27;s worth a shot, seeing as how the RX&#x27;s out there are 100&#x27;s of dollars a month.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for at least 3 wks. So far have not seen any results. Maybe it takes more time.</li>
            <li> I was happy with delivery and service of provider.  Still waiting to see lashes grow!</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I didn&#x27;t have very high hopes for this product. We all buy into \\&quot;If it is inexpensive it probably doesn&#x27;t work\\&quot;. Well, it does work and my eyelashes are longer than they have ever been. It doesn&#x27;t work as well on eyebrows, so I gave it four stars. I went to get my haircut a week ago and my barber wanted to trim my eyelashes, I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000VDUOFM Ardell Brow and Lash Growth Accelerator]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone doesn&#x27;t break out into a rash or anything after using this product, this review won&#x27;t really help you. All the reviews on this item i found to be misleading. It could be just me but I have been using this product for only a week now (i know, no time to see any results). But my face broke out into a rash and i didn&#x27;t realize what it was from since i had read this was supposed to be \\&quot;really safe.\\&quot; I haven&#x27;t been using anything new on my face except this brow and lash growth. this is really strange especially since I only use this on my eye lashes.. Anyways. Besides that, sometimes if and when the product gets into my eye, my eye gets incredibly irritated and very dry. My skin isn&#x27;t usually sensitive which is what also makes me concerned about this product. For the price, I would dry it. But I&#x27;m going to have to stop using this product and hopefully find another one.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this that long but there are a few issues I have had. First, if it gets in your eyes watch out! I have never had such an intense itching in my eye! Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem like there is anything on the brush when I apply it so I wonder if anything is actually getting on me?</li>
            <li> i was extremely skeptical of this stuff...i&#x27;m a big fan of rapid lash and had AMAZING results with that. but when i used to order it, it was about $25 a tube. now it&#x27;s almost $50!!! i thought 25 was expensive and kind of didn&#x27;t want to spend that...but 50?? no way. so anyways, this stuff doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s gonna work. it looks cheap - and i hate that it&#x27;s a mascara type wand and you feel like you&#x27;re not getting much on your lashes. BUT it does work. at least for me. rapidlash took 6 weeks for me to see any change at all!! today is the 23rd, i received this stuff on the 11th...so about 2 weeks...and i can already see a difference. kind of in shock and super happy. can&#x27;t really complain about anything when it&#x27;s this cheap and does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> Great product! I noticed a significant difference in about two weeks. Thicker and longer lashes! It worked so well, that I ordered more and shipped it to my mom! She has seen a difference, as well!</li>
            <li> If you use this consistently, twice a day, it does work after three weeks.  My lashes are longer, and slightly thicker.  The only reason I gave it three stars is that when you use it in the morning and then put your mascara over it, the lash treatment tends to dry and then it&#x27;s hard to feather your lashes out with regular mascara.  But, other than that, it really does help your lashes grow.</li>
            <li> I bought this on ebay years ago and I ordered it again because I KNOW it works for me. I needed it because Maybelline Falsies Mascara made me lose so many lashes. I have super thick lashes again. So happy! It&#x27;s really a great price too.</li>
            <li> I was very sceptical about this product because of the price compared to other similar products.  But I was very desperate.  I had gotten eyelash extensions and oh how I wish I could take that back.  It was horrible.  of course they looked great at first but when they started coming off they took all my lashes with them.  It was then that I would have given anything to go back to my original lashes and be happy with that.  It seemed as if they were not going to grow back or it was going to be quite some time.  So I resorted to gluing on false eyelashes EVERYDAY!  that was some work.  UNTIL I got this product in the mail!!  yay!!  I started using in hopes that it will work and work fast!  I could not believe it, 5 days later I saw results.  A week later I was able to wear mascara alone and I couldnt be happier.  My lashes are long and look great.  Thank you so very much!  Ladies, give it a try.  It does nit cost much and u wont lose out on most if it does not work for you.  ITS WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> Good product. I had used before. Second time I buy it.</li>
            <li> DANGEROUS! Mine started to burn I looked at the bottle(packaging has no expiration) and it has an expiration of 5/2! I purchased this in late Oct/Nov 2013. What a rip off and I fear this is risky! This stuff is ON your eyes, maybe it was safe new but who knows what it does expired. If that wasn&#x27;t the expiration date then THERE ISN&#x27;T ONE, which is even worse in my opinion. Only way to get a return is to ship the stuff back, ridiculous waste of time and money. I saw no other way to contact seller. Buy at your own risk!</li>
            <li> I bought this lash enhancer  the beginning of January. I have been using it every day and I can see no real difference. The price is very good, but you&lt;br /&gt;want something that is works. Maybe one has to use it for a longer duration...but they should tell you that, on the box, in simple language.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for weeks and haven&#x27;t seen any results at all.  I think it is a scam and would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Helps with lengthening but not with volumizing. It will take a while to see a difference though. One thing that I hate about this is the fact that you have to put it on consistently to see a good results... only because I am the type to forget or get lazy. Overall, I find it to be an OKAY product... nothing too much to gush about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product work or not but when I tried it on my lashes, an hour later I my eye (left eye only) turn red. The redness lasted about 6 days...I now use it only on my eyebrows.  Afraid to use them on my lashes again &#x3D;0(</li>
            <li> I used the brow &amp; lash grow accelerator &amp; did not see any difference&lt;br /&gt;in my lashes or brows.  I just tossed it.</li>
            <li> I have about 3 weeks using this product and i have noticed a dramatically change on my eyebrows. The product makes eyebrows little darker wich i love, do not fall everytime i wash my face and have begun to grow where i wanted. Hopefully they will get fuller and thicker with time. This is a great product and will order more for sure</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually take the time to write a review, but always read reviews when looking for a product. I am a daily mascara wearer and also due to aging my eyelashes became sparse.  I have used this for 2 months now and have my lashes back! I use daily before and after applying mascara and about once a week on my brows.</li>
            <li> The eyelash accelator seems to work if you are using it. When I stopped using it I did not see any more results.  Also be sure you are not allergic to this product. I used it and there were times where my eyes irritated me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t achieve any results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now and it&#x27;s just ok.  I have noticed though that there is growth on my eyebrows but not my eyelashes.  Still waiting as I probably need to give it more time.  I will review again in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I just started using it for the last couple of days since it arrived...I guess I am seeing a bit of more eyelash and eyebrow...but still working on it...so no further rating yet.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my lashes.  I also found that if I got it in my eyes, it was uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I was also skeptical about this product. But actually it works so well. My eyelashes and eyebrows grow. And it darkens my eye.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome!</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about this but I bought it based on the ratings.  It works.  It really does.  It not only tamed my brows but created volume.  My brows were really skimpy and unbelievably, this item helped.</li>
            <li> It has been about a month since I started it&#x60;s use. They do look thicker. I am in my 50&#x60;s. I say go for it. Use it nightly .</li>
            <li> I have used other products that worked great for lengthening my lashes.  Decided to give this a try.  Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  Would not use it again</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my thin, sparse lashes.  The only product that really works is Latisse, and you need a doctor&#x27;s prescription for that. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It does what it promises and is so inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used every single day but yet have seen results! Love it!</li>
            <li> I used this product as directed buy saw absolutely no results. I was expecting to see even a little bit of improvement in my eyelashes, but saw none.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month.  I don&#x27;t always remember to put it on before bed, but even with spotty usage it does seem as if my lashes are longer.</li>
            <li> I noticed this product working within just one week of using it! It&#x27;s really amazing! My lashes were once sparse, but now they are growing thicker and longer (I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month). Have not had any negative side effects whatsoever. I will definitely continue using this product and would recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m in my fifties my eyebrows and lashes are starting to thin. I bought this product based on other recommendations but didn&#x27;t expect anywhere near the results I got.&lt;br /&gt;I saw a noticeable difference within one week. After two weeks a couple of friends asked if I was wearing false eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;I no longer have to fill in my brows with powder. My eyelashes are a little fuller but definitely longer. As a result, I&#x27;m using much less mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already recommended this to several friends and they too are happy with the results.</li>
            <li> If you want longer/thicker lashes you do not need to spend copious amounts of money.  Olive oil, does EXACTLY the same thing.  All our eyelashes needs is moisture and a little oil.  Try it you will be surprised.</li>
            <li> Nothing crazy but enough to notice more hair. The best way I would describe it would be thick eyebrows where there was already hair but not much new hair. Regardless you will notice the difference, I know my friends did. I am happy.</li>
            <li> It dosen&#x27;t  work at all ; if you need a good product for ur brows try revitabrow it is incredible ... but this product just worth the money ... not much!!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I was skeptical at first.... but talking with a few esthetician friends convinced me to give a try.  Basically all growth accelerator products are the same... the difference is the price.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ve been using this product pretty religiously for about 5 weeks now and I can definitely say I notice a difference.  My brows were well overplucked and are now rather bushy....  Need to re-shape them.  Which I can do now!  Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes aren&#x27;t &#x27;thick&#x27; as such, but they are definitely longer!  Big difference!  I used to lose lashes a lot and I&#x27;ve notice they aren&#x27;t falling out as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product is inexpensive but works well as expensive one.  I use it for Lash but I don&#x27;t apply everyday because I have some seasonal allergies already irritating my eyes and don&#x27;t want to get worse.  Using this one and two time a week and my lash is growing bit by bit.  If someone use it everyday I guess it grows fast and full.  I used other very expensive lash growth that was about $100 to $160 and I can&#x27;t tell differences with this.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 5 Because me and my sister shared this 2 pack. We loved how it made our lashes grow at least 4 inches in length  we had to trim them with the scissors we couldn&#x27;t sleep at night because they were so long. Yes  would recommend this product. (Yes Just Kidding) we love it. It really works.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how long and beautiful my eyelashes are. I got this product not expecting much out of it, but I was very dedicated to it and one day - within a week..I started seeing a little difference..then more and more..crazy. but it works. You must use it every night before bed. do not skip a day. Use it as if your life depends on it lol . every night. then...pay attention to your eyelashes ..you will see:)</li>
            <li> There is no point in thinking this is a miracle. It does not work, it turns white on your eyebrows and flakes off as if you used a cheap hairspray on them. It will NOT grow hair. Don&#x27;t believe the hype.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so bad! U can&#x27;t get much lotion on the brush and if u get it in your eyes,It&#x27;s the worse I ever used ,U get what u pay for</li>
            <li> I like this product. It took a little while for it to start working, but I love it!! Will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> I used the product as per the directions but after several weeks I still could not detect any improvement whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I always had problem my lashes falling off :( and now this is helping me grew them back &amp;#60;3 I am sooo happy :D</li>
            <li> I did not see difference in my lash growth - def. not like from Latisse! And it burned my eyes, so I trashed it.</li>
            <li> does a good job when used consistently</li>
            <li> This really does make your lashes grow! You have to keep using it though to keep the results. I use it daily before I apply mascara.</li>
            <li> This product is pleasant to use but, after several weeks, I cannot tell if it is working.  I would love my over-plucked eyebrows to grow back but I&#x27;m not sure this is doing it.  I don&#x27;t know if any product would.</li>
            <li> After several weeks of use, this product delivers as advertised. My formerly scanty eyebrows are back in full bloom and my eyes are nicely framed by thicker lashes. It does take a while and the effect is not permanent; just as hair on your falls out and is replaced, so do those in your brows and lashes. So continued use is necessary. But the end result is very nice.</li>
            <li> a couple of years ago I had individual lashes put on, they looked great and were very addictive, but after using them for a couple of months my real lashes were short, sparse and ugly.  I tried this product after reading reviews on lots of different products.  it took a month or so for my lashes to start filling out again, during which time I used strips, cause my lashes looked that bad.  I still put this on my lashes under my mascara, and can honestly say my lashes are longer than they&#x27;ve ever been before, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love using this product because not only was it not expensive, but it actually works. I have bought some of the expensive kinds of growth accelerator and it did not work half as good as this stuff. I use every night.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend and she loves it, I didn&#x27;t ask why.</li>
            <li> I have noticeable eyelash and brow growth! In my family body hair is scarce which is great, but we have almost no lash or brow. I started to see results in a little over a week and my lashes are still growing. I got two tubes but I don&#x27;t think I needed two, my first is still full. Get it today!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have grown considerably, especially in the outer and inner corners of my eyes. I even used it on my lower lashes and eyebrows. It grew those, too. For anybody who has unruly eyebrows, this also works great for taming them. As the instructions state that you have to apply it at night, I recommend not using too much on your eyelashes because my eyes started to water once I closed my eyes. If you use too much, you&#x27;ll have crust around the corners of your eyes when you wake up. As for my eyebrows, I noticed that I was getting little pimples if I used too much. I decreased the amount that I was using and the pimples went away.</li>
            <li> I always had doubts about these kinds of lash growth accelerator, but few weeks ago, I just wanted to test a product, and this one was really affordable to test. I used it less than one month, and I&#x27;ve used it almost everyday night. Then, My eyelashes got longer. I have single eye lid, so when I open my eyes, my lashes looked short because my lashes were hide into the skins. After I use this product, even though I open my eyes, my lashes doesn&#x27;t look short anymore. Try it!</li>
            <li> If you are starting to bald in the lash area this helps a lot, just don&#x27;t stress it and get it!</li>
            <li> no hace efecto como dice</li>
            <li> I really like this product and have achieved dramatic results,I will continue to use this product and will recommend anyone to use.Its only been three weeks and I am impressed!</li>
            <li> I see a difference.  This used to be available at a local retailer.  Becase There is less lash fall-out, they are langer and fuller.  This is not a false eyelash look, but a noticable change.  Great for the price.</li>
            <li> Started seeing results the THIRD DAY and today is the 4th day and it grew even more. SO GREAT. Almost bought revitalash which is about $100. SO GLAD I BOUGHT THIS INSTEAD.</li>
            <li> I accidentally trimmed part of my lashes on the left eye a few weeks ago to the point that it was difficult to hide even with mascara.  I started using this at night as directed and the lashes are already just about grown back in.  Moreover, the lashes on both eyes are fuller and longer.  I&#x27;ve also used it on my brows and notice that they are thicker and the sparse areas are filling in nicely.  I have to warn you though, do NOT get in your eyes!  It burns like crazy and takes forever to wash out.  Bottom line, I don&#x27;t need as much brow pencil or mascara now, so I will definitely keep using this product!</li>
            <li> hard to tell if this stuff really works - not sure I would order it again...the prescription stuff definitely works</li>
            <li> This is a perfect if you want thicker and longer eyebrows and eye lashes, it works. you will see results with in 2 weeks. i used everday 4 2 weeks now  use about 3 times a week to just maintain my thick long eyelashes. i will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Ever since I got this, I&#x27;v been using it every night and I notice that there is less fallout! That&#x27;s what I call a good lash conditioner.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim after reading other reviews, both good and bad. I also asked my eye doctor if these kinds of products were safe. She said yes, so I gave it a try. For $9 it was not a big risk. I used it nightly and started to notice some change after about 21/2 weeks, but now that it&#x27;s been over 4 weeks I can see a clear difference. No question, this product does what it claims to do. It filled in the gaps, made my eye lashes longer, and I even put it on my eyebrows and they have thickened up a bit too. If you&#x27;re considering purchasing this product, give it a try. It worked for me.</li>
            <li> This product has worked beyond my expectations. I tried it as my eyebrows and eyelashes had thinned out tremendously, I suppose due to stress or hormones, and after a few days I was starting to see a difference...my eyebrows and lashes are back and thick and it seems every morning when I wake up (I put it on at night)there are more of them! I can&#x27;t believe how much of a difference it has made! I don&#x27;t think my eyelashes were ever that thick or long! I look like I have mascara on when I don&#x27;t! And I love my eyebrows! This product has become one of my must-haves. And at this price...no reason to say no to it!</li>
            <li> Had my doubts because it was only three bucks versus $35 for a similar Mary Kay product. But then I broke out in a rash on face around my eyes. Threw it away.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month ever since I got my eyebrows down and the lady made them super thin :( anyways ive noticed that my brows have gotten alot thicker and darker.i have lots of little hairs that are growing in, but for the most part it seems to only enhance the parts of my eyebrow that already have hair.ive been putting it on my eyebrows every morning and night and brush it through them and then take off some of the product off the wand and spread it on the skin where i want the hairs to grow back..its definitely worth a try! i will continue to use this product, and give a beter review after giving it another month or so.</li>
            <li> Good Product but not for me, it cause my eyes to burn, but I do have an allergy to gluten so that could be the reason. Therefore I cannot judge this product in a negative way.</li>
            <li> Actually I use two coats of this every morning before mascara as a primer, for which I would say this is good for.  I did, in the past, use it for what it is meant for and yes, I do admit my lashes looked much fuller, broke off a lot less, and since I use  waterproof mascara, on occasion I dealt with lash loss.  Using this product this happens seldom if at all.  As far as growing my brows, no such luck. I can&#x27;t say it grew my lashes either, but as aforementioned there have been benefits since my beginning using this, as well as it being a great lash primer, and why I continue to buy this.  Great seller too! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Although my brows are already decent, I tried this product hoping to fill in some of the patchier bits. I have to say that it does seem to have made my brows somewhat thicker and darker. However, it&#x27;s not a miracle worker. But for the price, why not try it?</li>
            <li> Does NOT work at all..!!!!&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed ):&lt;br /&gt;Used it for about for weeks now&lt;br /&gt;and it does not work..</li>
            <li> I ordered these months ago n they worked as expected over time. It worked so well i bought them again for friends n family to use.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it daily and my eyebrows are beginning to grow, finally.  Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s age-related, but I began losing my eyebrows about a year ago.  I decided to try this gel to see if it would help the brow growth.  I&#x27;ve been using in for over a month and I can visibly see the changes in the amount of brow I have.  So happy something is finally working for me.</li>
            <li> This product seems really conditioning and is easy to apply.  I have not noticed any differences but when washing it off in the shower I can feel a sliminess.  I have a bare spot on my left eyebrow and nothing has grown since using this product every night as directed.  I will continue to use it until gone and if I notice any changes I will report them.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this on both my eye brows and lashes and it just doesnt work. Maybe it will for someone else. Ive used it every night so I was hoping to see some kind of results but nothing,</li>
            <li> Only two weeks into using it I could already notice my eyebrows were getting thicker. My lashes took longer but the tube lasts a long time, even using it on brows and lashes daily. No irritation and easy application. I will continue to use this product as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars to counteract other reviews that say it burns.  Just started using it.  I&#x27;m allergic to everything.  This doesn&#x27;t bother me.  This does keeps eyelashes them from falling out and turning into my eyes.  So far, so good!</li>
            <li> This did not work for my eyelashes. Honestly, i should have known.</li>
            <li> I started out using this just as treatment gel for night, but I liked the way it made my lashes look so I started wearing it as a clear mascara for the day as well. Or sometimes I use it as a brow gel. I can&#x27;t say that it made my lashes any longer or more voluminous, but it did make them look healthier and they fell out less so it must be doing something. Overall, worth a try!</li>
            <li> Totally recommend it. Works well when you use it exactly as directed. I used it on my eyebrows. I have two bottles</li>
            <li> I loved this product because my eyelashes grew back and I&#x27;m super happy to have my lashes back after I had lost them after removing my lash extensions.</li>
            <li> I actually use this product as a clear mascara as I have dark eyelashes already-- this works great-- the brush seperates and grooms my lashes just as I want and has added benefits !! Have been using this product for years !!</li>
            <li> With this you will see results in a few days. I noticed my lashes were starting to look longer without mascara.</li>
            <li> 07/19/13  @  6:40pm MT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with the product of the eyelash Brow &amp; Lash treatment gel, however,  I am disappointed with the Brow &amp; Lash eyelash **BRUSH** Being that I have very thin and short eyelashes, I feel that the eyelash brush is too thick and too large for my eyelashes and the gel doesn&#x27;t coat my  eyelashes the way I would like for it to, I wish the eyelash brush was smaller in size just like the RIMMEL eyelash accelerator brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if the brush was smaller I could apply the product much better to my upper and lower lashes., but being that the brush is large I&#x27;m having to coat the tip of the brush with the gel and smear it about on my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have even tried to fit my RIMMEL eyelash brush into the BROW &amp; LASH accelerator bottle but some how the smaller brush it doesn&#x27;t fit ??? hum???  Therefore I have a tendency to use the RIMMEL product more often and feel I have much more productivity with Rimmel brush &amp;  product than the Brow &amp; Lash; The Rimmel eyelash brush is much easier to use and apply the gel product.&lt;br /&gt;So with that being said I am not knocking the product, just the BRUSH.  Again do to MY much smaller and shorter eyelashes than most average length eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that in the future Brow &amp; Lash will take inconsideration to produce a much SLIMMER Lined Brush because not every women already have lengthy and or fuller eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have purchased expensive products in the past that do the same thing this item claims to do. I was wasting my money the whole time. This product works just as well as the more costly ones, if not better! I started using this for my eye brows and they grew back pretty fast. The spots where I over plucked took some time but the hair grew back! I would recommend this to anyone trying to get their brows back. It works on eyelashes too!!</li>
            <li> This actually made my eyelashes grow a little. Not only that but my eyelashes were more nourished once I started using this product. You should try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> Very effective product, definitely buying it again.</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical at first because it seemed too good to be true. But it definitely works and I&#x27;m starting to grow more lashes and they&#x27;re healthier (which is aweeeeeeeewsomeeee.) Definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re over-plucked and sparsely-lashed.</li>
            <li> The burning! I wish I could have used it but my eyes would not stop watering when I tried to wear it.</li>
            <li> Hey, I gave this 2 stars because I really don&#x27;t want to &#x27;hate&#x27; anything, but this product just didn&#x27;t work for me-- at all. I have had better results in thickening my eyebrows and growing my eyelashes with my organic grapeseed oil every night.  Don&#x27;t waste your money..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months now, on and off. When I first used it, it worked like a charm. My eyebrows grew in length and in thickness. Over time however, it didn&#x27;t grow as fast or as much. Maybe my body became used to it? Maybe I was using it too often. So, I began using it on and off. Although it does not grow extremely fast &amp; thick like when I first began using it, this product STILL WORKS. I still use it on a nightly basis and I occasionally take some time off so my skin won&#x27;t fully adjust to it. My eyebrows have grown in thickness and just looks fuller overall. You will see the difference and will want to jump for joy! I do not use it on my lashes, just my brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product does work. I will continue to use this growth gel in my nightly routine.</li>
            <li> I used this product once as directed  and my eyes flamed and turned bright red I could get rid of it fast enough I don&#x27;t really recommend putting that anywhere near your eyes. No amount of long lashes is worth that kind of worth that kind of pain. NEVER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering, yes suffering with over waxed and plucked eye brows and tinee eye lashes. This Ardell Brow &amp; lash growth accelerator is fantastic. Within the 1st week I and my husband could tell a differerence in my brows and lashes. I&#x27;ve been using it now for several months, religiously. Every nite and every morning, and some days during the day. Trust me I&#x27;ve been in cosmetics for at least 25 years. Worked at department store cosmetic counters and sold cosmetics on my own. NOTHING, NOTHING COMPARES TO THE GROWTH OF BROWS AND LASHES!!!! I RECOMMEND YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU SUFFER FROM THE SAME PROBLEM I&#x27;VE HAD FOR MANY YEARS!</li>
            <li> I used it a couple of times and it ended up in my eyes.  My eyes are dry and sensitive.  I could have been allergic to it but didn&#x27;t like the way it affected my eyes.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I have 2 freinds that swear by so Im crossing my fingers that it works So try it wiith me</li>
            <li> For some of the nay sayers...  I think some people are not waiting long enough to get visible results.  Or, are not applying enough product, often enough.  Hair takes a while to grow.  Using it for a week or 2, may not give you noticeable results.  I would give it a month, at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day, for about a month, on my brows and eye lashes.  I am finally starting to see some new hairs sprout on my over-plucked eyebrows.  Also, the existing brows are getting a little thicker.  My lashes are also a bit longer.  I apply it 2 ways on my eyelashes.  1st on the base of the lashes, using the pointy end of the brush.  Then re dipping the applicator into the tube and applying it like I would mascara. I put it on pretty thick, at night.  I think that really helps too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my brows, I rub the applicator back and forth over the eyebrow and the over plucked areas that I want to stimulate new hair growth. Then I comb the brows in place, with the applicator.  It&#x27;s a good idea to put a good amount onto the eyebrows and let them dry completely before applying eyebrow pencil.  (Not gobs and gobs, but a full application amount per eyebrow.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution:  This will burn and irritate your eyes.  Be careful when applying and don&#x27;t rub your eyes, when you are wearing it.  It burns like heck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll post more updates if I get totally thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> So far no difference. i will update in a few weeks</li>
            <li> After finally being fed up with my short and sparse lashes and my not so bushy brows, I decided to try Ardell&#x27;s brand of lash and brow. I read lots of reviews and found that this brand had the least negative. After a month of, inconsistently, using this gel I was very pleased. No more fake lashes or penciling in brows. It&#x27;s super easy to apply. It does dry and scratch if you get it in your eye. But thats easy to avoid. I didn&#x27;t apply it like mascara, instead I used the tip of the lash brush and dabbed it on the lash line. I did the top and bottom the same way and I had results on both areas. As for the brows I just brushed it on as usual. I really like this product, enough to write a review. It&#x27;s inexpensive and it does what it says, thats what I paid for!</li>
            <li> I have been tweezing my eyebrows since I was 11 years old. As a 35 year old, I have decided that I want my eyebrows to be a bit thicker, which seems to be the trend these days.  My friend, who waxes my eyebrows, mentioned this to me.  It is so easy to use, is a great value and REALLY DOES WORK (when used properly). I have not tried this on my eye lashes, brows only but I am super happy with the results! Try it out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotta say that I&#x27;m pleased with this product. I had spaces in my brows that weren&#x27;t growing back and I&#x27;ve tried other products that were unsuccessful until this one. I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to work but I continued to apply it every day and night and then it seems like over night after a couple of weeks... I had some incredible grow in my baldy areas. The most I&#x27;ve spent on brow growth was $25 for Brow Boost and that stuff didn&#x27;t do anything... but low and behold the much cheaper stuff worked so much better. Goes to show... just because something cost MORE doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that formula is any better than the cheaper stuff.</li>
            <li> I am using it to my lash in the night, I think it works because I feel my lash grew....</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping. Actually works on making your lashes and eyebrows grow quickly. No false advertisements. Would recommend to anyone trying to make their lashes or eyebrows grow.</li>
            <li> But it does not irritate my eyes and adds enough volume.  I like that it is colorless so it never smears or show up.  I don&#x27;t wear much makeup so this well for me.</li>
            <li> WOW ! For such a low cost for 2 pk  what could it hurt? I applied it everyday or night dependindung on if I remembered. Accelerator seemed like clear mascara . But let me tell you folk&#x27;s that in was around a week before I noticed the difference. Not saying when I blink my lashes touch my chin but they appear longer in a short amount of time. I just ordered another 2pk . You should try it , it;s cheap and works. One warning though if you wear contact lenses use this at night and wipe off in am before you put your lenses in. I did not and my lenses felt gritty but once I use only at night problem solved ! TRY IT !!! What do you have to lose except having longer lashes . Drug store product&#x27;s w/ mascara promising longer looking lashes are not only costly but they are  temporary .This is not it work&#x27;s it is ckear and you can apply mascara right over top of it no clunking .You too will be amazed. THANK YOU SELLER</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and have seen great results, especially in my eyebrows...for some reason my brow lashes were falling off easily and growing back slowly, as soon as I started using this product I noticed a difference...my brows are back to normal in just 3 weeks of using the product every night.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for two weeks and lashes are a bit longer and darker. Still using it and hoping to see more results.</li>
            <li> This product works if you use it everyday as directed. You will see results after a few weeks. Worth the price and the product for sure.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it. It&#x27;s cheap because it does nothing. I don&#x27;t want to buy any thing from this company again</li>
            <li> This gel is easy to use - I havent been using it for long enought to see results yet but the application is easy</li>
            <li> it was okay i guess didnt do much what it had said so yea!!!!!!!!!! i wouldnt want to try this product...........</li>
            <li> I used this for weeks and saw no difference.  I would not recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always disliked my thin eyelashes. However, I&#x27;ve mostly taken putting on makeup out of my routine and have come to face the fact that I have pretty much no eyelashes! I decided to try this product first as it was low cost. I&#x27;m not really looking to have big fake looking eyelashes, I&#x27;m really just wanting some. Enough to actually form a lash line, especially on my bottom lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference right away. Like, within the first few days. After the first couple of weeks, the bottom lashes toward my inner eye were much darker and slightly longer. The ones on my outter eye were maybe a bit darker, but still sparse. My top eyelashes bore no difference except for a slight curl caused by the mascara type brush from the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a month of using this, it did not fill in the bald spots on my lower outter eye, however they did become darker. The lashes in the lower inner eye had relatively stayed the same since the first initial weeks. My top lashes seemed slightly fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came to conclusion that all this product really does is let your lashes grow to it&#x27;s full potential. This definitely worked a lot better than other products I&#x27;ve used for a lot more money. I would recommend this to someone who already has beautiful lashes and wants to maintain them or someone that maybe tried extensions or for whatever reason has lost lashes. However, I&#x27;m part Asian and that wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was going for. I want to have eyelashes where genetics neglected to give and not be embarrassed that my boyfriend has better eyelashes than I do. My search continues, yet this product was decent and a good price and I&#x27;ll most likely come back to it one day.</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of two. This is the second brand of lash growth I have used. Works great and with the precision combs causes for little mess.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than purchasing from the store, plus you get two! This is a great deal and a great product!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for almost 3 months now and it is definitely making my lashes thicker than longer But I can still take that. It takes a while though. I will order other ones and I will rate also. I am getting married and I want my lashes to look fabulous!!</li>
            <li> maybe it works as a  &#x27;conditioner&#x27;? , and I have been using it on lashes and brows.  But don&#x27;t see any difference after three months of continued use on either brows or lashes.  I&#x27;ve used lash growth accelerators in the past that have worked, especially Revitalash, but the original formula is no longer available (probably for good reason!) so i&#x27;ve been looking for a good replacement for both brows and lashes.  For me, this was not it.</li>
            <li> I saw no difference after using this product. I guess you get what you pay for and maybe it&#x27;ll work for you.</li>
