            <li>Does not smell like Lily of the Valley, but Ok</li>
            <li>Yardley of london products have been a favorite of mine since childhood.</li>
            <li>Smell is pleasant , but very old-fashioned.</li>
            <li>I love the light refreshing spray.</li>
            <li>I will use it up because it&#x27;s a clean scent, and has a touch of the flower I love.</li>

            <li> I do like the scent of this, but it doesn&#x27;t give me the feeling of being in a field of lily of the valley like some other products do.</li>

            <li> But there is so little flower scent in this spray.</li>
            <li> nasty smelling stuff, sickeningly sweet</li>
            <li> This is not genuine Yardley and it stinks like rotten lilacs.</li>
            <li> MAYBE THE GOVERNMENT COULD USE THIS FOR SOME SECRET WEAPON, YIKES</li>
            <li> The body spray smells very bad.</li>

            <li> Like it. Quality is good. Price is high, could be less.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Lily of the Valley and had high hopes for this body spray. But there is so little flower scent in this spray.The sweetness is gone, and it smells more masculine than feminine. Very synthetic scent, and very weak in general. I will use it up because it&#x27;s a clean scent, and has a touch of the flower I love. But I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I do like the scent of this, but it doesn&#x27;t give me the feeling of being in a field of lily of the valley like some other products do.</li>
            <li> bought it for my mother-in-law who is from England. It did the trick, it reminded her of her home land.</li>
            <li> Have bought this same item multiple times.Does not seem to be available for a cheaper price anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;Scent is a bit faint and will not last if you are going to sweat profusely.&lt;br /&gt;OK, for a trip while on a brief shopping trip.</li>

            <li> Does not smell anything like Lily of the Valley.  I decided to donate it to the staff bathroom at work.</li>
            <li> If I can find almost anything that smells like lilies of the valley, I will buy it. This is the furthest aroma from my favorite flower that I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Unless my &amp;#34;snifter&amp;#34; has had a major melt down I rate not even one star!!!</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get the old time floral scent my Mother used to wear but it is not.  I am using it as an air freshenr in the bath</li>
