    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have bought this product at Target and it was the best wax i had ever used.</li>
            <li>Like an epilator, sugar waxing seems to work best on hair that is between 1/4\\&quot; -- 1/2\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I bought this from a bricks-and-mortar store and it was the best product I&#x27;d ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many!  </li>
            <li>It has a nice scent; and best of all, it&#x27;s water soluble</li>
            <li>After about 15 seconds in the microwave (full container) and a thorough stir with one of the sticks, it goes from unusable to warm and wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfying.</li>
            <li>This wax is amazing.</li>
            <li>best product of it&#x27;s kind from the few we tried&lt;br /&gt;ease to apply, use and give the best results.</li>
            <li>so you can just scrub it off with warm water (like when I dripped a bit on the tile</li>
            <li>But I cut some of my own (from \\&quot;interfacing\\&quot; fabric--anything non-stretchy will do) and now always have plenty.  </li>
            <li>and I like not worrying about having to warm up the wax before use.</li>
            <li>Even though I didn’t know what I was doing, I was able to get a fair amount of hair.</li>
            <li>Once I learned how to use the product, I totally loved it way more than competitors (Nair wax strips, etc).</li>
            <li>I use Veet warm sugar wax now.</li>
            <li>The product smells good, and washes off easily in the shower.</li>
            <li>I wish it comes with more clothe tho.</li>
            <li>it changes the texture and eventually you won&#x27;t be able to use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found that the thinner you put the wax on the better it works.  </li>
            <li>anything more</li>
            <li>Like many people mentioned, I found that heating the wax slightly in the microwave gave awesome results.</li>
            <li>and this product has worked best out of all the other depilatory and waxes i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Once heated, it spreads on easily (in the direction of hair growth, like they tell you).  </li>
            <li>It really is so easy to use</li>
            <li>But, that&#x27;s the great thing about sugar wax - you can do the same area more than once</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to remove.</li>
            <li>soluble/ makes clean-up easy.</li>
            <li>You can wash and reuse the strips really easily -</li>
            <li>It literally pulls one hair out at a time, at that rate sensitive skin or not you&#x27;re going to have a reaction to all the irritation needed for this product to be successful.</li>
            <li>and I use a hot moist paper towel to be sure there is no sticky stuff around the top of the container or on the threads of the cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the hair is too long, spreading the wax might pull and hurt a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Overall - loved it!</li>
            <li>I have a strong feeling that whoever sells this just uses the real product for themselves and then makes their own &amp;#34;sugar wax&amp;#34; at home.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product for the area</li>
            <li>Clean up is ridiculously easy.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t spread it in the direction of hair growth, smooth the strips over it in the direction of hair growth and pull up in one swift stroke, it probably won&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it is easy to clean up.  </li>
            <li>It smelled good and most of the time I only had to go over the area once.</li>
            <li>the best part is the redness subsides in literally like 15 minutes and your skin goes back to normal!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;d loved the idea of it being natural, good for sensitive skin (which I do have), and my favorite: it can wash off easily, but I didn&#x27;t know if it can really put out hair as efficiently.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super easy cleanup, I reuse the popsicle sticks and wax strips as well.</li>
            <li>When I was about to run out, I was so excited to find it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Also when I put it under hot water to loosen the wax, a lot of watery liquid was up top.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about it is that it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>(in a cool place w/ no sunlight and after opening) the honey starts to chemically break apart</li>
            <li>you get it just right, this product works just as well as regular rosin wax, but is a lot gentler on the skin, cleans up easily, and smells nice too.</li>
            <li>To be fair, it smells just like the last jar I bought from a real store.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s when the fun began.</li>
            <li>As far as at home waxing kits - this has been my favorite experience.</li>
            <li>and i rarely have any ingrown hairs or irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the idea of all natural</li>
            <li>This wax product was a clear/translucent golden color.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the thing with this wax - I agree with other reviewers that the one I purchased originally from Target was the most fantastic waxing experience I&#x27;ve ever had - easy on, easy off, not too painful, very effective (though I did warm it up in the microwave for 15 seconds to get easier &amp;#34;spreadability&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>After reading the rest of the reviews I wanted to try it for myself and everyone was right.  </li>
            <li>I made extra strips from some cheap cotton fabric, and they were easy to rinse out and reuse.</li>
            <li>The clean up is very easy compared to other waxes.</li>
            <li>I liked the original formula because the risk of burns is low, it grabs hair pretty well, and can be washed off easily unlike other brands.</li>
            <li>(or I think you could put the container in a hot (not boiling) water bath), stirring in between and keeping watch on the consistency not to overdo it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most likely not.</li>
            <li>I can make this myself and probably get similar to better results.</li>
            <li>This one did not have a safety seal, and the texture seemed just as runny as the first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of different waxing kits for the bikini area, because I find that its always better at preventing ingrown</li>
            <li>This is my first experience waxing</li>
            <li>/&gt;i heat my container in a hot bowl of water.</li>
            <li>If the cover sticks run it under hot water and</li>
            <li>Also the larger your application stick is the better</li>
            <li>I wish I would have just got the hot wax.</li>
            <li>waxing kit was superior for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>I tried it straight out of the container without heating first.</li>
            <li>But now, after a lot more practice I can’t even pick up a single hair.</li>
            <li>You do have to warm it up to get it to remove even a little hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to melt it before I use this product.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t hurt that much.</li>
            <li>When I first bought the product a year ago, I was new to waxing.</li>
            <li>So I was so excited when I saw this at my local target.</li>
            <li>I tried spreading more wax, I tried spreading less wax, and I tried leaving the strip on for longer.</li>
            <li>If you are using this product for a brazilian wax i&#x27;ve found that for the &amp;#34;hard to get areas&amp;#34; the less you make your skin taunt, the more hair will come off.</li>
            <li>I usually love all Shea Moisture products,  but this one seems to be a dud especially for finer facial hair.</li>
            <li>but I highly suggest that if you&#x27;re going to buy this product from Amazon, don&#x27;t buy it from this seller.</li>
            <li>It is certainly more time consuming than shaving, and can take a little practice.</li>
            <li>also worked really well at pulling up nearly all of the hair, but</li>
            <li>It’s gentler on skin, smells nice, doesn&#x27;t leave much residue behind</li>
            <li>washes off ok but was not effective in pulling out that much hair.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this brand of wax at my local target about a year ago.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this product since I&#x27;m a big fan of other Shea Moisture products.  </li>
            <li>It is hard when you first open the container, but if you just put a glop on the area you&#x27;re going to use it on and let it sit for a minute or two (while you watch tv or something) it will soften up and you can spread it more easily.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I wish I can go to the salon every month and get it done professionally</li>
            <li>I got an old batch.</li>
            <li>The ONLY negative is that I usually need some more muslin strips and the sticks for spreading the wax break really easily but that doesn&#x27;t bother me because I just bought some extra muslin for cheap and some thick applicator sticks also for cheap.</li>
            <li>main reason i love this product is that it hurts considerably less (almost nothing) than any other wax product.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m finished i always take a hot paper towel and wipe off the inside of the cover and the outside of the container, that seems to help it not stick the next time you use</li>
            <li>found if I pulled the fabric strip off very quickly and firmly after following the instructions, it got virtually all of the hair.</li>
            <li>The only difference was the second jar was very grainy---I could see the sugar.</li>
            <li>even with other methods of hair removal, all the hair never comes off the first try.</li>
            <li>I ordered three, and two were the same clear/translucent gold color and worked fantastic, the third was a dark opaque brown color that didn&#x27;t work whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>it barely got any hairs.</li>
            <li>I will be returning this product and going back to my old wax.</li>
            <li>This is an organic natural based formula and b/c of that it seems to be different, from the way you apply, to the way you pull it off.  </li>
            <li>If your skin is sensitive then only apply once!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even warmed up, I could barely even get it out of the container to spread on my legs, and when I did, all that came up after I ripped the strip off was the wax itself.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I kept the container in a pan of hot water to soften it slightly.  </li>
            <li>I had intended to save the other jar for when I ran out, but since the first jar didn’t work I decided to check the second.</li>
            <li>It honestly isn&#x27;t even really that painful, and</li>
            <li>The all natural ingredients are friendly and provide a non irritating wax.</li>
            <li>But for me it hurt less than an epilator, which pulls out the hairs more slowly, and gave similar results--smooth skin that lasts for weeks until the hair grows back soft and fine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very easy to use and leaves soooooo much hair after.  </li>
            <li>it says to not put too much or too little.</li>

            <li> found if I pulled the fabric strip off very quickly and firmly after following the instructions, it got virtually all of the hair.</li>
            <li> The only difference was the second jar was very grainy---I could see the sugar.</li>
            <li> even with other methods of hair removal, all the hair never comes off the first try.</li>
            <li> I ordered three, and two were the same clear/translucent gold color and worked fantastic, the third was a dark opaque brown color that didn&#x27;t work whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> it barely got any hairs.</li>
            <li> I will be returning this product and going back to my old wax.</li>
            <li> This is an organic natural based formula and b/c of that it seems to be different, from the way you apply, to the way you pull it off.  </li>
            <li> If your skin is sensitive then only apply once!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even warmed up, I could barely even get it out of the container to spread on my legs, and when I did, all that came up after I ripped the strip off was the wax itself.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I kept the container in a pan of hot water to soften it slightly.  </li>
            <li> I had intended to save the other jar for when I ran out, but since the first jar didn’t work I decided to check the second.</li>
            <li> It honestly isn&#x27;t even really that painful, and</li>
            <li> The all natural ingredients are friendly and provide a non irritating wax.</li>
            <li> But for me it hurt less than an epilator, which pulls out the hairs more slowly, and gave similar results--smooth skin that lasts for weeks until the hair grows back soft and fine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very easy to use and leaves soooooo much hair after.  </li>
            <li> it says to not put too much or too little.</li>
            <li> However, now that I finally ran out of my other supply and cracked this one open, I find that it is completely defective - it doesn&#x27;t even spread on your skin, and it doesn&#x27;t lift the hairs out.  </li>
            <li> So I ordered three directly from the company website and ALL THREE were the dark opaque brown that didn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> The only difference is that this product is totally different from all the other wax products out there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  I have used this stuff numerous times and still like it a lot but have discovered that you have to be careful NOT TO OVERHEAT it or the composition changes (it turns cloudy) and no longer works</li>
            <li> I’m a long time user of this brand.</li>
            <li> The other had a safety seal that was not actually attached to the jar.</li>
            <li> Less than other at home kits definitely, but also less than professional jobs.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> Long story short it took me an hour and half to wax the front of both my lower legs.</li>
            <li> only complaint initially was that the box doesn&#x27;t come with enough strips.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the last batch I had, which was roughly the consistency of caramel, this stuff is very thin, like the consistency of cough syrup or fresh honey.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It tingles some, but in my experience (using it for legs, bikini line, and face) it is less than with actual (petroleum-based) wax strips.  </li>
            <li> It would be less time consuming to pluck each individual hair of your body than use this product.</li>
            <li> I’m not really worried that someone was using the product before me, since the strips and sticks were wrapped in plastic, but it did make me wonder.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few times with different amounts of wax bc</li>
            <li> I had to tweeze a few individual strands, but it was excellent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wax just wasn’t thick enough or sticky enough.</li>
            <li> skin is so dry and just life less after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again.</li>
            <li> On the up side, pulling it off didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad as I expected and the wax cleaned off of me and the strips easily.</li>
            <li> (The only exceptions were on tricky contours like my knees--still not sure how to do those.)</li>
            <li> The irritation that i&#x27;ve had from other products is obsolete when using shea&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li> (Just be *very careful* not to overdo, or you will burn your skin--it can be hotter than you think.)  </li>
            <li> Ill pay extra for the sensitive wax.</li>
            <li> I actually like this product a lot, despite the (mostly) negative reviews.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> It has natural ingredients and is non irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> I hate that I did not try it in time to be able to return it.  </li>
            <li> (E.g., for leg hair: spread the wax going down, press on a fabric strip going down, and pull off swiftly from the bottom pulling up.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of the reviewers on here mentioned the honey breaks down after 6 months, so</li>
            <li> (this doesn&#x27;t mean that you make a larger area</li>
            <li> Then you press on a fabric strip (rubbing firmly); and pull it off swiftly (in the other direction).  </li>
            <li> so I get MUCH less skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> I only use this on my stomach (weird I know, I guess we all have different hair problems and mine</li>
            <li> Trying to spread the cold wax is a nightmare of epic proportions and was more painful than pulling it off.</li>
            <li> The pain wasn&#x27;t so bad, it is a quick \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; and then the pain is gone.</li>
            <li> The container was messy and it did not have the smell or consistency of the one i bought at Target</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about waxing is how sticky and messy it is.</li>
            <li> I even waited a few minutes and figured after awhile</li>
            <li> I tried a few test strips the way I always have before, but nothing came up.</li>
            <li> A lot of wax was left behind.</li>
            <li> A few notes:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Getting it to spread thinly and evenly is definitely the hardest part and took a bit of finesse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure how well it would work on leg hair or other areas!</li>
            <li> I get these random bumps that hurt so bad just by touching them</li>
            <li> This product is usually a 10, and this is a zero.  </li>
            <li> Ive tried making homemade sugar wax (pinterest recipe) NUMEROUS times and always failed, so I bought this on a whim.</li>
            <li> I’m not sure</li>
            <li> This isn’t usually how I apply it, but I figured I’d try it.</li>
            <li> After this failed I tried heating it like I usually do, and the results were the same as before.</li>
            <li> but I bought this, tried it hot cold, room temperature, rubbed it on my legs, tried it thin, thick, ever which way</li>
            <li> if I received a bad batch, a new formula, or if someone added something to stretch the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very hard out of the container and kinda messy.</li>
            <li> , I have periodically had a hard time getting the cover off (as mentioned by another reviewer), but 10 seconds in the microwave (with the cover on) solved that,</li>
            <li> The idea of another woman waxing me is hard to get by.</li>
            <li> the hard to get areas</li>
            <li> This wax is an utter disappointment as it doesn&#x27;t pull any hair at all.</li>
            <li> and I really hope the company doesn’t give me any grief because they’ve been opened.</li>
            <li> Here I went spreading this thick goppy concoction.</li>
            <li> Seriously to get it off was the hard part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve learned that microwaving honey in general is a bad idea.</li>
            <li> No good.  </li>
            <li> is not a good waxing kit for those who don&#x27;t already have lots of experience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not a good product at all.</li>
            <li> Utterly ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened to this seller&#x27;s batch - if it was a bad batch or shipped/stored poorly, or what, but it does not at all function like this product usually functions.  </li>
            <li> It is completely useless.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, target has stopped selling it</li>
            <li> Its really completely useless.</li>
            <li> and I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> It does not go on cold at all.  </li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t remove any hair at all when it&#x27;s cold.  </li>
            <li> Its impossible to spread and doesn&#x27;t pull out any hair.</li>
            <li> I got so frustrated I decided on day 6 to just try it.</li>
            <li> It seems like they might have reformulated or I received a bad batch because the product I received did not work at all!</li>
            <li> However this product is terrible.  </li>
            <li> This is a terrible product!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have a strong feeling that whoever sells this just uses the real product for themselves and then makes their own &amp;#34;sugar wax&amp;#34; at home. I have bought this product at Target and it was the best wax i had ever used. It smelled good and most of the time I only had to go over the area once. I can&#x27;t even call what I got a wax. I&#x27;ve been waxing for 6 years now and i know how to do it. The container was messy and it did not have the smell or consistency of the one i bought at Target and it hurt a lot.  I don&#x27;t know that they sell it there anymore but I highly suggest that if you&#x27;re going to buy this product from Amazon, don&#x27;t buy it from this seller.</li>
            <li> No matter what the directions say, this waxing product must be heated **slightly**(see update)!  After about 15 seconds in the microwave (full container) and a thorough stir with one of the sticks, it goes from unusable to warm and wonderful.  (Just be *very careful* not to overdo, or you will burn your skin--it can be hotter than you think.)  Once heated, it spreads on easily (in the direction of hair growth, like they tell you).  Then you press on a fabric strip (rubbing firmly); and pull it off swiftly (in the other direction).  (E.g., for leg hair: spread the wax going down, press on a fabric strip going down, and pull off swiftly from the bottom pulling up.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tingles some, but in my experience (using it for legs, bikini line, and face) it is less than with actual (petroleum-based) wax strips.  This sugar wax stuff seems to have some conditioning ingredients so I get MUCH less skin irritation.  I also use their \\&quot;Elixir\\&quot; spray (and rub in after); and I have no bumps, irritation, or itching (which I also used to get sometimes by shaving).  It has a nice scent; and best of all, it&#x27;s water soluble so you can just scrub it off with warm water (like when I dripped a bit on the tile floor.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint initially was that the box doesn&#x27;t come with enough strips.  But I cut some of my own (from \\&quot;interfacing\\&quot; fabric--anything non-stretchy will do) and now always have plenty.  (Actually, since it is water-soluble, you could wash them off and reuse if you were so inclined.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I have used this stuff numerous times and still like it a lot but have discovered that you have to be careful NOT TO OVERHEAT it or the composition changes (it turns cloudy) and no longer works (i.e., doesn&#x27;t remove any hair, and doesn&#x27;t stick to the fabric strips well).  I had to pitch some that my teenage daughter ruined...  So I use very short bursts in the microwave (5-15 seconds) (or I think you could put the container in a hot (not boiling) water bath), stirring in between and keeping watch on the consistency not to overdo it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have periodically had a hard time getting the cover off (as mentioned by another reviewer), but 10 seconds in the microwave (with the cover on) solved that, and I use a hot moist paper towel to be sure there is no sticky stuff around the top of the container or on the threads of the cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you get it just right, this product works just as well as regular rosin wax, but is a lot gentler on the skin, cleans up easily, and smells nice too. HTH.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my legs as an alternative to using an epilator. It is certainly more time consuming than shaving, and can take a little practice. But for me it hurt less than an epilator, which pulls out the hairs more slowly, and gave similar results--smooth skin that lasts for weeks until the hair grows back soft and fine.&lt;br /&gt;I found if I pulled the fabric strip off very quickly and firmly after following the instructions, it got virtually all of the hair. Very satisfying. (The only exceptions were on tricky contours like my knees--still not sure how to do those.) Like an epilator, sugar waxing seems to work best on hair that is between 1/4\\&quot; -- 1/2\\&quot; long.&lt;br /&gt;I kept the container in a pan of hot water to soften it slightly.  I made extra strips from some cheap cotton fabric, and they were easy to rinse out and reuse. The product smells good, and washes off easily in the shower.</li>
            <li> This wax is amazing. It has natural ingredients and is non irritating to my skin. It really is so easy to use and I like not worrying about having to warm up the wax before use. The ONLY negative is that I usually need some more muslin strips and the sticks for spreading the wax break really easily but that doesn&#x27;t bother me because I just bought some extra muslin for cheap and some thick applicator sticks also for cheap. I cannot be without this wax - and if you take some advil about an hour before you wax there is virtually no pain.</li>
            <li> I bought this from a bricks-and-mortar store and it was the best product I&#x27;d ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many!  When I was about to run out, I was so excited to find it here on Amazon.  However, now that I finally ran out of my other supply and cracked this one open, I find that it is completely defective - it doesn&#x27;t even spread on your skin, and it doesn&#x27;t lift the hairs out.  I don&#x27;t know what happened to this seller&#x27;s batch - if it was a bad batch or shipped/stored poorly, or what, but it does not at all function like this product usually functions.  This product is usually a 10, and this is a zero.  Truly.  It is completely useless.  I hate that I did not try it in time to be able to return it.  What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and find another brand to use. It would be less time consuming to pluck each individual hair of your body than use this product. I&#x27;ve tried everything from warming it up to using muslin strips and countless things in between to make this work. Nothing! It literally pulls one hair out at a time, at that rate sensitive skin or not you&#x27;re going to have a reaction to all the irritation needed for this product to be successful. I wish I could find my receipt to return this product.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to melt it before I use this product. The clean up is very easy compared to other waxes. I wish it comes with more clothe tho.</li>
            <li> For me shaving is traumatizing, every time after I shave I get these random bumps that hurt so bad just by touching them and omg the itching when the hair grows back. So I&#x27;d considered waxing. I wish I can go to the salon every month and get it done professionally but 1) I&#x27;m a college student 2) The idea of another woman waxing me is hard to get by. So I tried waxing myself. The pain wasn&#x27;t so bad, it is a quick \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; and then the pain is gone. What I don&#x27;t like about waxing is how sticky and messy it is. Seriously to get it off was the hard part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I came upon sugar waxing. Honestly, I&#x27;d loved the idea of it being natural, good for sensitive skin (which I do have), and my favorite: it can wash off easily, but I didn&#x27;t know if it can really put out hair as efficiently. So while I was at Target I saw this product and decided to give it a go. I&#x27;m going to say this product is in between because it did pull out the hair. Not all the hair at once, but even with other methods of hair removal, all the hair never comes off the first try. However, I wasn&#x27;t feeling the strips that was included. Also when I put it under hot water to loosen the wax, a lot of watery liquid was up top. I even waited a few minutes and figured after awhile that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s going to be. Will I give up on sugar waxing? No. Will I buy this product again? Most likely not. I can make this myself and probably get similar to better results.</li>
            <li> I actually like this product a lot, despite the (mostly) negative reviews. BUT, I do think it depends on where you are waxing. I only use this on my stomach (weird I know, I guess we all have different hair problems and mine just seems to be there, shaving doesn&#x27;t cut it!) and this product has worked best out of all the other depilatory and waxes i&#x27;ve tried. Ive tried making homemade sugar wax (pinterest recipe) NUMEROUS times and always failed, so I bought this on a whim. The all natural ingredients are friendly and provide a non irritating wax. It honestly isn&#x27;t even really that painful, and the best part is the redness subsides in literally like 15 minutes and your skin goes back to normal! Since it&#x27;s water soluble it&#x27;s super easy cleanup, I reuse the popsicle sticks and wax strips as well. The only downside I&#x27;ve found is that sometimes it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair and you have to go over the same area a couple times. But, that&#x27;s the great thing about sugar wax - you can do the same area more than once and it won&#x27;t get irritated. Overall, great product for the area I&#x27;m waxing but I&#x27;m not sure how well it would work on leg hair or other areas!</li>
            <li> Summary: I’m a long time user of this brand. I&#x27;ve bought it in store but never online. It seems like they might have reformulated or I received a bad batch because the product I received did not work at all! I bought two jars and am returning them for a refund.  I first bought this brand of wax at my local target about a year ago. Since then I’ve gone through two containers of it. Like many people mentioned, I found that heating the wax slightly in the microwave gave awesome results. I liked the original formula because the risk of burns is low, it grabs hair pretty well, and can be washed off easily unlike other brands. Unfortunately, target has stopped selling it so I had to buy it online.  The jars are not individually wrapped, and the boxes are not wrapped in plastic. One of the jars I bought did not have a safety seal. The other had a safety seal that was not actually attached to the jar. I’m not really worried that someone was using the product before me, since the strips and sticks were wrapped in plastic, but it did make me wonder.  I’m not sure if I received a bad batch, a new formula, or if someone added something to stretch the product. One of the reviewers on here mentioned the honey breaks down after 6 months, so it’s possible I got an old batch. To be fair, it smells just like the last jar I bought from a real store. However, the texture is completely different! Unlike the last batch I had, which was roughly the consistency of caramel, this stuff is very thin, like the consistency of cough syrup or fresh honey.  Since it was so spreadable I tried it straight out of the container without heating first. This isn’t usually how I apply it, but I figured I’d try it. I tried a few test strips the way I always have before, but nothing came up. A lot of wax was left behind. The wax just wasn’t thick enough or sticky enough. I tried spreading more wax, I tried spreading less wax, and I tried leaving the strip on for longer. Nothing worked. It wasn’t grabbing anything. After this failed I tried heating it like I usually do, and the results were the same as before. All I was left with was sticky, hairy skin.  I had intended to save the other jar for when I ran out, but since the first jar didn’t work I decided to check the second. This one did not have a safety seal, and the texture seemed just as runny as the first. The only difference was the second jar was very grainy---I could see the sugar. No good.  When I first bought the product a year ago, I was new to waxing. Even though I didn’t know what I was doing, I was able to get a fair amount of hair. Once I learned how to use the product, I totally loved it way more than competitors (Nair wax strips, etc). It’s gentler on skin, smells nice, doesn&#x27;t leave much residue behind and it&#x27;s easy to remove. But now, after a lot more practice I can’t even pick up a single hair. If you can find it in a store, try it out, but don&#x27;t buy it online! I’m returning these and I really hope the company doesn’t give me any grief because they’ve been opened.</li>
            <li> best product of it&#x27;s kind from the few we tried&lt;br /&gt;ease to apply, use and give the best results.</li>
            <li> So I was so excited when I saw this at my local target. Decided to give it a chance. I shld have returned it when I couldn&#x27;t open the jar. Got it open and that&#x27;s when the fun began. It was like tar! Took me forever to get the wax to loosen up. So I waited. 5 days. I waited for the wax to loosen? To melt? I have no clue. I got so frustrated I decided on day 6 to just try it. Here I went spreading this thick goppy concoction. Long story short it took me an hour and half to wax the front of both my lower legs. Only reason I had to stop? I ran out of strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is so dry and just life less after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again. Going back to my local wax spot. Ill pay extra for the sensitive wax.</li>
            <li> This wax is an utter disappointment as it doesn&#x27;t pull any hair at all. The only good thing about it is that it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I tried waxing... it barely got any hairs. I tried a few times with different amounts of wax bc it says to not put too much or too little. It&#x27;s also very hard out of the container and kinda messy. I&#x27;ve been self-waxing for years. I&#x27;m sticking with my regular sugar wax. I gave it an extra star because it&#x27;s water soluble/ makes clean-up easy.</li>
            <li> As far as at home waxing kits - this has been my favorite experience. I&#x27;ve used a lot of different waxing kits for the bikini area, because I find that its always better at preventing ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;This waxing kit was superior for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. You don&#x27;t have to heat it up.&lt;br /&gt;2. It smells delicious.&lt;br /&gt;3. It really doesn&#x27;t hurt that much. Less than other at home kits definitely, but also less than professional jobs.&lt;br /&gt;4. It gets up like 98% of the hair. I didn&#x27;t have to do any double passes with the wax. I had to tweeze a few individual strands, but it was excellent.&lt;br /&gt;5. Clean up is ridiculously easy. You can wash and reuse the strips really easily - the wax just washes away with water.&lt;br /&gt; A few notes:&lt;br /&gt; It is hard when you first open the container, but if you just put a glop on the area you&#x27;re going to use it on and let it sit for a minute or two (while you watch tv or something) it will soften up and you can spread it more easily.&lt;br /&gt;This is not a good waxing kit for those who don&#x27;t already have lots of experience. Getting it to spread thinly and evenly is definitely the hardest part and took a bit of finesse.&lt;br /&gt;It also worked really well at pulling up nearly all of the hair, but if you don&#x27;t spread it in the direction of hair growth, smooth the strips over it in the direction of hair growth and pull up in one swift stroke, it probably won&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;If the hair is too long, spreading the wax might pull and hurt a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Overall - loved it! Definitely suggest it!</li>
            <li> washes off ok but was not effective in pulling out that much hair.  I use Veet warm sugar wax now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very easy to use and leaves soooooo much hair after.  After reading the rest of the reviews I wanted to try it for myself and everyone was right.  You do have to warm it up to get it to remove even a little hair.  It does not go on cold at all.  it won&#x27;t remove any hair at all when it&#x27;s cold.  It&#x27;s just not a good product at all.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product since I&#x27;m a big fan of other Shea Moisture products.  However this product is terrible.  Its impossible to spread and doesn&#x27;t pull out any hair. Its really completely useless. On the plus side, it is easy to clean up.  I will be returning this product and going back to my old wax.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience waxing and I am not impressed. Trying to spread the cold wax is a nightmare of epic proportions and was more painful than pulling it off. I broke two sticks just trying to get the stuff out of the jar. On the up side, pulling it off didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad as I expected and the wax cleaned off of me and the strips easily. Nevertheless, I&#x27;ll be trying something different next time.</li>
            <li> I have been waxing my bikini area for years now and have used every form of wax that i could find. This one out does them all! The only difference is that this product is totally different from all the other wax products out there.  This is an organic natural based formula and b/c of that it seems to be different, from the way you apply, to the way you pull it off.  This product does take some time to get used too but once you do you&#x27;ll never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason i love this product is that it hurts considerably less (almost nothing) than any other wax product.  I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s b/c you&#x27;re not supposed to heat this up. The irritation that i&#x27;ve had from other products is obsolete when using shea&#x27;s products.  i&#x27;ve even used their &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; elixirs from their spray to their cream and i rarely have any ingrown hairs or irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i heat my container in a hot bowl of water. One user said to microwave it but i&#x27;ve learned that microwaving honey in general is a bad idea. it changes the texture and eventually you won&#x27;t be able to use it. If the cover sticks run it under hot water and it unsticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i&#x27;m finished i always take a hot paper towel and wipe off the inside of the cover and the outside of the container, that seems to help it not stick the next time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that the thinner you put the wax on the better it works.  Also the larger your application stick is the better (this doesn&#x27;t mean that you make a larger area though)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you make your skin taunt before you rip off the wax paper you will get 99% - 100% of the hair.  If you are using this product for a brazilian wax i&#x27;ve found that for the &amp;#34;hard to get areas&amp;#34; the less you make your skin taunt, the more hair will come off. (i have no idea why this is the case but i&#x27;ve tested it out enough to know this works in my case)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the hard to get areas you can apply up to 2x! anything more and you will irritate the skin! If your skin is sensitive then only apply once!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve noticed that after about 6 months of storage (in a cool place w/ no sunlight and after opening) the honey starts to chemically break apart and you have to throw it out.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product!  It does not work. I usually love all Shea Moisture products,  but this one seems to be a dud especially for finer facial hair. I wish I would have just got the hot wax.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy something else. I love the idea of all natural but I bought this, tried it hot cold, room temperature, rubbed it on my legs, tried it thin, thick, ever which way and it only ever lifts JUST THE WAX off the skin or it takes out two hairs. Utterly ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the thing with this wax - I agree with other reviewers that the one I purchased originally from Target was the most fantastic waxing experience I&#x27;ve ever had - easy on, easy off, not too painful, very effective (though I did warm it up in the microwave for 15 seconds to get easier &amp;#34;spreadability&amp;#34;).  This wax product was a clear/translucent golden color.  Then Target stopped selling it, so I found it on Amazon.  I ordered three, and two were the same clear/translucent gold color and worked fantastic, the third was a dark opaque brown color that didn&#x27;t work whatsoever.  Even warmed up, I could barely even get it out of the container to spread on my legs, and when I did, all that came up after I ripped the strip off was the wax itself.  So I ordered three directly from the company website and ALL THREE were the dark opaque brown that didn&#x27;t work at all.  I emailed their customer service department for a refund or exchange, TWICE, and they NEVER responded at all.  So personally, I will never order any of their products again.  DO NOT BUY - it&#x27;s not worth it. I think they&#x27;re just offloading their defective batches.</li>
