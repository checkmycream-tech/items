            <li>Best that I have found yet.</li>
            <li>And, I am especially pleased because it is listed with PETA as a product that does not test on animals (although it does not have the &amp;#34;bunny&amp;#34; symbol for being against animal cruelty/testing.  </li>
            <li>So happy that Amazon carries it!</li>
            <li>Great price!</li>
            <li>Still the best on the market.  </li>
            <li>great product for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>I had heard that pureology made great hair products.</li>
            <li>And they look great.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t over-powering.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved these products for years as I have fine hair and the products are perfect for that.</li>
            <li>It smells good and not too flowery.</li>
            <li>This size is good for travel</li>
            <li>So happy to know Amazon had it on hand and love the convenience of ordering.  </li>
            <li>Pureology is a great hair product that is eco friendly and my hair loves it!</li>
            <li>Servvice was great &amp; Pureology products readily available at a good price.</li>
            <li>I love the Purelogy Volume products!</li>
            <li>This is the exact definition of my hair type, and the conditioner is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a lot more volume as well!  </li>
            <li>Will buy again that is for sure!</li>
            <li>whole Pureology line is great!</li>
            <li>This stuff is so good for my fine color treated hair.</li>
            <li>I have used it for many years for my color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I will keep alternating with another conditioner i have when I feel I need a more hydrating conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love them.....</li>
            <li>Keeps it healthy and shiny and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>good for it also...leaves it healthy and can use everyday...</li>
            <li>works very well on my fine thinning hair....</li>
            <li>While it worked better than some conditioners I have used, I have gotten the same results with Pantene conditioner at a quarter of the cost.</li>
            <li>I feel that this is a good conditioner, but for the price I have also found a few other ones that I feel actually do a better job for my hair type.  </li>
            <li>Easy way to shop for items I use daily.</li>
            <li>Quality non toxic conditioner and great for thin hair.</li>
            <li>And I really like them....</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s not the real thing</li>
            <li>While it did make my hair fluffier, it also left static in my hair, and the short hairs on my part-line stood up straight.  </li>
            <li>As long as it&#x27;s animal friendly, I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Even though this was much more expensive than the conditioner I had been buying at Costco, I decided to try it because it was on an online list of highly rated conditioners for fine, color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft!  </li>
            <li>I tried this conditioner because it came highly recommended for fine thin hair.  </li>

            <li> product that I&#x27;ve used in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was only average in preventing snarls.</li>
            <li> I get no volume in my fine hair and it is dirty within two days.</li>
            <li> so thin hair needs a lightweight shampoo and conditioner for volume and this, paired with the shampoo is FANTASIC.</li>
            <li> It gives my thin hair a lot of bounce.</li>

            <li> Best that I have found yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I love it.  It does what it says - adds volume.  It has a pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t over-powering.  I also use the shampoo.

            <li> This size is good for travel and I&#x27;ll soon be getting the big shower size.  I&#x27;ve loved these products for years as I have fine hair and the products are perfect for that.</li>
            <li> Have used this shampoo and conditioner before and like the smell and the way my hair feels after.  So happy to know Amazon had it on hand and love the convenience of ordering.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I feel that this is a good conditioner, but for the price I have also found a few other ones that I feel actually do a better job for my hair type.  I will keep alternating with another conditioner i have when I feel I need a more hydrating conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is the exact definition of my hair type, and the conditioner is wonderful.  I will say the picture was a bit misleading, I thought the bottle would be bigger.  But, no worries, I&#x27;ll be back!</li>
            <li> I had heard that pureology made great hair products. I get no volume in my fine hair and it is dirty within two days.</li>

            <li> Great price! Will buy again along with shampoo!~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best product that I&#x27;ve used in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole Pureology line is great!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft!  I have noticed a lot more volume as well!  Will buy again that is for sure!</li>
            <li> Still the best on the market.  Would recommend this and the shampoo to anyone.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s not the real thing</li>
