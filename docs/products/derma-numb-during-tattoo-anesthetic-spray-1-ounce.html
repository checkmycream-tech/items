            <li>Works great, we use it at the pediatrician&#x27;s office when our babies need shots or blood drawn.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great for burns also.</li>
            <li>You have to spray it AFTER the initial lines are done for the best results.  </li>
            <li>Vasocane worked vastly better.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Makes things much more comfortable</li>
            <li>For me it was worth the money!</li>
            <li>The reason why I gave one star is because it got here quickly</li>
            <li>Total rip off for sure!</li>
            <li>Used it on my ditch which is one of the more sensitive areas to get tattooed.</li>
            <li>I have yet to have any success on trying to get this to work</li>
            <li>This is the first numbing agent I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>It does exactly as it says on the bottle</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>Ended up using the whole bottle with no results.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it during the tattoo process, but I sprayed it on immediately after when the tattoo was finished and was really burning.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Had gotten a new tattoo and this did absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>Works great takes a few mins to start but lasts for quite a long time.</li>
            <li>Did not dull the pain or anything else!</li>
            <li>It took the pain completely away and has also helped with the itchiness as it heals.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not tattoing though, I use it as a skin deadener for hair removal in sensitive spots.</li>
            <li>I like the natural ingredients in this product.  </li>
            <li>The real draw back is the cost of the product.  </li>
            <li>I am a professional, licensed tattoo artist.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for products to not only make my clients more comfortable during truly painful procedures, but that will also make my job easier.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I have to dermaroll quickly over my face to let the product get in there to numb it before I go full throttle.  </li>

            <li> But when your getting a tattoo on sensitive areas any little bit of relief works.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DULL THE PAIN.  </li>
            <li> It does not completely negate the pain of rolling</li>
            <li> It helped a little but did not last very long.</li>
            <li> did not do as expected</li>
            <li> It tingles a bit and does burn a little if you get it in your eyes</li>
            <li> Wouldnt try again.it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> dont buy it waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tattooing for 5 years &amp; am heavily tattooed myself.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all, waste of money!</li>
            <li> The people that say it didnt work either don&#x27;t know what they are doing or ordered this product from a bootleg distributor.</li>
            <li> Just remember the skin has to be broken for it to work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if im doing something wrong</li>
            <li> I use it to numb my arms when I go for a blood test</li>
            <li> Didnt numb at all.</li>
            <li> Derma numb is a life saver when you are having a prolonged tattoo session.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t numb anything.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I do a lot of tattooing and you always get those customers that have to wine and this seems to help ease the pain i dont know if it actually works or they just think it does i personally have never used it</li>
            <li> My wife tried this for a tattoo she was getting. It helped a little but did not last very long.</li>
            <li> the two people i used it on could not tell i used it .. i dont know if it worked</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all, waste of money!</li>
            <li> Works great! I use it to numb my arms when I go for a blood test</li>
            <li> The people that say it didnt work either don&#x27;t know what they are doing or ordered this product from a bootleg distributor. Used it on my ditch which is one of the more sensitive areas to get tattooed. Order this from the actually company instead of individual sellers. This stuff works great.</li>
            <li> Works great for cuts also</li>
            <li> Worked great for my husband. Just remember the skin has to be broken for it to work. So this is used after the tattoo is started.</li>
            <li> Works great, we use it at the pediatrician&#x27;s office when our babies need shots or blood drawn. Babies don&#x27;t feel a thing! Great product.</li>
            <li> did not do as expected....felt no numbing.</li>
            <li> Didnt numb at all. Ended up using the whole bottle with no results. Wouldnt try again.it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> does not work at all.  tried it on akl body parts. no numbing whatsoever.  horrible product.  dont buy it waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is only 1% lidocaine, your doctor can write a prescription for stronger topical application. Save your money, unless placebo effect is desired.</li>
            <li> I have yet to have any success on trying to get this to work I don&#x27;t know if im doing something wrong but it has yet to work.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews that said that this spray did not help with the pain of a tattoo at all.  I didn&#x27;t use it during the tattoo process, but I sprayed it on immediately after when the tattoo was finished and was really burning.  It took the pain completely away and has also helped with the itchiness as it heals.  For me it was worth the money!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. I&#x27;m not tattoing though, I use it as a skin deadener for hair removal in sensitive spots. Makes things much more comfortable</li>
            <li> Does not work... thanks</li>
            <li> Derma numb is a life saver when you are having a prolonged tattoo session.  You have to spray it AFTER the initial lines are done for the best results.  That way the lido gets into the skin where the nerves are.</li>
            <li> I was doing a cover up at my inside arm, and after suffering for 3 hours, the tattoo guy sprayed that over my tattoo..... did not feel a thing anymore!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this a couple of times, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference for epilation. I know that it&#x27;s meant for use with tattoos, and I might still use it for that - so I will update it if it works for that.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much! perfect!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and felt no numbness.  I extended the period of contact for 20 minutes at 5 minute intervals and still did not feel numbness.  It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product works for my purposes which is not tattooing but derma-rolling. I like the natural ingredients in this product.  It does work within 90 seconds.  Sometimes I have to dermaroll quickly over my face to let the product get in there to numb it before I go full throttle.  It does not completely negate the pain of rolling but it takes the edge off.  It tingles a bit and does burn a little if you get it in your eyes (obviously) This is the first numbing agent I&#x27;ve ever used so I have nothing to compare it to.  The real draw back is the cost of the product.  I bought it for $15 for 1oz. ouch! but it seems to be lasting. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I am a professional, licensed tattoo artist. I&#x27;ve been tattooing for 5 years &amp; am heavily tattooed myself. I am always looking for products to not only make my clients more comfortable during truly painful procedures, but that will also make my job easier.This product does NOT work. I tried it on several clients, my husband &amp; even while tattooing myself. It does NOTHING. Vasocane worked vastly better.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t numb anything.</li>
            <li> Had gotten a new tattoo and this did absolutely nothing! Did not dull the pain or anything else! Total rip off for sure!</li>
            <li> It does exactly as it says on the bottle</li>
            <li> Works great takes a few mins to start but lasts for quite a long time. Great for burns also. Love it</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave one star is because it got here quickly but when it did the box was destroyed and so was everything else in the box. When I got the box inside in it looked like. A bomb went off so I am unhappy</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DULL THE PAIN.  IT WAS SPRAYED ON AFTER THE OUTLINE HAD BEEN COMPLETED AND LEFT ON FOR 90-120 SECONDS.  NOTHING!!!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to work. It doesn&#x27;t completely numb the tattoo. But when your getting a tattoo on sensitive areas any little bit of relief works.</li>
