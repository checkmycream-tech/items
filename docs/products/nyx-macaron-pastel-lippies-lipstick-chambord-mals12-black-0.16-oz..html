            <li>and I received many awesome reactions</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not as good as lime crime.</li>
            <li>The packing was good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so smooth and great pigmentation!</li>
            <li>good, but not a lot of staying power</li>
            <li>Great qualify for the price , I love nyx</li>

            <li>The product is lovely!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>This lipstick is creamy and glides on nicely.</li>
            <li>My wife liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>the color is nice, not too glossy.</li>
            <li>The color is really nice though</li>
            <li>Affordable and nice color payoff.</li>
            <li>Super matte, and just beautiful</li>
            <li>Love love love it!  </li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>Love it just what I was looking for</li>
            <li>Cute</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li>but It&#x27;s definitely the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I just love this lipstick.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good and</li>
            <li>works AMAZING doesn&#x27;t have the oily feel that a lot of black lipsticks do and it stays on wonderfully but is easy to remove and doesn&#x27;t stain</li>
            <li>Because it is so creamy it does not stain and comes off easily on silver wear while eating, most don&#x27;t easily come off</li>
            <li>Other than that it looks great!!!!</li>
            <li>I just wish it didn&#x27;t come off so easily.</li>
            <li>I love bold and daring makeup looks</li>
            <li>goes on super opaque!</li>
            <li>I was so excited for this, but the lipstick was a bit blotchy closer to my inner lip, beautiful lipstick otherwise.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and even and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>So smooth.</li>
            <li>Smears off very easily and is very oily</li>
            <li>This is the perfect black!!</li>
            <li>Just pair it with the black berry lip liner from nyx and ur good to go !</li>
            <li>It stays on perfectly fine with the right lip liner and it isn&#x27;t too greasy looking.</li>
            <li>But I love it so much that I have to do a review here.</li>
            <li>Absolutely just love this lipstick</li>
            <li>Wonderful pigmented color for a cheap lipstick, even compared to the other colors in the same line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s black, what&#x27;s not to love?!!</li>
            <li>but it was worth it</li>
            <li>They have a black lipstick called Penelope under another line of NYX, and although that one is cheaper, this one has better coverage and consistency. :)</li>
            <li>My husband loves it when I dress in goth makeup ;)</li>
            <li>Pretty color</li>
            <li>Great quality and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>but it is just what I wanted nice creamy and dark works for me</li>
            <li>Lipstick was nice and dark.</li>
            <li>It came much faster than when it said it would</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t go on very well...</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>very nice slightly too dry !</li>
            <li>My favorite black lipstick</li>
            <li>And better than no name brands that sells black lipstick.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into more of a matte finish layer black liner, apply a couple coats of lipstick and blot.</li>
            <li>it last for a long time and i have full lips!!</li>
            <li>My favorite black lipstick!</li>
            <li>It dries my lips out fast and doesn&#x27;t  last long on my lips, but other than that, its cool.</li>
            <li>Lining first also gives you a deeper black.</li>
            <li>Not sure about how it compares to other black lipsticks, but I think this is a really good option.</li>
            <li>Takes a couple of times to get it dark enough, but that wasn&#x27;t really a problem.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on for a long time</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t glide on, but it&#x27;s possible to achieve an even colored black lip.</li>
            <li> just add black eyeshadow to your lip and it will last all night</li>
            <li> but I expected that with such a dark color.</li>
            <li> Now it does wipe off when you drink something, but i sort of expected that.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this shade at first, but the compliments I received on Halloween erased them all...</li>
            <li> stays dark and vampy</li>
            <li> I just started getting into dark lips for the fall</li>
            <li> Color is indeed black.</li>
            <li> The black is NOT blotchy or tacky.</li>
            <li> I like how black it is, however It does come off</li>
            <li> Black is in.</li>
            <li> it takes a few layers to get it really dark</li>
            <li> Little smuggy and a little gray</li>
            <li> Gud color, but messy gets in mouth</li>
            <li> Very black and thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to make a lipstick that doesn&#x27;t unless it&#x27;s a lip stain.</li>

            <li> very nice slightly too dry !</li>
            <li> it was really great! goes on super opaque!♥♥♥</li>
            <li> You will need to moisturize your lips before and after usage. Other than that it looks great!!!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good and the color is nice, not too glossy.Takes a couple of times to get it dark enough, but that wasn&#x27;t really a problem. It doesn&#x27;t stay on for a long time and I had to reapply every so often, but It&#x27;s definitely the best I&#x27;ve tried. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Good product, kids liked it</li>
            <li> I like how black it is, however It does come off and you have to reapply sometimes.</li>
            <li> I just love this lipstick.  Black is in.</li>
            <li> Great lipstick! I got this about a day ago and wore it for a night out and it looked great. Now it does wipe off when you drink something, but i sort of expected that. It&#x27;s hard to make a lipstick that doesn&#x27;t unless it&#x27;s a lip stain. Definitely will buy this again when I run out of the one I have now.</li>
            <li> Used for a Homestuck cosplay. Stayed on very well, I had to reapply a few times but I expected that with such a dark color. Lipstick was nice and dark. I would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s NYX, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Gud color, but messy gets in mouth</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on at all, had to reapply multiple times in one hour before I just ended up taking it off. The color is really nice though</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this, but the lipstick was a bit blotchy closer to my inner lip, beautiful lipstick otherwise.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend said \\&quot;it&#x27;s kinda s***ty\\&quot;. Girls you read it here.</li>
            <li> I just started getting into dark lips for the fall and this is lipstick definitely a great way to try out it takes a few layers to get it really dark but it was worth it and I received many awesome reactions</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! It&#x27;s so smooth and great pigmentation!</li>
            <li> good, but not a lot of staying power</li>
            <li> Affordable and nice color payoff. If you&#x27;re into more of a matte finish layer black liner, apply a couple coats of lipstick and blot. Lining first also gives you a deeper black.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect black!! it last for a long time and i have full lips!! Creamy look and feel, definitely purchasing again!!</li>
