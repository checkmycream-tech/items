            <li>Very easy to measure for recipes.  </li>
            <li>I was lead to this listing by a blog mom who has a tendency towards healthy items and found this spectacular price.</li>
            <li>I read that this is healthy salt or one of the healthiest and this is why we chose this kind.</li>
            <li>Bag re-seals very securely.</li>
            <li>but I am confident in my purchase.</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>This product is ok</li>
            <li>Love this Himalayan salt</li>
            <li>Tastes so much better.</li>
            <li>Everything I&#x27;ve read says that the Himalayan salt is better for you</li>
            <li>Satisfied in every way.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this salt.</li>
            <li>I love this salt.</li>
            <li>My favorite salt to use in the kitchen.</li>
            <li>much better than the grocery store.</li>
            <li>I love this salt and this company.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find this source.</li>
            <li>I hand-grind mine in a mortar with a pestle if I want it very finely ground to mix easily in recipes..</li>
            <li>It is &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; but works just fine and is so much more healthy than the salt I&#x27;ve used all of my life.  </li>
            <li>Grain isn&#x27;t quite as fine as I&#x27;d thought it would be, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>The grind is fine (I wouldn&#x27;t all it extra fine) but as it is, it&#x27;s perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>We love this salt, and enjoy using it in all our cooking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good item and reasonable prices.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>This fine grind is perfect for cooking...not to mention the mineral health derived from Himalayan pink sea salt.</li>
            <li>Purchase made easy online.  </li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>X-fine is easy to use on dishes.</li>
            <li>so it is easy to not overdo.</li>
            <li>I like the fine grind it has.  </li>
            <li>It is fine ground like advertised.</li>
            <li>It,s finely ground</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize this salt was so fine when I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>I think the price is okay, 2 pounds is a lot of salt, so it will last a good while, and it comes out of a salt shaker just fine.  </li>
            <li>This salt has a very prounced aftertaste, the kind you find with cheap table salt.  </li>
            <li>but once I tasted it I realised why it&#x27;s such a great price.</li>
            <li>It has a very rich flavor and it&#x27;s pretty too!</li>
            <li>It is not only attractive to look at, my family loves when I use it in my cooking.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this on meats and veggies.  </li>
            <li>, so I was happy to see this price although I know it&#x27;s not the same</li>
            <li>Use this salt for everything, i enjoy cooking alot.</li>
            <li>It is superfine</li>
            <li>I want to make sure I use the right kinds of salts.</li>
            <li>We all concluded we will create our own spice blends, we like French sea salt better than New Zealand, Salish is an acquired taste, and we all loved the Himalayan.  </li>
            <li>I have braces and often need to rinse my mouth with salt water, this by far is the best and gives me instant relief.</li>
            <li>one of the many reasons people pay so much for it.</li>
            <li>even regular sea salt is not as good tasting.  </li>
            <li>Healthy and natural and easy to use while cooking</li>
            <li>And ever since switching to the Himalayan salt, I love the mild flavor so much</li>
            <li>Nice fine grind, fits in all regular shakers</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Because it is not the real super fantastic pink salt that I have come to love.</li>
            <li>Some of us love salt, some are normal.  </li>
            <li>The grind is exactly what they said and I could not be happier!</li>
            <li>Himalayan salt offers a healthier more flavorful alternative to processed salts.</li>
            <li>We need more products like this look up Dr. Mercola on YouTube on this vital nutrient.</li>
            <li>Taste-wise, I dont know the difference, but I just like it, and know it&#x27;s a healthy, natural salt.</li>
            <li>Again, the aftertaste is very strong, something you NEVER taste with the genuine Himalayan pink salt-</li>
            <li>Taste just as good as any other table salt.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy detoxifying soaks with a high volume of this salt in the tub.</li>
            <li>Much more exciting than regular sea salt.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who likes the taste of Himalayan sea salt which we do very much.</li>
            <li>So much better than regular salt.  </li>
            <li>interested in health?  </li>
            <li>First tried this in Ireland and when I got home ordered some and since then</li>
            <li>it is healtly for you and comes highly recommened by many medical and herbal drs</li>
            <li>Since getting this I no longer keep the pure chemical table salt in my house.</li>
            <li>Ground fine enough to use in a salt shaker.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell this is a top quality product and works great in shakers due to small size of granules.</li>
            <li>I really like the taste of this salt over table salt.</li>
            <li>we could see and defintely taste that this wasn&#x27;t the real stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love pink salt.  </li>
            <li>Really like this salt.  </li>
            <li>, if you put too much, it gets too salty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has a flover that really complement what ever&lt;</li>
            <li>Love it, great taste, just way too expensive, get it cheaper at a local store.</li>
            <li>I really like this salt.</li>
            <li>I am sure there are other benfits</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this was caused by Customs but there was a large puncture hole in the middle of the box that went right into the salt bag spilling the contents of the bag into the box making it unusable.</li>
            <li>Order came quickly and I think this salt will last me almost six months!  </li>
            <li>high quality Himalayan salt.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>High quality salt, I would recommend</li>
            <li>Pure, natural and what your body needs.</li>
            <li>I made some up for my daughter and it&#x27;s really helped clear her face up.</li>
            <li>Love that this is an all natural salt and that pink Himalayan salt naturally has iodine.</li>
            <li>I use a very restricted salt diet, and a very small amount of this salt is better flavor.</li>
            <li>I filled my salt shakers with this and got rid of all other salt!</li>
            <li>If you put it in a dressing to sit for few hours, then it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t ground as finely as salt from a round box, so doesn&#x27;t go through the salt shaker nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>its naturally tasty .</li>
            <li>I also appreciate the purity and natural source without any additives.</li>
            <li>I like natural foods</li>
            <li>We all thought the Himalayan was the saltiest salt ever, a little goes a long way, and the fine ground was much easier to use at the table.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to be afraid of using it unlike the traditional table salt that has nothing good!</li>
            <li>Sure, ordinary table salt is vastly cheaper</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasing taste and it goes a long way</li>
            <li>A more pale color that some of the other pink salts I&#x27;ve tried, but it still has the distinct flavor I look for.</li>
            <li>If I still lived there I wouldn&#x27;t be trying to buy my pink salt online and ending up with this mess! :))</li>
            <li>I have barely put a dent in 2 lbs of salt</li>
            <li>Not to mention, of course, this salt is millions of years old, so you avoid the current water pollution out there across the globe....</li>
            <li>Very tasty pink salt.</li>
            <li>What I do know is that several of us (8 adults) had a &amp;#34;salt tasting&amp;#34;, including French and New Zealand sea salt, Salish smoked salt and a couple of salt/spice blends.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this salt, it&#x27;s highly nourishing, and relatively inexpensive compared to other natural salts on the market.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea if claims of special minerals or any other &amp;#34;nutritional&amp;#34; silly ideas about this salt are true.  </li>

            <li> so it is easy to not overdo.</li>
            <li> I like the fine grind it has.  </li>
            <li> It is fine ground like advertised.</li>
            <li> It,s finely ground</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this salt was so fine when I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> I think the price is okay, 2 pounds is a lot of salt, so it will last a good while, and it comes out of a salt shaker just fine.  </li>
            <li> This salt has a very prounced aftertaste, the kind you find with cheap table salt.  </li>
            <li> but once I tasted it I realised why it&#x27;s such a great price.</li>
            <li> It has a very rich flavor and it&#x27;s pretty too!</li>
            <li> It is not only attractive to look at, my family loves when I use it in my cooking.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this on meats and veggies.  </li>
            <li> , so I was happy to see this price although I know it&#x27;s not the same</li>
            <li> Use this salt for everything, i enjoy cooking alot.</li>
            <li> It is superfine</li>
            <li> I want to make sure I use the right kinds of salts.</li>
            <li> We all concluded we will create our own spice blends, we like French sea salt better than New Zealand, Salish is an acquired taste, and we all loved the Himalayan.  </li>
            <li> I have braces and often need to rinse my mouth with salt water, this by far is the best and gives me instant relief.</li>
            <li> one of the many reasons people pay so much for it.</li>
            <li> even regular sea salt is not as good tasting.  </li>
            <li> Healthy and natural and easy to use while cooking</li>
            <li> And ever since switching to the Himalayan salt, I love the mild flavor so much</li>
            <li> Nice fine grind, fits in all regular shakers</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Because it is not the real super fantastic pink salt that I have come to love.</li>
            <li> Some of us love salt, some are normal.  </li>
            <li> The grind is exactly what they said and I could not be happier!</li>
            <li> Himalayan salt offers a healthier more flavorful alternative to processed salts.</li>
            <li> We need more products like this look up Dr. Mercola on YouTube on this vital nutrient.</li>
            <li> Taste-wise, I dont know the difference, but I just like it, and know it&#x27;s a healthy, natural salt.</li>
            <li> Again, the aftertaste is very strong, something you NEVER taste with the genuine Himalayan pink salt-</li>
            <li> Taste just as good as any other table salt.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy detoxifying soaks with a high volume of this salt in the tub.</li>
            <li> Much more exciting than regular sea salt.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who likes the taste of Himalayan sea salt which we do very much.</li>
            <li> So much better than regular salt.  </li>
            <li> interested in health?  </li>
            <li> First tried this in Ireland and when I got home ordered some and since then</li>
            <li> it is healtly for you and comes highly recommened by many medical and herbal drs</li>
            <li> Since getting this I no longer keep the pure chemical table salt in my house.</li>
            <li> Ground fine enough to use in a salt shaker.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell this is a top quality product and works great in shakers due to small size of granules.</li>
            <li> I really like the taste of this salt over table salt.</li>
            <li> we could see and defintely taste that this wasn&#x27;t the real stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love pink salt.  </li>
            <li> Really like this salt.  </li>
            <li> , if you put too much, it gets too salty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has a flover that really complement what ever&lt;</li>
            <li> Love it, great taste, just way too expensive, get it cheaper at a local store.</li>
            <li> I really like this salt.</li>
            <li> I am sure there are other benfits</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this was caused by Customs but there was a large puncture hole in the middle of the box that went right into the salt bag spilling the contents of the bag into the box making it unusable.</li>
            <li> Order came quickly and I think this salt will last me almost six months!  </li>
            <li> high quality Himalayan salt.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> High quality salt, I would recommend</li>
            <li> Pure, natural and what your body needs.</li>
            <li> I made some up for my daughter and it&#x27;s really helped clear her face up.</li>
            <li> Love that this is an all natural salt and that pink Himalayan salt naturally has iodine.</li>
            <li> I use a very restricted salt diet, and a very small amount of this salt is better flavor.</li>
            <li> I filled my salt shakers with this and got rid of all other salt!</li>
            <li> If you put it in a dressing to sit for few hours, then it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t ground as finely as salt from a round box, so doesn&#x27;t go through the salt shaker nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> its naturally tasty .</li>
            <li> I also appreciate the purity and natural source without any additives.</li>
            <li> I like natural foods</li>
            <li> We all thought the Himalayan was the saltiest salt ever, a little goes a long way, and the fine ground was much easier to use at the table.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to be afraid of using it unlike the traditional table salt that has nothing good!</li>
            <li> Sure, ordinary table salt is vastly cheaper</li>
            <li> It has a very pleasing taste and it goes a long way</li>
            <li> A more pale color that some of the other pink salts I&#x27;ve tried, but it still has the distinct flavor I look for.</li>
            <li> If I still lived there I wouldn&#x27;t be trying to buy my pink salt online and ending up with this mess! :))</li>
            <li> I have barely put a dent in 2 lbs of salt</li>
            <li> Not to mention, of course, this salt is millions of years old, so you avoid the current water pollution out there across the globe....</li>
            <li> Very tasty pink salt.</li>
            <li> What I do know is that several of us (8 adults) had a &amp;#34;salt tasting&amp;#34;, including French and New Zealand sea salt, Salish smoked salt and a couple of salt/spice blends.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this salt, it&#x27;s highly nourishing, and relatively inexpensive compared to other natural salts on the market.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea if claims of special minerals or any other &amp;#34;nutritional&amp;#34; silly ideas about this salt are true.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the granulars must be a tiny bit bigger, doesn&#x27;t come out of my salt shaker as well.</li>
            <li> Occasionally find some tiny hard grains, but not often.</li>
            <li> I clicked on what I&#x27;ve been ordering for a long time from Spice Lab, this is NOT IT!!!</li>
            <li> &amp; you do have to be careful</li>
            <li> I always use pink salt.  </li>
            <li> We concluded that it must be a very small amount of pink salt added in for color and mixed with regular table and sea salt.</li>
            <li> I hate any other kind of salt --</li>
            <li> However, when you eat other things that aren&#x27;t prepared with the pink salt, you can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to ordinary refined table salt.</li>
            <li> Of course a person shouldn&#x27;t over due it like anything.</li>
            <li> I took this bag over to my sister who had the real pink salt.  </li>
            <li> my blood pressure went down after using this salt in my cooking and on my plate</li>
            <li> Others cost an average of $10.00 for 10 ounces, this is less than $10.00 for a 2 pound bulk size.  </li>
            <li> so you use less salt.</li>
            <li> and it does have a bitter after taste!!!</li>
            <li> Also, is seems to taste extremely briney!!</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> This salt is an everyday staple in our home.</li>
            <li> I think the salt is not a good quality as it doesn&#x27;t dissolve all in the water there is still pink crystal sediment every time I used it</li>
            <li> The shipping costs were excessive, but it is a heavy product.</li>
            <li> I was a little leery after one negative review</li>
            <li> I find that I also use less of it because of all the subtle layers of flavors that it adds to my foods.</li>
            <li> This is NOT x fine ground ground that ive been getting!</li>
            <li> At least it helps your blood pressure and doesn&#x27;t work against your health.</li>
            <li> I try to avoid using it in cold meals, such as salads because it does not dissolve well.</li>
            <li> &amp; it was expensive (around $55).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was lead to this listing by a blog mom who has a tendency towards healthy items and found this spectacular price. I was a little leery after one negative review but I am confident in my purchase. Himalayan salt offers a healthier more flavorful alternative to processed salts. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like the taste of this salt over table salt. My only complaint is that the granulars must be a tiny bit bigger, doesn&#x27;t come out of my salt shaker as well. But I can&#x27;t imagine going back to table salt.</li>
            <li> This fine grind is perfect for cooking...not to mention the mineral health derived from Himalayan pink sea salt. Best way to assure you get the trace minerals your body needs</li>
            <li> high quality Himalayan salt.  I have purchased this time over and over from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Great price but once I tasted it I realised why it&#x27;s such a great price. Because it is not the real super fantastic pink salt that I have come to love. This salt has a very prounced aftertaste, the kind you find with cheap table salt.  I took this bag over to my sister who had the real pink salt.  Side by side we could see and defintely taste that this wasn&#x27;t the real stuff.  We concluded that it must be a very small amount of pink salt added in for color and mixed with regular table and sea salt. Again, the aftertaste is very strong, something you NEVER taste with the genuine Himalayan pink salt- one of the many reasons people pay so much for it. And this defintely ISN&#x27;T it.       (FYI- In San Francisco, Rainbow Grocery has it for a great price in the bulk section.  If I still lived there I wouldn&#x27;t be trying to buy my pink salt online and ending up with this mess! :))</li>
            <li> I think the salt is not a good quality as it doesn&#x27;t dissolve all in the water there is still pink crystal sediment every time I used it</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this salt, it&#x27;s highly nourishing, and relatively inexpensive compared to other natural salts on the market.  Others cost an average of $10.00 for 10 ounces, this is less than $10.00 for a 2 pound bulk size.  It adds a great flavor to food, and beverages.</li>
            <li> Great product with a wonderful flavor and it is supposed to be good for us as well.  Just love it.</li>
            <li> This product is ok but I found a great salt mined in the USA, so I will no longer purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I love this salt! It has a very rich flavor and it&#x27;s pretty too! Actually, when you use it you don&#x27;t notice the color. I can recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.  So much better than regular salt.  Purchase made easy online.  Will get it again when I need it</li>
            <li> I love pink salt.  I haven&#x27;t touched regular salt in years.  This is some of the best I&#x27;ve found.  Great price too.  I like the fine grind it has.  Very easy to measure for recipes.  I keep it in a bamboo salt box and never have an issue with moisture in it.</li>
            <li> my blood pressure went down after using this salt in my cooking and on my plate</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, lots of minerals comes in a medium fine grit so you use less salt.</li>
            <li> Himalayan Crystal salt it the only salt that I will buy from now on.  It is delicious and very healthy for you.  I will never go back to ordinary refined table salt. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than Sea Salt! I filled my salt shakers with this and got rid of all other salt!</li>
            <li> Love this Himalayan salt</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this was caused by Customs but there was a large puncture hole in the middle of the box that went right into the salt bag spilling the contents of the bag into the box making it unusable. Couldn&#x27;t say if the salt was good or not. What a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I am sure there are other benfits but I like it because it looks so nice in the shaker!  I also comes in a great resealable package.</li>
            <li> Good price on quality item....</li>
            <li> Best condiment I&#x27;ve ever had!!!!</li>
            <li> Order came quickly and I think this salt will last me almost six months!  The grind is exactly what they said and I could not be happier!</li>
            <li> I now use this for the majority of my cooking.  It is not only attractive to look at, my family loves when I use it in my cooking.  I have barely put a dent in 2 lbs of salt and I cook almost every day.</li>
            <li> Great healthy and tasting alternative to table salt. Tastes so much better. Healthy and natural and easy to use while cooking</li>
            <li> I bought this salt for facials and table salt. I absolutely love it! Great taste and it does awesome for a saltwater spray to help with acne. I made some up for my daughter and it&#x27;s really helped clear her face up. Would recommend to everyone and when I run out I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that you have supplied a product that is better than most pharmaceutical medicines. At least it helps your blood pressure and doesn&#x27;t work against your health. Back when it was being formed the people of that day weren&#x27;t trying to make alimony payments. We need more products like this look up Dr. Mercola on YouTube on this vital nutrient.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly. Good tasting salt. Occasionally find some tiny hard grains, but not often. Grain isn&#x27;t quite as fine as I&#x27;d thought it would be, but it&#x27;s okay. Bag re-seals very securely.</li>
            <li> Excellent salt, and good price. We love this salt, and enjoy using it in all our cooking. Taste-wise, I dont know the difference, but I just like it, and know it&#x27;s a healthy, natural salt.</li>
            <li> I needed to make up capsules for the &amp;#34;Salt/C+ Protocol&amp;#34; (see Amazon for the book by that title), and it is working beautifully.  I was very excited to find this source.</li>
            <li> interested in health?  Gotta try this salt - it tastes so good and it&#x27;s so healthy!  It has minerals you don&#x27;t get otherwise.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if claims of special minerals or any other &amp;#34;nutritional&amp;#34; silly ideas about this salt are true.  It&#x27;s salt.  It&#x27;s not a health food.  What I do know is that several of us (8 adults) had a &amp;#34;salt tasting&amp;#34;, including French and New Zealand sea salt, Salish smoked salt and a couple of salt/spice blends.  Some of us love salt, some are normal.  We all concluded we will create our own spice blends, we like French sea salt better than New Zealand, Salish is an acquired taste, and we all loved the Himalayan.  We all thought the Himalayan was the saltiest salt ever, a little goes a long way, and the fine ground was much easier to use at the table.  I think the price is okay, 2 pounds is a lot of salt, so it will last a good while, and it comes out of a salt shaker just fine.  All any of us tasted was salt, no aftertaste (but then, I don&#x27;t get an aftertaste from any salt, of any type or brand) and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Really like this salt.  I really enjoy using this on meats and veggies.  Tastes fuller than the regular table salt.  Arrived quickly.  Thanks for the great service!</li>
            <li> Everything I&#x27;ve read says that the Himalayan salt is better for you so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  Guess what?  It tastes just like salt.  I&#x27;m going to continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> It is great for cooking. I try to avoid using it in cold meals, such as salads because it does not dissolve well. If you put it in a dressing to sit for few hours, then it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I got this for the mineral content of the sea salt, and it&#x27;s beautiful. Much more exciting than regular sea salt. Satisfied in every way.</li>
            <li> Pure, natural and what your body needs.</li>
            <li> This salt is pinker than the usual salt, more iron than the usual HP salt. good product. The shipping costs were excessive, but it is a heavy product.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Taste good. Meet my expectation.  Will buy again and recommend to friends and family.  Thank you for this product.</li>
            <li> I want to make sure I use the right kinds of salts. and their is a different taste in the salts. great product!</li>
            <li> We use nothing else!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought Himalayan salt before (50 lbs.) &amp; it was expensive (around $55)., so I was happy to see this price although I know it&#x27;s not the same size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is nice. I like the taste &amp; you do have to be careful, if you put too much, it gets too salty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Once I tried this on recommendation I have never gone back to white proccessed salt This has a flover that really complement what ever&lt;br /&gt;foods yo eat. Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I read that this is healthy salt or one of the healthiest and this is why we chose this kind. X-fine is easy to use on dishes.</li>
            <li> The grind is fine (I wouldn&#x27;t all it extra fine) but as it is, it&#x27;s perfect for me.  And ever since switching to the Himalayan salt, I love the mild flavor so much I hate any other kind of salt -- even regular sea salt is not as good tasting.  Not to mention, of course, this salt is millions of years old, so you avoid the current water pollution out there across the globe....</li>
            <li> Love it, great taste, just way too expensive, get it cheaper at a local store.</li>
            <li> I love this salt. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Excellent item, quick shipping, we recommend!</li>
            <li> if you are going to use salt, this is the way to go. it is healtly for you and comes highly recommened by many medical and herbal drs</li>
            <li> I read lots of reviews on different salts and then realized its just salt and ended up buying this. I use it and it tastes good and looks good. Good value for the 2 pound bag.</li>
            <li> Sure, ordinary table salt is vastly cheaper but so is it&#x27;s taste. Once you taste Himalayan Crystal Salt you will NEVER want to use regular table salt again.I find that I also use less of it because of all the subtle layers of flavors that it adds to my foods. A wonderful product!</li>
            <li> This salt is an everyday staple in our home. We will never go back to regular table salt again!! Repeat customer!</li>
            <li> Awesome, love the finely ground! Surpassed my expectations in taste, will definitely buy again! Would/will reccomend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I like it! its naturally tasty .</li>
            <li> it is very good.fast and excellent</li>
            <li> This is NOT x fine ground ground that ive been getting! What happened??? Tastes ehh ok I don&#x27;t understand what happened! I clicked on what I&#x27;ve been ordering for a long time from Spice Lab, this is NOT IT!!! and it does have a bitter after taste!!! What gives??????????</li>
            <li> This tastes great sprinkled on cantaloupe or watermelon. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the taste of Himalayan sea salt which we do very much. It is fine ground like advertised.</li>
            <li> Product is even ground, amazingly flavorful. I use a very restricted salt diet, and a very small amount of this salt is better flavor. I also appreciate the purity and natural source without any additives.</li>
            <li> Use this salt for everything, i enjoy cooking alot. I have braces and often need to rinse my mouth with salt water, this by far is the best and gives me instant relief.</li>
            <li> I love this salt. Sprinkle it on everything. As far as I can tell this is a top quality product and works great in shakers due to small size of granules. Ditch regular table salt and get some of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a year. You have the best price and the best packaging I&#x27;ve seen yet. This salt is really good for a warm salt gargle when the throat is sore. It has a very pleasing taste and it goes a long way</li>
            <li> I always use pink salt.  It taste very good and does not make your feet and hands swell.  However, when you eat other things that aren&#x27;t prepared with the pink salt, you can tell the difference. It,s finely ground and I like that as well because it does not dissolve instantly if it is too coarse.</li>
            <li> Delicious salt! &amp; It&#x27;s good for you too! Excellent value for the price!</li>
            <li> First tried this in Ireland and when I got home ordered some and since then *two years ago* .. it is what we use daily .. Haven&#x27;t tried it with cooking .. I like using sea salt for cooking and am used to that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good item and reasonable prices.&lt;br /&gt;And I received it short enough in time.&lt;br /&gt;I hope all your business going well.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this salt. You can tell the difference in the quality.&lt;br /&gt;K</li>
            <li> My favorite salt to use in the kitchen. Love that this is an all natural salt and that pink Himalayan salt naturally has iodine. Since getting this I no longer keep the pure chemical table salt in my house.</li>
            <li> Excellent flavor and nice to find it in a fine grind. Good value- much better than the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t ground as finely as salt from a round box, so doesn&#x27;t go through the salt shaker nearly as well.  I hand-grind mine in a mortar with a pestle if I want it very finely ground to mix easily in recipes..</li>
            <li> This is a great finishing salt. It is superfine so it is easy to not overdo. This has replaced sea salt for me. I have read that Himalayan salt has 87 different minerals. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Nice fine grind, fits in all regular shakers</li>
            <li> Best price for a great product! The texture is perfect for baking, cooking and using as a seasoning. High quality salt, I would recommend</li>
            <li> My doctor has recommended that I not eat table salt, and this salt is different from regular table salt. It actually has the same composition as the blood and fluids in our bodies.  It has proved to be everything I read about, and can be used the same as table salt without the hazards.</li>
            <li> I love this salt and this company. Packaging is perfect. Salt is perfect texture for most shakers and the taste is outstanding. I don&#x27;t know how I used regular salt for all those years</li>
            <li> I like natural foods an I have used this himalayan natural crystal cooking pink salt before. I will buy it again an again !</li>
            <li> The best salt you can buy, everything your body needs and you don&#x27;t have to be afraid of using it unlike the traditional table salt that has nothing good! Of course a person shouldn&#x27;t over due it like anything. I have used Himalayan crystal salt for quite some time now and I won&#x27;t use anything else!!</li>
            <li> Taste just as good as any other table salt.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the research I did on it.  It is &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; but works just fine and is so much more healthy than the salt I&#x27;ve used all of my life.  I plan to use only this.  I&#x27;ve baked bread with it and can tell no difference in the way it turns out.</li>
            <li> Love it and it&#x27;s good for you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use another type of salt again. Between the health benefits and flavor, this is officially my jam. I also enjoy detoxifying soaks with a high volume of this salt in the tub.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this salt was so fine when I ordered it.  I prefer a chunkier salt.  Also, is seems to taste extremely briney!!</li>
            <li> Very tasty pink salt. Ground fine enough to use in a salt shaker. A more pale color that some of the other pink salts I&#x27;ve tried, but it still has the distinct flavor I look for.</li>
