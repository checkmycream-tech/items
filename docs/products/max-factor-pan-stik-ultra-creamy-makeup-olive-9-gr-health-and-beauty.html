            <li>but,my color has been discontinued, but shade i bought was ok...</li>
            <li>The color was perfect for the southern climate.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s available!  </li>
            <li>I needed the product since I was out of it, so I didn&#x27;t want to wait another week or more to return it and reorder.</li>
            <li>If you can find Suntone I would like that much better.  </li>
            <li>Love the coverage of this foundation.</li>
            <li>Have never found another product on the market like it so was thrilled to find it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for many, many years.</li>
            <li>but it is OK.</li>
            <li>The formula has changed from the very original formula.  </li>
            <li>Item was more of a sample size than what I bought originally.  </li>
            <li>Even though the tube and contents are much smaller, I was happy to be able to get it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and goes on easy.</li>
            <li>Ive used Max Factor Pan stick foundation my whole life and along with a good moisturizer just prior to applying and the results are amazing!</li>
            <li>chose this rating because i like things readily available.</li>
            <li>BUT SHE SAID IT&#x27;S TOO LIGHT AND WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li>When I saw this was available here</li>
            <li>I like it very much and would like to order more.  </li>
            <li>The add looks just like the original size</li>
            <li>It would be worth your price if it were that!</li>
            <li>I always wore a light one first and added SunTone that is no longer available.</li>
            <li>delivery was super quick..</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much for making this available to me again.</li>
            <li>They need more normal colors.</li>
            <li>I love this product and hope I will be able to get more in the near  future.  </li>
            <li>all the new Pan-Stik should have more cream content.</li>
            <li>Do not remember paying this much when it was available in retail stores.  </li>
            <li>It is pictured as a large size as the original that I used to buy, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>They at RM Cosmetics very good in sending the right shade and did not charge me anything extra and mailed the new order expeditiously back to me.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like it at all!</li>
            <li>By the way,  the website says that it is still sold here in several stores, but I dare you to find one!  :-)</li>
            <li>Sure wish I could just pick it up at a local store.</li>
            <li>Works much better for covering facial discolorations than conceal sticks.</li>
            <li>Make sure you order the correct shade since they are different than the shades made by Max Factor USA.</li>
            <li>I would like a better shade next time</li>
            <li>A mask is the whole idea!</li>
            <li>Love the Max Factor make up but the shipping time is so long.</li>
            <li>Been looking for a long time love it</li>
            <li>Product was a lot smaller than the usual kind I would buy for more money.  </li>
            <li>I use an Eliabeth Arden loose powder over top.</li>
            <li>When they discontinued I was very upset and still am.  </li>
            <li>I used it but really didnt like the color..</li>
            <li>Thanks to Max Factor.</li>
            <li>Very Deceptive.</li>
            <li>Because of $$, may have to find something else even though I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for many  years , However the gram has went from 14 to 9 a lot less for the higher price, Some tubes has like harden specks in it for some reason.</li>
            <li>Wish I could get deep olive or rich beige.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth stays long.</li>
            <li>not as dark as I needed more like a Ivory/beige</li>
            <li>I used this Deep Olive Panstick for so many years and then suddenly couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li>MaxFactor rates high with me .</li>
            <li>and my skin is very sensitive.,</li>
            <li>Container is a bit smaller now and price a bit higher now; however these are not a concern to me.</li>
            <li>Has been my favorite base for years- not too heavy and perfect</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thick foundation and lasts a long time, so the price is fair for the amount of product in it (imo).</li>
            <li>The color was a little light for me.</li>
            <li>Have been using a mixture of colors in the 14g size instead of 9g which it clearly states in the advertisement</li>
            <li>I have been buying this product since I was 15 years old and did a modeling layout for Max Factor.  </li>
            <li>I am 90 years old, and have used Max Factor for yoears.</li>
            <li>The charge is as much as the bigger version.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 75 years old and ever one says I look like I&#x27;m in my 60.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s versatile...can be used as a full coverage foundation, correcting the appearance of minor to major imperfections, or a concealer under a sheer foundation.</li>
            <li>they are really small thought they would be bigger need to put a better description</li>
            <li>In fact, the product comes in an extremely small size that was probably meant for free samples.</li>
            <li>The item is half the size of the original at the same price.  </li>
            <li>My only objection is the smaller version of the once very convenient&lt;br /&gt;size.</li>
            <li>this is a hard to fine item..</li>
            <li>I do however get past that due to the fact its not in stores  any more.</li>
            <li>THIS WAS FOR MY AUNT, BUT NOT DARK ENOUGH...</li>
            <li>The natural assumption when ordering this product would be that you would get the same size containers (only 2 or 3 times the price)as you would have found on the store shelves.  </li>
            <li>Thought the items were larger in size and had more makeup in them, didn&#x27;t realize they were so small, not worth the money,</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and the price was twice what the drug stores charge and the quanity was half as much.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s not available in the states anymore, it is hard to find and costs a lot more...</li>

            <li> Since it&#x27;s not available in the states anymore, it is hard to find and costs a lot more...</li>
            <li> This new one is a little different.</li>
            <li> May be that it has been so long since I could find any, that it is the same</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed the color is not how it looks and very cheap dispenser!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and will continue to use it as long as I can get it.  </li>
            <li> Last time I purched one it was larger and the price was less.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so dry.</li>
            <li> and I only thought it should be less dry.  </li>
            <li> would rather purchase in store rather than on line, also the package has down sized and price is double.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat dry to apply!</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll be back.</li>
            <li> BUT, the tubes are way smaller than what you usually buy in the States...</li>
            <li> That is the only complaint, otherwise product is the same I used to have years past and does what its supposed to</li>
            <li> Now the size is much smaller and the price has increased at least 2 fold.  </li>
            <li> This is so small that it won&#x27;t last me but a few months.  </li>
            <li> cover my birthmark which is half my face.  </li>
            <li> (Less oil ?)</li>
            <li> I found the color that I ordered was too bland for me.</li>
            <li> IT GIVES THAT LITTLE BIT OF &amp;#34;EXTRA COVERAGE&amp;#34; BEFORE I APPLY MY BLUSH.</li>
            <li> I like my skin imperfections hidden!</li>
            <li> so I was super disappointed when they pulled it from the US stores.</li>
            <li> We had to send it back because it was the wrong shade</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the small size as are all the order.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Sun Tine in Max Factor, but it is hard to get on line without paying an arm and a leg for it.  </li>
            <li> Sister loves max factor and it is hard to find in the stores</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who had run out of hers ( which by the way, had lasted for at least 10 years, and she told me it was just like how she remembered.</li>
            <li> I was not happy.</li>
            <li> just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;just desperate to find it as I guess Max Factor out of business.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the size.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product matches my skin tone perfectly and is flawless.  It is so much better than liquid foundation  and does not cause irritation at all and my skin is very sensitive.,</li>
            <li> I love max factor make up and have for years.</li>
            <li> Love the Max Factor make up but the shipping time is so long.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product since I was 15 years old and did a modeling layout for Max Factor.  When they discontinued I was very upset and still am.  Now the size is much smaller and the price has increased at least 2 fold.  Have been using a mixture of colors in the 14g size instead of 9g which it clearly states in the advertisement, just didn&#x27;t look that way in the picture so I never gave it a thought.  Not sure I&#x27;ll be back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed the color is not how it looks and very cheap dispenser! I really didn&#x27;t like it at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this product for many years. The product is above my expectations. Why have they changed to a smaller tube?  I find that this product is not as moist as it use to be! It&#x27;s somewhat dry to apply!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for  35 years.&lt;br /&gt;It cover my birthmark which is half my face.  I it only on my birthmark. I use an Eliabeth Arden loose powder over top. This new one is a little different. (Less oil ?) still good. Wish I could get deep olive or rich beige.</li>
            <li> It is a ripoff!  The add looks just like the original size but, in fact, it is simply a sample size.  The case is just 2 1/2 &amp;#34; overall and the actual stick of makeup is only 3/4&amp;#34; .  I paid  four times the amount I used to pay for the larger size in our country.  By the way,  the website says that it is still sold here in several stores, but I dare you to find one!  :-)</li>
            <li> It was much smaller than it was formerly and the color was off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and will continue to use it as long as I can get it.  Sure wish I could just pick it up at a local store.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS FOR MY AUNT, BUT NOT DARK ENOUGH...</li>
            <li> Best Product on the market. Goes on smooth stays long. Color good for day the day wear. Blends well. Use sparingly</li>
            <li> Absolutely satisfied to the fullest.  I love this product and hope I will be able to get more in the near  future.  Been using Max Factor for years</li>
            <li> Been looking for a long time love it</li>
            <li> Ive used Max Factor Pan stick foundation my whole life and along with a good moisturizer just prior to applying and the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many, many years. My only objection is the smaller version of the once very convenient&lt;br /&gt;size. Otherwise there is nothing like it to cover blemishes.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the same size I&#x27;ve been using for 50 years.  This is so small that it won&#x27;t last me but a few months.  The price was the same as the larger one I&#x27;ve been getting.  NOT GOOD!&lt;br /&gt;Will not order again</li>
            <li> I have used this make up for many years and am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;This make up has the coverage I like.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years... and years (!).. and I can&#x27;t get it in Seattle. Even though the tube and contents are much smaller, I was happy to be able to get it. Now that I can, I need to order more!</li>
            <li> It was okay I usually use Sun Tine in Max Factor, but it is hard to get on line without paying an arm and a leg for it.  The color was a little light for me.</li>
            <li> Thought the items were larger in size and had more makeup in them, didn&#x27;t realize they were so small, not worth the money,</li>
            <li> I like this product and have bought it in the stores for many years.  I was delighted to find in on-line, however the tube is about 1/2 the size of the one I was able to buy in the store.</li>
            <li> Great to find this product.  Could use more color selections</li>
            <li> Love this foundation. Best makeup ever.</li>
            <li> It did not seem as creamy as it use to be.  May be that it has been so long since I could find any, that it is the same and I only thought it should be less dry.  Still thrilled that I  can once again find the pan stik makeup.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who had run out of hers ( which by the way, had lasted for at least 10 years, and she told me it was just like how she remembered.</li>
            <li> MaxFactor rates high with me ., Have used it for many years !  Easy to apply and has great coverage ., Yes I would recomend to friends !</li>
            <li> Cannot buy this Maxx Factor product in the States any longer!</li>
            <li> I like the coverage of it. I have used it for many  years , However the gram has went from 14 to 9 a lot less for the higher price, Some tubes has like harden specks in it for some reason. I do however get past that due to the fact its not in stores  any more.</li>
            <li> I used it but really didnt like the color..I thought I ordered a different color, but..decided to keep it and use it.being this is a hard to fine item..</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the makeup.  It was all I hoped it would be.  Works much better for covering facial discolorations than conceal sticks.</li>
            <li> THE MAX FACTOR PAN-STIK  CREAMY MAKEUP IS GREAT...IT GIVES THAT LITTLE BIT OF &amp;#34;EXTRA COVERAGE&amp;#34; BEFORE I APPLY MY BLUSH.</li>
            <li> I am 90 years old, and have used Max Factor for yoears. an love it, it ,covers  blemeshes and makes me look younger..For yeaars people have told me how beautiful my comlection  lookedl /. Thanks to Max Factor. I hope you never do away with it. I lovr it lovr it lovr it. Thank you Max Factor.  Alice Dilabio.</li>
            <li> Sister loves max factor and it is hard to find in the stores</li>
            <li> Product was a LOT more expensive than it would have been in the stores - if they still sold it in stores. The natural assumption when ordering this product would be that you would get the same size containers (only 2 or 3 times the price)as you would have found on the store shelves.  In fact, the product comes in an extremely small size that was probably meant for free samples. Very Deceptive. Thief!

            <li> not as dark as I needed more like a Ivory/beige but I still love panstick and I will use it in the winter time.</li>
            <li> they are really small thought they would be bigger need to put a better description</li>
            <li> Well I bought this for a old wash up drag queen name JODI LANE,she loves it.</li>
            <li> The formula has changed from the very original formula.  We had to send it back because it was the wrong shade we wanted deep olive not olive. It cost me $16.75 to mail it back to England.  They at RM Cosmetics very good in sending the right shade and did not charge me anything extra and mailed the new order expeditiously back to me. Make sure you order the correct shade since they are different than the shades made by Max Factor USA.</li>
            <li> I love this-- this --have worn for years---but,my color has been discontinued, but shade i bought was ok...delivery was super quick..</li>
            <li> Item was more of a sample size than what I bought originally.  That is the only complaint, otherwise product is the same I used to have years past and does what its supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> chose this rating because i like things readily available. would rather purchase in store rather than on line, also the package has down sized and price is double.</li>
            <li> The color is perfectly suited for my complexion...just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.  Do not remember paying this much when it was available in retail stores.  Because of $$, may have to find something else even though I really like this product.  Always used it.</li>
            <li> all the new Pan-Stik should have more cream content. It&#x27;s like putting on a crayon it&#x27;s so dry. I used Max Factor Panstik since I was 17 and will be 82 in December. They need more normal colors. I always wore a light one first and added SunTone that is no longer available. The color was perfect for the southern climate. Wish I had the formula and would start making and selling it.</li>
            <li> THX! What a great way to shop. I&#x27;ll do it again. Jo Brandis</li>
            <li> Wife is happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Well, the product was right, the service was great BUT, the tubes are way smaller than what you usually buy in the States...I was&lt;br /&gt;just desperate to find it as I guess Max Factor out of business.</li>
            <li> THE WIFE SAID THIS ISEN&#x27;T THE SAME PRODUCT SHE USE TO USE BACK THEN !!!!!! THE COLOR IS SUPOSED TO BE OLIVE BUT SHE SAID IT&#x27;S TOO LIGHT AND WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> Last time I purched one it was larger and the price was less. I was not happy.</li>
            <li> I used this Deep Olive Panstick for so many years and then suddenly couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. When I saw this was available here I immediately sent my order in and it came today. Without hesitation I applied it and there it was again, that instant change in my appearance and my attitude. Thank you so very much for making this available to me again.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase for the fact that my order came in a timely manner, the price was great, and since I can&#x27;t purchase it in any stores in my area - it&#x27;s available!  My only problem is that I ordered Deep Olive and received Olive.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it, but it is not the shade I requested.  I needed the product since I was out of it, so I didn&#x27;t want to wait another week or more to return it and reorder.</li>
            <li> I found the color that I ordered was too bland for me. I would like a better shade next time</li>
            <li> I am very happy to be able to buy Panstik again.  I have used it for almost 50 yrs.  Since it&#x27;s not available in the states anymore, it is hard to find and costs a lot more...The item is half the size of the original at the same price.  The quality is great though...If you can find Suntone I would like that much better.  Will buy it again when I need it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the size.  MUCH smaller.  Not to much bigger than a sample would be.</li>
            <li> Love the coverage of this foundation. It&#x27;s versatile...can be used as a full coverage foundation, correcting the appearance of minor to major imperfections, or a concealer under a sheer foundation. It&#x27;s creamy and goes on easy. Have never found another product on the market like it so was thrilled to find it&#x27;s still available. Container is a bit smaller now and price a bit higher now; however these are not a concern to me. It&#x27;s a thick foundation and lasts a long time, so the price is fair for the amount of product in it (imo). I love this product and have used it for many, many years.</li>
            <li> Thank you ....... Nice to find what truly like to use</li>
            <li> 14 gram is what I liked! It would be worth your price if it were that! The coverage is Max Factors  signature!  Maybellene has a stick I tried it , it has no coverage.They advertise &amp;#34;no mask!&amp;#34; I say to them...why bother? A mask is the whole idea! I don&#x27;t want cream or sunscreen added I&#x27;ll do that myself. Hey industry try to get it! I like my skin imperfections hidden! I&#x27;ve tried them all, from LANCOME to COVER GIRL! No one has the coverage of &amp;#34;miss max factor of hollywood&amp;#34; amen!</li>
            <li> Product was a lot smaller than the usual kind I would buy for more money.  It also was not the color I wanted but it is OK.</li>
            <li> Last time I ordered it, I didn&#x27;t expect to get a much smaller version of this.  The charge is as much as the bigger version.</li>
            <li> Has been my favorite base for years- not too heavy and perfect coloring- so I was super disappointed when they pulled it from the US stores. Glad I found it again!</li>
            <li> Totally satisified&lt;br /&gt;Product was as advertised and I received it when promised.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering this product from here again.</li>
            <li> I use this shade for a concealer.  It&#x27;s the small size as are all the order.  It is pictured as a large size as the original that I used to buy, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time as described!</li>
            <li> I have use Max factor pan stick off and on for years. And when I use it everyone always asked what kind of makeup I have on. I&#x27;m 75 years old and ever one says I look like I&#x27;m in my 60.  So I guess I&#x27;ll keep using it in my eighty.</li>
            <li> Next time I order I will order this color.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great service.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and the price was twice what the drug stores charge and the quanity was half as much.</li>
            <li> Iwant to see the colors</li>
            <li> was not at all the same as the picture. was not the same size as the pictured one....Was way smaller and different.&lt;br /&gt;Very dissapoiinted.</li>
            <li> I should have ordered the Deep Olive instead of this one</li>
            <li> I like it very much and would like to order more.  My name is Corrine Helland and not Sandra.  Thank you.</li>
