            <li>My skin felt great</li>

            <li>throw in a bottle of their post acne spot-lightening treatment, and i&#x27;m good to</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t see any fascinating results.</li>
            <li>No matter how good a system is after a year</li>
            <li>and i found acne product and heard a lot of good reviews about it its called expose skin</li>
            <li>The packaging does say you have to use it a full 30 days to see the difference and warns of the purging, I may give this another month, as I did have severe acne and it may just take longer for me to see the best results.</li>
            <li>The items are nice and feel good on the skin.  </li>
            <li>as soon as i stopped using it, my face was better than it was before i started using it!  </li>
            <li>and I have more break outs now than when I started with the system!  </li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Decided to give Murad a try and thank goodness we did, works great cleared her skin right up!!  </li>
            <li>I could not be more excited about it!!!</li>
            <li>just looks all around amazing.</li>
            <li>but this kit has already made my skin look and feel amazing.</li>
            <li>I liked using this product because it smelled nice.</li>
            <li>Buy at ur own risk.</li>
            <li>but it stopped working for me and after seeing really good reviews for Murad, i was really excited and hopeful to try it.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing in the line is the treatment gel, I think it is the most effective on my skin because its an all over treatment</li>
            <li>I tried this kit as I had been so impressed with Murad products in general</li>
            <li>and I already see a huge improvement!</li>
            <li>It works; better than the line my doc sales in his office.</li>
            <li>I tried so many products I can&#x27;t even remember, including ProActive.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser is okay and the lotion is okay</li>
            <li>(though doesn&#x27;t moisturize as much as most lotions), thus my 2 stars.</li>
            <li>I love this product for my skin.</li>
            <li>More than anything I will be ordering the wipes.</li>
            <li>The toner and moisturizer is mostly a 2.5 out of 5.</li>
            <li>but it dries my skin and makes me breakout more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything and wasn&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>At the time I ordered murad my acne was not terrible</li>
            <li>and once they cleared more would come.</li>
            <li>It was delivered in a most timely manner and I have paired the product with a sunscreen during the day and a dense night moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>it has worked much better than proactive in my situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Also be sure to use moisturizer twice a day and liberally.</li>
            <li>My acne was a big problem until i bought this and tried it, it was working magic!!!</li>
            <li>Ok so i loved this product the first week i had it.</li>
            <li>Great collectible, perfect for the value!  </li>
            <li>Benzoyl kills bacteria and does a more thorough clean.  </li>
            <li>Happy with product but thought the containers were going to be bigger.  </li>
            <li>So the wipes are absolutely FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>i have pretty good skin, but my move to the south (and it&#x27;s insanely hot summers)</li>
            <li>The cleanser if smooth and makes your skin nice and tingly and the moisturizer makes my skin really glow.</li>
            <li>Been using it for about a month, so far so good.</li>
            <li>My face was clean so it is a decent cleansing system but for the price it&#x27;s just as effective as soap and water</li>
            <li>was excited to try it out</li>
            <li>but it is worth all the time and money you put into it!</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I bought the kit and my skin has never been so clean.</li>
            <li>Using the face wash made my face feel and look clean.  </li>
            <li>While this product does feel good on your skin and does not dry it out, I would not recommend it for severe acne.</li>
            <li>my skin starts burning, itching, turns bright red...</li>
            <li>I know I haven&#x27;t used it the full 4 weeks</li>
            <li>mo3FN6UGL4T4YH4]]I&#x27;ve tried numerous acne treatments over the years and I had good luck with this one.  </li>
            <li>was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the products the day of my 60day moneyback guarantee date and got a full refund but guess what . .</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am EXTREMELY happy with this product, although I think it to be slightly pricey, I do believe it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I just have mild acne on my chin and forehead</li>
            <li>I quickly bought a moisturizer</li>
            <li>Just be sure to GIVE IT TIME (takes about four weeks to completely clear)!</li>
            <li>THE WORST;&lt;br /&gt;ANAPHYLAXIS â€” a rare, life-threatening allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Anaphylaxis requires an immediate trip to the emergency department and an injection of epinephrine.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth the expense.</li>
            <li>I find I only use dime size amount at most of each product and any more is too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, murad, clean and clear, acne free, and clearsil.</li>
            <li>I threw it away right when i got home.</li>
            <li>I bought it just right before a wedding I was going to attend</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used this in the past with great results.</li>
            <li>So I order my products excited to start my new skin care</li>
            <li>When I first started using it</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t get a rash after the first box, you won&#x27;t get any.</li>
            <li>I love Murad and it is the only thing that has worked for me ever since I was 13.</li>
            <li>Really helped!</li>
            <li>I decided last night to give my skin a break and just used bio-oil to help heal, and my skin already looked 100% better.</li>
            <li>have tried MANY products over the years and decided to try Murad after getting a facial one day.</li>
            <li>had some redness at first, but backed off of the amount I was using and it went away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only have been using Murad for a couple of days but my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li>Recently, I have switched to the AcneFree Severe system as well as using a Clarisonic and absolutely LOVE the combination.  </li>
            <li>If you have white heads like me, make sure to use something with Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
            <li>I showed some signs of improvement within the first month or so.</li>
            <li>(should have been my first sign).</li>
            <li>It works at the first time i used murad then after a month using it, it breaks me out like hell!&lt;br /&gt;so, it did not work for me.</li>
            <li>So be aware of the make up your using and what your diet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been to many a dermatologist and tried countless medicines.</li>
            <li>With most of the negative reviews I guess that many people used the travel size for a couple of weeks and were discouraged because of the product&#x27;s purging process or were using too much and gave up because their skin was irritated.</li>
            <li>really tried to give murad a chance which is why I waited the full and complete</li>
            <li>and it does NOT dry out my skin, but it does keep breakouts completely under control and that is the reason I tried it, so I am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>I am starting to feel like I might not have to wear makeup all the time, which is huge for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>i had never had anything like that in my whole life.</li>
            <li>was really working for me</li>
            <li>Really does work.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin very itchy and uncomftorable</li>
            <li>I received it so fast as well.</li>
            <li>and it came fast from what I remembered.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t really help me much.</li>
            <li>This product had to many steps for a busy mom who wants a simple routine.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not irritating.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been plagued with acne since I was very young(11-12)and</li>
            <li>I even used the moisterizer during and after but that didn&#x27;t do much once the damage was already done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 35 and have suffered from acne my whole life.</li>
            <li>Slowly getting better, I&#x27;m excited.</li>
            <li>Murad seemed to work great for my roommate who has mild acne, but it only made my acne worse.  </li>
            <li>We have tried many otc products as well as scripts from our dermotologist with no success.  </li>
            <li>Although benzoyl peroxide based products like Proactiv and Acne Free work fairly well, they dry out my skin and make my skin looked aged and gives me dry patches.</li>
            <li>I got good results with this system and it didn&#x27;t over dry my skin like some of the other treatments I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>A great active ingredient for black heads.</li>
            <li>I recently went to a skin care product \\&quot;party\\&quot; and I have to say that my skin looked better and younger than the people who were peddling their line</li>
            <li>So when you use it just use a super tiny bit and don&#x27;t rub it all around your face.</li>
            <li>It contained SALICYLIC ACID which the main metabolite of ASPIRIN.</li>
            <li>I have mild to moderate acne, battled with it on and off since high school (am now 22).</li>
            <li>I wonder why MURAD is so highly critiqued.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend Murad.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough to make a difference on my breakouts, but gentle enough not to irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>i like murad products, and with a little tinkering to the routine make it more personalized for my needs-</li>
            <li>Do NOT buy if u have sensitive skin at all!!</li>
            <li>With that being said, if you have sensitive skin, DO NOT buy this product!!</li>
            <li>On my fifth week I went back to using Bare Minerals and my acne started clearing up quick!</li>
            <li>What I really did not like is that my skin feels like irritated after using it, maybe I just have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My chin, lower cheek bones and under my nose is absolutely drained from any natural skin oil I already had.</li>
            <li>and they said its the normal purging process.</li>
            <li>The pimple cream didn&#x27;t heal my new breakouts nor did any of them.</li>
            <li>I know how it is to live with the feeling</li>
            <li>I expected this product to be different and better than others</li>
            <li>Hello clear skin again!</li>
            <li>and my skin is the CLEAREST it&#x27;s been since I was FIFTEEN YEARS OLD!</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try something other than proactiv.</li>
            <li>I alternate between the one in this kit (which smells lovely) and the previously mentioned color correcting moisturizer</li>
            <li>it is very small now and goes away very quickly where it has never done that before I really do see a different in my skin texture for the better been using the Murad for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li>turned my clear glowing skin into a pizza.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s been a while that I ordered to clear mt skin and tone.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t clear my folliculitis that I had on my cheeks as what it said it would heal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Product has helped clear my acne..</li>
            <li>This product leaves my skin glowing, soft and youthful.</li>
            <li>If you have never used this product just to tell you the acne spot treatment is very concentrated and is meant to be used on bigger pimples.</li>
            <li>Now that I use the proper amount of product (and really massage everything into my face), it has cleared my face like never before.</li>
            <li>so if your skin is extremely sensitive do not use the exfoliating gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay but not spectacular.</li>
            <li>I have an oily T-Zone and sensitive skin to boot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My 15 year old daughter has been suffering with acne for a couple years now.  </li>
            <li>However, I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>that i was so self conscious about.</li>
            <li>at first it seemed to clear everything up then after a month i started to get big red pimples on my face</li>
            <li>and then some, not only does my skin clear up and looking amazing,it&#x27;s hydrated and shiny and</li>
            <li>As an adult, I still break out occasionally, I think a lot of adults do</li>
            <li>After I let my skin settle down and recover for a few days, I thought I would give the product one more chance.</li>
            <li>(don&#x27;t be scared that it&#x27;s green; it blends right in).</li>
            <li>/&gt;After 1 week I started having more breakouts than usual and assumed it was due to my skin purging.</li>
            <li>It will help on minor white heads, but mainly for blackheads.</li>
            <li>Would be five stars but the price/quantity leaves much to be desired but its cheaper than the other stuff and works.</li>
            <li>The other 3 products didn&#x27;t really like.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive oily acne prone  african american skin.</li>
            <li>and I start using the products religiously, twice a day with no other skin care products.</li>
            <li>the first half gives details of how it works, the different steps, and what&#x27;s in it.  </li>
            <li>The kit says that after the first few days your face will feel smoother.</li>
            <li>But this time, I used LESS of the Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel (Step 2) and REALLY massaged it into my skin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with mild to severe acne at least give it a try.</li>
            <li>I am Highly recommending this product to anyone who has tried EVERYTHING to get rid of breakouts due to oily skin!</li>
            <li>I have had bad acne my whole life and have tried many different products over the years.</li>

            <li> Happy with product but thought the containers were going to be bigger.  </li>
            <li> So the wipes are absolutely FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> i have pretty good skin, but my move to the south (and it&#x27;s insanely hot summers)</li>
            <li> The cleanser if smooth and makes your skin nice and tingly and the moisturizer makes my skin really glow.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about a month, so far so good.</li>
            <li> My face was clean so it is a decent cleansing system but for the price it&#x27;s just as effective as soap and water</li>
            <li> was excited to try it out</li>
            <li> but it is worth all the time and money you put into it!</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought the kit and my skin has never been so clean.</li>
            <li> Using the face wash made my face feel and look clean.  </li>
            <li> While this product does feel good on your skin and does not dry it out, I would not recommend it for severe acne.</li>
            <li> my skin starts burning, itching, turns bright red...</li>
            <li> I know I haven&#x27;t used it the full 4 weeks</li>
            <li> mo3FN6UGL4T4YH4]]I&#x27;ve tried numerous acne treatments over the years and I had good luck with this one.  </li>
            <li> was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the products the day of my 60day moneyback guarantee date and got a full refund but guess what . .</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am EXTREMELY happy with this product, although I think it to be slightly pricey, I do believe it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I just have mild acne on my chin and forehead</li>
            <li> I quickly bought a moisturizer</li>
            <li> Just be sure to GIVE IT TIME (takes about four weeks to completely clear)!</li>
            <li> THE WORST;&lt;br /&gt;ANAPHYLAXIS â€” a rare, life-threatening allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Anaphylaxis requires an immediate trip to the emergency department and an injection of epinephrine.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth the expense.</li>
            <li> I find I only use dime size amount at most of each product and any more is too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, murad, clean and clear, acne free, and clearsil.</li>
            <li> I threw it away right when i got home.</li>
            <li> I bought it just right before a wedding I was going to attend</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used this in the past with great results.</li>
            <li> So I order my products excited to start my new skin care</li>
            <li> When I first started using it</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t get a rash after the first box, you won&#x27;t get any.</li>
            <li> I love Murad and it is the only thing that has worked for me ever since I was 13.</li>
            <li> Really helped!</li>
            <li> I decided last night to give my skin a break and just used bio-oil to help heal, and my skin already looked 100% better.</li>
            <li> have tried MANY products over the years and decided to try Murad after getting a facial one day.</li>
            <li> had some redness at first, but backed off of the amount I was using and it went away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only have been using Murad for a couple of days but my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li> Recently, I have switched to the AcneFree Severe system as well as using a Clarisonic and absolutely LOVE the combination.  </li>
            <li> If you have white heads like me, make sure to use something with Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
            <li> I showed some signs of improvement within the first month or so.</li>
            <li> (should have been my first sign).</li>
            <li> It works at the first time i used murad then after a month using it, it breaks me out like hell!&lt;br /&gt;so, it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> So be aware of the make up your using and what your diet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been to many a dermatologist and tried countless medicines.</li>
            <li> With most of the negative reviews I guess that many people used the travel size for a couple of weeks and were discouraged because of the product&#x27;s purging process or were using too much and gave up because their skin was irritated.</li>
            <li> really tried to give murad a chance which is why I waited the full and complete</li>
            <li> and it does NOT dry out my skin, but it does keep breakouts completely under control and that is the reason I tried it, so I am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> I am starting to feel like I might not have to wear makeup all the time, which is huge for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> i had never had anything like that in my whole life.</li>
            <li> was really working for me</li>
            <li> Really does work.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin very itchy and uncomftorable</li>
            <li> I received it so fast as well.</li>
            <li> and it came fast from what I remembered.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t really help me much.</li>
            <li> This product had to many steps for a busy mom who wants a simple routine.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not irritating.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been plagued with acne since I was very young(11-12)and</li>
            <li> I even used the moisterizer during and after but that didn&#x27;t do much once the damage was already done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 35 and have suffered from acne my whole life.</li>
            <li> Slowly getting better, I&#x27;m excited.</li>
            <li> Murad seemed to work great for my roommate who has mild acne, but it only made my acne worse.  </li>
            <li> We have tried many otc products as well as scripts from our dermotologist with no success.  </li>
            <li> Although benzoyl peroxide based products like Proactiv and Acne Free work fairly well, they dry out my skin and make my skin looked aged and gives me dry patches.</li>
            <li> I got good results with this system and it didn&#x27;t over dry my skin like some of the other treatments I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> A great active ingredient for black heads.</li>
            <li> I recently went to a skin care product \\&quot;party\\&quot; and I have to say that my skin looked better and younger than the people who were peddling their line</li>
            <li> So when you use it just use a super tiny bit and don&#x27;t rub it all around your face.</li>
            <li> It contained SALICYLIC ACID which the main metabolite of ASPIRIN.</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate acne, battled with it on and off since high school (am now 22).</li>
            <li> I wonder why MURAD is so highly critiqued.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend Murad.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong enough to make a difference on my breakouts, but gentle enough not to irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> i like murad products, and with a little tinkering to the routine make it more personalized for my needs-</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy if u have sensitive skin at all!!</li>
            <li> With that being said, if you have sensitive skin, DO NOT buy this product!!</li>
            <li> On my fifth week I went back to using Bare Minerals and my acne started clearing up quick!</li>
            <li> What I really did not like is that my skin feels like irritated after using it, maybe I just have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My chin, lower cheek bones and under my nose is absolutely drained from any natural skin oil I already had.</li>
            <li> and they said its the normal purging process.</li>
            <li> The pimple cream didn&#x27;t heal my new breakouts nor did any of them.</li>
            <li> I know how it is to live with the feeling</li>
            <li> I expected this product to be different and better than others</li>
            <li> Hello clear skin again!</li>
            <li> and my skin is the CLEAREST it&#x27;s been since I was FIFTEEN YEARS OLD!</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try something other than proactiv.</li>
            <li> I alternate between the one in this kit (which smells lovely) and the previously mentioned color correcting moisturizer</li>
            <li> it is very small now and goes away very quickly where it has never done that before I really do see a different in my skin texture for the better been using the Murad for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> turned my clear glowing skin into a pizza.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s been a while that I ordered to clear mt skin and tone.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t clear my folliculitis that I had on my cheeks as what it said it would heal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Product has helped clear my acne..</li>
            <li> This product leaves my skin glowing, soft and youthful.</li>
            <li> If you have never used this product just to tell you the acne spot treatment is very concentrated and is meant to be used on bigger pimples.</li>
            <li> Now that I use the proper amount of product (and really massage everything into my face), it has cleared my face like never before.</li>
            <li> so if your skin is extremely sensitive do not use the exfoliating gel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but not spectacular.</li>
            <li> I have an oily T-Zone and sensitive skin to boot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter has been suffering with acne for a couple years now.  </li>
            <li> However, I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> that i was so self conscious about.</li>
            <li> at first it seemed to clear everything up then after a month i started to get big red pimples on my face</li>
            <li> and then some, not only does my skin clear up and looking amazing,it&#x27;s hydrated and shiny and</li>
            <li> As an adult, I still break out occasionally, I think a lot of adults do</li>
            <li> After I let my skin settle down and recover for a few days, I thought I would give the product one more chance.</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t be scared that it&#x27;s green; it blends right in).</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 1 week I started having more breakouts than usual and assumed it was due to my skin purging.</li>
            <li> It will help on minor white heads, but mainly for blackheads.</li>
            <li> Would be five stars but the price/quantity leaves much to be desired but its cheaper than the other stuff and works.</li>
            <li> The other 3 products didn&#x27;t really like.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive oily acne prone  african american skin.</li>
            <li> and I start using the products religiously, twice a day with no other skin care products.</li>
            <li> the first half gives details of how it works, the different steps, and what&#x27;s in it.  </li>
            <li> The kit says that after the first few days your face will feel smoother.</li>
            <li> But this time, I used LESS of the Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel (Step 2) and REALLY massaged it into my skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with mild to severe acne at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> I am Highly recommending this product to anyone who has tried EVERYTHING to get rid of breakouts due to oily skin!</li>
            <li> I have had bad acne my whole life and have tried many different products over the years.</li>
            <li> It says that your skin will get worse before it gets better, so I expected it.</li>
            <li> All i can say is that if you have sensitive skin then be very careful about this.</li>
            <li> The kit is long lasting despite the smaller sizes of the products and I am going to re order because I have not found anything that works as well.</li>
            <li> but now I wonder how long it will take for my face to get back to normal after I worked so hard to get it clear.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so maybe for most people it&#x27;s not too bad, but I get hives every time I shower...</li>
            <li> but this is the first time trying the acne complex.</li>
            <li> and my face is really red, dry, itchy and swollen.</li>
            <li> Despite reading many negative reviews, I decided to try Murad Acne Complex Kit.</li>
            <li> After a couple months of daily use, I have not had any of the bigger pustule zits in a while, my pores are looking smaller with fewer blackheads (not completely gone yet, hoping to see further improvement), and my skin is less blotchy.</li>
            <li> and I read the positive and negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I just realized that I am writing a review that&#x27;s been long over dued.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Murad was a product I heard of when I was a teen and never really thought of it then until I saw the infomercial.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I don&#x27;t believe that it acted any different that anything I could have bought at the drug store for cheaper.</li>
            <li> that you need to use a very small amount of the cleanser and gel as they&#x27;re very drying.</li>
            <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t dry at all</li>
            <li> i ditch the zit cream (too stinky and drying), and on REALLY dry days</li>
            <li> Accutane worked when I was being treated but my skin and lips were unbearably dry.</li>
            <li> My skin is on the dry side</li>
            <li> Once you get past the first few days of purging, your skin will rejuvenate itself.</li>
            <li> it just made my face 10x worse and really itchy, red, and bruised feeling!  </li>
            <li> I can not say if the product is good or bad, I still have acne, the product is not helping, not even a little bit, but at the same time I think is too soon to make a judgment because I&#x27;ve been using it for less than a month...</li>
            <li> I have tried every single acne kit there is and this one ranks as the rest.  </li>
            <li> Reactions generally occur within a few hours of putting the cream on.</li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t gotten used to the product or had to put up with peeling or dry skin!</li>
            <li> I get blackheads and large pores as well as stress acne, large painful pimples and whiteheads throughout my t-zone.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Didnt work good on my skin made it too dry, and it looked horrible for weeks, wish I could get my money back</li>
            <li> The pimples were deep in my skin and the result was big round bumps the size of anywhere from half an inch to an inch.</li>
            <li> The first few days of using this product were not good.</li>
            <li> Break-outs are minimal.</li>
            <li> use it a few times per week, not daily</li>
            <li> Well that must mean that it doesn&#x27;t work, because my face never got clear.  </li>
            <li> If you have black heads of just some minor lumps.</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t expect is that the break out would last for months, and give me pretty bad acne scars you notice when you look close enough.</li>
            <li> I had tried other products like proactive and skin ID</li>
            <li> JUST BE CAREFUL BECAUSE I BROKE OUT IN ITCHY HIVES!</li>
            <li> i decided to try Murad because my acne wasn&#x27;t responding to other treatments.</li>
            <li> I have used this product as well as every other acne systems on the market for my moderate/severe chin and jawline breakouts.  </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t due to Murad.</li>
            <li> I use the gel twice a day but sometimes skip it if my skin&#x27;s feeling especially dry.</li>
            <li> skin has never been smoother, my pores much smaller, my blackheads are minimal (chin &amp; nose used to be bad) and even when I have a breakout for that time of the month, the one or two that pop up go away MUCH quicker than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I continued with the system for three months and saw only negative changes to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, it has:    - Completely cleared my acne  - Smoothed the texture of my skin  - Decreased the size of my pores  </li>
            <li> My breakouts went from the typical whitehead pimple to HUGE painful nodular acne.</li>
            <li> I went to extreme measures like taking birth control for acne and accutane treatments (twice!).</li>
            <li> i had slight acne before i started with murad.  </li>
            <li> like they recommend, but I just can&#x27;t subject myself to it anymore.</li>
            <li> Shortly after starting to use this product I got a horrible rash, at first I didn&#x27;t attribute it to this product, but now I&#x27;m rethinking that.</li>
            <li> The solution they have for breakouts (little tube) I didn&#x27;t find to help me at all.  </li>
            <li> I ended up buying proactiv to fix the mess murad made but the proactiv didnt kick in until a few months after.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I do get a hormonal break-out I will sometimes add a dab of bp to the problem area  for a few days and the problem is solved.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I had to use the Proactive repair cream for my few breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I also did not want to get trapped in the Proactiv vortex ever again with their horrid customer service and the trials and tribulations</li>
            <li> and I knew that this would make acne worse on the second week but after two uses, this product became unbearable for me to comfortablly move my mouth.</li>
            <li> I thought why not cater to my specific skin type instead of buying the way less expensive starter kit.</li>
            <li> the turnaround time usually takes about 8 weeks, so i have to buy two boxes.</li>
            <li> and because this stuff is pricier than standard drugstore fare, she felt guilty about wasting it and my</li>
            <li> It was small like traveling size small for the price I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> or so I usually need to switch to another for a while, just like with shampoos.  </li>
            <li> 4months of excessive acne that I never had to begin with, no thank you.</li>
            <li> I can usually use OTC products with improvement without going to the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Not many people pay attention to those type of things.</li>
            <li> Do not try it all on your face, but instead try a small bit to see how your skin reacts.</li>
            <li> I wasted my hard earned money on this!</li>
            <li> and my skin is hardly recovering.</li>
            <li> Its unreal how bad it ruined my skin, and like I said if you have sensitive skin, I would NOT risk it because the outcome is truly embarssing.</li>
            <li> Not effective for acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Murad Acne Complex now for about 5 weeks</li>
            <li> I saw the infomercial late one night</li>
            <li> and then I worked into it slowly.</li>
            <li> Now within the past couple days I have noticed redness and irritation around my eyes, and yesterday afternoon I looked in the mirror and my face had EXPLODED with bumps and redness - could have been a photosensitive reaction but nonetheless, my face is awful-looking!</li>
            <li> But instead of just going away it got worse and worse, I even started to notice that i had blackheads.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for three months and all it did was made it worse.</li>
            <li> she was faithful to the twice-a-day rule, and it made her slightly-sensetive skin even worse.</li>
            <li> it made my acne worse.</li>
            <li> I tried Proactive and it made my acne worse</li>
            <li> and it got worse.</li>
            <li> Unfortunatley It dried my skin out so horribly that i spent my Easter with skin</li>
            <li> it also dried my skin out really bad.</li>
            <li> bought this product as a part of Murad Adult Acne Treatment which I have terrible reactions to.</li>
            <li> Made my skin worse!  </li>
            <li> This made my skin worse!</li>
            <li> and I know it is expensive</li>
            <li> then i am use to seeing and as it heals it is itching like crazy.</li>
            <li> Depressing</li>
            <li> and i have been applying it for 3 days now like crazy</li>
            <li> The peeling is still there and its seem impossible for my skin to heal.</li>
            <li> I was breaking out badly, and I don&#x27;t want to see my doctor.</li>
            <li> One thing I did notice after week 3 my acne did get bad</li>
            <li> Its so painful and nothing seems to help...</li>
            <li> They were so painful</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I was a bit disappointed by the product.</li>
            <li> for me it was horrible</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully for 2 weeks, my skin looks horrible and every time I use the exfoliation gel (step 2)</li>
            <li> By 3 weeks I had the worst acne I have ever had in my life.</li>

            <li> I already use the sulphur mask 2-3 times a week. I bought the kit and my skin has never been so clean. I would definitely recommend this to others and already have!</li>
            <li> if I do get a pimple it is very small now and goes away very quickly where it has never done that before I really do see a different in my skin texture for the better been using the Murad for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> i had slight acne before i started with murad.  I had tried other products like proactive and skin ID but they never fully got rid of my pimples. So then I tried murad at first it seemed to clear everything up then after a month i started to get big red pimples on my face i had never had anything like that in my whole life. But instead of just going away it got worse and worse, I even started to notice that i had blackheads.I had not seen blackheads on my face since i was a teen.  Even though i have stopped using murad for about two weeks it&#x27;s damage is still being done.  my face has those big red pimples all over it and some are still coming up because of the blackheads. The healing process is taking longer then i am use to seeing and as it heals it is itching like crazy. All i have to say is buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Made my skin worse!  I tried this product for three months and all it did was made it worse. I did not see any improvement at all. Now I just use Swiss Apricot Scrub with Salicylic Acid and it works great. Do not buy this product!</li>
            <li> It works; better than the line my doc sales in his office. Would be five stars but the price/quantity leaves much to be desired but its cheaper than the other stuff and works. I have sensitive oily acne prone  african american skin.</li>
            <li> I am over 40 and have been fighting acne since I was a teen. Although benzoyl peroxide based products like Proactiv and Acne Free work fairly well, they dry out my skin and make my skin looked aged and gives me dry patches. I have been using this product for several years and I can definitely tell when I run out and use something else. This product leaves my skin glowing, soft and youthful. When I first started using it I broke out in big cystic acne, so I stopped for a while until I got control again and then I worked into it slowly. I started using it at night and then the benzoyl peroxide (bp) system during the day. I eventually weaned myself off of the bp system and use Murad exclusively. If I do get a hormonal break-out I will sometimes add a dab of bp to the problem area  for a few days and the problem is solved. I recently went to a skin care product \\&quot;party\\&quot; and I have to say that my skin looked better and younger than the people who were peddling their line and they told me whatever I was doing was really working for me ;) The only reason I did not give it a 5 was that I still get occasional hormonal breakouts.</li>
            <li> My acne was a big problem until i bought this and tried it, it was working magic!!! My skin wasn&#x27;t dry at all but my face was getting clearer!! Can&#x27;t wait to buy more!!!</li>
            <li> i have pretty good skin, but my move to the south (and it&#x27;s insanely hot summers) turned my clear glowing skin into a pizza. i&#x27;ve used this in the past with great results. the turnaround time usually takes about 8 weeks, so i have to buy two boxes. i like murad products, and with a little tinkering to the routine make it more personalized for my needs- i ditch the zit cream (too stinky and drying), and on REALLY dry days i substitute the gel for the lotion. the key to this kit working is using it in the morning AND at night. throw in a bottle of their post acne spot-lightening treatment, and i&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the negatives- this doesn&#x27;t work for everybody. my sister was having similar skin problems(whiteheads, blackheads, and big red pimples in her stress-indicator areas) and i decided to get it for her. she was faithful to the twice-a-day rule, and it made her slightly-sensetive skin even worse. and because this stuff is pricier than standard drugstore fare, she felt guilty about wasting it and my $$$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line, start with the 30 day kit. if you don&#x27;t get a rash after the first box, you won&#x27;t get any. the 31-60 days are when your skin starts to improve anyway, so go for the second kit. i swear by it, but only in moderation for folks who&#x27;ve never used it before.</li>
            <li> Not effective for acne. My face was clean so it is a decent cleansing system but for the price it&#x27;s just as effective as soap and water</li>
            <li> This product does what it promises to do and then some, not only does my skin clear up and looking amazing,it&#x27;s hydrated and shiny and just looks all around amazing.</li>
            <li> The biggest thing I have to say about Murad is for some people it works wonders and others it does not. Of course the same could be said for any acne treatment. If you have never used this product just to tell you the acne spot treatment is very concentrated and is meant to be used on bigger pimples. So when you use it just use a super tiny bit and don&#x27;t rub it all around your face. I love Murad and it is the only thing that has worked for me ever since I was 13.</li>
            <li> The items are nice and feel good on the skin.  However I am approaching the end of my 30 day run and feel like my skin is still &#x27;purging&#x27;.  The packaging does say you have to use it a full 30 days to see the difference and warns of the purging, I may give this another month, as I did have severe acne and it may just take longer for me to see the best results.</li>
            <li> I was breaking out badly, and I don&#x27;t want to see my doctor. So it&#x27;s been a while that I ordered to clear mt skin and tone. But now I feel great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Murad Acne Complex now for about 5 weeks and my skin is the CLEAREST it&#x27;s been since I was FIFTEEN YEARS OLD! For me, it has:    - Completely cleared my acne  - Smoothed the texture of my skin  - Decreased the size of my pores  - Eliminated skin discoloration  - Drastically reduced the severity of my acne scars    The first few days of using this product were not good. My skin became leathery and rough--I thought I had an allergic reaction to the product. After I let my skin settle down and recover for a few days, I thought I would give the product one more chance. But this time, I used LESS of the Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel (Step 2) and REALLY massaged it into my skin. Before, I was lathering it over my skin like a gel mask. THAT&#x27;S WHY IT REACTED THE WAY IT DID!     Now that I use the proper amount of product (and really massage everything into my face), it has cleared my face like never before. I haven&#x27;t seen my face look like this since before I ever had acne. It truly is a miracle product.     If you have super-sensitive, acne-prone skin like me, try this. Once you get past the first few days of purging, your skin will rejuvenate itself. Just be sure to GIVE IT TIME (takes about four weeks to completely clear)!</li>
            <li> I have always had an off and on problem with acne. I tried proactive when I was a teen and I didn&#x27;t like it. I decided to try this last year. It says that your skin will get worse before it gets better, so I expected it. What I didn&#x27;t expect is that the break out would last for months, and give me pretty bad acne scars you notice when you look close enough. I stopped it after about 3 mos of no improvment. I wasted my hard earned money on this!</li>
            <li> this product does not work!!  it just made my face 10x worse and really itchy, red, and bruised feeling!  as soon as i stopped using it, my face was better than it was before i started using it!  waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great collectible, perfect for the value!  Really does work.  Works better than Proactiv!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Ok so i loved this product the first week i had it. it cleared up my acne so well but then i broke out in hives on it and that wouldn&#x27;t go away for a couple days even with medicine and my doctor said it was probably from the Murad. I threw it away right when i got home. for me it was horrible but i had an allergic reaction so maybe it was just me. JUST BE CAREFUL BECAUSE I BROKE OUT IN ITCHY HIVES!</li>
            <li> While this product does feel good on your skin and does not dry it out, I would not recommend it for severe acne.</li>
            <li> Happy with product but thought the containers were going to be bigger.  Packaging is deceiving and it should be noted that it is a starter kit!</li>
            <li> I wonder why MURAD is so highly critiqued. It is definately overrated. I think one star is overrated for this product. It didnt do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried every single acne kit there is and this one ranks as the rest.  Waste of money.  The kit says that after the first few days your face will feel smoother. Nope. Then it says there will be bursts of acne break outs. Well that must mean that it doesn&#x27;t work, because my face never got clear.  If anyone knows a kit that actually works let me know! I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, murad, clean and clear, acne free, and clearsil.</li>
            <li> I liked using this product because it smelled nice. Other than that, I don&#x27;t believe that it acted any different that anything I could have bought at the drug store for cheaper. If you have the money, I would go ahead and buy this, but if not, stick to what you&#x27;re already using.</li>
            <li> Product in kit was not as advertised. Had to return and wait for the refund&lt;br /&gt;:-(.</li>
            <li> Didnt work good on my skin made it too dry, and it looked horrible for weeks, wish I could get my money back</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE THIS MURAD PRODUCT IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN OR ANY OF ITS INGRIDIENTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product as a part of Murad Adult Acne Treatment which I have terrible reactions to. It contained SALICYLIC ACID which the main metabolite of ASPIRIN. I only used it for a month. Reactions generally occur within a few hours of putting the cream on. The reaction includes;&lt;br /&gt;HIVES,&lt;br /&gt;ITCHY SKIN,&lt;br /&gt;SWELLING OF MY LIPS, MY TONGUE AND MY FACE,&lt;br /&gt;COUGHING, WHEEZING AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH&lt;br /&gt;AND THE WORST;&lt;br /&gt;ANAPHYLAXIS â€” a rare, life-threatening allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Anaphylaxis requires an immediate trip to the emergency department and an injection of epinephrine. I was hospitilised 4 times in a month. Several blood samples and at the end doctors finally found why?? SALICYLIC ACID in the MURAD PRODUCTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Murad should obliged to WARN CUSTOMERS WHO ARE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN SHOULD AVOID from this product line which ANY OF ITS INGRIDIENTS is SALICYLIC ACID.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE THIS MURAD PRODUCT IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN OR ANY OF ITS INGRIDIENTS.</li>
            <li> Deep cystic acne runs in the family.  I tried so many products I can&#x27;t even remember, including ProActive.  This is the only product that I found made any difference in my skin.  Really helped!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every product out there and nothing works like Murad. I&#x27;ve recommended this to friends and they are all happy. Highly recommend Murad.</li>
            <li> i decided to try Murad because my acne wasn&#x27;t responding to other treatments. I can not say if the product is good or bad, I still have acne, the product is not helping, not even a little bit, but at the same time I think is too soon to make a judgment because I&#x27;ve been using it for less than a month...What I really did not like is that my skin feels like irritated after using it, maybe I just have sensitive skin. I think I might have food allergies and that&#x27;s causing my acne, so the product won&#x27;t be of any help....</li>
            <li> This is really not the product for sensitive skin. I used it twice and my face is really red, dry, itchy and swollen. Read all of the reviews before deciding to purchase.</li>
            <li> I know I haven&#x27;t used it the full 4 weeks like they recommend, but I just can&#x27;t subject myself to it anymore. Shortly after starting to use this product I got a horrible rash, at first I didn&#x27;t attribute it to this product, but now I&#x27;m rethinking that. I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully for 2 weeks, my skin looks horrible and every time I use the exfoliation gel (step 2) my skin starts burning, itching, turns bright red... it feels like I&#x27;m putting rubbing alcohol on open sores! I decided last night to give my skin a break and just used bio-oil to help heal, and my skin already looked 100% better. The cleanser is okay and the lotion is okay (though doesn&#x27;t moisturize as much as most lotions), thus my 2 stars. I have very sensitive skin, so maybe for most people it&#x27;s not too bad, but I get hives every time I shower... so if your skin is extremely sensitive do not use the exfoliating gel.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my skin. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> OHMYGOD!!! So the wipes are absolutely FANTASTIC. More than anything I will be ordering the wipes. The cleanser is like a freaking altoid for your face. It&#x27;s absolutely refreshing!!! The toner and moisturizer is mostly a 2.5 out of 5. It&#x27;s okay but not spectacular. Definitely get the cleanser and the wipes though!!!</li>
            <li> I have moderate acne and bought this product about four weeks ago, it did nothing for me however I thought I&#x27;d keep using it in hopes it would start working. It never did.  Makes my skin very itchy and uncomftorable and I have more break outs now than when I started with the system!  Finally decided to go back to my clarisonic and drug store acne creams! I would definitely not reccomend this product!  Over priced and overrated, and beware, the bottles are much smaller than they appear online or in the box!</li>
            <li> Best product out there and speaking as a Pharmacist -the expiration date doesn&#x27;t matter. I received it so fast as well.</li>
            <li> I expected this product to be different and better than others but it dries my skin and makes me breakout more I don&#x27;t think I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am a 32 yo female and have had acne since I turned 12. I have an oily T-Zone and sensitive skin to boot.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried MANY products over the years and decided to try Murad after getting a facial one day. They had the kit available,the Esthetician raved about it, so I said why not.&lt;br /&gt;I had some redness at first, but backed off of the amount I was using and it went away.&lt;br /&gt;My skin has never been smoother, my pores much smaller, my blackheads are minimal (chin &amp; nose used to be bad) and even when I have a breakout for that time of the month, the one or two that pop up go away MUCH quicker than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am EXTREMELY happy with this product, although I think it to be slightly pricey, I do believe it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like murad at all it made my acne worse. It made acne appear where i didnt even have it before using it</li>
            <li> I used this product twice and after the second use i became red and irritated i woke up the next day with what looked like chemical burns all around my mouth and around my nose. Its so painful and nothing seems to help...Buy at ur own risk. Do NOT buy if u have sensitive skin at all!!</li>
            <li> I just realized that I am writing a review that&#x27;s been long over dued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in the spring of 2012. I saw the infomercial late one night and I was intrigued. I&#x27;ve tried everything and wasn&#x27;t satisfied. Murad was a product I heard of when I was a teen and never really thought of it then until I saw the infomercial.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the thing and it came fast from what I remembered.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try it out but I was a bit turned off by the size of it. It was small like traveling size small for the price I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;Well I tried the product and I didn&#x27;t see any fascinating results. The pimple cream didn&#x27;t heal my new breakouts nor did any of them. It didn&#x27;t clear my folliculitis that I had on my cheeks as what it said it would heal.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was a bit disappointed by the product. I didn&#x27;t but a second Murad product after that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong enough to make a difference on my breakouts, but gentle enough not to irritate my skin.  I love it.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3FN6UGL4T4YH4]]I&#x27;ve tried numerous acne treatments over the years and I had good luck with this one.  No matter how good a system is after a year or so I usually need to switch to another for a while, just like with shampoos.  I got good results with this system and it didn&#x27;t over dry my skin like some of the other treatments I&#x27;ve tried.  Here&#x27;s a video- the first half gives details of how it works, the different steps, and what&#x27;s in it.  You can ignore the second part which is just the information for when it&#x27;s on tv.</li>
            <li> I started using this product 3 days ago and I already see a huge improvement! I just have mild acne on my chin and forehead but this kit has already made my skin look and feel amazing. The cleanser if smooth and makes your skin nice and tingly and the moisturizer makes my skin really glow. I would recommend this to anyone with mild to severe acne at least give it a try. I tried Proactive and it made my acne worse it also dried my skin out really bad. Ive been using Murad for over a year now but this is the first time trying the acne complex. I could not be more excited about it!!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I only have been using Murad for a couple of days but my skin looks so much better.Love it.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t really help me much. Different results for different people.</li>
            <li> I have used this product as well as every other acne systems on the market for my moderate/severe chin and jawline breakouts.  Proactiv was working for me for a year but then my acne started to come back, so I switched to Murad.  Murad seemed to work great for my roommate who has mild acne, but it only made my acne worse.  I continued with the system for three months and saw only negative changes to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from moderate to severe acne, I would recommend you switch to a system that uses Benzoyl Peroxide instead of Salicylic Acid.  Benzoyl kills bacteria and does a more thorough clean.  Recently, I have switched to the AcneFree Severe system as well as using a Clarisonic and absolutely LOVE the combination.  Just my two cents for those suffering with severe acne life myself.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about a month, so far so good. Break-outs are minimal. Slowly getting better, I&#x27;m excited. Thank u</li>
            <li> did not work for me...</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter has been suffering with acne for a couple years now.  We have tried many otc products as well as scripts from our dermotologist with no success.  Decided to give Murad a try and thank goodness we did, works great cleared her skin right up!!  Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Using the face wash made my face feel and look clean.  The other 3 products didn&#x27;t really like.  I had to use the Proactive repair cream for my few breakouts.  The solution they have for breakouts (little tube) I didn&#x27;t find to help me at all.  Overall would recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I was recommended Murad by a friend that ranted and raved about it so I was excited to try something other than proactiv. I bought the oil control kit WITH an added clarifying toner to combat my oily skin. I thought why not cater to my specific skin type instead of buying the way less expensive starter kit. So I order my products excited to start my new skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had acne since 7th grade and have used Proactiv or drugstore acne products. At the time I ordered murad my acne was not terrible but I was still having breakouts here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my murad finally comes in the mail and I start using the products religiously, twice a day with no other skin care products. Then the breakouts started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 1 week I started having more breakouts than usual and assumed it was due to my skin purging. By 3 weeks I had the worst acne I have ever had in my life. My breakouts went from the typical whitehead pimple to HUGE painful nodular acne. The pimples were deep in my skin and the result was big round bumps the size of anywhere from half an inch to an inch. They were so painful and once they cleared more would come. Once one came to a head and a lot of stuff came out of it which just showed how deep the pimple was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the products the day of my 60day moneyback guarantee date and got a full refund but guess what . . Not only did I have the nodular acne up until those 60days but it lasted for the next 2 months after!! 4months of excessive acne that I never had to begin with, no thank you. I ended up buying proactiv to fix the mess murad made but the proactiv didnt kick in until a few months after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really tried to give murad a chance which is why I waited the full and complete 60days before I returned it.  I dont know if im allergic to their ingredients but I will never buy from them again.</li>
            <li> This review is going to be short and simple. Everything in the box uses salicylic acid. A great active ingredient for black heads. It will help on minor white heads, but mainly for blackheads. If you have white heads like me, make sure to use something with Benzoyl Peroxide. If you have black heads of just some minor lumps. This is the product for you.</li>
            <li> This product had to many steps for a busy mom who wants a simple routine.  Product did not reduce pore size or help with breakouts.  Wasn&#x27;t worth the expense.</li>
            <li> This made my skin worse! I called customer service and they said its the normal purging process. Well I waited weeks and it got worse. Depressing</li>
            <li> I have had bad acne my whole life and have tried many different products over the years. I figured I would try Murad out. It made my face break out twice as bad as it already was!!! I will NEVER use this product again. It was a complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate acne, battled with it on and off since high school (am now 22). I can usually use OTC products with improvement without going to the dermatologist. However, I do have sensitive skin so I do have to watch what I put on my face. With that being said, if you have sensitive skin, DO NOT buy this product!! I showed some signs of improvement within the first month or so. I did only get to use the cleanser twice though before I had a reaction to it (should have been my first sign). Now within the past couple days I have noticed redness and irritation around my eyes, and yesterday afternoon I looked in the mirror and my face had EXPLODED with bumps and redness - could have been a photosensitive reaction but nonetheless, my face is awful-looking! I have discontinued the product but now I wonder how long it will take for my face to get back to normal after I worked so hard to get it clear. Word to the wise people!</li>
            <li> I am Highly recommending this product to anyone who has tried EVERYTHING to get rid of breakouts due to oily skin! It was delivered in a most timely manner and I have paired the product with a sunscreen during the day and a dense night moisturizer.  This Product has helped clear my acne..it has worked much better than proactive in my situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please give it a try if you are seeking to invest in such a product, give it a week or two to see results!&lt;br /&gt;IT WAS SOOOO WORHT IT!</li>
            <li> It works at the first time i used murad then after a month using it, it breaks me out like hell!&lt;br /&gt;so, it did not work for me. *sighs*&lt;br /&gt;I did a research and i found acne product and heard a lot of good reviews about it its called expose skin care.&lt;br /&gt;I will try to use it to see if its going to work for me.</li>
            <li> works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> I heard about this product through Amazon and I read the positive and negative reviews. With most of the negative reviews I guess that many people used the travel size for a couple of weeks and were discouraged because of the product&#x27;s purging process or were using too much and gave up because their skin was irritated. I find I only use dime size amount at most of each product and any more is too much. Knowing those things, I tried it anyway and my skin did act up for a week and after that it got clearer and clearer. I&#x27;ve used it almost every day, twice a day, since the beginning January 2013 and my skin the the clearest I&#x27;ve seen it in years! I don&#x27;t need makeup to hide it anymore! I also haven&#x27;t gotten used to the product or had to put up with peeling or dry skin! My favorite thing in the line is the treatment gel, I think it is the most effective on my skin because its an all over treatment but it&#x27;s not irritating.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been plagued with acne since I was very young(11-12)and I&#x27;ve tried product after product to get rid of it but this is the only thing that has worked on my sensitive/combination skin. I&#x27;ve tried Proactive and it stopped working after two weeks. I went to extreme measures like taking birth control for acne and accutane treatments (twice!). Accutane worked when I was being treated but my skin and lips were unbearably dry. They all stopped working after my skin got used to the product or after the treatment was over. I get blackheads and large pores as well as stress acne, large painful pimples and whiteheads throughout my t-zone.&lt;br /&gt;As I said before, these products are AMAZING!! I found it helpful to use an exfoliating pouf or scrub with the cleanser whenever it felt like my skin started breaking out. This opens up the pores so the treatment can work. Also, I occasionally took a break from the skincare line for a couple of days just to give it a rest in case it might get irritated. I know how it is to live with the feeling like there&#x27;s nothingI could do about my acne. Please give this a try and give it some time to work. I know you&#x27;ve heard this speech before and I know it is expensive but it is worth all the time and money you put into it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Murad for about 6 weeks now and I love it! I thought I would try it out since my friend had great results from using this product. I bought it just right before a wedding I was going to attend and it cleared my skin perfectly for the occasion. One thing I did notice after week 3 my acne did get bad but it wasn&#x27;t due to Murad. It was because of the make up I was using. On my fifth week I went back to using Bare Minerals and my acne started clearing up quick! I also changed my diet which also helped.  I have the hormonal acne but the heal time is a lot quicker. So be aware of the make up your using and what your diet. Not many people pay attention to those type of things.</li>
            <li> BUY THIS FOR MY SON. THIS IS THE 2ND TIME I HAVE PURCHASED FROM THIS SELLER.  COMES IN A TIMELY FASHION AND MY SON LOVES THIS PRODUCT.  CHEAPER THAN WHAT THE DERMATOLOGIST WAS HAVING US USE.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product, you just have to use it as the instructions tell you. If you want it to work!</li>
            <li> All i can say is that if you have sensitive skin then be very careful about this. Do not try it all on your face, but instead try a small bit to see how your skin reacts. I had used Clinique before this but it stopped working for me and after seeing really good reviews for Murad, i was really excited and hopeful to try it. Unfortunatley It dried my skin out so horribly that i spent my Easter with skin that i was so self conscious about. My skin actually started peeling everywhere and it looked/looks so disgusting. I quickly bought a moisturizer and i have been applying it for 3 days now like crazy and my skin is hardly recovering. The peeling is still there and its seem impossible for my skin to heal. Its unreal how bad it ruined my skin, and like I said if you have sensitive skin, I would NOT risk it because the outcome is truly embarssing.</li>
            <li> As an adult, I still break out occasionally, I think a lot of adults do but we do not want to admit it. I tried this kit as I had been so impressed with Murad products in general and I was not disappointed. I also did not want to get trapped in the Proactiv vortex ever again with their horrid customer service and the trials and tribulations you go through with them to try to manage your account.&lt;br /&gt;I use it a few times per week, not daily and it does NOT dry out my skin, but it does keep breakouts completely under control and that is the reason I tried it, so I am extremely pleased. The kit is long lasting despite the smaller sizes of the products and I am going to re order because I have not found anything that works as well. Hello clear skin again!</li>
            <li> Despite reading many negative reviews, I decided to try Murad Acne Complex Kit. My skin is on the dry side and I knew that this would make acne worse on the second week but after two uses, this product became unbearable for me to comfortablly move my mouth. My chin, lower cheek bones and under my nose is absolutely drained from any natural skin oil I already had. I even used the moisterizer during and after but that didn&#x27;t do much once the damage was already done. HATE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed. I&#x27;m almost 35 and have suffered from acne my whole life. I&#x27;ve been to many a dermatologist and tried countless medicines. Nothing ever got rid of my acne and I would never leave the house without makeup on. I got started on Murad when I got a facial. My skin felt great so I decided to give this 30 day kit a try. What did I have to lose? I also bought the color correcting moisturizer and overnight soothing gel. After a couple months of daily use, I have not had any of the bigger pustule zits in a while, my pores are looking smaller with fewer blackheads (not completely gone yet, hoping to see further improvement), and my skin is less blotchy. I am starting to feel like I might not have to wear makeup all the time, which is huge for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that you need to use a very small amount of the cleanser and gel as they&#x27;re very drying. I use the gel twice a day but sometimes skip it if my skin&#x27;s feeling especially dry. Also be sure to use moisturizer twice a day and liberally. I alternate between the one in this kit (which smells lovely) and the previously mentioned color correcting moisturizer (don&#x27;t be scared that it&#x27;s green; it blends right in).</li>
            <li> This set was purchased to be used when traveling and it is a great in size and a wonderful product.</li>
