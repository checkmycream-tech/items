    <ol>
            <li> I ordered both this masque and the Mint Julep.  This goes on super easy and dries just like mud, makes me feel like I have a spa right in my home. This masque comes HIGHLY recommended from me, along with the Mint Julep.</li>
            <li> Makes my face soft and cleans out the pores.  I alternate between the Mint and this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it makes my skin feel so smooth afterwards. Get the jar and not the tube. I have a hard time getting it all out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I would buy this product again, my costumers love it, easy to use and gives great results, it a quality product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why but it burns my face. I still left it on and the burning went away and once I washed it away my skin felt pretty soft. Gonna look for a better mask.</li>
            <li> I love this mud mask. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it is my favorite beauty item. It pulls all of the yucky stuff from your pores and leaves your face really soft.</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised. Don&#x27;t use too much or it will dry you out. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again. I&#x27;ve been using this for 8 years. I usually sleep and leave it on all night. I&#x27;m a 39 year old male and have no lines on eyes or forehead. If I start getting lines I&#x27;ll leave on twice in one week,usually every 3 days. Then the lines will disappear. Face feels tight.Not bad considering how cheap it is..</li>
            <li> Been using this for about for months. Love the feeling it gives after every use. You can literally feel your face tightening and smoothening out. I try to use it as often as I can as I apply it to my whole face and leave it on for 15-20 minutes (10 min). It does wonders drying out and healing any acne that appears.</li>
            <li> TThis mask makes my skin very soft. U can literally feel it cleansing your face, tiny tingle to it. Alot goes a long way too. My husband likes this as well. Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial for anyone. It has made my skin feel so soft &amp; clean &amp; not oily at all like most of my facials do afterwards. Try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Material is good.  Really tightens and goes on quite easily.  Feels refreshing when finished.  Seems like a good mask for the price point.</li>
            <li> Good price and quality!</li>
            <li> I live by this stuff!! For the price it&#x27;s amazing! Feels great while it&#x27;s on and after.. Oh my.. My face feels beautiful. I use it on my arms too because I have bumps there. Really good stuff! And the smell isn&#x27;t intense! Very soothing !</li>
            <li> Great u guys  :D ! , bigger than I thought when bought the item , smells great and makes your skin feel amazing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. Much easier to use &#x27;all of it&#x27; as opposed to the tubes which are really hard to squeeze. I like the mint julep mask a whole lot more and feel it does more for my skin but this is okay too. I&#x27;ll definitely finish the container but as far as buying it again... I think I like the cooling minty feel of the mint julep a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like a cool/mint feeling on your skin then this is the one you should go for. It seems to do the same as the julep mask as far as how it tightens your skin and pores sans the cool feeling.</li>
            <li> Product was what I expected and it is ust like I use to buy in the stores over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to use, easy to remove, and nice fragrance. It has quite a lot in the jar and will take some time to use up. But I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This mask makes your face feel clean and smooth.  After applying and waiting about 15-20 minutes it dies nicely.  I would say not to put too thick of a layer on your face, its a pain to remove if too thick.</li>
            <li> I love using this product on my face once a week for what I like to call pamper myself day. It feels wonderful and I feel my skin tighten. I cannot say anything bad about this as it&#x27;s done good for me.</li>
