            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>Glad I switched!</li>
            <li>but these Colgate toothbrushes clean just like I like -- in and around each tooth, leaving my teeth with that most excellent squeaky-clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Favorite toothbrush, good price on prime.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the Tung is as effective for tongue brushing as the 360, the pain it inflicts is counterproductive.</li>
            <li>The rubber bristles help get food particles out and feel nice to brush with, kind of massages the gums.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is so nice.</li>
            <li>Grip is nice I suppose too.</li>
            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than in stores (Target, drugstores, etc.) and a wonderful toothbrush.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes have the bristles designed for a great clean.</li>
            <li>I find this brush the most comfortable to use and works great every time.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth from receding gums, so I try my best to purchase \\&quot;Soft\\&quot; bristle toothbrushes.    </li>
            <li>They are my husband&#x27;s favorite kind of toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Good value for the convenience of having a supply of toothbrushes available.</li>
            <li>this is a great value and they are nice and sturdy but gentle.</li>
            <li>it is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are very comfortable to handle.  </li>
            <li>The advertised \\&quot;polishing cups\\&quot; (the pattern the brush bristles are assembled in) seems more like a gimmick than anything of practical use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, does what a toothbrush is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>If you have big hands, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>We love this toothbrush pack.</li>
            <li>Love these tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>and I love the assorted colors.</li>
            <li>Glad to have the convenience of Amazon.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are simple, but very great.</li>
            <li>food, well, food mostly</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes, I&#x27;ve used them for years.</li>
            <li>I have to replace it more often than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and i use this brush, so i guess it works if you use it:)</li>
            <li>I had a subscription and love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>But as soon as I started using Amazon more often, I found this</li>
            <li>buy this one for sure</li>
            <li>These brushes are wonderful out of the package - but they don&#x27;t seem to last</li>
            <li>I love subscribing to these necessities.</li>
            <li>I was always trying different ones and found these to be the best.</li>
            <li>Always nice to have a supply available for visitors etc.</li>
            <li>In the world of manual toothbrushes, there is none better.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite manual toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>More so than most medium brushes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Nice bristles and the handle is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>Cheaper is not all better.</li>
            <li>Clean pretty well (not the best buy pretty well).</li>
            <li>These brushes are too big for my mouth, but my husband finds them to be the perfect fit for his hands and mouth.</li>
            <li>You can use them to brush your teeth or clean things!  </li>
            <li>Shipped free which was even better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These don&#x27;t make it 2 weeks before becoming frayed.</li>
            <li>so soft seems to work great.</li>
            <li>Feels like you are really doing a good job in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>I like the bristle design and the special tongue brush!  </li>
            <li>Teeth feel just as clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>The tooth brush is a decent or actually good toothbrush</li>
            <li>Colgate 360 causes zero discomfort, does a superb job as a tongue brush and costs dollars less than the Tung.  </li>
            <li>but the head fits me just fine.</li>
            <li>If you have a mouth like a camel, these would be fine.</li>
            <li>Very consistent on delivery and their product line in top shelf</li>
            <li>The very first time I used a toothbrush from this package many bristles came out in my mouth.</li>
            <li>So comfortable, and the toothpaste foams up perfectly - sounds odd</li>
            <li>Love how full the brushes are, leaves my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>and I like how it makes my teeth feel smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they feel so smooth my mouth</li>
            <li>Fantastic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Such a great deal to get them in a value pack instead of buying them one by one.</li>
            <li>The scrubber on the back side feels great on the cheeks.</li>
            <li>Anyway it is cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for a month and so far so good.</li>
            <li>love that the back of the head also gives your cheeks and skin inside your mouth a good rub.</li>
            <li>but somehow I only need 1/4 of the toothpaste I used to apply to get a great clean brushing.  </li>
            <li>but if you dont need extra soft, these might work perfectly.</li>
            <li>I feel clean every night and morning.</li>
            <li>My teeth are clean.</li>
            <li>It has a good feel in the hand and is more than what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>The Colgate 360 Degree Adult Full Head soft tooth brush is a very good product.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that i was buying full headed toothbrushes when I purchased these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t like those toothbrushes with tiny heads), and the handle is fairly ergonomic.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve found lately.</li>
            <li>simply put these have a good wear pattern and do NOT leave my teeth scuzzy</li>
            <li>the plus side is I have never had my teeth and gums feel so clean so quickly.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good toothbrush, look no further.</li>
            <li>This four-pack is priced right, they work well for me, the brush is comfortable in my hand, and the heads don&#x27;t fall apart in the six weeks</li>
            <li>The head is relatively big which speeds things up and provides a more satisfying clean.  </li>
            <li>Makes brushing your tongue pretty quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that they have the two swirl heads, and fit comfortable in your mouth.</li>
            <li>4 great toothbrushes at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The actual brush end was really top notch as it got the top and sides of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Love these, we always buy them, normally in a pack of 2 and on sale.</li>
            <li>also clean well, dry better (IMO) &amp; the tongue cleaning feature, while not a must, is still better than using the bristles...</li>
            <li>Lasted exactly the time it should and even had a comfortable grip.</li>
            <li>The handles are large and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are fantastic, really leave my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Seemed economical and it was a quick solution to my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The have handles, bristles, and pretty colors!</li>
            <li>Note this particular package is full size heads, which are huge to me.</li>
            <li>I do just want to make you aware that they are full head toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and love the feature of the tongue cleaner.</li>
            <li>Have tried switching to soft several times, and found this Colgate toothbrush to be a happy alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>360 degree feature seems to clean the tooth surface far better &amp; its gentle on my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are soft and the head is wide, giving a great clean.</li>
            <li>get the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; &amp; they are just right.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a big deal, though, since my husband is fine with full heads, and I bought them for him anyway!  </li>
            <li>I really feel like you can get right in your gob and clean out all the crevices.  </li>
            <li>Many of the ones that say full head are as skimpy as regular sizes.</li>
            <li>The handle design makes it very easy to roll the brush in the proper motion on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The price was pretty good on these, but we have been told by the dentist to use soft bristle brushes to be gentle to our gums and these are not the normal \\&quot;soft\\&quot; we are used to.  </li>
            <li>The head of this toothbrush is very large....</li>
            <li>have a large mouth and big teeth so quite like the size of the head, more efficient, and comfortable</li>
            <li>I have never found that silicone textured-pad on the back of the toothbrush head all that useful, and tend to use the toothbrush bristles to clean my tongue; however, if you are one of those people who use this feature, know that it is available on this brand of toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have switch to a different style for different needs but these are great to have on hand for visitors who need a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Not sure if they&#x27;re cheaper here than in the store, but was a good stocking stuffer and they came in quick.</li>
            <li>I love them and will definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li>It is really misleading!</li>
            <li>I like to use a toothbrush with a light medium bristle but our family dentist keeps harping on switching to brushes with a soft bristle.</li>
            <li>The first time buying toothbrushes from Amazon...</li>
            <li>Cheaper than buying individually at Duane reade :)</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t understand how they are classed as &amp;#34;soft.&amp;#34;  They provide a pretty aggressive brush.  </li>
            <li>This is my personal favorite for a manual toothbrush and the one my office recommends.  </li>
            <li>I use this brush for more then 4 years now and never change to any different brand or kind.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans</li>
            <li>I switched them out on about a monthly basis, and they clean my teeth, gums, and mouth better than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>just plain feels good in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that this 4-pack is available through Amazon&#x27;s &amp;#34;Add-on program&amp;#34; and that the free Prime shipping extends to military APO/FPO addresses.  </li>
            <li>Nice big soft toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>It also does very well to protect your gums as the bristles are soft and soft bristles are what most dentists recommend when brushing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li>toothbrush - if you are looking for soft / full head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Colgate 360 Full Head Toothbrush with Soft bristles does very well when it comes to cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li>They last a good long time</li>
            <li>I like a large head on my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Smart purchase people.</li>
            <li>It has a large wide head, that is flexible and has very soft, comfortable bristtles at varying heights that can cover and clean pretty much every corner of your mouth.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t share a bathroom and you&#x27;re buying these to use for yourself the blue handle theme works fine.  </li>
            <li>But this is much cheaper and with a subscribtion you save 15%.</li>
            <li>I really like these toothbrushes</li>
            <li>They work really well.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing another pack very soon.</li>
            <li>Even though I tried to brush as light as possible, it still created the scratches all over my gum and cheek.</li>
            <li>that is all I really need from a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are working out very well for me.</li>
            <li>It could just as well be straight.</li>
            <li>very long.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>Really gets in all the nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li>You had to look closely to see the difference between the four in the set since blue was the primary color of all four.  </li>
            <li>That is no longer the case so these are now much easier to identify.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i buy the same item over and over and compare to other supermarket like Walgreen, Walmart price is really good here.</li>
            <li>The only toothbrush on earth that rational people will ever use to clean their maw.</li>
            <li>As long as you brush it, your teeth will be fine.</li>
            <li>On the opposite side of the brush are grooves that clean your gums as you brush.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try the full head instead of compact, but these are way too big.</li>
            <li>Other than this minor annoyance they are good brushes.</li>
            <li>The fineness is soft enough that it is not too abrasive, but not so fine that it accomplishes nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush heads are probably too large for kids and young teens, but I like them for the adults in the house!</li>
            <li>, I can grip this one better in my slightly arthritic hand.</li>
            <li>This particular brand and style was recommended to me by my dental hygienist.</li>
            <li>Most &#x27;soft&#x27; style toothbrushes feel like trying to brush with a wet paper towel...</li>
            <li>Tongue scrubber is decent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft like the Dentist recommends, and they clean my teeth, especially when I use them with toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This is the easy way to get toothbrushes and save the other $40 you&#x27;ll spend at the store just going in to get them.</li>
            <li>If you are on the hunt for an ultra-soft and gentle toothbrush -but find children&#x27;s toothbrushes to be too soft-</li>
            <li>Dentists tell you to go with soft because it doesn&#x27;t matter how much pressure you put on your teeth..</li>
            <li>The tongue scrubber on the back of the brush is a useful and neat feature</li>
            <li>I have a small mouth and this toothbrush has a nice sized head, soft bristles and</li>
            <li>so won&#x27;t damage your enamel and hurt your gums, but firm enough to last a reasonable amount of time and give you a good clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just returned from a year-long trip that took me around the jungles and beaches of Papua New Guinea, and this product was part of my pack.  </li>
            <li>so I remember to throw out our toothbrushes and use new every 4 months or so.</li>
            <li>They do a great job reaching the back teeth, and behind them.  </li>
            <li>Very soft which is how I like my toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft enough and the price is surely right.</li>
            <li>These are soft, large bristles with a large soft tongue cleaner on the back (which I like).</li>
            <li>The Colgate 360 Degree toothbrush is fairly similar to most other toothbrushes on the market.</li>
            <li>The bristle design hits more gum-line than what I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>I normally use medium but was told by my dentist to use soft.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if they got the product back or if the new tenants are loving them now though...</li>
            <li>you have similar conditions and are looking for a decent, economical toothbrush for daily use, I recommend these.</li>
            <li>I purchased the \\&quot;Colgate 360 Degree Adult Full-Head &#x27;Soft&#x27; Toothbrush, 4-Count\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It is by far the softest adult toothbrush I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t soft in the beginning, but decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy it hoping it will be soft.</li>
            <li>COST TOO MUCH TO PACK UP AND SEND BACK.</li>
            <li>A lot of dentists recommend soft toothbrushes which is why I ended up buying these.</li>
            <li>And the bristles are truly soft.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a SOFT colgate 360 degree from this seller and after I used for one time my gum and my mouth got all wounded.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is a SOFT toothbush.</li>
            <li>Soft head tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>There is no way to interpret these bristles as soft.</li>
            <li>soft</li>
            <li>got an 8-pk in a big box store and tried a few more before the rest wound up in my garage tool collection.</li>
            <li>I thought at first it was just a loose bristle.</li>
            <li>I do like the 4 colors (green, blue, purple, pink) and the soft (better for your teeth!)</li>
            <li>I brush for no less than a minute each time.</li>
            <li>The same is true if you&#x27;re having these shipped to a military address</li>
            <li>They are a little harder than I expected, but they are good and get in between teeth well.</li>
            <li>really well very soft and also i like tongue clear on the other side.</li>
            <li>I find because this has a noticeably bigger handle than the toothbrushes I normally have</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive teeth and these are soft enough to not bother them.</li>
            <li>As far as toothbrushes go, this toothbrush is of your standard fare variety.</li>
            <li>We have been using the 360 soft for years, but we are definitely switching brands now.</li>
            <li>When I moved the last pack went to my old residence so I did not get them.</li>
            <li>I recently swapped to these from the freebie Oral B so called &#x27;soft&#x27; toothbrushes given me by my dentist.</li>
            <li>I did not like the slightly bent handle at first, but I soon got used to it.</li>
            <li>Due to the softness of the bristles, the toothbrush wore out faster (about a month of regular use) and did not seem to clean my teeth as adequately as other \\&quot;soft\\&quot; bristle toothbrushes.    </li>
            <li>As for my choice of tooth cleaning substances to use with it I will just say study long and far.</li>
            <li>As I have fingers and a hand on a wrist, I can angle a straight handle just as well as this slightly bent handle.</li>

            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> Glad I switched!</li>
            <li> but these Colgate toothbrushes clean just like I like -- in and around each tooth, leaving my teeth with that most excellent squeaky-clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Favorite toothbrush, good price on prime.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the Tung is as effective for tongue brushing as the 360, the pain it inflicts is counterproductive.</li>
            <li> The rubber bristles help get food particles out and feel nice to brush with, kind of massages the gums.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is so nice.</li>
            <li> Grip is nice I suppose too.</li>
            <li> Nice</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than in stores (Target, drugstores, etc.) and a wonderful toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes have the bristles designed for a great clean.</li>
            <li> I find this brush the most comfortable to use and works great every time.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth from receding gums, so I try my best to purchase \\&quot;Soft\\&quot; bristle toothbrushes.    </li>
            <li> They are my husband&#x27;s favorite kind of toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Good value for the convenience of having a supply of toothbrushes available.</li>
            <li> this is a great value and they are nice and sturdy but gentle.</li>
            <li> it is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are very comfortable to handle.  </li>
            <li> The advertised \\&quot;polishing cups\\&quot; (the pattern the brush bristles are assembled in) seems more like a gimmick than anything of practical use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, does what a toothbrush is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If you have big hands, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> We love this toothbrush pack.</li>
            <li> Love these tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> and I love the assorted colors.</li>
            <li> Glad to have the convenience of Amazon.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are simple, but very great.</li>
            <li> food, well, food mostly</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes, I&#x27;ve used them for years.</li>
            <li> I have to replace it more often than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and i use this brush, so i guess it works if you use it:)</li>
            <li> I had a subscription and love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> But as soon as I started using Amazon more often, I found this</li>
            <li> buy this one for sure</li>
            <li> These brushes are wonderful out of the package - but they don&#x27;t seem to last</li>
            <li> I love subscribing to these necessities.</li>
            <li> I was always trying different ones and found these to be the best.</li>
            <li> Always nice to have a supply available for visitors etc.</li>
            <li> In the world of manual toothbrushes, there is none better.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite manual toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> More so than most medium brushes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Nice bristles and the handle is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Cheaper is not all better.</li>
            <li> Clean pretty well (not the best buy pretty well).</li>
            <li> These brushes are too big for my mouth, but my husband finds them to be the perfect fit for his hands and mouth.</li>
            <li> You can use them to brush your teeth or clean things!  </li>
            <li> Shipped free which was even better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These don&#x27;t make it 2 weeks before becoming frayed.</li>
            <li> so soft seems to work great.</li>
            <li> Feels like you are really doing a good job in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I like the bristle design and the special tongue brush!  </li>
            <li> Teeth feel just as clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> The tooth brush is a decent or actually good toothbrush</li>
            <li> Colgate 360 causes zero discomfort, does a superb job as a tongue brush and costs dollars less than the Tung.  </li>
            <li> but the head fits me just fine.</li>
            <li> If you have a mouth like a camel, these would be fine.</li>
            <li> Very consistent on delivery and their product line in top shelf</li>
            <li> The very first time I used a toothbrush from this package many bristles came out in my mouth.</li>
            <li> So comfortable, and the toothpaste foams up perfectly - sounds odd</li>
            <li> Love how full the brushes are, leaves my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> and I like how it makes my teeth feel smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they feel so smooth my mouth</li>
            <li> Fantastic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Such a great deal to get them in a value pack instead of buying them one by one.</li>
            <li> The scrubber on the back side feels great on the cheeks.</li>
            <li> Anyway it is cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a month and so far so good.</li>
            <li> love that the back of the head also gives your cheeks and skin inside your mouth a good rub.</li>
            <li> but somehow I only need 1/4 of the toothpaste I used to apply to get a great clean brushing.  </li>
            <li> but if you dont need extra soft, these might work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I feel clean every night and morning.</li>
            <li> My teeth are clean.</li>
            <li> It has a good feel in the hand and is more than what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> The Colgate 360 Degree Adult Full Head soft tooth brush is a very good product.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that i was buying full headed toothbrushes when I purchased these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t like those toothbrushes with tiny heads), and the handle is fairly ergonomic.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve found lately.</li>
            <li> simply put these have a good wear pattern and do NOT leave my teeth scuzzy</li>
            <li> the plus side is I have never had my teeth and gums feel so clean so quickly.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good toothbrush, look no further.</li>
            <li> This four-pack is priced right, they work well for me, the brush is comfortable in my hand, and the heads don&#x27;t fall apart in the six weeks</li>
            <li> The head is relatively big which speeds things up and provides a more satisfying clean.  </li>
            <li> Makes brushing your tongue pretty quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that they have the two swirl heads, and fit comfortable in your mouth.</li>
            <li> 4 great toothbrushes at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The actual brush end was really top notch as it got the top and sides of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Love these, we always buy them, normally in a pack of 2 and on sale.</li>
            <li> also clean well, dry better (IMO) &amp; the tongue cleaning feature, while not a must, is still better than using the bristles...</li>
            <li> Lasted exactly the time it should and even had a comfortable grip.</li>
            <li> The handles are large and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are fantastic, really leave my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Seemed economical and it was a quick solution to my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The have handles, bristles, and pretty colors!</li>
            <li> Note this particular package is full size heads, which are huge to me.</li>
            <li> I do just want to make you aware that they are full head toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and love the feature of the tongue cleaner.</li>
            <li> Have tried switching to soft several times, and found this Colgate toothbrush to be a happy alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 360 degree feature seems to clean the tooth surface far better &amp; its gentle on my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are soft and the head is wide, giving a great clean.</li>
            <li> get the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; &amp; they are just right.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a big deal, though, since my husband is fine with full heads, and I bought them for him anyway!  </li>
            <li> I really feel like you can get right in your gob and clean out all the crevices.  </li>
            <li> Many of the ones that say full head are as skimpy as regular sizes.</li>
            <li> The handle design makes it very easy to roll the brush in the proper motion on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The price was pretty good on these, but we have been told by the dentist to use soft bristle brushes to be gentle to our gums and these are not the normal \\&quot;soft\\&quot; we are used to.  </li>
            <li> The head of this toothbrush is very large....</li>
            <li> have a large mouth and big teeth so quite like the size of the head, more efficient, and comfortable</li>
            <li> I have never found that silicone textured-pad on the back of the toothbrush head all that useful, and tend to use the toothbrush bristles to clean my tongue; however, if you are one of those people who use this feature, know that it is available on this brand of toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have switch to a different style for different needs but these are great to have on hand for visitors who need a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they&#x27;re cheaper here than in the store, but was a good stocking stuffer and they came in quick.</li>
            <li> I love them and will definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> It is really misleading!</li>
            <li> I like to use a toothbrush with a light medium bristle but our family dentist keeps harping on switching to brushes with a soft bristle.</li>
            <li> The first time buying toothbrushes from Amazon...</li>
            <li> Cheaper than buying individually at Duane reade :)</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t understand how they are classed as &amp;#34;soft.&amp;#34;  They provide a pretty aggressive brush.  </li>
            <li> This is my personal favorite for a manual toothbrush and the one my office recommends.  </li>
            <li> I use this brush for more then 4 years now and never change to any different brand or kind.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans</li>
            <li> I switched them out on about a monthly basis, and they clean my teeth, gums, and mouth better than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> just plain feels good in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that this 4-pack is available through Amazon&#x27;s &amp;#34;Add-on program&amp;#34; and that the free Prime shipping extends to military APO/FPO addresses.  </li>
            <li> Nice big soft toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It also does very well to protect your gums as the bristles are soft and soft bristles are what most dentists recommend when brushing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li> toothbrush - if you are looking for soft / full head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Colgate 360 Full Head Toothbrush with Soft bristles does very well when it comes to cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> They last a good long time</li>
            <li> I like a large head on my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Smart purchase people.</li>
            <li> It has a large wide head, that is flexible and has very soft, comfortable bristtles at varying heights that can cover and clean pretty much every corner of your mouth.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t share a bathroom and you&#x27;re buying these to use for yourself the blue handle theme works fine.  </li>
            <li> But this is much cheaper and with a subscribtion you save 15%.</li>
            <li> I really like these toothbrushes</li>
            <li> They work really well.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> I plan on purchasing another pack very soon.</li>
            <li> Even though I tried to brush as light as possible, it still created the scratches all over my gum and cheek.</li>
            <li> that is all I really need from a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are working out very well for me.</li>
            <li> It could just as well be straight.</li>
            <li> very long.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> Really gets in all the nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li> You had to look closely to see the difference between the four in the set since blue was the primary color of all four.  </li>
            <li> That is no longer the case so these are now much easier to identify.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i buy the same item over and over and compare to other supermarket like Walgreen, Walmart price is really good here.</li>
            <li> The only toothbrush on earth that rational people will ever use to clean their maw.</li>
            <li> As long as you brush it, your teeth will be fine.</li>
            <li> On the opposite side of the brush are grooves that clean your gums as you brush.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try the full head instead of compact, but these are way too big.</li>
            <li> Other than this minor annoyance they are good brushes.</li>
            <li> The fineness is soft enough that it is not too abrasive, but not so fine that it accomplishes nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush heads are probably too large for kids and young teens, but I like them for the adults in the house!</li>
            <li> , I can grip this one better in my slightly arthritic hand.</li>
            <li> This particular brand and style was recommended to me by my dental hygienist.</li>
            <li> Most &#x27;soft&#x27; style toothbrushes feel like trying to brush with a wet paper towel...</li>
            <li> Tongue scrubber is decent.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft like the Dentist recommends, and they clean my teeth, especially when I use them with toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is the easy way to get toothbrushes and save the other $40 you&#x27;ll spend at the store just going in to get them.</li>
            <li> If you are on the hunt for an ultra-soft and gentle toothbrush -but find children&#x27;s toothbrushes to be too soft-</li>
            <li> Dentists tell you to go with soft because it doesn&#x27;t matter how much pressure you put on your teeth..</li>
            <li> The tongue scrubber on the back of the brush is a useful and neat feature</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and this toothbrush has a nice sized head, soft bristles and</li>
            <li> so won&#x27;t damage your enamel and hurt your gums, but firm enough to last a reasonable amount of time and give you a good clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just returned from a year-long trip that took me around the jungles and beaches of Papua New Guinea, and this product was part of my pack.  </li>
            <li> so I remember to throw out our toothbrushes and use new every 4 months or so.</li>
            <li> They do a great job reaching the back teeth, and behind them.  </li>
            <li> Very soft which is how I like my toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft enough and the price is surely right.</li>
            <li> These are soft, large bristles with a large soft tongue cleaner on the back (which I like).</li>
            <li> The Colgate 360 Degree toothbrush is fairly similar to most other toothbrushes on the market.</li>
            <li> The bristle design hits more gum-line than what I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I normally use medium but was told by my dentist to use soft.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if they got the product back or if the new tenants are loving them now though...</li>
            <li> you have similar conditions and are looking for a decent, economical toothbrush for daily use, I recommend these.</li>
            <li> I purchased the \\&quot;Colgate 360 Degree Adult Full-Head &#x27;Soft&#x27; Toothbrush, 4-Count\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It is by far the softest adult toothbrush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t soft in the beginning, but decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it hoping it will be soft.</li>
            <li> COST TOO MUCH TO PACK UP AND SEND BACK.</li>
            <li> A lot of dentists recommend soft toothbrushes which is why I ended up buying these.</li>
            <li> And the bristles are truly soft.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a SOFT colgate 360 degree from this seller and after I used for one time my gum and my mouth got all wounded.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a SOFT toothbush.</li>
            <li> Soft head tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> There is no way to interpret these bristles as soft.</li>
            <li> soft</li>
            <li> got an 8-pk in a big box store and tried a few more before the rest wound up in my garage tool collection.</li>
            <li> I thought at first it was just a loose bristle.</li>
            <li> I do like the 4 colors (green, blue, purple, pink) and the soft (better for your teeth!)</li>
            <li> I brush for no less than a minute each time.</li>
            <li> The same is true if you&#x27;re having these shipped to a military address</li>
            <li> They are a little harder than I expected, but they are good and get in between teeth well.</li>
            <li> really well very soft and also i like tongue clear on the other side.</li>
            <li> I find because this has a noticeably bigger handle than the toothbrushes I normally have</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive teeth and these are soft enough to not bother them.</li>
            <li> As far as toothbrushes go, this toothbrush is of your standard fare variety.</li>
            <li> We have been using the 360 soft for years, but we are definitely switching brands now.</li>
            <li> When I moved the last pack went to my old residence so I did not get them.</li>
            <li> I recently swapped to these from the freebie Oral B so called &#x27;soft&#x27; toothbrushes given me by my dentist.</li>
            <li> I did not like the slightly bent handle at first, but I soon got used to it.</li>
            <li> Due to the softness of the bristles, the toothbrush wore out faster (about a month of regular use) and did not seem to clean my teeth as adequately as other \\&quot;soft\\&quot; bristle toothbrushes.    </li>
            <li> As for my choice of tooth cleaning substances to use with it I will just say study long and far.</li>
            <li> As I have fingers and a hand on a wrist, I can angle a straight handle just as well as this slightly bent handle.</li>
            <li> I will note that I did not find the toothbrush head to be too large (as some reviewers have been stating), and dentist&#x27;s have told me that I have a small mouth.    </li>
            <li> Not like other brushes that claim to be soft yet feel , well, not soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I could subscribe to delivery on Amazon because they are getting harder to find in stores, which is sad.  </li>
            <li> Only improvement would be superficial - allow for buying packs of single selectable colors.</li>
            <li> Strange feeling on the walls of your cheeks with this brush.  </li>
            <li> Not soft.</li>
            <li> Remember to always get Soft bristles because medium and firm are way too abrasive on your gums and enamel.</li>
            <li> I am much less likely to pick up a toothbrush that isn&#x27;t mine if the handles are different colors.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive but it is worthwhile.</li>
            <li> One single brush doesn&#x27;t do everything I need, so I buy both colgate 360 and numbus.</li>
            <li> Also the little tongue scraper dealy on the back of the head only makes the large size worse.</li>
            <li> In general, I find the Colgate 360 Degree to be a bit of a waste of money, and too \\&quot;soft\\&quot; for my liking.</li>
            <li> The handle is a bit small and fragile feeling so guys with larger hands might not like this.</li>
            <li> Each handle was blue and white with small color accents.  </li>
            <li> And, while you want toothbrush bristles to not be so hard in texture they damage teeth and gums, the Colgate 360 Degree toothbrush was so soft it almost felt like a children&#x27;s toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint with the Colgate 360 Degree toothbrush is the softness of the bristles, I think the bristles of this toothbrush are too soft.</li>
            <li> Although, i never really use the scrubber on the backside.</li>
            <li> The part that is rough on the reverse side of the brush head rips apart my lips and mouth as I brush.  </li>
            <li> I discovered these toothbrushes a few years back</li>
            <li> Not much else</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> because they are soft and a lot of times I&#x27;ve bought other tooth brushes and they are often too hard for my gums.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what happened to the trusted Colgate name here, but this was a complete waste.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth, and I think I&#x27;ll need to switch, because this is so big and wide</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve bitten other stuff like shoe laces, potato chip bags</li>
            <li> other brushes, I can switch when I run out of our smallish tube of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you suffer from inflammation to your gums or or are hyper-sensitive, there are other softer brushes out there.</li>
            <li> I ended up at the store today buying \\&quot;extra soft\\&quot; brushes and feeling a little bummed out that I wasted the money...</li>
            <li> My wife and I both know not to brush too hard, but even still the bristles come off, get suck in our teeth and the toothbrush needs to be thrown away earlier than warranted.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re intending to use these in a common shared bathroom toothbrush holder you might want to consider if the slight color variations on the toothbrush heads are enough to help you identify whose is whose.  </li>
            <li> My one problem with these toothbrushes is the fact that they roll if you try to put toothpaste on it and put it down on the counter.</li>
            <li> Whenever my friends are over, I&#x27;m all like, &amp;#34;Yo G, these clean my teeth like you can&#x27;t even imagine.&amp;#34; Too bad my friends are imaginary.</li>
            <li> Half the price of Walmart</li>
            <li> but i felt i wore out the bristles to soon about a month and a half for me.</li>
            <li> If you ever find yourself frustrated by &amp;#34;Free&amp;#34; toothbrushes you get at the dentist with small narrow heads, this is the exact opposite.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really like a toothbrush with bristles that get in and around each tooth with a little scrubbing power.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember ever having cleaner-feeling teeth with so little effort.</li>
            <li> Decided to replace my battery-operated vibrating brush with these to save on waste - the battery - and money.</li>
            <li> Its a toothbrush, I like the shape of the bristles as they round my teeth.</li>
            <li> dont waste yuor money on anything else.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the main thing I look for with toothbrushes, and these totally cover that base.</li>
            <li> Toothbrust is not easy to handle.</li>
            <li> They do wear out fairly quickly, and I do hate the waste of all that plastic going in the trash every month.  </li>
            <li> I have a fairly small mouth (though I run it all the time)</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;m just not as observant as some when it comes to small details like the color variations in these toothbrush bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Worst when the handle gets wet - it becomes very slippery.</li>
            <li> and I have had a hard time using anything since!  </li>
            <li> Really never too bad to have toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d hate to purchase them individually.</li>
            <li> I give it 2 stars for a poor handle design since it made me quit brushing before I reached my desired goal.</li>
            <li> Falsely labeled.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes have an awful taste, like a new car smell but on your tongue...</li>
            <li> By far the worst toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Colgate.</li>
            <li> The curve design makes it difficult for my medium size hand to keep it in place.</li>
            <li> Difficult to hold on to while brushing teeth.  </li>
            <li> It is very irritating to the gums.</li>
            <li> After 2 months of use, one of my teeth has eroded and it&#x27;s painful.</li>
            <li> Worst toothbrush</li>
            <li> It was completely disgusting and something that should not happen with a brand like Colgate.</li>
            <li> After just 20 seconds, my wrist aches terribly trying to hold onto the handle.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased the \\&quot;Colgate 360 Degree Adult Full-Head &#x27;Soft&#x27; Toothbrush, 4-Count\\&quot;. I have sensitive teeth from receding gums, so I try my best to purchase \\&quot;Soft\\&quot; bristle toothbrushes.    The Colgate 360 Degree toothbrush is fairly similar to most other toothbrushes on the market. It has silicone grips on the handle, as well as a silicone-like material on the back of the toothbrush head for cleaning the tongue and cheek area. I have never found that silicone textured-pad on the back of the toothbrush head all that useful, and tend to use the toothbrush bristles to clean my tongue; however, if you are one of those people who use this feature, know that it is available on this brand of toothbrush. The advertised \\&quot;polishing cups\\&quot; (the pattern the brush bristles are assembled in) seems more like a gimmick than anything of practical use. I will note that I did not find the toothbrush head to be too large (as some reviewers have been stating), and dentist&#x27;s have told me that I have a small mouth.    As far as toothbrushes go, this toothbrush is of your standard fare variety. My biggest complaint with the Colgate 360 Degree toothbrush is the softness of the bristles, I think the bristles of this toothbrush are too soft. I have noticed that every toothbrush brand seems to have a different version of \\&quot;soft\\&quot; on the market. And, while you want toothbrush bristles to not be so hard in texture they damage teeth and gums, the Colgate 360 Degree toothbrush was so soft it almost felt like a children&#x27;s toothbrush. It is by far the softest adult toothbrush I have ever used. Due to the softness of the bristles, the toothbrush wore out faster (about a month of regular use) and did not seem to clean my teeth as adequately as other \\&quot;soft\\&quot; bristle toothbrushes.    In general, I find the Colgate 360 Degree to be a bit of a waste of money, and too \\&quot;soft\\&quot; for my liking. If you are on the hunt for an ultra-soft and gentle toothbrush -but find children&#x27;s toothbrushes to be too soft- this might bethe toothbrush for you; it just simply was not the toothbrush for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, does what a toothbrush is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with my teeth until now. When I bought this manual toothbrush I hoped it would work as advertised - &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;. It wasn&#x27;t soft in the beginning, but decided to give it a try. After 2 months of use, one of my teeth has eroded and it&#x27;s painful. Don&#x27;t buy it hoping it will be soft. Big mistake.</li>
            <li> Love these, we always buy them, normally in a pack of 2 and on sale. But this is much cheaper and with a subscribtion you save 15%.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. This particular brand and style was recommended to me by my dental hygienist. I took her word for it an gave it a try. It Seems she did know about tooth brushes so kudos for her! As for my choice of tooth cleaning substances to use with it I will just say study long and far. Good Brushing!</li>
            <li> I really like these toothbrushes because they are soft and a lot of times I&#x27;ve bought other tooth brushes and they are often too hard for my gums.  These are just perfect.</li>
            <li> I have been using the 360 toothbrushes for over 5 years now, and I can tell you one thing. They make my teeth feel like they&#x27;ve been brushed. They&#x27;re soft like the Dentist recommends, and they clean my teeth, especially when I use them with toothpaste. Whenever my friends are over, I&#x27;m all like, &amp;#34;Yo G, these clean my teeth like you can&#x27;t even imagine.&amp;#34; Too bad my friends are imaginary. Colgate 360, you have won my mouth over and over. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Nice big soft toothbrushes. Makes brushing your tongue pretty quick and easy.</li>
            <li> some good intentions were made with this toothbrush</li>
            <li> Great tooth brushes! Perfect softness.</li>
            <li> Love how full the brushes are, leaves my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they&#x27;re cheaper here than in the store, but was a good stocking stuffer and they came in quick. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Colgate.</li>
            <li> This pack is the best deal for toothbrush. The quality is superb, cleans our teeth really well and based on my self-conducted survey at home, this is the best toothbrush they&#x27;ve all ever used. It feels good on the teeth, gums and tongue to brush with these great toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The handle design makes it very easy to roll the brush in the proper motion on my teeth.  thank you</li>
            <li> The price was pretty good on these, but we have been told by the dentist to use soft bristle brushes to be gentle to our gums and these are not the normal \\&quot;soft\\&quot; we are used to.  I ended up at the store today buying \\&quot;extra soft\\&quot; brushes and feeling a little bummed out that I wasted the money... but if you dont need extra soft, these might work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrushes; no complaints.</li>
            <li> These brushes are too big for my mouth, but my husband finds them to be the perfect fit for his hands and mouth. If you have big hands, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I OPENED THEM  AND NONE OF TOOTHBRUSHS WORKED! ONCE YOU OPENED THE PACKAGE YOUR SCREWED. COST TOO MUCH TO PACK UP AND SEND BACK. HAD TO USE AS A REGULAR TOOTHBRUSH.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re toothbrushes. What can you expect.</li>
            <li> Favorite toothbrush, good price on prime.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrushes. But they&#x27;re just a tad big for my taste.</li>
            <li> A lot of dentists recommend soft toothbrushes which is why I ended up buying these. Love them! Great price for this product. The handle is a bit small and fragile feeling so guys with larger hands might not like this.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that i was buying full headed toothbrushes when I purchased these toothbrushes.  It wasn&#x27;t a big deal, though, since my husband is fine with full heads, and I bought them for him anyway!  These toothbrushes are awesome.  They are my husband&#x27;s favorite kind of toothbrush.  I am happy with my purchase.  I do just want to make you aware that they are full head toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> We love this toothbrush pack. The tongue scrubber on the back of the brush is a useful and neat feature</li>
            <li> The Colgate 360 Full Head Toothbrush with Soft bristles does very well when it comes to cleaning your teeth. It also does very well to protect your gums as the bristles are soft and soft bristles are what most dentists recommend when brushing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li> these are the best toothbrushes by war for the price, they&#x27;ve got a good grip and clean well. Although, i never really use the scrubber on the backside.</li>
            <li> Decided to replace my battery-operated vibrating brush with these to save on waste - the battery - and money. I&#x27;ve been using these for a month and so far so good. Teeth feel just as clean and healthy. I also have sensitive teeth and these are soft enough to not bother them. The &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34; bits to help scrape and polish do a good job too. Glad I switched!</li>
            <li> My husband refuses to use anything else but these... he likes them.</li>
            <li> Love these tooth brushes. I really like the fact that they have the two swirl heads, and fit comfortable in your mouth. When you are brushing it feels like a battery operated tooth brush. I would even say that these tooth brushes feel as though you are going to the dentist every time. I love them and will definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes have an awful taste, like a new car smell but on your tongue... Every time I use them, I worry that I am being poisoned</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are fantastic, really leave my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a ton of surface area for bristles, these are the ones. That&#x27;s the main thing I look for with toothbrushes, and these totally cover that base.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are the perfect size. They last a good long time and I love the assorted colors. The rubber grips are well-placed and have a good tacky feel.&lt;br /&gt;...4 great toothbrushes at such a reasonable price. What a great value!</li>
            <li> The only toothbrush on earth that rational people will ever use to clean their maw.</li>
            <li> Great value. They work really well. They are comfortable to hold. Clean pretty well (not the best buy pretty well). My one problem with these toothbrushes is the fact that they roll if you try to put toothpaste on it and put it down on the counter. The back of the toothbrush is rounded. Other than this minor annoyance they are good brushes.</li>
            <li> These are my go-to toothbrushes and have been using them for years. The bristles are soft and love the feature of the tongue cleaner. Glad to have the convenience of Amazon.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT SO MUCH, IT IS PURTTEY GOOD, I ean iit is very good so nice and good to eat!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush! I like the bristle design and the special tongue brush!  This toothbrush is an excellent value!</li>
            <li> You know you want to! These toothbrushes are simple, but very great. I plan on purchasing another pack very soon.</li>
            <li> im a biter, i like to bite things. food, well, food mostly but i&#x27;ve bitten other stuff like shoe laces, potato chip bags and once i bit a rubber tree leaf because it looked yummy. these brushes help keep my teeth in good biting condition.</li>
            <li> Same brushes that you&#x27;ll find at Walgreens for 5 dollars for one brush. I find this brush the most comfortable to use and works great every time.</li>
            <li> I like the handle it is very comfortable.  They are a little harder than I expected, but they are good and get in between teeth well.</li>
            <li> Each toothbrush at a convenience store is about $5... this is a great value and they are nice and sturdy but gentle. love it</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened to the trusted Colgate name here, but this was a complete waste. My wife and I both know not to brush too hard, but even still the bristles come off, get suck in our teeth and the toothbrush needs to be thrown away earlier than warranted. We are going back to Reach!</li>
            <li> Strange feeling on the walls of your cheeks with this brush.  Feels like you are really doing a good job in your mouth.  And the bristles are truly soft.  Not like other brushes that claim to be soft yet feel , well, not soft.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Very consistent on delivery and their product line in top shelf</li>
            <li> Our dentist gives these out at every cleaning.  Of course, one brush doesn&#x27;t last for 6 months, so we buy these packs to tide us over.  They do a great job reaching the back teeth, and behind them.  They do wear out fairly quickly, and I do hate the waste of all that plastic going in the trash every month.  Frankly though, I think this is still the best alternative out there.</li>
            <li> Been using this model for a while now. It has great coverage (I don&#x27;t like those toothbrushes with tiny heads), and the handle is fairly ergonomic. They&#x27;re also durable.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t Buy!!!! I ordered a SOFT colgate 360 degree from this seller and after I used for one time my gum and my mouth got all wounded. I don&#x27;t think this is a SOFT toothbush. It is really misleading! Even though I tried to brush as light as possible, it still created the scratches all over my gum and cheek. I stopped using it since the second try, because it destroyed my mouth. Don&#x27;t Buy this!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrushes. The bristle design hits more gum-line than what I&#x27;ve used in the past. It has a good feel in the hand and is more than what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> The Nimbus toothbrush is gentler; it has a thinned bristle arrangement that is perfect for brushing gum line and effectively cleaning perio pockets.  However, Colgate 360 outperforms Nimbus for brushing away plaque and I like how it makes my teeth feel smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the Tung is as effective for tongue brushing as the 360, the pain it inflicts is counterproductive. Colgate 360 causes zero discomfort, does a superb job as a tongue brush and costs dollars less than the Tung.  The 4-pack 360 is cheaper than singles and since these are hit and miss locally, I buy them on amazon. One single brush doesn&#x27;t do everything I need, so I buy both colgate 360 and numbus.</li>
            <li> Product as described. No complaints at all!</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes, I&#x27;ve used them for years.</li>
            <li> I just returned from a year-long trip that took me around the jungles and beaches of Papua New Guinea, and this product was part of my pack.  I switched them out on about a monthly basis, and they clean my teeth, gums, and mouth better than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.  I&#x27;m very impressed, and they feel great in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the back of the head also gives your cheeks and skin inside your mouth a good rub.</li>
            <li> an ok toothbrush, great price</li>
            <li> I like to use a toothbrush with a light medium bristle but our family dentist keeps harping on switching to brushes with a soft bristle. Have tried switching to soft several times, and found this Colgate toothbrush to be a happy alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really like a toothbrush with bristles that get in and around each tooth with a little scrubbing power. Most &#x27;soft&#x27; style toothbrushes feel like trying to brush with a wet paper towel... but these Colgate toothbrushes clean just like I like -- in and around each tooth, leaving my teeth with that most excellent squeaky-clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I go through a toothbrush about every six weeks, functionality and cost are the two biggest factors in my toothbrush purchase decision. This four-pack is priced right, they work well for me, the brush is comfortable in my hand, and the heads don&#x27;t fall apart in the six weeks or so that I use them... that is all I really need from a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have similar conditions and are looking for a decent, economical toothbrush for daily use, I recommend these.</li>
            <li> I like a large head on my toothbrush. Many of the ones that say full head are as skimpy as regular sizes. This one isn&#x27;t much bigger but it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve found lately. It&#x27;s not the longest lasting, either. I have to replace it more often than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I have not use this product as yet I know Colgate make great products so I purchase this product on the brand name only time will tell.....</li>
            <li> The part that is rough on the reverse side of the brush head rips apart my lips and mouth as I brush.  I guess that&#x27;s part of the gimmick of this product, but I personally can&#x27;t use them.  It has ripped holes in my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had to throw them all away.  Worst toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I discovered these toothbrushes a few years back and I have had a hard time using anything since!  I&#x27;m so glad that I could subscribe to delivery on Amazon because they are getting harder to find in stores, which is sad.  Costco used to carry them in bulk.  Anyway, this solves my problem and I now have a package coming for my family every couple months!  Yay!</li>
            <li> They get the job done and last about a month for me.  I use subscribe and save on this item and never have to worry about tooth brushes for my family.</li>
            <li> The very first time I used a toothbrush from this package many bristles came out in my mouth. It was completely disgusting and something that should not happen with a brand like Colgate. We have been using the 360 soft for years, but we are definitely switching brands now.</li>
            <li> Bristles are supposedly &amp;#34;soft,&amp;#34; but they irritate my gums. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Does a good job cleaning but doesn&#x27;t hurt the gums, plus it has a tongue cleaner.</li>
            <li> I ordered these based on the great reviews. I have a small mouth, and I think I&#x27;ll need to switch, because this is so big and wide it makes me gag a bit--I&#x27;ve never had that happen with a toothbrush until now! I do like the 4 colors (green, blue, purple, pink) and the soft (better for your teeth!) bristles.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. The rubber bristles help get food particles out and feel nice to brush with, kind of massages the gums. I recommend!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is so nice. I have a small mouth and this toothbrush has a nice sized head, soft bristles and just plain feels good in my mouth.</li>
            <li> No cavities on last several years of checkups and i use this brush, so i guess it works if you use it:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush. Dentists tell you to go with soft because it doesn&#x27;t matter how much pressure you put on your teeth.. As long as you brush it, your teeth will be fine.</li>
            <li> Good deal on these. Amazon is  great!</li>
            <li> I had a subscription and love these toothbrushes. When I moved the last pack went to my old residence so I did not get them. Amazon refunded me. I am not sure if they got the product back or if the new tenants are loving them now though...</li>
            <li> I recently swapped to these from the freebie Oral B so called &#x27;soft&#x27; toothbrushes given me by my dentist. These are working out very well for me. I did not like the slightly bent handle at first, but I soon got used to it. It could just as well be straight. As I have fingers and a hand on a wrist, I can angle a straight handle just as well as this slightly bent handle. The most important part is the head and the bristles, and in this case the size and softness is just perfect for me. The fineness is soft enough that it is not too abrasive, but not so fine that it accomplishes nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars.</li>
            <li> Of all the tooth brushes Ive used over the years these are simply my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 360 degree feature seems to clean the tooth surface far better &amp; its gentle on my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; &amp; they are just right. (for me...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also clean well, dry better (IMO) &amp; the tongue cleaning feature, while not a must, is still better than using the bristles...</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth well, that&#x27;s all I ask of it to do.</li>
            <li> Great toothbruses. Handle has a great grip. A pack of 4 of these for the price is a bargain and I&#x27;d hate to purchase them individually. Smart purchase people.</li>
            <li> The head of this toothbrush is very large....</li>
            <li> By far the worst toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had. It is very irritating to the gums. Toothbrust is not easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Its a toothbrush, I like the shape of the bristles as they round my teeth. Grip is nice I suppose too. Not much else I can say about a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The first time buying toothbrushes from Amazon...these are the best toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;They are soft and the head is wide, giving a great clean. Good work Colgate!</li>
            <li> I like that I can buy these on Sub and save. I have switch to a different style for different needs but these are great to have on hand for visitors who need a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I always use this toothbrush and I always bought it in stores. But as soon as I started using Amazon more often, I found this and it&#x27;s cheaper here than in stores. The tongue cleaner was the reason I always got this toothbrush. I feel clean every night and morning.</li>
            <li> great toothbrush at a great price. dont waste yuor money on anything else. buy this one for sure</li>
            <li> Great deal. My family loves these toothbrushes. Nice</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s intended to do. Good price compared to walmart/target. Shipped free which was even better. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> The Colgate 360 Degree Adult Full Head soft tooth brush is a very good product.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> These brushes are wonderful out of the package - but they don&#x27;t seem to last very long.&lt;br /&gt;With other brushes, I can switch when I run out of our smallish tube of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These don&#x27;t make it 2 weeks before becoming frayed.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than in stores (Target, drugstores, etc.) and a wonderful toothbrush. Really gets in all the nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li> They work.  My teeth are clean.</li>
            <li> I brush for no less than a minute each time. After just 20 seconds, my wrist aches terribly trying to hold onto the handle. The curve design makes it difficult for my medium size hand to keep it in place. Worst when the handle gets wet - it becomes very slippery. I have no qualms about the bristles but the handle didn&#x27;t work for me. &#x27;got an 8-pk in a big box store and tried a few more before the rest wound up in my garage tool collection. I give it 2 stars for a poor handle design since it made me quit brushing before I reached my desired goal.</li>
            <li> Soft head tooth brush.  Tongue scrubber is decent. I bought this to lie around.  Really never too bad to have toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I was given one of these toothbrushes by my hygienist and was so impressed I&#x27;ve switched to using these exclusively.</li>
            <li> The handle is too short.  Difficult to hold on to while brushing teeth.  The brush is wonderful and does a great job of making my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> simply put these have a good wear pattern and do NOT leave my teeth scuzzy</li>
            <li> Product as advertised. On time delivery</li>
            <li> when I brush my teeth with these tooth brushes, And i run my tongue over my teeth they feel so smooth my mouth also feel fresher and they get between the teeth and remove what ever particle is there.</li>
            <li> This is the easy way to get toothbrushes and save the other $40 you&#x27;ll spend at the store just going in to get them. I love subscribing to these necessities.</li>
            <li> this is the oddest feeling tooth brush I have ever had.  feels like you are rubbing your teeth with plastic.  the plus side is I have never had my teeth and gums feel so clean so quickly.</li>
            <li> Very soft which is how I like my toothbrushes. I was always trying different ones and found these to be the best.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than buying individually at Duane reade :)</li>
            <li> Good value for the convenience of having a supply of toothbrushes available. Always nice to have a supply available for visitors etc.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrushes I have ever used.  So comfortable, and the toothpaste foams up perfectly - sounds odd but somehow I only need 1/4 of the toothpaste I used to apply to get a great clean brushing.  Only improvement would be superficial - allow for buying packs of single selectable colors.</li>
            <li> the best tooth brush in a value pack. Half the price of Walmart</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> The title says it all. They&#x27;re expensive but worth it. I can&#x27;t remember ever having cleaner-feeling teeth with so little effort.</li>
            <li> I have these on auto delivery so I remember to throw out our toothbrushes and use new every 4 months or so. These are soft, large bristles with a large soft tongue cleaner on the back (which I like). The handles are large and easy to hold. The brush heads are probably too large for kids and young teens, but I like them for the adults in the house!</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are so great!  The have handles, bristles, and pretty colors! You can use them to brush your teeth or clean things!  You can even use them to dye your hair!</li>
            <li> Fantastic toothbrush. It is a little expensive but it is worthwhile.</li>
            <li> If you ever find yourself frustrated by &amp;#34;Free&amp;#34; toothbrushes you get at the dentist with small narrow heads, this is the exact opposite. It has a large wide head, that is flexible and has very soft, comfortable bristtles at varying heights that can cover and clean pretty much every corner of your mouth. In the world of manual toothbrushes, there is none better.</li>
            <li> Good price and good tooth brush</li>
            <li> On the opposite side of the brush are grooves that clean your gums as you brush. After only using powered brushes before,  I am sold on this bruch from now on.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes have the bristles designed for a great clean.</li>
            <li> Who ever thought a toothbrush could be a pleasant surprise? I find because this has a noticeably bigger handle than the toothbrushes I normally have, I can grip this one better in my slightly arthritic hand. I have had several surgeries on the hand and it just doesn&#x27;t grip like I wish it would and this larger handle makes a difference! The head seems a bit larger too, though not enough to cause me any discomfort. I have a fairly small mouth (though I run it all the time) but the head fits me just fine. The bristles are soft enough and the price is surely right. I hope they never discontinue this!</li>
            <li> Not soft. There is no way to interpret these bristles as soft. Falsely labeled.</li>
            <li> Those are  good toothbrushes. Good handle with a great grip. Good price value as 4 of them come in one pack.</li>
            <li> Perfect &amp;#34;no-frills&amp;#34; toothbrush - if you are looking for soft / full head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft so won&#x27;t damage your enamel and hurt your gums, but firm enough to last a reasonable amount of time and give you a good clean.&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from inflammation to your gums or or are hyper-sensitive, there are other softer brushes out there. On a scale from softest to hardest this brush is probably a 3/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a large mouth and big teeth so quite like the size of the head, more efficient, and comfortable enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, excellent value for money.</li>
            <li> This brush has a cup which allows the polish to be applied to your teeth instead of just being moved around.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are very comfortable to handle.  They do an excellent job keeping teeth clean.  I recommend using the Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> The tooth brush is a decent or actually good toothbrush but i felt i wore out the bristles to soon about a month and a half for me.</li>
            <li> These work well and had a good price.</li>
            <li> These are the only brushes that I use. Such a great deal to get them in a value pack instead of buying them one by one.</li>
            <li> UPDATE - May 2016 - When I wrote my initial review the color scheme on these looked different.  Each handle was blue and white with small color accents.  You had to look closely to see the difference between the four in the set since blue was the primary color of all four.  That is no longer the case so these are now much easier to identify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW - I appreciate that this 4-pack is available through Amazon&#x27;s &amp;#34;Add-on program&amp;#34; and that the free Prime shipping extends to military APO/FPO addresses.  I like the head/bristle design on this toothbrush and the integrated tongue cleaner.  If you don&#x27;t share a bathroom and you&#x27;re buying these to use for yourself the blue handle theme works fine.  The same is true if you&#x27;re having these shipped to a military address and they are going to be distributed to a group that isn&#x27;t keeping them in the same toothbrush holder.  However, if you&#x27;re intending to use these in a common shared bathroom toothbrush holder you might want to consider if the slight color variations on the toothbrush heads are enough to help you identify whose is whose.  I am much less likely to pick up a toothbrush that isn&#x27;t mine if the handles are different colors. If you are sharing a toothbrush holder with a guy like me you&#x27;re probably going to want that guy to have a toothbrush color that stands out and is distinctly different than the others.  Guess I&#x27;m just not as observant as some when it comes to small details like the color variations in these toothbrush bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I last purchased the 4-pack in March of 2015 and paid $8.97.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good toothbrush, look no further. I normally use medium but was told by my dentist to use soft. I brush 2-3 times a day so soft seems to work great. This is a good product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like this type of toothbrush with the grippy stuff on the back of the head. Note this particular package is full size heads, which are huge to me. So I had to give them all to my husband.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite manual toothbrushes.  I really feel like you can get right in your gob and clean out all the crevices.  The head is relatively big which speeds things up and provides a more satisfying clean.  I just don&#x27;t understand how they are classed as &amp;#34;soft.&amp;#34;  They provide a pretty aggressive brush.  More so than most medium brushes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is my personal favorite for a manual toothbrush and the one my office recommends.  Remember to always get Soft bristles because medium and firm are way too abrasive on your gums and enamel.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush and great value.</li>
            <li> I use this brush for more then 4 years now and never change to any different brand or kind.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans really well very soft and also i like tongue clear on the other side. i buy the same item over and over and compare to other supermarket like Walgreen, Walmart price is really good here.</li>
            <li> These are great quality. Lasted exactly the time it should and even had a comfortable grip. The actual brush end was really top notch as it got the top and sides of my teeth. Even had a check brush on the outside of the head. Great toothbrush. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> The scrubber on the back side feels great on the cheeks. Nice bristles and the handle is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Got this pack on vacation when I forgot my toothbrush. Seemed economical and it was a quick solution to my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the toothbrush sheds bristles. I thought at first it was just a loose bristle. Nope. Every time I used the brush, I&#x27;d get bristles in my gums or stuck between my teeth. I tossed the brush after a couple of days and the rest of the pack went into the trash as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rebecca Kyle, January 2013</li>
            <li> My husband like this tooth brush, but I don&#x27;t like it. Anyway it is cheap. Cheaper is not all better.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try the full head instead of compact, but these are way too big. Also the little tongue scraper dealy on the back of the head only makes the large size worse. I exfoliate the inside of my cheeks while  trying to brush. If you have a mouth like a camel, these would be fine.</li>
