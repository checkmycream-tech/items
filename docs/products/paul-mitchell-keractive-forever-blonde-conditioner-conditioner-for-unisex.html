            <li>This is the best conditioner for blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I find this conditioner to be just ok.</li>
            <li>I used tons of products, most of them worked okay</li>
            <li>Maybe the shampoo is better?</li>
            <li>I really do love this product.</li>
            <li>That makes it more affordable.</li>
            <li>Meh...I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li>I was able to find it online for cheaper than in the salon.  </li>

            <li>and i love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will for sure being buying along with the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I also love the smell.</li>
            <li>When I shampoo (sulfate-free clarifying brand), this works better to brighten my white/gray hair and remove the yellowy buildup from my products.  </li>
            <li>It has quite a nice, mild non-irritating fragrance.</li>
            <li>Very good for colored hair takes away the brassy color in blonde</li>
            <li>But I think this works better, has a light tint</li>

            <li>Keractive Blonde shampoo and conditioner by Paul Mitchell are the absolute best products for my colored and keratin treated fine hair!</li>
            <li>some just mask the hair to feel more healthy, but this really works!  </li>
            <li>Really great for blonde hair, stylist recommended.</li>
            <li>Its great conjunction with with forever blonde shampoo</li>
            <li>and I can smooth it through and let it sit for 5+ minutes while I wash.</li>
            <li>Not only is my hair softer it is more healthy!  </li>
            <li>That to me is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Not to sure if this is the real deal stuff I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li>It helps makes my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I have been using Pravana Pure LIght Shampoo (very, very purple) and not leaving in my hair for more than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>This combination has made my hair a much nicer shade of blonde, healthier, and it smells great.</li>
            <li>I love the way this conditioner makes my hair feel, it really does help keep my hair natural and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>so I dont use it all up so fast, but when I get out my hair is so easy to brush out, takes the knots right out.</li>
            <li>so this conditioner really helps smooth out my knots.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and leaves my blonde white hair very shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>even if they don&#x27;t highlight it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I did because I really don&#x27;t look good with short hair.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner left my hair very smooth, soft and easily detangled!</li>
            <li>I am blond and this leave my hair very silky and helps to eradicate yellow color which I tends to get very prominent from chemicals in the water.</li>
            <li>I already knew I loved this product - but I can get it for less and have it delivered to my door.</li>
            <li>conditioner has really made a difference!  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is really purple!  </li>
            <li>Also, received it within a few days of ordering, packed well, and in good condition.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and keeps my hair soft and blonde!</li>
            <li>Helps in keeping the blonde color blonde instead of turning more like a light motor oil color.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I went to a new salon and stylist and she was pretty sure my previous stylist had been using a cheap product on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Used the matching shampoo (which kind of leaves your hair like straw, but does tone down the Orange).  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super soft and my highlights look lighter.</li>
            <li>Good for keeping the brassy color away from my blonde color treated long locks.</li>
            <li>She recommended this conditioner and shampoo and it has really made a positive difference.  </li>
            <li>Then I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t really coming from the scalp, it was breaking off.  </li>
            <li>According to my upscale hairdresser she says it has really worked-</li>
            <li>It really does repair the hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much conditioner on the hair.</li>
            <li>It really gives bleached/</li>
            <li>I also used John Frieda Clear Glaze (stinky as fxxx; I was sneezing and tearing up all day), but the Forever Blonde works better.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t any better than say Pantene or some other drug store brand.</li>
            <li>It left it clean feeling and not&lt;br /&gt;limp</li>
            <li>and I am always changing my hair, but since I have gone blonde the Forever Blonde Conditioner makes my hair feel so soft and amazing.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to find a new go-to conditioner</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it highly...</li>
            <li>Really worth the extra price.</li>
            <li>Really doesn&#x27;t do much for blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair finally feels NORMAL and not like dry straw or hay.  </li>

            <li> Really worth the extra price.</li>
            <li> Really doesn&#x27;t do much for blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair finally feels NORMAL and not like dry straw or hay.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair a little too dry or a little too soft so that it gets greasy quickly.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit of the shampoo to work up a rich thick lather and after rinsing, my hair feels soft enough that I don&#x27;t need a lot of the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, straight, naturally dark blonde hair.</li>
            <li> was concerned that it would leave my hair limp, as I have very fine and thin hair.</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair platinum blonde several months ago and was looking for a go-to conditioner I could use for my very dry hair.</li>
            <li> Only negative is you have to be careful to only use a little, or it runs out way too fast!!!</li>
            <li> I used to find that I had to switch products occasionally because my hair would either become dry or over conditioned.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> however because I was the victim of a bad ombre job which was bleached to death, then I put box color on top of the bleach to tone down the color a bit and THEN ended up going to a different hairstylist to recolor my hair the very next day...</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this shampoo to other blondes out there, just wish the big bottle was less</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t blonde (it&#x27;s dark brown)</li>
            <li> I will ask for a refund as this is pretty expensive product for it to be so low quality of a product.</li>
            <li> I started partially highlighting my hair 2 years ago, about 4 times a year.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, natural and coily 4b/4c hair and this conditioner</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark brown hair</li>
            <li> but it doesnt wear my hair down.</li>
            <li> Plus, it does not weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t turn brassy and the conditioner does not weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair feels silky throughout the day and there is less frizz.  </li>
            <li> I am a fake blonde and sometimes the blonde would start to look a little darker and brassy.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> It is a little drying</li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Redken Heavy Cream and Joico K-Pakistan both worked</li>
            <li> dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> My hair no longer feels like dead straw.</li>
            <li> No more tangles and much less hair loss.  </li>
            <li> It smelled like dawn soap to :/</li>
            <li> It does not feel heavy on my hair and helps with managing my thick, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair like usual, then put the Paul Mitchell conditioner in my hair and just walk around the house with a shower cap on.  </li>
            <li> I usually leave it on for a minimum of 1 hour and sometimes overnight.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a conditioner that will soften and detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> I seriously thought I was going to have to chop it all off.  </li>
            <li> Over the past year, my hair started knotting really bad when I washed it</li>
            <li> The product itself was mediocre.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
            <li> Horrible!  </li>

            <li> Horrible!  Used the matching shampoo (which kind of leaves your hair like straw, but does tone down the Orange).  This was supposed to be a conditioner for that issue.  NO WAY!  Redken Heavy Cream and Joico K-Pakistan both worked</li>
            <li> Good for keeping the brassy color away from my blonde color treated long locks. It is a little drying so I use a hydrating conditioner to compensate.</li>
            <li> I got this from a coworker with the set. I love it! I mix it with some dove conditioner so I dont use it all up so fast, but when I get out my hair is so easy to brush out, takes the knots right out.</li>

            <li> I have been using the forever blonde conditioner for about 2 weeks now.  I have very long, straight, naturally dark blonde hair. I started partially highlighting my hair 2 years ago, about 4 times a year.  After this last trip to the salon, I talked with my stylist about the changes in my hair&#x27;s color and texture since starting the highlighting.  I had noticed a brassy color to my hair and a loss of silkiness, so I wanted to find a home care regiment that could help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner has really made a difference!  I massage it through my hair, then run a shower comb through it before rinsing.  My hair feels silky throughout the day and there is less frizz.  I would definitely recommend this shampoo to other blondes out there, just wish the big bottle was less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I have not used the shampoo or the repair treatment.</li>
            <li> I love the way this conditioner makes my hair feel, it really does help keep my hair natural and healthy looking. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
            <li> leaves my hair nice and silky after i rinse it out. definitely feels moisturized but it doesnt wear my hair down. is it a miracle no but i will add to regime.</li>
            <li> I have blond highlights and have been getting them for years.  Over the past year, my hair started knotting really bad when I washed it and I was losing lots in the shower and when I brushed it out.  Then I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t really coming from the scalp, it was breaking off.  I have been getting highlights for decades and never had this happen.  Anyway, I went to a new salon and stylist and she was pretty sure my previous stylist had been using a cheap product on my hair.  She recommended this conditioner and shampoo and it has really made a positive difference.  No more tangles and much less hair loss.  Plus, it does not weigh down my hair.  Very satisfied with the product.  Also, received it within a few days of ordering, packed well, and in good condition.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. It leaves my hair super soft and my highlights look lighter.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best condition I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been using it on my hair for over a year now and have no plans to switch products.</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair platinum blonde several months ago and was looking for a go-to conditioner I could use for my very dry hair. I had heard rave reviews about this product and decided to go with it. Overall, it wasn&#x27;t for me. I have very thick, natural and coily 4b/4c hair and this conditioner sort of just sat on my hair rather than condition it. I&#x27;m not dyeing my hair that blonde anytime soon, but when I do I think I&#x27;ll stick to deep conditioning with oils and try out the Clairol Shimmerlights.</li>
            <li> This does not work as well as Sueve keratin infusion. Went back to the sueve and saved alot of money. I will ask for a refund as this is pretty expensive product for it to be so low quality of a product. dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> After reading all the rave reviews for this product, I was hopeful.  But this conditioner did nothing for my hair except tangle it ..... I&#x27;ll stick with Leonor Greyl.  It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes hair shine, gives it body, smells awesome. Only negative is you have to be careful to only use a little, or it runs out way too fast!!!</li>
            <li> I already knew I loved this product - but I can get it for less and have it delivered to my door. Really great for blonde hair, stylist recommended. and save your time and energy and money and get it here.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended this shampoo and conditioner.  I am a fake blonde and sometimes the blonde would start to look a little darker and brassy.  Now I use this and it keeps the blonde brighter.  I love the smell of the conditioner.  The shampoo is really purple!  It&#x27;s very good at getting my hair clean and conditioned.  I really love the conditioner bc I feel like it&#x27;s perfect.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair a little too dry or a little too soft so that it gets greasy quickly.</li>
            <li> This product smells so good! I use it with the Paul Mitchell Platinum Blonde Shampoo on my colored hair, it is wonderful! This combination has made my hair a much nicer shade of blonde, healthier, and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to find a new go-to conditioner but this one definitely didn&#x27;t do the job.  I DID brighten up my blonde but I&#x27;ll just be using this whenever I&#x27;m getting a bit brassy in between salon appointments.</li>
            <li> Love this Conditioner!</li>
            <li> Great price...fast service.</li>
            <li> Heals my wifes hair. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell and smooth</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner for blonde hair. Im a hair stylist and I am always changing my hair, but since I have gone blonde the Forever Blonde Conditioner makes my hair feel so soft and amazing. I also use the Platinum Blonde Shampoo by PM as well amd my hair is so shiny!</li>
            <li> Not only is my hair softer it is more healthy!  According to my upscale hairdresser she says it has really worked- some just mask the hair to feel more healthy, but this really works!  I have naturally dark brown hair and i&#x27;ve dyed and highlighted it blond for years- this works!</li>
            <li> I find this conditioner to be just ok. It wasn&#x27;t any better than say Pantene or some other drug store brand. I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I use with the shampoo..It does not feel heavy on my hair and helps with managing my thick, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Good packaging, shipment arrived on time. The product itself was mediocre. For a product made specifically for blonde hair it had no moisturizing components. Made my hair dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> Keractive Blonde shampoo and conditioner by Paul Mitchell are the absolute best products for my colored and keratin treated fine hair! The color doesn&#x27;t turn brassy and the conditioner does not weigh down my hair. It only takes a little bit of the shampoo to work up a rich thick lather and after rinsing, my hair feels soft enough that I don&#x27;t need a lot of the conditioner.  I used to find that I had to switch products occasionally because my hair would either become dry or over conditioned.  But I&#x27;ve used these for more than 2 years now and my hair looks and feels great!  I use the big 33.8 oz sizes at home and purchased this regular size for traveling so I never have to use something else!</li>
            <li> I had severly damaged hair from highlighting. I used tons of products, most of them worked okay but nothing to write home about. My stylist recommended this. I figured \\&quot;what the hell\\&quot; since nothing else worked it was worth a shot. OMG! My hair no longer feels like dead straw. This along with the sulfate-free shampoo and Keratin spray is AMAZING! I will recommend this to all my friends and relatives that highlight. Heck- even if they don&#x27;t highlight it is well worth it. It really does repair the hair.</li>
            <li> Really works great, quick delivery,</li>
            <li> Really doesn&#x27;t do much for blonde hair.  Maybe the shampoo is better?</li>
            <li> I really do love this product. It helps makes my hair nice and soft. I&#x27;d recommend it highly... even to those who are not blonde!</li>
            <li> After using my hair has great texture.  The reason I did not give 5 stars is because it does not moisturize as I thought it would</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner. I have highlighted hair and this was recommended by my hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that it would leave my hair limp, as I have very fine and thin hair. It left it clean feeling and not&lt;br /&gt;limp at all.&lt;br /&gt;It smells really good, and is purple in color (just like their shampoo). It doesn&#x27;t take much conditioner on the hair. I only use a dime size amount so this will last me for months. That makes it more affordable. I would recommend this over my other&lt;br /&gt;conditioners that are name brands.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and keeps my hair soft and blonde! Its great conjunction with with forever blonde shampoo</li>
            <li> Meh...I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li> This product was a recommendation from a hairstylist, so i decided to try it.  I was able to find it online for cheaper than in the salon.  My hair isn&#x27;t blonde (it&#x27;s dark brown) however because I was the victim of a bad ombre job which was bleached to death, then I put box color on top of the bleach to tone down the color a bit and THEN ended up going to a different hairstylist to recolor my hair the very next day...it was FRIED DYED AND LAID TO THE SIDE! OMG! My hair felt like a brillow pad.  I seriously thought I was going to have to chop it all off.  So instead the second hairstylist suggested I try this conditioner to save my hair.  I am SO GLAD I did because I really don&#x27;t look good with short hair.  I use this every week as a deep conditioner.  I wash my hair like usual, then put the Paul Mitchell conditioner in my hair and just walk around the house with a shower cap on.  I usually leave it on for a minimum of 1 hour and sometimes overnight.  My hair finally feels NORMAL and not like dry straw or hay.  I went from HAY to HHHEEEEEEYYYYYYY in an hour.  That to me is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and i love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;o o o o o o o o o o</li>
            <li> Awesome works great I will for sure being buying along with the shampoo.  It really gives bleached/hi lited hair that extra boost of shine and brings out the blonde.  I have long thick hair so this conditioner really helps smooth out my knots.</li>
            <li> Really nice conditioner! I have very thick coarse hair. I have a hard time finding a conditioner that will soften and detangle my hair. This conditioner left my hair very smooth, soft and easily detangled! I also love the smell. I am very happy with this conditioner!</li>
            <li> When I shampoo (sulfate-free clarifying brand), this works better to brighten my white/gray hair and remove the yellowy buildup from my products.  It has quite a nice, mild non-irritating fragrance. If I am co-washing, I do two rounds followed by an ACV rinse rinse it out before I apply this.  I have been using Pravana Pure LIght Shampoo (very, very purple) and not leaving in my hair for more than 2 minutes. But I think this works better, has a light tint and I can smooth it through and let it sit for 5+ minutes while I wash. I also used John Frieda Clear Glaze (stinky as fxxx; I was sneezing and tearing up all day), but the Forever Blonde works better. I may try using the Pravana for shorter then use this. See what happens.</li>
