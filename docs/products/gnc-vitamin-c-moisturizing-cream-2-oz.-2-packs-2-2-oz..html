            <li> I mean, the smell is really unacceptable, it smells like old lady medication or something.</li>
            <li> in the past I having been using a high end moisturizing cream ($150)</li>
            <li> I am disappointed and expected more.</li>
            <li> other moisturizers aswell.</li>
            <li> Rubbed it all over my dog, and his hair and skin shines like the sun, all the other dogs in the neighborhood are jealous and are barking for their owners to buy this miracle cream</li>
            <li> I am down to the bottom of the jar.</li>
            <li> It dried out mine(50)(Paul&#x27;s wife) and my daughter&#x27;s(16) skin.  </li>
            <li> will know how well it works in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> so disappointed---should have read reviews---I usually do---</li>
            <li> but in a small jar.</li>
            <li> sad rip-off---and sold in GMC too----should be a law against this type of false advertisement........</li>
            <li> I use three times a day when cold out doors.</li>
            <li> It smells bad and burned my skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion was terrible.  </li>
