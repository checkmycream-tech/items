            <li>/&gt;Shaving with my Merkur is a great way to start  the day.  </li>
            <li>The Merkur 38 Hd is well engineered and feels great in the hand, IMHO of course.</li>
            <li>Happy Shaving.</li>
            <li>Very nice shave, happy with product</li>

            <li>this is a wonderful safety razor with a perfectly sized handle and just the right amount of weight.</li>
            <li>* Amazing shave!</li>
            <li>Merkur makes an amazing product!  </li>
            <li>The quality of the Merkur 38c is impeccable.</li>
            <li>It looks brilliant in my bathroom and has a nice weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although the Barber Pole design was nice, I Returned it!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant upon buying this razor because I thought I was going to cut my own throat with it!  </li>
            <li>To be honest there was virtually no adjustment from using a cartridge razor to using a DE razor for me!</li>
            <li>but he says it&#x27;s an excellent razor and the quality is top notch.</li>
            <li>this razor has a nice nice balance..fits well in your hands, nice weigh..go for it!!</li>
            <li>The Merkur shaves great, looks great, cheaper to use and is better for the environment.</li>
            <li>Pair it with a badger hair brush and some nice shaving soap or cream and you&#x27;ll be amazed at how great your skin feels and</li>
            <li>(you don&#x27;t have to apply pressure to get a good pass), since that weight and a good blade take all of the work out of shaving.</li>
            <li>this is a good razor to start with and get some experience.</li>
            <li>Both work well with this razor with the Feather being the sharper of the two, yet the Derby will give a good close shave used in this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I do think that you can get just as CLOSE of a shave using a good replaceable shaver</li>
            <li>and it was good</li>
            <li>I have tried just about every brand out there and the Van Der Hagen Aloe Vera &amp; Shea Butter is as good as any for 5 or 6 times the price.</li>
            <li>Like any good piece of hardware the Merkur has good construction, heft, and quality materials.</li>
            <li>* West Coast Shaving (Good place to get supplies, razor sampler packs are well known)</li>
            <li>The internet forums also suggested this razor as a good one to make the leap into DE shaving.    </li>
            <li>The weight of the razor feels so good in your hand.  </li>
            <li>Works well, and good quality.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was good</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>I used Proraso shaving soap which is also good.  </li>
            <li>This razor, when combined with good technique, will produce shaves that will exceed your wildest dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of build quality, this thing is built like a precision whisker-annihilating weapon.</li>
            <li>I find the shave for me to be really good</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re shaving, you must have good control of the blade in your hands, otherwise you will be hurt.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>and decided that this razor would be a good fit for my hands, have good weight to it, and provide an excellent shave.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to make a cut or nick by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of blades, including &amp;#34;7am&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Merkur&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Astra Superior Platinum&amp;#34;, and others.</li>
            <li>So through my research I find that Merkur makes really good quality DE razors.</li>
            <li>... felt good in my hands.</li>
            <li>how great they work and how nice they look.</li>
            <li>I am told the balance is great and it looks nice.</li>
            <li>Fits and fells good in the hand.  </li>
            <li>I Think this does just as good of a job as the others at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>I bought a 100pk of Astras based on the good reviews and price.</li>
            <li>than others, so good for a beginner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>her razor, she wouldn&#x27;t get a good shave.    </li>
            <li>Feels good in hand.</li>
            <li>, I felt this one would be a good one to start with.  </li>
            <li>Good, but cut me too often.</li>
            <li>Not some alcohol based smelly sauce, a good quality cream.  </li>
            <li>A clearly superior shave compared to a multi blade razor.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a good razor.  </li>
            <li>, it is a hefty razor that provides a good grip for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I was told it was good for beginners</li>
            <li>but I loved it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean and perfect shave!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shaver with derby blades, the cheap tweezerman badger brush and arko shave soap for about two months and must say it&#x27;s been a very pleasant experience.  </li>
            <li>And the ability to manuever the blade was exceptional.</li>
            <li>The soap dish and brush stand are still working fine, and the shave brush is also still in very good shape.  </li>
            <li>The razor appears to be of good quality and has a wonderful feel, just the right size and weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I liked the heaver adjustable handle I had before this one gives me a much more pleasant shave and the longer handle is great.</li>
            <li>My husband is MORE than happy with it.  </li>
            <li>That was very interesting to learn.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>This razor, a brush, Williams shaving soap and after shave cream make shaving a joy again and a rewarding experience.</li>
            <li>If they made this razon with a handle 1.5 to 2 inches (3.8 cm to 5 cm) longer, it would have made for a much better shave -- for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some of you, this will be a great razor, but it was not for me.</li>
            <li>I used Astra Platinum blades and was glad I did, since they worked great.  </li>
            <li>This razor is a great piece of equipment, and I am thoroughly pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this razor for over 2 years now and am very satisfied with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>This razor is well balanced and much more attractive than the picture can show.</li>
            <li>Nice weight, and feels good in my hand.  </li>
            <li>Add a badger brush, and a fine cream like Truefitt &amp; Hill, and you&#x27;ll have the perfect, enjoyable shave.</li>
            <li>Good grip, good angle, good weight and a longer handle for easy of use and precision.</li>
            <li>It has good weight and balance which I think made it very easy for me to get use to it.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor and it&#x27;s GREAT!!</li>
            <li>and I guarantee you&#x27;re gonna love it too!</li>
            <li>just used it for the first time with the included Merkur Platinum blade and got the best shave of my life.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been using electric razors and disposable blades all these years, I&#x27;ve never had a better shave!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this razor!</li>
            <li>I love the razor handle itself, but felt the Merkur brand blade is came with sucked!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this razor!</li>
            <li>From the quality of the chrome polished frame &amp; handle to the smooth quality of the threads on the screw in handle Merkur did a beautiful job of building the razor.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle and get a great shave.  </li>
            <li>The construction is of pure quality and it is balanced perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It has a very nice weight and is easily controllable.  </li>
            <li>you want a smoother shave, if you want to save money, if you want to reduce your environmental impact, and if you want to engage in a ritual that great men like your grandfather, John F. Kennedy, and Teddy Roosevelt took part in, then buy this fantastic safety razor.</li>

            <li>yet I&#x27;ve been able to get a good shave with this from day one with no cuts or discomfort.    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of therapeutic.</li>
            <li>The Perfecto stand is well built and looks nice on my countertop.  </li>

            <li>Nice razor,smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Nice weight for shaving.</li>
            <li>It was so nice that I purchased another one.  </li>
            <li>With the Williams Mug Shaving Soap, the razor glides as though it had its own comfort strip attached.  </li>
            <li>It has impressed me that much.  </li>
            <li>The handle is shorter than I&#x27;m used to, but it has a nice weight to it.</li>

            <li>Cleaning is very easy.</li>
            <li>, this razor makes swapping out blades very easy.  </li>

            <li>you got your razor, some good blades, an amazing brush, some soap/creame, a pre and after-shave care package: how do you clean and maintain the razor and blades?</li>
            <li>The chromed finish is perfect, and the screw mechanism for the head is sure and steady.</li>
            <li>OK, why would people ever have moved to cartridge razors when this kind of shaving goodness existed all along??</li>
            <li>Great razor well worth the price</li>
            <li>The merkur is the best by far.    </li>
            <li>First impression: it&#x27;s a beautiful thing and it feels well-balanced in the hand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good weight and holds the razor securely.</li>
            <li>Good razor, bought it to have a longer handle, but use it, I think the razor should be supplied with a cheap plastic case.</li>
            <li>The handle is heavier on the Merkur, and the weight of the razor is more effective in shaving.</li>
            <li>It was the most popular razor on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Nice weight, looks great, gives a consistent shave no matter what blade you are using.  </li>
            <li>excellent example of this stunning new DE Razor technology is the Merkur Barber Pole DE Razor.  </li>
            <li>With the right blades it&#x27;s a great shaver.</li>
            <li>and I wish I could properly express how great it is to engage in one of those forgotten rituals that remind a man why it&#x27;s great to be a man.</li>
            <li>This is a solid product it gives a great shave when paired with a great razor, (Astra) for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is certainly well&#x3D;made and beautiful</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s do ourselves and our lovely women a favor and give ourselves the kind of satisfying shave we deserve and that they love.</li>
            <li>Great and fast delivery !</li>
            <li>Respect the edge, lads and lasses, and you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Has a very comfortable handle.  </li>
            <li>Good, mild shave.  </li>
            <li>The grip is awesome, I dunk mine in hot water to start out with to get it warm and ready, and I take it out and begin to shave.</li>
            <li>but there are alot of types to try and find what works best on your face, also dont skimp on the lather, its cheap and worth the good stuff, also badger brush is a must, i got a cheap one at first and the hairs fall out....</li>
            <li>razor has a great feel in my large hands.</li>
            <li>Great Weight, smooth cut and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I use Cremo shave cream and Personna blades, so I&#x27;m sure they help too.  </li>
            <li>Love my HD.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this razor.</li>
            <li>so maybe an adjustabe would be a better choice depending on your beard.</li>
            <li>give or take a dollar or two at most.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.......</li>
            <li>In no time at all you&#x27;ll experience the most absolutely wonderful shaves you have ever had in your entire life!!!!</li>
            <li>The heft of the razor is ideal for letting the weight of the razor shave your beard w/o adding any of your own pressure to move the razor across your face    At the time I purchased this razor here at Amazon, I also bought a package of Derby Extra DE Razor blades (5 pack) and a 10 pack of Feather DE blades, also purchased here at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>you want to make sure you tighten the handle after inserting the razor blade.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you always tighten the top of the razor well before using.  </li>
            <li>This razor is stunning.  </li>
            <li>The styling and design are top notch.  </li>
            <li>stylish.</li>
            <li>I love this safety razor.</li>
            <li>A couple of tips to keep it tip top</li>
            <li>more often!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start by saying I love using a safety razor.</li>
            <li>I used the merkur blade that came with it and prefer the derbies much better.  </li>
            <li>col. cunk&#x27;s shave soap and found cunk&#x27;s to be my favorite</li>
            <li>but I use arko the most.  </li>
            <li>You must give yourself time to get used to using this shaver or else you will have many nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>Your shaves will now take more time</li>
            <li>but they cost SO much more and wear out faster.  </li>
            <li>This setup will save me a lot of money over the years and will also be better for the environment as I can recycle the blades and keep the shaver and badger brush indefinitely.  </li>
            <li>Love this razor.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to buy them in the states for years over the counter</li>
            <li>but if you can find the \\&quot;Premium\\&quot; they are even better.  </li>
            <li>I have a Parker 22r that I like too, but this is a better razor and gives me a better shave.</li>
            <li>For a starter razor, the Parker is probably going to be better for most people, but once you get some time under your belt with DE shaving, try the Merkur.</li>
            <li>You can start with most any DE blade.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought this razor.</li>
            <li>After 2 uses, I don&#x27;t see how on earth this DE razor is better than a mach 3 or a fushion.  </li>
            <li>The teeth allow more contact with the skin/hair for a better shave.      </li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks I&#x27;m pleased with the 38 HD.  </li>
            <li>I got better at lathering the cream and gained more confidence in my technique.  </li>
            <li>My technique improved and the sharper blades performed much better.  </li>
            <li>I love the feel of this razor.</li>
            <li>The thicker handle gives me a better grip, and the heft is both reassuring and advantageous when shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had fewer nicks and irritation as well, just a better shave experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You know that this is an item that you will be able to use for many years to come.</li>
            <li>I don’t just recommend this razor, I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>I don’t just recommend this razor, I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll understand even better.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>The razors are elegant and affordable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still enjoying and working on that, and it&#x27;s been months.  </li>
            <li>I actually find it to be a WAY better shave than the Proglide, which I had been impressed with and content with</li>
            <li>- any, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve tried that, and if you like that scent but want a better performer, you should try these&amp;#34;?).</li>
            <li>Mach3&#x27;s, however pricey, can flex, &amp; still seem to provide a better shave on all but the most squared off jaws.</li>
            <li>It also gives a better shave.</li>
            <li>I had another razor in my cart and after more research I ended up buying this one</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did...</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>Love this razor.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Safety razors are more \\&quot;green\\&quot; - no plastic blades to throw out.  </li>
            <li>Event better - get a badger hair brush and shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to get one of the packs with the Feather blades.</li>
            <li>Makes shaving enjoyable...</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love tradition.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit more moisture and some finesse</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many types of cartridge razors, waxing, and Nair cream (Don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Shaving with it is quite safe and a pleasure.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to pay 20 bucks for a razor but ended up paying 55 bucks for the merkel barber pole razor.its</li>
            <li>Double edge yields a marvelous shave.  </li>
            <li>I just like the 2 piece design better).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for 4 years and love it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this razor a year ago and have enjoyed it ever since.</li>
            <li>The quality is top notch</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with the quality and performance of this product.</li>
            <li>I had read so many reviews of dangers.  </li>
            <li>I have had good success with feather blades</li>
            <li>So glad I changed.</li>
            <li>Day after day, week after week, I have been shaving with this razor and I am kicking myself for paying a fortune for plastic cartridge razors for so many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>The quality was excellent with an all metal design that feels solid in your hand.</li>
            <li>Secondly, this thing cuts a close shave and feels awesome on your face.</li>
            <li>The blade came with a Merkur blade, which is OK</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>the many \\&quot;how to\\&quot; videos of shaving with a DE bladed razor.</li>
            <li>I never had a better shave.</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>If anything like that happens, I will be sure to update this review and rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is just OK, which makes it overpriced.  </li>
            <li>I love the Merkur razor.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>If you have been looking for a better shaving experience, this might be the way to go.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need 3,4,5 or more blades to shave.</li>
            <li>I love the heft and size of this razor.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work best for me with the sharper blades, but that may depend on your personal preference and beard.</li>
            <li>this razor seems to be better quality and gives better shave,  </li>
            <li>im glad i ordered it.</li>
            <li>So glad I made the change.</li>
            <li>that I just purchased more for Christmas gifts</li>
            <li>Many of my friends, and colleagues recommended that I get one of the market(Mach 3, Norelco etc...)</li>
            <li>I receive comments on my shave from many women...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll prove to be cheaper than my multi-blade setup,  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I am sure that once i get used to the idea of &amp;#34;hair</li>
            <li>;, i will learn to love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Top quality razor.</li>
            <li>On top of that, Women&#x27;s and Men&#x27;s razors are identical except for color, yet Women&#x27;s razors always cost more.</li>
            <li>What could be better?</li>
            <li>The Weishi had been recommended for novice DE shavers, so it seemed like the safe choice.  </li>
            <li>Decided to convert to a DE safety razor from many years of using cartridge razors on a whim.</li>
            <li>and I figure it&#x27;ll just get better.</li>
            <li>I love it, and the delay in my purchase kept me from enjoying a rewarding shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>shave but wasn’t up until now that I need to get more shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I think most guys want.</li>
            <li>Get yourself a variety pack of razors because each person’s skin is different &amp; you need to know which blade works the best with your skin.</li>
            <li>Make sure those are in your variety pack.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Make sure those are in your variety pack.)    </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this purchase because I know it will last me for many years to come</li>
            <li>Truth be told, I might end up wanting something a bit more aggressive as time goes on but for now I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this razor or the rest of my set up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>Gotta love those</li>
            <li>I love that the weight of the razor allows me to shave without using pressure, avoiding nicks.</li>
            <li>A Progress or better yet a Futur.</li>
            <li>What a hunk of steel, I love it.</li>
            <li>Slightly more aggressive than the Jagger db89l</li>
            <li>Much better than the one I used 40 years ago.</li>
            <li>I did 3 passes just to be safe and make sure I got all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Slightly more aggressive cut than my EJ89 and heavier.</li>
            <li>I expect many years of use with this quality product.</li>
            <li>Twist the bottom remove the top and set the razor in and done.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, otherwise I could have injured myself.  </li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Outstanding razor, wish I would have switched over to this razor from the disposable ones along time ago.</li>
            <li>After 25+ years of shaving with overpriced cartridge razors, I now have the best shave short of going to the barber.  </li>
            <li>Handle&#x27;s knurling turns out to be OK after all, just had to make sure that my pre-shave oil was washed off my hands.</li>
            <li>The barber pole handle looks great and is very functional.  </li>
            <li>Thank you :)</li>
            <li>I like the 38HD much better</li>
            <li>Model 38 HD is an elegant piece of hardware.  </li>
            <li>:  So, I&#x27;ve been shaving with this razor now for about a week, and I still couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>Anyone still need convincing?  </li>
            <li>(32 more years)</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve been shaving with this razor now for about a week, and I still couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>Anyone still need convincing?  </li>
            <li>(32 more years)</li>
            <li>I used a Parker razor before this, and this is even better.</li>
            <li>I did some more research and discovered a more aggressive razor which is the Merkur 38 HD.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>One of my better purchases.</li>
            <li>I am glad I picked this model of razor.  </li>
            <li>This particular razor has a good weight, is easy to clean and looks great.  </li>
            <li>Chrome is quality, weight is right, and length is good.</li>
            <li>The design is very nice and the razor is built very durable.  </li>
            <li>I used a smaller model very successfully</li>
            <li>I get a nice clean shave</li>
            <li>Pay special attention to your neck: It is its own labyrinth of errant, erratic hair growth patterns.</li>
            <li>so if your short handed and tire easy it may not be best for you</li>
            <li>The weight is perfect and the two-piece construction is simple and makes for easy cleaning.  </li>
            <li>First off, pair the 38 HD with a good quality blade (Feather or Israeli Personnas)</li>
            <li>The grip is usually pretty good.</li>
            <li>Again, I&#x27;m still sticking with the straight-edge when I can at ALL squeeze in the time, but what first struck me about this safety razor is good my face felt afterwards, both just in itself and to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I imagine this will work pretty good for a while now.</li>
            <li>It gave me a good shave for using a DE for the first time, but my hand cramped up each time by the end of my shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There was a learning curve that resulted in plenty of nicks and cuts, at first, but coupled with a good quality shaving soap, all of the razor burn and rashes were history from day 1.  </li>
            <li>What I like better about this razor though is the, longer handle, the handle has a better grip than my smooth chrome EJ89, and what I like the most is the weight of this razor.</li>
            <li>I took a chance on this product, and it was the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better razors but for the money this one is fine.  </li>
            <li>Great for guys with large hands for a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>It has fit my hands like a glove, so it&#x27;s easy to avoid &amp;#34;bloodbaths&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>the top blade guard easily comes off to change the blade</li>
            <li>/&gt;No more overpriced multi-blades that clog up easily.</li>
            <li>Next you&#x27;ll want a good shaving soap/cream, a brush, and a good shaving bowl or cup to work up your lather.</li>
            <li>If you want a more aggressive razor this will still fit your requirements just use a more aggressive blade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to clean, and after nine months it&#x27;s still as shiny as the day I got it.  </li>
            <li>This has singly been the best purchase to take me from being a boy to being a Marlboro Man...without smoking or stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that, the build quality is excellent and I&#x27;m confident nothing will happen to it for years to come.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re both very good razors, and I&#x27;m currently using nothing else.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident that it will give you a very special and irritation free shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>Excellent construction, fine finish and craftsmanship combined with real heft and retro styling make this razor a real winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My bottom line is enjoy safety razor shaving, however I feel the experience could be with a better designed razor.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been conditioned to accept the cheap and disposable multi-blades that companies market today because it makes them lots of money - not because it&#x27;s a better product for us.</li>
            <li>It seems as if the Derby blades are the best so far, lasting me a good 5-7 days.  </li>
            <li>The Poraso seems to give me the most comfortable and close shave.  </li>
            <li>and I got a smooth results love the weight to it as well</li>
            <li>like I said it&#x27;s got the ideal weight and feel for a strongish guy with big hands like me.</li>
            <li>There are many DE blades available.</li>
            <li>expect?I feel more manly using it as opposed to the cheap plastic</li>
            <li>And I totally love how cheap it is to</li>
            <li>I love the quality and design are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have tried an extensive blade sampler from Barberia Italiana and have found the Personna blades from Israel to be ideal for me.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more comfortable for me to hold in my hand</li>
            <li>Fits in hand very well, a good weight.</li>
            <li>Good aggressiveness but not too much and</li>
            <li>To be fair, I bought a whole system: This Merkur 38 HD razor</li>
            <li>before i get a straight edge, i felt this would be a good stepping stone to replace my fusion, as for i want to shave like they did in the olden days.</li>
            <li>Definitely a superior shave and the blades are really inexpensive.</li>
            <li>If you want a shave that is smooth, enjoyable, and easy, I would recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li>very happy with purchase smooth shave very balanced would easily recommend to anyone looking for a good single blade razor</li>
            <li>Still looking for the right blades but thrilled with the razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy, well balanced, has a good grip, made to last a lifetime and delivers a wonderful shave with a good blade.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable and easy to load blade and clean.</li>
            <li>(I love the scent of the Art of Shaving Sandalwood line, but suspect that there are better options out there - any suggestions from anybody more seasoned?).  </li>
            <li>Full marks!</li>
            <li>Extremely well made and wonderful to hold in your hand.  </li>
            <li>The spiral handle is easy to grip and control.  </li>
            <li>i have a better shave and already saved enough from not using Gilette multiblade cartridges to pay for it also greatly reduces razor bumps</li>
            <li>I then tried the Parker 99R because I was hoping that the butterfly design would work for me so that changing blades would be easy.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to put blade in and out  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read reviews stating that it&#x27;s easy to nick yourself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t scalp my face.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a technique, that in my opinion is quite easily mastered.</li>
            <li>Easy to change blades</li>
            <li>It sliced through the hair easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to grasp, and holds the blades rigidly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>The longer handle on this version is great as I have larger hands and allows for a more balanced grip.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made, moderately aggressive, good for a beginner, and has a nice heft to it.  </li>
            <li>Finally, I highly recommend a pre-shave oil and a good after shave care regimen (witch hazel and Nivea</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as well as a really good after shave cream.</li>
            <li>This Merkur is longer, heavy, has a good grip and it is very nicely finished.</li>
            <li>I also use a badger hair brush and Taylor of Old Bond Street Shaving Cream (also incredible, and smells better than any modern shaving cream).  </li>
            <li>Even after a hot shower and a nice lather.</li>
            <li>The razor is beautifully finished, functional and will probably last me the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li>I have some experience with straight razors, so I am familiar with the prep work that is involved for ensuring that your face is good to go.  </li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going through the trouble of making my own lather and buying a brush, I want a good shave!</li>
            <li>The strippers love my smooth, clean shaven face.  </li>
            <li>I am new in DE razors and this is a good starter</li>
            <li>This razor in combination w/ Colonel Conk Soap, a badger brush, and Wilkinson blades gives me a relatively, surprisingly smooth and easy shave.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had pretty good success with it.  </li>
            <li>It gives a pretty awesome shave, should order shop double edge safety razors like bic.</li>
            <li>The texture of the handle makes it easy to grip with a light touch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to feel when the blade is at the correct angle and the shaves have been close and comfortable.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve EVER shaved with a DE razor, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;ll get a clean shave and have money left over to afford to eat lol:)</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>Shaves fine.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Merkur blades and they seem to do the job fine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It also did fine on my neck and cheeks as I just lined them up.</li>
            <li>During the work week, the EJ 89 maintains just fine.</li>
            <li>(alcohol is more volatile (evaporates quickly) and sanitizes rather well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really a super razor!</li>
            <li>So, for many years I&#x27;ve had adequate shaves.  </li>
            <li>Multi-blade systems might get this many, if you are lucky, but they cost over a dollar per head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and heavy, cleans easy and shaves great.</li>
            <li>I just have large hands and thought a longer handle would be nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and heavy, very high quality and archaeologist will probably find this razor in almost perfect condition somewhere a thousand years from now.  </li>
            <li>also have huge hands</li>
            <li>and I have huge hands.  </li>
            <li>and I get great shaves, especially if I do a third pass against the grain.  </li>
            <li>shave is so close and smooth; I feel I could go longer than 5 days without shaving.</li>
            <li>I bought this hefty and fantastic safety razor</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, the blade never clogs.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately the razor survived.</li>
            <li>I enjoy and look forward to shaving with this shaving system.</li>
            <li>In two weeks I tried four or five blades from a cheap sample pack I bought.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for users just starting or that have been using a safety razor for years.</li>
            <li>Comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li>CO Bigelow Premium Menthol Shave Cream with Eucalyptus Oil - 5.2 oz]] have made shaving something I enjoy doing as opposed to something I did every so often</li>
            <li>And since the soap is important, how you apply it is equally important.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it - time consuming, but it&#x27;s (as un-heterosexual as this might sound) kinda like pampering yourself.  </li>
            <li>it really didn&#x27;t come shave-ready from Amazon, but I found a guy in the area who did it effectively for $5).  </li>
            <li>This and a Feather blade are a combo that I have no complaints about and fully enjoy.  </li>
            <li>is great for a guy with big hands.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend getting a blade sampler as many people do not have success with the Merkur blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I have never been this smooth.</li>
            <li>GREAT Christmas Present!</li>
            <li>The receiver loves it and wont stop talking about it and how smooth his face is.</li>
            <li>so i think the heavy weight works best for my type of head.</li>
            <li>Overall great product</li>
            <li>blades!&lt;br /&gt;The razor has a comfortable handle.</li>
            <li>razor is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>of all of the &#x27;classics&#x27; I own, the Mercur is absolutely my go to razor.</li>
            <li>Since that was my primary razor, I went shopping for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I bought a cheap razor to learn how to shave with a DE razor.</li>
            <li>* Replacement blades are cheap.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic razor.</li>
            <li>Glass smooth,</li>
            <li>I now enjoy shaving.</li>
            <li>I found it to be a great starting off razor</li>
            <li>Strangely, I actually enjoy and look forward to shaving with the Merkur.    </li>
            <li>Smooth threading.</li>
            <li>My rationale is: Why not spend some extra money on what has been reviewed and recommended by many, many customers as the best thing they&#x27;ve ever shaved with instead of spending a lesser amount of money for a handle and a lot of money for &#x27;cartridges&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li>this shaver and enjoy a smooth face.</li>
            <li>Overall, this has been a great choice for me</li>
            <li>The performance is strictly middle of the road also; it does make a great travel Razor though; you won&#x27;t be that pissed if you lose it.    </li>
            <li>The chrome finish underneath the head is not as smooth as it could have been.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the shave.</li>
            <li>The bright chrome finish and rotating parts are holding up well, although it takes a bit of water and some occasional polishing to keep the top plate free of soap residue and</li>
            <li>He likes the shave, the closeness and smooth skin and not all the bumps.</li>
            <li>I put a light lather of the soap on my face, and began to shave with the 38 HD.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Congratulations, Merkur, on producing a fantastic piece of shaving equipment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I use cartridges, according to my math (which could be mistaken....feel free to check the numbers), I will have to replenish my cartridge razor supply 486.7 times, and at $25.00 a package at today&#x27;s cost, that equates to about $12,166.67 for the cartridges alone.  </li>
            <li>Anyone have any questions, feel free to message me.  </li>

            <li>Would you expect a smooth cut?</li>
            <li>So far, the brush seems good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no looking back for me now as I am absolutely hooked on this combo for the best shave ever.</li>
            <li>The shaving experience is far superior to anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.    </li>
            <li>I hear the Taylor of Old Bond Sandalwood is good soap too.  </li>
            <li>I have found that Shark stainless blades have worked better than Astra platinums, but I&#x27;ve yet to try out much more.</li>
            <li>And the brushing action is good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this razor will last me a lifetime--the construction just seems so good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got some nice heft to it and features a nice longer handle for us bigger handed guys.</li>
            <li>This razor is very nice, nice packaging and arrived in a few days.</li>
            <li>still want to find out who in their right mind thought multi blade cartridges were better for shaving than this &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; tech and give them a piece of my mind....</li>
            <li>sure you get the right blades for your face</li>
            <li>The extra weight is very nice.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, I was pleasantly-surprised at the weight, as well as the overall construction, - very nicely made.</li>
            <li>After much research I am really happy to have purchased the Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic &amp;</li>
            <li>To get the full effect of this shaving style you must use either shaving soap or shaving cream that you whip up with a pure badger brush, otherwise you might be kind of dissappointed.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for a more enjoyable shaving experience.</li>
            <li>It unscrews to 2 pieces and is super easy to change blades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;All-in-all, using a DE over ANY disposable is light-years better, and the money you save in the long run can give you the opportunity to get some good food and a date with those baby-smooth cheeks.</li>
            <li>All-in-all, using a DE over ANY disposable is light-years better, and the money you save in the long run can give you the opportunity to get some good food and a date with those baby-smooth cheeks.</li>
            <li>I ordered a Dovo Best Solingen straight edge razor, a strop, a Parker Badger Hair shaving brush, a nice pretty shave bowl, Art of Shaving Sandalwood soap in the pretty wooden bowl AND their shaving cream, and I waited.  </li>
            <li>It seemed like a good choice because I  have broad hands</li>
            <li>Keeps the blade secure and easy to swap out for a fresh one.</li>
            <li>It has good heft to it, and is easy enough to get the angles with it.</li>
            <li>all in all its WELL worth a try!</li>
            <li>I use the Feather blades but have successfully used the Merkur blade and the Extra.</li>
            <li>This one is also a bit more forgiving on beginners (eliminating some of the more exotic models), and it had a bit of extra heft, which made it preferable to me over the HD.  </li>
            <li>Overall fit and finish was excellent and it gives the closest shave so far.</li>
            <li>It is Eco friendly and you can get DE blades from 2-5 dollars a 10 pack.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a woman, so I have a lot more real estate to shave than a man (just saying!).</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cut/engraving (not sure how to describe it) on the handle is absolutely superb.</li>
            <li>Merkuur is worth the price!</li>
            <li>First, it is a bit heavier than most.</li>
            <li>My first DE was the Merkur 34c because that is the one that so many said to start with.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first safety razor, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but I know I love it.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I was excited to receive this razor</li>
            <li>This was more first safety razor</li>
            <li>first reaction to using this razor is that you don&#x27;t have to be a shaving connoisseur to be able to use the thing.</li>
            <li>This is my first DE razor and I love it.</li>
            <li>This one seems perfect, even when I was holding it with small hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many demonstrations on YouTube to help the first time user of a DE razor.</li>
            <li>This was not my first D.E. razor, but it is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Okay so I just had my first shave with the Merkur.</li>
            <li>Good strong frame, holds blades straight and steady.</li>
            <li>pretty sure I want another one.</li>
            <li>This is my first DE razor and it really is a better way to shave.  </li>
            <li>The 2-piece loading of the blade is convenient and straightforward.</li>
            <li>I could tell from the first pass that this was better.</li>
            <li>And yes I said excited to shave again..........</li>
            <li>The first step for me was to get much more aggressive blades (Feather Pt coated).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice weight, feels good in the hand (not too long or short) and looks nice as well.</li>
            <li>but the new tech dose  not make for a real smooth shave</li>
            <li>I honestly like my new &amp;#</li>
            <li>This is the best by far, for several reasons:</li>
            <li>After a stroke or two, turn the razor over to use the clean side of the blade.</li>
            <li>Spirals weren&#x27;t machined as clean as I thought they would.  </li>
            <li>and my wife will attest to a super smooth face.  </li>
            <li>Double edge safety razors are more effective.</li>
            <li>But, if you don&#x27;t want to go whole hog, the razor is the most important component of the system.</li>
            <li>I may try to do a clean face shave now though.</li>
            <li>When finished with the shave, remove the blade and, using a clean paper towel or cloth, clean the razor blade thoroughly along with the razor.  </li>
            <li>This is ACROSS the grain, not AGAINST the grain, and it makes the single biggest difference in going from a decent to a superbly close shave.</li>
            <li>Incidentally, this razor, with some training and a shot of whiskey to attempt it the first time, will help you have the best shave down south, if you catch my drift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many positive reviews of this product online</li>
            <li>The weight of the razor took some getting used to, but the idea of letting the tool do most of the work, as opposed to pulling on the tool to get the cut is a positive attribute.</li>
            <li>This razor feels solid and steady in my hand and, with the right blade (Dorco ST-300 works best for me),</li>
            <li>have almost completely cleared, and my face feels much better all thru the day!     </li>
            <li>The handle is the right length and changing blades is extremely easy.</li>
            <li>The heft is the first thing I noticed right away, more than doubled of that cheap thing I bought.</li>
            <li>But it most certainly does.</li>
            <li>If I ever have an opportunity to use another DE razor for comparison or if I run into any major problems with the construction of this razor, I will edit the review, but for now I am very pleased with the feel and look of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>suggestions: I wash my face first with warm water and either Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint Pure Castile Peppermint Soap or Pears Soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a shaving brush, mug and shaving soap for years.</li>
            <li>Love this product very high quality.</li>
            <li>Here, in a nutshell, is all you need to know to get a great wet shave with this (or any)</li>
            <li>This Works cool soft skin its amazing and the closest cut I have ever had in my life with no razor burn or bumps.</li>
            <li>gives me a pretty close shave and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to cut your throat off, lol.  </li>
            <li>The stradegy of getting a good shave using a DE razor, unlike a cartridge razor that employs multiple blades in one throw away razor, the DE razor should be used making up to 3 passes during a shave.  </li>
            <li>The top of the head comes off when you unscrew at the very bottom of the handle.  </li>
            <li>full 24 hours passed when I noticed that my face still felt like I just shaved it.</li>
            <li>The weight is good and it feels like a product that will last me for years.</li>
            <li>Such a good shave</li>
            <li>Much better shave, and so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>The blade that initially comes with the razor is a good blade to train with.</li>
            <li>The blade that initially comes with the razor is a good blade to train with.</li>
            <li>this is by far more fun to use and i feel like i get a better shave...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it</li>
            <li>this razor is sweet.</li>
            <li>(use badger, its better than boar) and real shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Also says he only has to shave twice a week because it&#x27;s so good.</li>
            <li>A bit of up front investment gets you a way better shave for a much lower cost.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who wants a better shave,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Made&amp;#34; and it was cool to know the work put into this thing.</li>
            <li>problem is, i also shave my head, so it will take more getting used to this (let alone a straight edge) than if i were just shaving my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did another blade or a vibrating feature really make a better razor?</li>
            <li>I find that one blade lasts me a full week.</li>
            <li>Most of the information I got came from a there &amp; Mantic59 has some really informative videos which will help you in this process.</li>
            <li>Most of the information I got came from a there &amp; Mantic59 has some really informative videos which will help you in this process.</li>
            <li>, I took it and tried it myself and found the same results, lots of nicks, cuts and burn no matter how you used it, and this was with Derby blades which are fairly forgiving.  </li>
            <li>good back up</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m laughing at how much money I&#x27;m saving and what a better shave I get.  </li>
            <li>Good luck with your future in DE shaving.</li>
            <li>Nicks and cuts can be avoided by taking your time, doing a good face prep before shaving, building a proper lather with a quality shave brush and using a good shaving soap or shaving cream, and letting the weight of the razor cut your beard, and if you want a very close shave, make sure you make multiple passes with the razor</li>
            <li>Hot towel your face for 30+ seconds, apply a pre shave oil if you got sensitive skin like me, Work a good lather with your shaving brush, lather up and shave with the grain.</li>
            <li>Also, the handle is exactly the right length of the several popular DE razors I own.</li>
            <li>This thing works exactly the way it&#x27;s supposed to work, cleans up easily, and looks cool (and that&#x27;s not a bad thing at all).  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m good with the whole new old-fashioned style of shaving.</li>
            <li>It was the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years, and when I say years, I mean like 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is really easy to cut if the blade is not the first time use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The weight makes the razor easy to hold, maintain an angle, and keep consistent pressure on your face... even on curves.</li>
            <li>This is my first and was easy to get use to.</li>
            <li>For the first time since I was 18 and Gillette sent me my free Mach 3 razor in the mail I was excited to shave.</li>
            <li>Get on board with all the other DE converts and save money and treat yourself (and face) every day to a great shave.  </li>
            <li>The size and shape of the handle and head make shaving easy (at least in my large hands) and the weight is perfect.  </li>
            <li>A quick wipe with a towel or microfiber cloth after a soak brings everything to shiny, beautiful goodness once again (never wipe your blades, shake to get most of the alcohol off) and reassemble your razor and place everything back on your razor stand until the next shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sharp but does an exceptional job for you when you shave!</li>
            <li>LOVE the barber pole handle feature - the &amp;#34;screw at the bottom&amp;#34; allows me to unscrew it slightly while I am shaving to lift the top guard a bit if I need to rinse it out better.</li>
            <li>in all, if you&#x27;ve never shaved with a safety razor, you&#x27;re definitely missing out on one of the best shaves of your life (unless you take the time to learn to use a straight razor or find a barber like I did).</li>
            <li>I use the Parker on my head with a Shark Super Chrome blade</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way more fun to shave now and it&#x27;s much smoother afterwards.</li>
            <li>It smells awesome (though I wish the scent lasted longer than a few minutes) and really calmed the razor burn.  </li>
            <li>Of course, one cannot simply expect to get great shaves from this razor straight out of the box.</li>
            <li>The razor&#x27;s own weight is generally enough to do the job, I just let it rest against my skin while lightly pulling it along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It falls into the mild to medium range for aggressiveness.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor as a back up to my Edwin Jagger DE89 which I love, and this has now become my favorite razor.</li>
            <li>Luckily Amazon sells them in bulk.</li>
            <li>what I&#x27;ve gathered this type of handle is the most popular for beginners in the wet shaving world.</li>
            <li>Heavy and great fit</li>
            <li>I also have a mild tremor in my hands that made me nervous to switch to a safety razor.</li>
            <li>It seems that the more things change, the more they stay the same.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The grip is still quite adequate and not slippery and there have been no issues loosening/tightening the bottom knob to change blades.</li>
            <li>Yes, after so many years, I went back to the basics of a safety razor &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li>Despite my novice DE shaving status, I have no problem with very close, comfortable shaves with very rare bloodshed.    </li>
            <li>No complaints with the EJ89, but when I want or need something with a little more aggressiveness and weight, the Merkur Barber Pole is the next best step up for me.</li>
            <li>The shave cream smells of sweet almonds, which I really like, but it seems more of a luxury (whereas the skin food, also pricey, seems far more worth it to me).  </li>
            <li>(I shave every other day)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet shaving is the best way to go by far.</li>
            <li>That also provides ample opportunity for a good long test drive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Beautiful and heavy.</li>
            <li>I hope that this razor lasts a long time and that I continue to have a good experience with it.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I went back to the classic razor, refills are cheaper and I think a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful gift!</li>
            <li>Although everyone is different, for the most part I think the choice between the longer and shorter versions of the Merkur line should be mainly based on which suits your own particular shaving needs better.  </li>
            <li>F N times better than the new tech.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will probably out live me.  </li>
            <li>This is my first DE razor and I am loving it so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many DE (double-edge) razors, knowing full well that DE shaves are far closer than the multi-blade Gillettes.</li>
            <li>This shaver is very sturdy, easy to use and provides a close shave.  </li>
            <li>I have really appreciated the strong build quality and weight of this razor.</li>
            <li>While I am fairly new to safety and straight razor shaving, I do also own the Merkur 180 (aka the 23c), the Merkur Futur, the Edwin Jagger DE89L and a Thiers Issard</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is only a very minor drawback to an otherwise excellent razor - however if I had known about this before buying I might have gone with a razor with a bi-directional knurling pattern.</li>
            <li>The Parker doesn&#x27;t get quite as close on looser areas of skin and around the neck, but it does fine shaving my head since the skin there is very taught.</li>
            <li>I began trying different blades and quickly found that the sharper ones were more comfortable for me (Astra and Feather).  </li>
            <li>Just a note to fellow beginners - a lot of the experienced users of DE razors comment on how the handle of this particular razor is quite long.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty steady growth of hair and my hair is thicker than most.</li>
            <li>but I enjoy shaving now so much that I don&#x27;t mind doing it</li>
            <li>I also tried proraso shaving cream which I enjoy but not as much as the soaps.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the razor but very seldom rate anything a highest level or lowest level.  </li>
            <li>Great for those with heavy beards.</li>
            <li>Has a good weight to it (not too light or too heavy).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Merkur product is solid and amazing quality.  </li>
            <li>weight of this razor is quite a bit more than the old Mach 3</li>
            <li>Spend some time on Badger and Blade forums and get a semi nice brush to go with it and shaving won&#x27;t seem like such a chore anymore with this razor.</li>
            <li>It was worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Safety razor shaving is worth it but not a \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; shaving experience like alot of others on here state.  </li>
            <li>Wash face with warm water (or just take a shower), then squeeze a quarter-sized dollop of shaving cream onto the warm, wet brush; start whipping up a lather directly on your face.</li>
            <li>In the most tightened position, the blade is held very stable without much wiggle room.</li>
            <li>I also wanted to note that I didn&#x27;t buy any of the shave soaps or brushes - I&#x27;ve been using regular shaving cream and shaving after I shower, which is probably the most important part since that makes the hairs easier to cut.  </li>
            <li>I also still haven&#x27;t run out of my &amp;#34;canned goo&amp;#34;, so what I do for now until I receive a few more things in the mail to try is apply some Aveeno Therapeutic Shave Gel (which I&#x27;d long ago determined to be the best performer of the &amp;#34;canned goo&amp;#34;) before getting into the shower.  </li>
            <li>Out of my collection this razor is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It is so worth it.</li>
            <li>And once you get it, the blades don&#x27;t cost 12 bucks for 4 of them and only really give 3 or 4 good shaves.</li>
            <li>Shaving is now fun</li>
            <li>like I just had a refreshing professional barber shave when I walk out.      </li>
            <li>I rarely cut myself now.  </li>
            <li>The chrome is classy and the design is stylish.  </li>
            <li>Those are my favorite (so far, it could take a year to try everything).</li>
            <li>I just gave myself is as good or even better than a professional straight razor shave that I recently paid $35 for at a boutique barber shop.</li>
            <li>I am learning the skill of a double edge razor with this merkur and have to say I am loving it.</li>
            <li>I had to make multiple passes, and didn&#x27;t find the razor effective.</li>
            <li>Functions well, as good of or perhaps the best shave as I&#x27;ve ever had even with those 4, 5, or 6 blade or whatever Fusion razors that have replacement blades costing over $5 each and lasting only a few shaves.</li>
            <li>It will add about 10 minutes to your shaving routine but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>I actually tried running it across my own face hairless though it may be</li>
            <li>I rarely cut myself.</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Also, check out geofatboy(free advertising) on Youtube for great shaving videos to help young guys like me to learn how to properly shave like our grandfathers used to.</li>
            <li>While there was a learning curve for its use, driving on through that learning curve has proven to be worth it.  </li>
            <li>This is the only DE razor I own.  </li>
            <li>I used cheap Barbasol aerosol cream, but will probably move on to the mug and brush gig later on, as it&#x27;s supposed to be the better way to a cleaner shave.</li>
            <li>and I Bought this for my wife to shave her legs with as I thought the extra weight and length would be handy for that purpose.</li>
            <li>With a fresh Feather loaded in there it gave me a BBS shave in 3 passes and no irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should note that to change blades, the top separates completely from the razor, so you need to take some care.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>In this case, the ole stereotype about superior German engineering really comes to mind.  </li>
            <li>a straight razor shave one time in the military in Japan, and it was also a great experience.  </li>
            <li>Nice middle of the road razor.  </li>
            <li>The razor itself is beautiful, very heavy.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean between passes whereas my other razors required more soaking and cleansing between passes.</li>
            <li>They are first time users of the double edged razor and they love it!  </li>
            <li>I successfully completed my first DE razor shave with absolutely no bleeding!  </li>
            <li>I read a ton of reviews on the 38 HD and other DE razors and settled on the this one based on excellent reviews, longer handle length, and the fact that it is basically almost the same product as the Merkur 34 HD.  </li>
            <li>Now I am able to quickly give myself a better shave than previously without any cuts or burn.</li>
            <li>My hands are large and shaped more like mittens than gloves, so the long handle is appealing.  </li>
            <li>But the overall opinion I&#x27;ve gathered is that Merkur is a really good brand, that many people prefer it over other brands, and that this particular model is one of the ones most recommended for newbies.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good bit more aggressive than my old Gillette Tech and took a little getting used to, but once I mastered it, my shaves are quick and close.    </li>
            <li>Works as advertised and as good as my other Merkur...</li>
            <li>double edge razors stop reading and just buy this (along with a high quality badger brush, good soap/cream, and a blade sampler pack).</li>
            <li>I have larger hands and the long handle gives very good control.  </li>
            <li>Yep, that&#x27;s right:</li>
            <li>This one is just so right.</li>
            <li>Right out of the box...</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>if I never tried I&#x27;d never know right??</li>
            <li>It just sliced the hair right off.</li>
            <li>And the Merkur 38 HD seems to have just the right design to reach everywhere on my face except right under the nostrils.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty amazing to me considering I didn&#x27;t do anything different.</li>
            <li>I was cautious of course, but really no issues, it was a breeze compared to a straight edge, and here&#x27;s the kicker: the results were surprisingly more comfortable than the Proglide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preparation is a big part of getting a good shave, and I&#x27;m still exploring pre-shave</li>
            <li>but it was enjoyable, almost as if I was back in the day, cheasy, yes, but true.  </li>
            <li>Without trying to sound like a conspiracy theorist, I realized I was being manipulated by clever marketing.</li>
            <li>Its a high quality razor which feels just right for a guy with huge hands.  </li>
            <li>This razor is a two piece unit which I really like and you unscrew the bottom of the handle to remove the top and put in a new blade.</li>
            <li>I chopped my neck up pretty good the first time and trimming around my goatee is kind of tricky, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised for a first round.</li>
            <li>I read previous reviews on different models and the best blades to use.  </li>
            <li>I clean it about once a month with an old toothbrush &amp; isopropyl alcohol to keep it shiny as well as clean.</li>
            <li>Your beard hairs will cut easier and more effectively if you shave them using multiple passes (from different directions), so take your time and don&#x27;t hurry.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the higher price up front</li>
            <li>I would not have purchased it, but in person it looks very stylish and does not slip when wet.  </li>
            <li>So far the best blades for me in this razor have been Personna Blue (made in USA) and Crystal (a.k.a. Personna Red, made in Israel).</li>
            <li>The long handle makes it feel more familiar, like</li>
            <li>This is a great razor and it is very heavy duty.</li>
            <li>You will enjoy waking up and shaving, heck, you may set your alarm clock a 10 minutes earlier to enjoy shaving with this.  </li>
            <li>Beyond the satisfaction of shaving with a sturdy piece of metal that feels like it will last for hundreds of years, the shave is far superior when compared to cartridge razors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This might be the best investment I have made in the last few years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also just more fun to shave with, especially if you throw in a shave brush</li>
            <li>Works great, feels old-timey, and you&#x27;ll save so much $$$ not having to buy replaceable razors every few weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a heavy hence the &amp;#34;Heavy Duty&amp;#34; razor not the cheap kind.</li>
            <li>Merkur and its logo are engraved nicely at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor came in a box with a single Merkur razor blade.</li>
            <li>Another great tip (thank you [...]) is to keep the head submerged in mineral oil (which can be found at target or other stores I would guess) which will keep the water out of it and make the blades last significantly longer and prevent any possibility of rusting.</li>
            <li>Everything I expected and more !</li>
            <li>I like this shaver very much.  </li>
            <li>Replacement razor blades are very, very inexpensive</li>
            <li>It was a very straight forward operation.</li>
            <li>I am a tech-centric kind of guy, always trying the latest and greatest stuff, but in the case of razors I found every new model worse than the last - dulling quicker, clogging easier, and more and more expensive.</li>
            <li>It has great balance with an extra long handle and just the right amount of weight.....which is not too heavy.....but balanced well in my opinion......</li>
            <li>other, and probably the most important, aspect of DE&#x27;s are the blades.</li>
            <li>Shaving the right sideburn was not as much of an issue with my right hand.  </li>
            <li>the long handle is nice in my large hands.</li>
            <li>I currently use the Merkur progressive adjustable (on the lowest setting) and get a decent and reasonably comfortable shave and almost never see a nick or a cut, I&#x27;ve also used a bargain basement cheap safety razor and actually got a the best shave ever out of it, very comfortable and smooth especially with Derby blades, unfortunately that one broke (as I said cheap)</li>
            <li>Not luxurious like Trumper&#x27;s cream but a fraction of the cost and very effective (provides more slickness to give less drag than the cream).  </li>
            <li>This will keep it looking new as well as keep it clean and remove the excess water in between the blade and head</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an old pro with these kinds of razors, but I had owned one DE razor before and the difference in quality was huge.</li>
            <li>Really, this investment is worth it, it costs me about 40 cents a week to shave now, soap and blades, compare that to buying fancy Gillette blades.  </li>
            <li>HD Barber Pole DE Razor was the first DE Razor I used.  </li>
            <li>You make your lather, apply w/a brushand make your first pass WTG (with the grain), then rinse and re-lather.  </li>
            <li>That way you will be prepared for your first shave having taken the time to read how it is done    </li>
            <li>This is my first DE razor and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li>Like I said in my title I have been using this razor for three months, and I should note this is my first time with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>I love this Razor did a lot of research as well prior to purchase blogs videos</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m as well glad that I went for this Razor vs 34c HD,  because I have big hands</li>
            <li>I dove right in, buying the HD along with the Perfecto 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush, Perfecto chrome stand, Geo F. Trumper Almond Shaving Cream Jar, and Geo F. Trumper Limes Skin Food.  </li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;re confident, especially around the nose and neck, don&#x27;t hesitate to try the sharper options.  </li>
            <li>this is my first,</li>
            <li>(My personal favorite are the Feather Platinum blades.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(My personal favorite are the Feather Platinum blades.)  </li>
            <li>Replaced the razor, but still took repeated passes if you weren&#x27;t daring enough to apply more pressure.</li>
            <li>This will last me for the rest of my life for sure...</li>
            <li>when i first got it i had to learn how to use it without leaving my face with a ton of nicks in it.</li>
            <li>but I actually have more control with this one.</li>
            <li>I felt it would be appropriate to write a review before actually using the razor</li>
            <li>Changing the blade is simple, all one has to do is unscrew the bottom and pull off the top and slip a blade in.</li>
            <li>Second, it has a longer handle than most.</li>
            <li>Since the knurling on the handle all runs in the same direction it acts more like threads on a screw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I consider myself a pretty environmentally aware person</li>
            <li>I knew their had to be a better way than to shave than what American society pushes at us...</li>
            <li>we first got it</li>
            <li>It was my first safety razor</li>
            <li>This is the first safety razor I have used in years.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I look forward to shaving every day.</li>
            <li>He loves it; I love it, and it&#x27;s a solid as it was the day it was purchased.  </li>
            <li>I am a first time DE shaver</li>
            <li>I decided to remove the top cap from my 34c and put it on this razor and instantly a world of difference it was shaving just as well as</li>
            <li>For top performance I used tag teamed it with the Japanese feather</li>
            <li>I would not recommend trying this razor for the first time the day of a job interview or if you are going to be on</li>
            <li>TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten much better after several shaves (and watching some YouTube videos).  </li>
            <li>read a ton of reviews on Amazon (thanks, Amazon customers!)</li>
            <li>I had no idea how many different types there were.</li>
            <li>the razor looked like a very well crafted piece of equipment!</li>
            <li>I allways intended to get a better razor, but I never saw anything in the drug store that was all that different from the Atra cartridge that I was useing.</li>
            <li>razor is also similar to the EJ in that it seems to be a forgiving razor, maybe more so without sacrificing closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li>It should also come with more than one blade, especially at that price.  </li>
            <li>With that said, I had a couple of weeks of consistent nicks and cuts on my neck region.</li>
            <li>Shaving really is something I look forward to now!</li>
            <li>Even when showed the exact angle to have it at, it still didn&#x27;t even feel like it was doing anything.</li>
            <li>I recently converted from a Schick Quadrillion (because more blades is better--right?)</li>
            <li>I use Wilkinson&#x27;s Sword blades which I am able to find in local drug stores or (ugh)</li>
            <li>Much better performance than the Wilkinson&#x27;s swords, but can&#x27;t be found locally.</li>
            <li>purchased their competitors razor first</li>
            <li>I was ready to opt out of the system!    </li>
            <li>The system is so sophisticated that unused foam is automatically recycled to be used for the next shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The system is so sophisticated that unused foam is automatically recycled to be used for the next shave.      </li>
            <li>and I find they last at most 5 shaves.</li>
            <li>Having decided to get into wet/DE shaving, I researched many different razors.  </li>
            <li>The first time was the experiment.</li>
            <li>I also have a Merkur short handle 34C which tends to cut a bit more aggressively and sometimes I bleed.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling smooth &amp; soft which</li>
            <li>(My technique to remember was each time I used a razor to take the wrapper the razor came in &amp; tape it to a piece of paper then wrote bad, good, best next to it</li>
            <li>(My technique to remember was each time I used a razor to take the wrapper the razor came in &amp; tape it to a piece of paper then wrote bad, good, best next to it</li>
            <li>First off the pictures on do it justice.  </li>
            <li>This is my first ever DE razor, so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything, but the look and feel of</li>
            <li>The 38c was the first DE razor I purchased.</li>
            <li>Would recommend as a first safety razor.</li>
            <li>I targeted the merkur line because of there consistent reviews for quality.</li>
            <li>The razor is well made and is pretty hefty.  </li>
            <li>First time using a de razor..</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor.</li>
            <li>This being my first safety razor</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor and I must say I&#x27;m now a convert.  </li>
            <li>this is my first DE razor, and most likely all I will ever need.  </li>
            <li>This was my first DESR in about 30 years.  </li>
            <li>If this is your first safety razor I recommend you buy a blade sampler and try a selection of vendors.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>But overall, I think it&#x27;s a top notch razor.    </li>
            <li>I had bought the Merkur HD 34C as my first DE razor.</li>
            <li>I will only replenish my blade supply about 16.7 more times, at acurrent cost of around $16.00.  </li>
            <li>This is my first razor after using disposable razor heads.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and decided on buying the Merkur 23C first.  </li>
            <li>I bought the 38 HD and the first time I used it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a heavy bearded guy, but I like a smooth finish when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months, and I can say that it may not be a glitz and glamor model, but it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and the quality is as promised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, heavy, reliable, with good grippage.</li>
            <li>Still this one is more precise due to close up and weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave reinvented!</li>
            <li>So one day I was looking to buy some new cartridges for my Gillette Proglide (I had given up on the electric shavers years ago), and I looked at the price and thought, &amp;#34;That&#x27;s pretty much a full tank of gas!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I never thought that this old style shave would be better than the new style blade</li>
            <li>However, the heft and the slightly longer handle of this razor gives me a closer shave and is more comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>I may try a different blade manufacturer in hopes of a more positive shave.</li>
            <li>So, I come back to the 38, which I&#x27;m slowly coming to love more and more.</li>
            <li>Try this razor if you want to tell Gillette and Shick to shove their obscene profits where the lights don&#x27;t shine and get back into affordable comfortable shaving that will be sort of fun.</li>
            <li>Obviously, not all &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; technology is better technology, because this has really done the trick.  </li>
            <li>It may sound corny, but it makes shaving fun, and I wish I had switched from blade cartridges much, much earlier.</li>
            <li>I love that I can boil this stainless razor to keep it from getting gross.</li>
            <li>It is a nice simply designed and solidly built piece of equipment; the problem is that for a few dollars more you can get a much better Razor.</li>
            <li>Not only is it so much cheaper, but the closeness of the shave is not anything I&#x27;ve ever been able to get in an electric, disposable or cartridge razor.  </li>
            <li>The chrome plating is very good, and one other thing I need to mention, especially if you are a new DE Razor user....</li>
            <li>Honestly I think in general this should be the standard size in length for most even without big hands.</li>
            <li>it does take a little more time because i use the badger brush and lather up shaving cream but its well worth it!</li>
            <li>The Merkur brand has a good reputation, and because of the name I expected something a little better.  </li>
            <li>This is a positive case of &amp;</li>
            <li>[i.e. screwing the long handle clockwise tightens the blade assembly at the top of the razor.</li>
            <li>My first razor of this type and it shaves really well.  </li>
            <li>My first impression of this razor is that it&#x27;s very well made with the finest materials.</li>
            <li>with this one minor criticism, I am perfectly satisfied with this razor.</li>
            <li>Having sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve always had trouble shaving--in fact, I can only shave twice a week even with the best tinctures, lotions and shave soaps.</li>
            <li>The simple and old school design and operation makes it easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>The overall appearance is appealing and classic.</li>
            <li>Use a nice sharp blade, and you&#x27;re in business!</li>
            <li>I assume that the razor works exactly within spec and it will give a very close shave, but it can easily shave too close and draw blood if patience and proper technique are not part of the shaving session.</li>
            <li>This razor is highly recommended by many longtime double edge users.  </li>
            <li>The head is very heavy, which was fine -- but the shorter handle changed my elbow-shoulder-neck angles as I shaved my neck, changing my neck muscle tension, which lead to more nicks along the changed neck muscles.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this razor if you have medium to large man/woman hands and want to save money over the life of this razor, since blades are so cheap and at such a higher quality, not to mention the quality of your shave is infinitely better once you have learned the proper shave</li>
            <li>This razor is really easy to user and after watching some instructional videos I had no problem picking up basic wetshaving technique.    </li>
            <li>The body of the razor is very solid and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>It was physically lighter than the 34c, and the shave was no quite as easy as the shave I got with the 34c, and it is a 3-piece razor.  </li>
            <li>I used to dread shaving but with some Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream, my super badger brush and this razor; It is a relaxing pleasure.</li>
            <li>Never have my shaves been so close or so smooth, and after using this product for a week, the razor bumps I normally get on my neck are completely gone.</li>
            <li>It is a nice, heavy razor - my first DE safety razor.</li>
            <li>All in all a better shave than a cartridge razor and much cheaper in the long run</li>
            <li>Google for \\&quot;DE blade sampler packs choice\\&quot; to find a sampler pack with a large variety of blades.</li>
            <li>Pure Badger Shaving Brush]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>im 6&#x27;4&amp;#34; with rather large hands.</li>
            <li>This razor will certainly outlive me.  </li>
            <li>have large hands, and I like the length of this razor.</li>
            <li>I like my Merkur razor, but be advised that it takes a certain level of skill to use one.</li>
            <li>Since I have large hands, I opted for this model against the 34c.</li>
            <li>problem is that if you&#x27;re an experienced shaver this guy tends to be on the moderate side even with a very sharp (Feather) blade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty solid piece that looks really nice with the chrome on the outside.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with starting out new and pampering myself a bit.</li>
            <li>most state of the art technology, there is a slight learning curve when using this powerful device.  </li>
            <li>eventually decided to get this Barber Pole Merkur HD as I thought the extra 3/4 inch long handle would be perfect for moving my hand back a little more while shaving</li>
            <li>That brought me to a whole new world where I&#x27;ve learned that shaving can actually be an enjoyable pleasure that I actually look forward to and find not just the look but both the feel AND FEELING of the results</li>
            <li>This new shaving device uses amazing \\&quot;mono blade\\&quot; technology that delivers a shave as close as the finest multi-blade cartridge system,  but the blades are completely bio-degradable and have a tiny \\&quot;carbon footprint.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>The DE (double edge) razor design has been around for 100+ years and with proper technique will give you a perfect shave in one pass, providing less irritation than the 3,4, 5 or by the time you read this 8 bladed cartridges.</li>
            <li>So I am pretty excited to see what it&#x27;s like when I actually shave the way you are suppose to with this thing.</li>
            <li>But, I didn&#x27;t cut myself, which was my main goal for the first try.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>I have large hands and this fits me very well.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I went with the slightly longer model, I feel I have the right amount of control.</li>
            <li>According to the commercials and the ads, the first blade of the multi-blade razors lifted the hair, the second blade cut it cleanly.</li>
            <li>Second shave was fine, much easier.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very heavy, solid and has a good grip to it!</li>
            <li>Well made heavy razor with a nice handle for my large hands.</li>
            <li>It comes apart very easily into two pieces by twisting the knob at the bottom and you just put the blade in and tighten it down.</li>
            <li>The blades are very inexpensive relative to disposables, so do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t go on the cheap for blades.</li>
            <li>The blades are very inexpensive relative to disposables, so do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t go on the cheap for blades.</li>
            <li>fit and finish is fantastic, living up to its heavy duty name.</li>
            <li>A huge plus to a double sided safety razor is the cost of blades.</li>
            <li>I like the heft and feel of this razor a whole lot.  </li>
            <li>After doing much research.....and reading a lot of reviews.....I settled on the Merkur 38C.</li>
            <li>The added weight and longer handle really make a difference in shaving.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a very subjective thing I understand</li>
            <li>but I enjoy them so much that I don&#x27;t really mind and actually look forward to shaving now.  </li>
            <li>This Razor glides really well</li>
            <li>Then again, I&#x27;ll be saving so much on blades</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the Trumper&#x27;s skin food stuff</li>
            <li>i really like how close of a shave</li>
            <li>so im about to try a whole head shave excluding eyebrows of course.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Merkur 38HD to complement my use of a straight razor, and all I can say is \\&quot;Wow\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care what the package looked like</li>
            <li>I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>I would get such fantastic shaves.</li>
            <li>This is a really quality handle</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t much to say about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very well constructed, two piece razor.</li>
            <li>This razor works really well.  </li>
            <li>Well, I found out that a friend of mine got into straight edge shaving, and he said that when he&#x27;s in a hurry he uses a safety razor.  </li>
            <li>He thanks me whenever he shaves.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>That meant that if I placed too much pressure on the blade when shaving, I might twist the assembly to the side and loosen the blade.</li>
            <li>I does meet my expectations very well.</li>
            <li>it gives me a much nicer shave than today&#x27;s cartridge razors.  </li>
            <li>There are probably hundreds of double edge (DE) safety razors available, from antiques on eBay to present-day newly-manufactured razors.</li>
            <li>If you prefer a real \\&quot;vintage\\</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unlike anything you&#x27;ll ever get from a modern multi-bladed shaving razor from</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re someone that is coming straight from cartridge</li>
            <li>High reccomend it!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t really cut myself at all.  </li>
            <li>, don&#x27;t need to drag it like most razors.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this product and almost want to keep it a secret to all the women out there just so that the price doesn&#x27;t decide to jump on the replaceable razors.  </li>
            <li>Pick it up with some Shark Double Edge Razor Blades and free yourself from di$po$able razor hell...</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t for a fast shave, this is a Razor for a shaving experience.</li>
            <li>This is a very well made, quality razor.  </li>
            <li>In addition to all this safety razor blades are much cheaper than cartridges.  </li>
            <li>razor is stainless steel.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the top cap on the razor extends too far covering too much of the blade which prevents you from getting a proper shave</li>
            <li>a modern razor feels.</li>
            <li>The Barber Pole is well made and very functional.  </li>
            <li>My husband is very please with the razor.</li>
            <li>I conducted several shaves and at best I was left with an uneven shave.  </li>
            <li>razors with 3-5 blades because it fit their description of how to properly shave.  </li>
            <li>and I really got into it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I REALLY got a kick out of was what was printed on the wrapper of the Merkur razor blade that came with the razor:</li>
            <li>So much so I ended up buying a stand for it to hang from on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>She did not care for it because it was a very aggressive shaver</li>
            <li>A real work of art.</li>
            <li>With that thing I&#x27;d be feeling growth just 6 hours later, but with this I&#x27;m still smooth shaven when I go to bed.</li>
            <li>I think this weighs as much as 2 Merkur 180s together.</li>
            <li>I felt it was a much close shave than I have very had.</li>
            <li>I was very relieved.  </li>
            <li>I really like the feel of this razor in my hand, there is something to hold on to.</li>
            <li>to use and very well constructed.</li>
            <li>It took my about 30 days before I really started to really get it</li>
            <li>There really is a difference in sharpness, ease of use and durability among them.  </li>
            <li>I have saved so much money with this razor that I can now afford to go to Strip Clubs four times a month instead of twice a month.  </li>
            <li>straight.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Gentle finger tightening works quite well in securing the blade.</li>
            <li>If one is ready to develop the needed skills or already has those skills, Go for it.</li>
            <li>It was that much of a difference.</li>
            <li>It gives me a wonderfully smooth shave and it definitely is a money saver when it comes to razor blades.</li>
            <li>especially like the secure blade assembly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and heavy; built like a tank.  </li>
            <li>I use Poraso shave cream/soap with a good badger brush having tried the Col. Conks shave soap and a few others so far.  </li>
            <li>Nice shave in only two passes using Persona blue box blades.</li>
            <li>I went through a few of them until I found what I liked in style, weight, and ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>This is my second safety razor and by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>This Barber Pole also has that similar solid feel and weight that I got and liked from the shorter Merkur razor.</li>
            <li>I have large hands and the long handle makes it easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for something that is functional, well made (well enough to last several lifetimes, probably) and good looking then you have come to the right place.    </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to guess where it&#x27;s going on your face; and with a very sharp DE blade that&#x27;s pretty important!  </li>
            <li>Just wow!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job: I get through daily shaving pretty quickly (3-5mins tops)</li>
            <li>New to DE shaving and was nervous before my first shave.</li>
            <li>I made sure not to use much pressure, almost none at all, and was very very careful.  </li>
            <li>My Father-In Law gave me a classic razor years prior, which I keep in my gym bag, and I really enjoy the close shave they give.  </li>
            <li>The weight pretty much guarantees a smooth, effortless shave on the face (myself) with minimal passes and effort</li>
            <li>The replacement of blades is simple and straightforward.</li>
            <li>That being said, since I wasn&#x27;t able to hold other models, it is all I</li>
            <li>No amount of care in using the razors, or applying &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; creams, gels, or lotions, nor any amount of blade changes to make sure every edge was sharp helped.  </li>
            <li>It was the familiar &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34; type of razor with two doors that open to expose where the blade sits.</li>
            <li>The question here is do you want a \\&quot;barber pole\\&quot; \\&quot;old style\\&quot; razor or a new smooth \\&quot;futuristic\\&quot; looking old style safety razor?  </li>
            <li>It gives a very Close, Classic shave.</li>
            <li>If you are considering a classic razor I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li>A very well thought out design for something so classic.</li>
            <li>K Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer]] that was given to me from my grandfather as a \\&quot;becoming a man\\&quot; gift.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice hefty feel to it, the handle is long so you wont feel like you have run out of room with it in your hand, yet you can choke up on it and not use the entire length of the handle.  </li>
            <li>The somewhat rare combination of long handle and extra weight along with the barber pole handle etching make this one stand out from most of the classic Merkur models.  </li>
            <li>While the razor handle is labeled as long, it is still rather short in my opinion, but I have large hands (usually wear size XL gloves) and the size is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Realizing that, (for this kind of money), I needed a little more info, I visited several sites, including &amp;#34;Badger &amp; Blade&amp;#34;, and read several reviews for each of the models I was looking at.</li>
            <li>I got tired of paying the 4700% profit to Gillette and Shick for multiple blade razors that are nothing more than gimmics and don&#x27;t do the job nearly as well as a good safety razor.  </li>
            <li>on to this razor in particular, I like the longer handle (although it really is not that long, shorter than a Mach 3 for example) and as with other Merkur razors the build quality is excellent.  </li>
            <li>If it doesn’t fit on your cute little stand… your stand’s too short.</li>
            <li>Get a good lather, which will be denser and less bulky than if you&#x27;d used commercial spraycan foams.&lt;br /&gt;3) SHAVE.</li>
            <li>Your small efforts will be rewarded with the knowledge that you are not only more \\&quot;green\\&quot; but you also have the latest new tech toy on the block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a fairly thick beard and it gives me an incredibly close shave without a single nick.</li>
            <li>Merkur makes nice razors but they are not known (at least in a positive sense) for their blades.    </li>
            <li>The long handle was important to me.</li>
            <li>The feel in the hand is at that sweet spot for my larger hands:</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Apparently, many other safety razors are considerably shorter that the 38HD, so for a convert like me, going from a cartridge razor to the 38D was pretty normal in terms of handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So, I was searching on Youtube one day and stumbled upon geofatboy&#x27;s videos that showed me how to shave properly and showcased many different versions of safety, and straight razors.  </li>
            <li>I must say that so far it is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>so I could see the full left sideburn edge.</li>
            <li>(if you do most of your skin will go down the drain, with your stubble - which is true of any double edge).  </li>
            <li>I originally thought I needed the long handle as most safety razors tend to be smaller, but I can say for certain it&#x27;s not necessary.</li>
            <li>A little more aggressive than I thought, but very close.  </li>
            <li>I read a lot online about options, and quite honestly, I remembered my dad&#x27;s old razor from when I was a little kid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very heavy duty, has a nice weight and handle length.  </li>
            <li>The main reason I bought this razor was I was mad at Gillette always making a new razor that is the best, and the animal testing that they do.</li>
            <li>you get a new blade, and with real care, you will not hurt youself.</li>
            <li>I get a better shave with less irritation, and to me</li>
            <li>The knurling on the handle makes it easy to control with wet hands.</li>
            <li>Classic styling, solid construction and proper function are the three things that make this an outstanding choice.  </li>
            <li>A well built, solid razor that will last for many years.  </li>
            <li>The additional weight of the Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic requires time to develop skill.  </li>
            <li>Just like many of the reviewers on this board, I did my research on multiple websites and paid close attention to their directions for using this double edge razor.</li>
            <li>B003BRETQU 25 SHARK SUPER CHROME DOUBLE EDGE SAFETY RAZOR BLADES]],</li>
            <li>Give it a try and get rid of your plastic disposables, sometimes simple tools do the same job better.</li>
            <li>Why did I pick this particular razor?  </li>
            <li>Over the years, I have tried several DE razor brands but have come to realize that I love this DE razor above all the others.</li>
            <li>it definitely gets a super close shave.</li>
            <li>I was tired of the cheap disposable junk razors that sliced up my handsome face and end up in a landfill.</li>
            <li>Decent shave,</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been using this same razor now for several years, spending pennies on replacement blades, no longer dealing with skin irritations, and getting a better shave.  </li>
            <li>but he must have bought his particular stand in Lilliput because this razor&#x27;s handle is about 2 1/2&amp;#34;-3&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Okay, a few weeks later after much more practice, this thing definitely shaves much closer than my mach 3.</li>
            <li>If you want weight and length just get a Futur, if you want the older style get a Progress or and HD.    </li>
            <li>And I can purchase hundreds of good DE blades for the same price as just a few disposable blades.  </li>
            <li>I bought the 38HD Classic, Personna Blades (100 in a pack), Tweezerman&#x27;s Badger Hair Brush, Williams shaving soap, a soap bowl, and a brush stand.  </li>
            <li>I will only replenish my blade supply about 16.7 more times, at a current cost of around $16.00.  </li>
            <li>The savings just grow as you get older.  </li>
            <li>I bought the 38HD Classic, Personna Blades (100 in a pack), Tweezerman&#x27;s Badger Hair Brush, Williams shaving soap, a soap bowl, and a brush stand.  </li>
            <li>The savings just grow as you get older.  </li>
            <li>While I am still learning, my experience so far has been a positive one.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this particular razor.  </li>
            <li>You can unscrew the handle as described above and you can also further pull the long axis of the handle to expose more parts and get a deeper clean.     </li>
            <li>When I used it the first time I really cut myself upI may just need more practice however the single blade is far different than the three blade schick I&#x27;ve been using for 30 years now.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.its stainless steel with a chrome finish and feels very solid and durable.it doesn&#x27;t pivot like the multi-blade razors wich takes some getting used to, but makes shaving seem like a little bit more of an art.it</li>
            <li>This was my first DE razor, and I had significant trouble getting used to zero pressure and steady angle for the jawline, but my face and neck feel and look much better due to the sharper shave.</li>
            <li>I took to it pretty quickly so there is not much of a learning curve.</li>
            <li>I definately recommend this product to anyone looking for a high quality safety razor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using/trying both the Derby and the Feather razor blade with this razor.  </li>
            <li>The weight is heavy enough to convince you of the craftsmanship in your hand, but light enough to let you deftly shave.      </li>
            <li>highly enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the product and the store.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I was highly sceptical that the weight of the razor alone would be sufficent...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to make the switch from a cartridge razor to a DE razor I highly recommend trying this out</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend Feather blades.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product or any Merkur DE razor.</li>
            <li>My friend recommended Merkur razors for their durability and high build quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Nearly</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T put in your pick-up bin), I&#x27;m saving time shopping for the refills, and still getting a high quality product.</li>
            <li>always make high quality products.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>business and reeks high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only fault I can give this razor is that when it&#x27;s wet, the grip isn&#x27;t all that great to hold on to; but it&#x27;s a small complaint for an otherwise great razor.</li>
            <li>I often find myself gripping near the top of the razor to get the right angle, and I find the weight of the razor to be awkward when you grab it by the handle.</li>
            <li>: when you&#x27;re done shaving, unscrew it a little and rinse it, that will make sure to get all the stubble out of the head.</li>
            <li>I figured out that old school shaving is 10! 10!</li>
            <li>The handle is long-enough for my big hands and the design is classic and useful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the few non-hightech gadgets I own, where &#x27;modern&#x27; has actually innovated some legitimate improvements over &#x27;classic&#x27;.</li>
            <li>First off, let me say this, compared to a few other DE razors I&#x27;ve purchased, vintage DE razors, this brand new DE razor made in Solingen Germany is very well made (I also own and use a DOVO straight razor made in Solingen).  </li>
            <li>This gives a comfortable shave without the nicks and burn that I always seem to get no matter how careful I am with my cartridge razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a secure grip even when wet or slippery.  </li>
            <li>This is more of a spot for wet shaving in general.</li>
            <li>I like this razor a lot, only thing i would say is a &amp;#34;checkered&amp;#34; grip as opposed to a barber pole style would give a better hand grip when wet, tends to feel like it wants to spin,lol</li>
            <li>I like the weight of the razor and now see how this can be an important factor when wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have much reference on which way to go as far as razors.  </li>
            <li>While I was skeptical after the first shave or two, I&#x27;m already convinced that it was a good move.  </li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, taking my time and doing multiple passes with the Mach3</li>
            <li>I followed the Internet&#x27;s collective advice: keeping the skin taught, using multiple light, short strokes, first with the grain, then re-lather, then against the grain, rinsing it frequently, and always trying to keep the blade at a 30 degree angle from my skin.</li>
            <li>People who are complaining need to watch more than a few video&#x27;s</li>
            <li>razor and &amp;#34;Personna Double Edge Razor Blades&amp;#34; give you a shave better than any disposable and the savings between this razor &amp; blades and disposable razors is gargantuan.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>A well made product and well worth the money considering the low price of replacement blades.</li>
            <li>Here are a few I found the most helpful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Here are a few I found the most helpful.      </li>
            <li>Well, I have to say, it does take much longer for inexperienced shavers to shave, however I enjoyed the entire process.  </li>
            <li>Not only do the blades only cost about $0.50 so they can be replaced more often, but I&#x27;ve found I get as many, if not more, shaves from this.</li>
            <li>I am new to safety razors and have always used the high dollar disposable type razors, including the Gillette lineup.</li>
            <li>Secure it down with a twist of the bottom and your ready to go.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the other Merkur classic razors; they are too light and come apart in three pieces to change the blade.  </li>
            <li>However, the significant weight of this razor helps me keep my hand steady while shaving (and the added closeness of a thorough wet shave means that I don&#x27;t look like an unkempt basement-dweller at the end of the three days I have to wait between shaves).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rinse your razor in hot, hot water; shake it dry and then dip it in 90% rubbing alcohol to displace the water and to disinfect and sterilize the blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blades are a lot less exspencive, some of the old ways are better.</li>
            <li>I own the Merkur HD Classic 38C, along with six or eight vintage Gillettes, and have also expanded into straight-razor shaving as well (with some restored &#x27;seriously&#x27; antique razors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out</li>
            <li>A single blade will last 4 or 5 shaves (more, with some care).</li>
            <li>XTG shaving you would shave left to right or right to left.  </li>
            <li>The angle on the blade is just right for a close shave and even when I cut myself starting out</li>
            <li>I expect to try out the soaps sooner or later, but don&#x27;t feel like you need to make that leap right away.    </li>
            <li>just the right size if you have big hands like I do.</li>
            <li>Whether this is right for you is a matter of personal choice.</li>
            <li>I have bigger hands but matched with the right blade</li>
            <li>We both have very large hands and struggle with the pencil-thin handles on regular razors.</li>
            <li>The blades are extremely sharp and a light touch when shaving is mandatory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want an extremely close and comfortable shave, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li>Now at age 23, I am guilty to say that I have been using these same clippers to shave and trim up after I cut my hair(I&#x27;m very good at it).  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a new DE razor.  </li>
            <li>I am new to this after paying a ton of money for razor bumps and burn whoooo Wheeee</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to DE shaving.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get about 4-5 shaves before you need new ones.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get about 4-5 shaves before you need new ones.</li>
            <li>just so I could use the new razor when it came in</li>
            <li>This assumes you buy this razor at the age of 20 and live until 80 and invest the $10/month in the stock market at a 9% interest rate.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this almost a year ago I was new to the art of shaving like a man.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re new to DE shaving, i also recommend getting one of those &amp;#34;DE sample blade packs&amp;#34; so see which blades you like the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this razor after struggling for months to find refills for my 3-blade razor with no interest in buying a new 4-blade or vibrating razor.</li>
            <li>Safety razors are new to me, even though I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>TO REMEMBER IF YOU ARE NEW TO THIS STYLE OF SHAVE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>TO REMEMBER IF YOU ARE NEW TO THIS STYLE OF SHAVE:    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Being new to DE shaving</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the DE shaving</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 38, and if I live to be 70</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 38, and if I live to be 70</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the DE shaving world</li>
            <li>Like many others, I finally decided to take the plunge and try wet shaving using a DE safety razor.  </li>
            <li>The razor is nice to hold and it&#x27;s heavy enough to do the work for you, no pressure needed.</li>
            <li>The weight of the razor lends itself to the ease of the shave, since the razor is heavy enough to basically cut through the hair on its own.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First few shavings like I remember with my old razor many years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The major drawback of this razor as compared to modern razors is the lack of a pivoting head.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin so getting nicks and cuts has always been an issue for me when shaving.</li>
            <li>What I somehow had missed in my research is that this slanted head is generally not recommended for beginners for whom a straight head style is apparently less challenging.  </li>
            <li>That usually gets most of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I digress... not for sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>It is so satisfying to complete a close shave and know it costs pennies while not captive to a corporate price controlled industry.</li>
            <li>First of all, this is my second \\&quot;safety\\</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality of this product is obvious at first glance.</li>
            <li>Having watched the various videos online, I had an idea of how to shave with one of these and on my first shave</li>
            <li>I rinse it in hot water and swish it briefly in some 91% rubbing alcohol after every shave and,</li>
            <li>This was my first double edge razor.</li>
            <li>Not only was the first shave easier</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The first time I picked this razor up, I could tell it was well-made meant to last.</li>
            <li>This is the first DE razor I&#x27;ve ever used... and I&#x27;m thinking will be the last razor I&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
            <li>First de razor I have purchased...never going going back.</li>
            <li>construction is solid and it is really pretty.</li>
            <li>This futuristic, yet elegant, device is made of durable metal instead of the usual plastic</li>
            <li>(Makes the antique Gillette look like a rickety, old wagon)!</li>
            <li>I wish this was my first DE razor purchase, it would have been my last.</li>
            <li>One for the first pass and another for the second pass).</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the polished finish and solid feel.</li>
            <li>B0077LAJT2 Personna Double Edge Razor Blades]] , which are also extremely cost-effective and outstanding razor blades.  </li>
            <li>B0077LAJT2 Personna Double Edge Razor Blades]] , which are also extremely cost-effective and outstanding razor blades.  </li>
            <li>There is a learning curve you must overcome at first, but once mastered there&#x27;s no turning back.</li>
            <li>Now, I typically slap a new razor blade in my Merkur every 3-4 days and enjoy a literally razor-sharp blade for just cents each.  </li>
            <li>With every blade change I simply take some baby wipes or tissue paper and rub it clean - very low maintenance.  </li>
            <li>The razors are sharp and so inexpensive compared to the cartridges that it&#x27;s worth spending a little time learning to get a safe, close shave with the Merkur.</li>
            <li>By a stroke of pure genius the replacement blades will cost about a tenth that of a classic cartridge and will actually provide two complete edges, in essence giving you two blades for the price of one.  </li>
            <li>This highly concentrated pellet can provide at least as many shaves as a can of shaving foam and doesn&#x27;t use propellants or a steel aerosol can.  </li>
            <li>Using Gillett and many other brands finally now at 28 years old</li>
            <li>To my pleasure, I shaved with it for the first time and, WOW, it shaves as good if not better than the 2 and 5 bladed razors out there and for half the extended price!</li>
            <li>The first shave didn&#x27;t go too bad, yet it wasn&#x27;t great either.  </li>
            <li>I get a much closer shave, my razor bumps had disappeared, and in the long run shaving will be MUCH cheaper.</li>
            <li>The few you might find in your local drug store may not be suitable.</li>
            <li>The refill blades that I buy are cheap and last a long time as well.</li>
            <li>As my first wet razor, I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.</li>
            <li>With the modern razors, I normally had to shave again the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Evidently, I have sensitive skin, especially on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got beefy hands (think burly and stocky, not long and lanky) and</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t blown away after the first shave; I had been using a Quattro and Jack Black&#x27;s Beard Lube and at first it seemed like there was no difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>- I have no complaints - this razor is built much more solidly than my previous safety razor.</li>
            <li>And once he got used to the razor (especially the weight), he was getting a closer, better shave than anything he had tried previously.  </li>
            <li>I got tired of buying razor blade cartridges for $2 a piece to keep my blades sharp for a nice clean shave not a rip your hair out as you go encounter.</li>
            <li>This means, as you&#x27;ll see in the post farther down, I am still YEARS away from using up the box of 100 blades I originally purchased.  </li>
            <li>again, that does not imply the Derby blade is not sharp, it is sharp, but the Feather is very sharp and you will feel the sharpness after your shave due to more of the top layer of skin cells will be removed when using the Feather razor blade    </li>
            <li>By keeping the razor blade dry and stored outside the bathroom away from steam and moisture, the blade should last quite a bit longer, and so be even more cost-effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I prefer the 38c hd as I am a man with large hands and like the weight of a solid razor, not plastic.  </li>
            <li>Buy this razor with confidence as it is a fine shaving tool and one that will last you your entire life with proper use and care</li>
            <li>(I got the super sharp ones - feather, I think?</li>
            <li>It is super sharp</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;barber pole\\&quot; only breaks down into two which makes it easy to load new razors.</li>
            <li>The twisted finish adds a comfortable rigidity and it feels secure in your finger tips.</li>
            <li>sensitive skin aftershave balm (it&#x27;s cheap!)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if you would prefer a vintage 50s Ferrari to a modern supercar model then you and I are on the same page.    </li>
            <li>Check out mantic59 on youtube for an intro into this old fashioned technique.</li>
            <li>I just shaved with Catie&#x27;s Bubbles Soft Soap</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m complete now.</li>
            <li>It has taken me a few weeks to switch from a light weight disposable twin blade razor.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I have is that I unfortunately cannot seem to find many razor stands to fit it.</li>
            <li>One thing I use to do is apply pressure with my plastic disposables, well you really don&#x27;t want to do that with this razor, you need to let it glide over your face and the weight of the razor should be enough.</li>
            <li>(speaking of, one box of refills nearly pays for this tool).</li>
            <li>The first couple of times you use this, you may get a nick or whatnot, so do it on a weekend and use the lawnmower hitting you with a rock as an excuse for your nicks.</li>
            <li>try a lot of different soaps, creams, and aftershaves looking for my \\&quot;absolute favorite\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I have tried quite a few of the tools that are available after you lather up.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m still waiting on soap to arrive) because so much of the actual shave&#x27;s effectiveness has to do with the correct blade choice, preparation, and technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Classy look.  </li>
            <li>So I started thinking about the old barbers and how they shave men&#x27;s faces so close.</li>
            <li>After doing some research I found out that the multiple blade razors can actually cause more issues because you are essentially shaving each spot multiple times.  </li>
            <li>With all of the cash that had already been thrown at cartridges and razor changes, the price tag on this didn&#x27;t sting TOO much when considering that if it worked and held up that blade changes would only be pennies thereafter.  </li>
            <li>I did 3 passes and removed next to no hair on my face being very dissatisfied</li>
            <li>have a reasonable heavy beard, and it took the old Gillettes and the straight razors to really teach me just how _</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m over 50 years old... and have been shaving since I was 15.</li>
            <li>This is a greart razor for men with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Persona Blue blades work really well for me with the Merkur.</li>
            <li>and so far I have found no need to purchase another.</li>
            <li>I have spend a solid 2 weeks researching safety razors, as well as straight edge razors and shavettes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i decided to go with this one for 3 vital reason, the weight, the longer handle, and reviews said it was &amp;#34;more forgiving&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Price is fairly reasonable as well, especially knowing that I no longer have to pay $2.50 per fusion</li>
            <li>The German razor appears well made and well finished, so the price seems quite reasonable.  </li>
            <li>but then again I could only use one cartridge razor (Gillette Fusion) on my face per shave which became very costly in itself.</li>
            <li>After a lot of research I took the dive into the old fashion safety razer.</li>
            <li>100 blades is considerably cheaper than a 5 pack of anything else.</li>
            <li>This razor is very well made, with solid construction and weight.  </li>
            <li>At 16 years old, Mom gave me a can of barbasol and a track II.  </li>
            <li>This old school razor puts overpriced cartridge razors and electric shavers to shame.</li>
            <li>I was immediately amazed at how smooth the save was, even though my beard was about 4 days heavy.  </li>
            <li>I am, however, looking at trying out a Dovo Straight Razor next.  </li>
            <li>I will also review that when I have developed an opinion about the experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think anyone that uses this razor in a reasonable fashion will be instantly hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased my complete setup for around $122 including shipping.  </li>
            <li>I think anyone that uses this razor in a reasonable fashion will be instantly hooked.  </li>
            <li>I purchased my complete setup for around $122 including shipping.  </li>
            <li>using it is a skill that has to be developed.</li>
            <li>I think the best part about it is that the head screws on via the base of the handle.</li>
            <li>If you re-insert the top of the razor to the rest of the razor and do not tighten correctly, the top of the razor can allow the razor blade to move up and down, which is not good as your skin can possibly get caught between the blade and the guard</li>
            <li>modern shaving tools are nothing more than a scam - they make shaving slightly easier at the expense of extremely high costs and lots of waste.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend this particular razor over other DE safety razors, as it&#x27;s the first I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I see no change in shaving aggressiveness from its original little brother, Merkur 38C HD.</li>
            <li>Merkur also makes several other styles that may or may not be available on Amazon (you&#x27;ll have to Google them).    </li>
            <li>The sound you hear as the ultra sharp blade glides across your face is addictive.  </li>
            <li>There is a small learning curve but after 1 or 2 shaves it is easy.</li>
            <li>I bought my first Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic \\&quot;Barber Pole\\&quot; Long Safety Razor a year ago March 9, 2011, and the Feather Hi-Stainless Double edged razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>went the eBay route and figured that I should buy an older razor from that era because it was probably built better... or at least, built to last.</li>
            <li>, it is all true, but the basic design wasn&#x27;t developed in 2008, it was developed over 100 years ago and it is likely that your grandpa and possibly your dad used it.  </li>
            <li>Well, it is all true, but the basic design wasn&#x27;t developed in 2008, it was developed over 100 years ago and it is likely that your grandpa and possibly your dad used it.  </li>
            <li>Recently started experimenting with some new blades, and thought I would splurge on a new razor to go with them.</li>
            <li>so far no nicks or cuts (a little razor burn at first, but as I moved to sharper blades that hasn&#x27;t been too much of an issue).  </li>
            <li>how about instead we brush on a little sandalwood shave cream, use this fine razor, and a few smooth moves later we can be soft as a baby&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>When reassembling the razor, be sure the reassemble the long handle by pressing the little c-clip in with your fingers to make it glide into the body of the handle.    </li>
            <li>Occasionally I&#x27;ll get a loose badger bristle stuck under the guard and this allows me to quickly flush it out and keep shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have an older Merkur \\&quot;short handle\\&quot; razor that I&#x27;ve used for years</li>
            <li>(it was fine, not &#x27;mashed up&#x27; or damaged) when it arrived, and this purchase was placed in the final days of my Prime membership - so it was in my hand in less than 48 hrs.</li>
            <li>It was shortly thereafter that I decided to enter an older world of shaving.  </li>
            <li>Back to the Merkur Hd Classic Safety Razor.</li>
            <li>- gadgetry: various adjustables or clever mechanisms    </li>
            <li>After looking at different models, I settled on the 38 HD Classic Barber Pole because of its simplicity:</li>
            <li>The looks are classic and it&#x27;s a simple machine.</li>
            <li>Simply switching to a shaving soap and using a DE razor has saved me over $200 in the first year alone, including the cost of purchasing this handle which will probably last me the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was also very interested in trying a razor that did not have the typical butterfly opening</li>
            <li>Decided to go back to the old way of shaving because the results are comparable to the new devices and over time will save money on shaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Razor Scientists have developed a radical new razor called the DE or \\&quot;Double Edge\\&quot; Razor.  </li>
            <li>If you like the idea of a little extra heft but want a more traditional handle length, try the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only downside is that I would like to see slightly more aggressiveness with the handle&#x27;s knurling because it&#x27;s been a little slippery, especially noticeable when I&#x27;m cleaning it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the other two items to complete my whole new shaving experience.</li>
            <li>After a couple of shaves, you&#x27;ll have the technique down to a proper shave each and every time, with no cuts (yes, I&#x27;ve actually cut myself, once when I first got it), and you&#x27;ll save money for the long run (a year or more of blades will set you back around $14 or so, and whatever the cost of your soap/creame and pre/after shave products).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was worried about this when I got the stand because of the long handle, but it fits very well.</li>
            <li>talking about small degrees of difference, so enjoy whatever choice</li>
            <li>I really like the weight in the handle and even thought the description says long handle</li>
            <li>you believe that if you spend a few more bucks you can get a \\&quot;Futur,\\&quot; got news, same company and same style of shaving!  </li>
            <li>Normally, when I go out in public</li>
            <li>After using the razor just a few times, I was able to master the technique to hold the razor properly to get it to shave properly.  </li>
            <li>I am right- handed and the shorter handle made it more difficult to get my hand back far enough to assure I was creating a straight edge for my entire sideburn.  </li>
            <li>The Personnas can be found on Amazon&#x27;s and are very sharp but also a little more forgiving for a new DE shaver like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do have to not that the razor I received was new and sealed, however there were some imperfections in the groves on the handle (simply cosmetic).  </li>
            <li>The blades are easily exchanged and once the mechanism is tightened down it does not come loose like some others I have used.  </li>
            <li>Proper shaving has become a lost art and today&#x27;s average joe hasn&#x27;t a clue about the fine art of the traditional shave that our grandfathers took part in.</li>
            <li>They will dry too fast and then the razor will not glide over your face without taking some skin as a trophy.</li>
            <li>whenever I clean my bathroom (less often than my wife would like), I use the same bathroom</li>
            <li>Lately, I have been maintaining a beard, and this is easy to use around the edges to groom the lines of my beard.</li>
            <li>finished shaving with cold water, followed by good old fashion Witch</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently 25 years old, and started shaving with a Mach3 (too young for my dad to have started on one of these,</li>
            <li>So... if moderate razors (like the standard Merkur DE&#x27;s or the Feather Stainless) haven&#x27;t worked well for you I recommend opting for the adjustable Merkur Futur instead.</li>
            <li>I chose this safety razor because I have big hands, so I really have difficulties with those tiny things we use to find.</li>
            <li>I am not about to go back to the multi-blade plastic disposables yet, but that could quite possibly be because of how much money I have invested in purchasing this yesterday&#x27;s technology razor and refill blades, Shaving Brush, Shaving Soap, Mug and a separate mirror.</li>
            <li>The Parker was the least expensive, but was very light, and the Feather was more money than I wanted to spend on shaving for the rest of my natural life, so I opted for the Merkur as a &amp;#34;middle ground&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought two of these, the first replaced a more expensive handle, the second was a gift.</li>
            <li>It looks pretty sharp too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently begun moving from the marketing driven shaving devices I&#x27;ve used for the past 20+ years (Fusion, etc) to a more traditional shaving experience.</li>
            <li>Now, I haven&#x27;t seen a wide enough variety of vaginas to know what the average hair growth is, but from what I have seen, mine is a bit courser than most.</li>
            <li>MAJOR irritation).  </li>
            <li>(As I originally said, we&#x27;re talking small degrees of difference &amp; preference.  </li>
            <li>but after trying the Merkur \\&quot;barber pole\\&quot; DE razor for the first time with the Merkur blade that came with the safety razor I will never return to the Mach 3 or any other cartridge razor again.</li>
            <li>the routines that I now use, and my Merkur 38 HD \\&quot;Barber Pole\\&quot; DE razor... is the major part of my morning shaving experience.</li>
            <li>Long handle, heavy duty safety razor will last for many years.</li>
            <li>, I might as well buy a whole new printer for these prices!&amp;#34;  I felt used, put down the cartridges, and went home to pout and brood over this.  </li>
            <li>#34;Barber Pole&amp;#34; long handle classic razor.  </li>
            <li>B000RJUZMW Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic \\&quot;Barber Pole\\&quot; Long Safety Razor]].  </li>
            <li>B000RJUZMW Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic &amp;#34;Barber Pole&amp;#34; Long Safety Razor]]</li>
            <li>Interestingly, while my old razor&#x27;s handle is diamond knurled  (a cross-hatch design carved up and down the pole, rather rough on my hands), this razor is only diagonal knurled (carvings in the handle run only one direction diagonally).</li>
            <li>First, note that the &amp;#34;Barber Pole&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Long&amp;#34; description only applies relative to other DE razors: compared to a cartridge razor, the 38HD&#x27;s length is totally normal.</li>
            <li>We have also noted there was much less irritation and ingrown hairs after getting a grip with proper use of a safety razor (no shaving against the grain!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note for the ladies that may plan on using one of these: if you plan on shaving your legs with this razor, be sure to use a thick, stiff bristle brush to work up your lather and to stand up the hairs for a better shave.</li>
            <li>When connoisseurs of fine products speak of items where form intersects function with aesthetic appeal, the Merkur 38c HD is an example of what they mean.</li>
            <li>get a super close shave every time, something that I only got the first few uses of the other blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to write yet another glowing review for this razor&#x27;s positive attributes as they have all been throughly covered by other reviewers.</li>
            <li>I generally use DE razors in one position anyway.</li>
            <li>It is heavier than the #180, and probably on the heavier side of DE razors in general.</li>
            <li>If you want to experience a proper shave, hit up youtube and watch a few shave demonstrations, then come back and get this bad boy and get ready to knock your woman dead with that handsome baby smooth face (for you men) or completely erase your man&#x27;s mind with ridiculously smooth legs (for you women).</li>
            <li>In short, it took me a long time to make just two passes, and I didn&#x27;t get a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>Takes a while to get used to, but the item is clearly well made and seems like it will last forever.</li>
            <li>part of what attracted me to DE shaving, besides saving a bunch of money on blades, was the idea of using an old world style instrument in my daily routine and</li>
            <li>From an economic standpoint, I&#x27;ve already saved the price of this razor in what I would have spent on disposable cartridges, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have no regrets.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely a step up from my old razor in both aesthetics and engineering.</li>
            <li>A variety sampler pack of DE razors Proraso preshave cream in the White line for sensitive skin (smells a bit manly)</li>
            <li>only thing I can add to what&#x27;s been said is this:  the weight of the 38 surprised me.  </li>
            <li>, it looks classy and traditional.</li>
            <li>is, by far, a well-made razor... built to last...</li>
            <li>my entire adult shaving life...</li>
            <li>So, definitely take your time and becareful / ready for a couple of small cuts in the first weeks of usage.</li>
            <li>Old timers like my grandfather used this type of razor and men before him for hundreds of years for a reason; it get&#x27;s simple, reliable and get&#x27;s the job done.</li>
            <li>I was very reluctant to want to buy this handle &amp; start wet shaving but kept wondering if I&#x27;d ever get rid of my razor burn.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve yet to shave my head with thing, which I may attempt in the near future.</li>
            <li>It’s crafted to last forever &amp; has that old style look to it.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re ready to take the plunge into DE wet saving</li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t be going back to my old Fusion.</li>
            <li>I also am very fond of the barber pole texture on the handle which helps me hold the razor when it is wet.  </li>
            <li>The one time expense to buy this beauty will be saved in no time from the difference in cost of the old blades especially if you shave every day!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll want something with a little less &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; and better exfoliating properties.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was not hard to do or uncomfortable in any way.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen people review this type of razor and say it takes more time to shave this way.</li>
            <li>Functionally, the long handle is closer to my old Sensor razor than the standard HD allowing me to hold it in a similar fashion and reduce the amount of awkwardness I have to work through as I learn this new (old) method of shaving.  </li>
            <li>For those new to DE razors I offer this suggestion, experiment with different razor blade brands, since everyone&#x27;s face is different.</li>
            <li>There is not a single complaint in the 1-3 stars that I feel is justified.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little time to adjust the style of shaving and amount of pressure you need to apply to cut the hair when switching from modern razors to the old fashioned way.</li>
            <li>The Merkur gets a closer shave with less irritation as long as I&#x27;m careful and make sure my technique is solid.</li>
            <li>Seriously I get baby butt smooth</li>
            <li>I am a new  single blade shaver and this blade is forgiving.  </li>
            <li>Little nicks may come for the first week or two if you are not used to this</li>
            <li>A weeks worth of stubble, or a month&#x27;s - this a single swipe will take it down to bare skin, two inches at a time - just rinse (opening the blade chamber a bit can help) and repeat.</li>
            <li>Very nicely weighted and build quality (don&#x27;t fall for less expensive Chinese</li>
            <li>The only other razor I&#x27;ve used had a blade assembly that opened by twisting the whole assembly itself.</li>
            <li>I vacillated for far too long before I bought this razor.</li>
            <li>The grin I witnessed from someone who ordinarily hates hates HATES shaving and was using an electric and a Gillette Fusion Power with the fortune in replacement blades was worth everything and the finish?</li>
            <li>I got a few nicks the first couple of times</li>
            <li>Aside from a few nicks on the first shave I don&#x27;t get any razor burn and no ingrown hair.  </li>
            <li>With all of those, I have suffered with consistent irritation and trouble with shaving bumps.  </li>
            <li>I will never return to the muti-bladed disposable cartridges again... and my new Merkur 38 HD \\&quot;Barber Pole\\&quot; long handled razor, is one of the reasons I&#x27;m now a new wet shaver convert!</li>
            <li>The only thing that wasn&#x27;t perfect for my particular set of conditions was it was a little difficult to see clearly past my hand when shaving the edge of my long left side burn.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Merkur razor to cut down on the expense of modern razor cartridges.  </li>
            <li>Due to my particular beard growth patterns, I must shave my neck with a blade every day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to \\&quot;wet shaving\\&quot; and have been using cartridge disposable razors</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still new to wet shaving and shaving with a safety razor, so I still have to find my technique.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a razor everyone who enjoys wet shaving or people who are new to it like me, should have.</li>
            <li>but after I adjusted the razor angle, quit pressing down so hard and started taking my time, I did not experience any more nicks</li>
            <li>Other than that, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Using the double-sided safety razor blades work really well for me, much less rash than with a disposable razor.  </li>
            <li>It is possible that my initial enthusiasm with wet shaving might factor into my appraisal of this particular razor.  </li>
            <li>I finally took the plunge into traditional wet shaving with this Merkur 38HD Classic \\&quot;Barber</li>
            <li>I just go after it twice, once straight down from chin to collarbone in short strokes; and once diagonally from lobe to Adam&#x27;s apple.</li>
            <li>I was going to order the old style single blade razor that the bald guy from pawn stars was promoting.</li>
            <li>Definitley worth the expenditure either way, saves money in the long run, less garbage, and in fact recyclable!  </li>
            <li>It shed several hairs the first few shaves, but now only one or two per use.  </li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re careful and move slowly it&#x27;s not usually a problem.  </li>
            <li>The cost definitely is a bit pricier up front, but you&#x27;ll come out cheaper after a few months of switching from your cartridges (which can be $20 or more each month!), and have much less waste in the end</li>
            <li>I shaved the same way I always do and it was done very quickly ( maybe a little faster without having to deal with a razor clogging every few swipes).</li>
            <li>(the other two were a Futur and an HD, the HD feeling too small in my hand and the the Futur feeling too smooth,</li>
            <li>Unfortunately the curve the doors formed on top was higher and made it difficult for me find the right angle for the blade to make contact with my face shape.  </li>
            <li>The knob on the end of the handle used to open up the razor for inserting the blade is polished smooth and a little slippery so sometimes takes a little finagling to open up.    </li>
            <li>Ifyou want to go even further back and save even more money, you can get a straight razor and strop, but those are a little too scary for me.</li>

            <li> great product.</li>

            <li> Great weight and length of handle.</li>
            <li> and it gives me great shaves without spending a literal fortune on the blades i was buying before..</li>
            <li> and I was quite happy with that one as well.</li>
            <li> Both are great in respect to expectations, results and feel.</li>
            <li> This thing with the feather blades shaves closer than anything I have ever experienced.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Shaving with my Merkur is a great way to start  the day.  </li>
            <li> The Merkur 38 Hd is well engineered and feels great in the hand, IMHO of course.</li>

            <li> * Amazing shave!</li>
            <li> Merkur makes an amazing product!  </li>
            <li> The quality of the Merkur 38c is impeccable.</li>
            <li> It looks brilliant in my bathroom and has a nice weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although the Barber Pole design was nice, I Returned it!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant upon buying this razor because I thought I was going to cut my own throat with it!  </li>
            <li> To be honest there was virtually no adjustment from using a cartridge razor to using a DE razor for me!</li>
            <li> but he says it&#x27;s an excellent razor and the quality is top notch.</li>
            <li> this razor has a nice nice balance..fits well in your hands, nice weigh..go for it!!</li>
            <li> The Merkur shaves great, looks great, cheaper to use and is better for the environment.</li>
            <li> Pair it with a badger hair brush and some nice shaving soap or cream and you&#x27;ll be amazed at how great your skin feels and</li>
            <li> (you don&#x27;t have to apply pressure to get a good pass), since that weight and a good blade take all of the work out of shaving.</li>
            <li> this is a good razor to start with and get some experience.</li>
            <li> Both work well with this razor with the Feather being the sharper of the two, yet the Derby will give a good close shave used in this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I do think that you can get just as CLOSE of a shave using a good replaceable shaver</li>
            <li> and it was good</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every brand out there and the Van Der Hagen Aloe Vera &amp; Shea Butter is as good as any for 5 or 6 times the price.</li>
            <li> Like any good piece of hardware the Merkur has good construction, heft, and quality materials.</li>
            <li> * West Coast Shaving (Good place to get supplies, razor sampler packs are well known)</li>
            <li> The internet forums also suggested this razor as a good one to make the leap into DE shaving.    </li>
            <li> The weight of the razor feels so good in your hand.  </li>
            <li> Works well, and good quality.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was good</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> I used Proraso shaving soap which is also good.  </li>
            <li> This razor, when combined with good technique, will produce shaves that will exceed your wildest dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of build quality, this thing is built like a precision whisker-annihilating weapon.</li>
            <li> I find the shave for me to be really good</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re shaving, you must have good control of the blade in your hands, otherwise you will be hurt.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> and decided that this razor would be a good fit for my hands, have good weight to it, and provide an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to make a cut or nick by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of blades, including &amp;#34;7am&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Merkur&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Astra Superior Platinum&amp;#34;, and others.</li>
            <li> So through my research I find that Merkur makes really good quality DE razors.</li>
            <li> ... felt good in my hands.</li>
            <li> how great they work and how nice they look.</li>
            <li> I am told the balance is great and it looks nice.</li>
            <li> Fits and fells good in the hand.  </li>
            <li> I Think this does just as good of a job as the others at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I bought a 100pk of Astras based on the good reviews and price.</li>
            <li> than others, so good for a beginner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> her razor, she wouldn&#x27;t get a good shave.    </li>
            <li> Feels good in hand.</li>
            <li> , I felt this one would be a good one to start with.  </li>
            <li> Good, but cut me too often.</li>
            <li> Not some alcohol based smelly sauce, a good quality cream.  </li>
            <li> A clearly superior shave compared to a multi blade razor.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good razor.  </li>
            <li> , it is a hefty razor that provides a good grip for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I was told it was good for beginners</li>
            <li> but I loved it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean and perfect shave!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver with derby blades, the cheap tweezerman badger brush and arko shave soap for about two months and must say it&#x27;s been a very pleasant experience.  </li>
            <li> And the ability to manuever the blade was exceptional.</li>
            <li> The soap dish and brush stand are still working fine, and the shave brush is also still in very good shape.  </li>
            <li> The razor appears to be of good quality and has a wonderful feel, just the right size and weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I liked the heaver adjustable handle I had before this one gives me a much more pleasant shave and the longer handle is great.</li>
            <li> My husband is MORE than happy with it.  </li>
            <li> That was very interesting to learn.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This razor, a brush, Williams shaving soap and after shave cream make shaving a joy again and a rewarding experience.</li>
            <li> If they made this razon with a handle 1.5 to 2 inches (3.8 cm to 5 cm) longer, it would have made for a much better shave -- for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some of you, this will be a great razor, but it was not for me.</li>
            <li> I used Astra Platinum blades and was glad I did, since they worked great.  </li>
            <li> This razor is a great piece of equipment, and I am thoroughly pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor for over 2 years now and am very satisfied with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> This razor is well balanced and much more attractive than the picture can show.</li>
            <li> Nice weight, and feels good in my hand.  </li>
            <li> Add a badger brush, and a fine cream like Truefitt &amp; Hill, and you&#x27;ll have the perfect, enjoyable shave.</li>
            <li> Good grip, good angle, good weight and a longer handle for easy of use and precision.</li>
            <li> It has good weight and balance which I think made it very easy for me to get use to it.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and it&#x27;s GREAT!!</li>
            <li> and I guarantee you&#x27;re gonna love it too!</li>
            <li> just used it for the first time with the included Merkur Platinum blade and got the best shave of my life.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been using electric razors and disposable blades all these years, I&#x27;ve never had a better shave!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor!</li>
            <li> I love the razor handle itself, but felt the Merkur brand blade is came with sucked!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor!</li>
            <li> From the quality of the chrome polished frame &amp; handle to the smooth quality of the threads on the screw in handle Merkur did a beautiful job of building the razor.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle and get a great shave.  </li>

            <li> Nice weight for shaving.</li>
            <li> It was so nice that I purchased another one.  </li>
            <li> With the Williams Mug Shaving Soap, the razor glides as though it had its own comfort strip attached.  </li>
            <li> It has impressed me that much.  </li>

            <li> The chromed finish is perfect, and the screw mechanism for the head is sure and steady.</li>
            <li> OK, why would people ever have moved to cartridge razors when this kind of shaving goodness existed all along??</li>
            <li> Great razor well worth the price</li>
            <li> The merkur is the best by far.    </li>
            <li> First impression: it&#x27;s a beautiful thing and it feels well-balanced in the hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good weight and holds the razor securely.</li>
            <li> Good razor, bought it to have a longer handle, but use it, I think the razor should be supplied with a cheap plastic case.</li>
            <li> The handle is heavier on the Merkur, and the weight of the razor is more effective in shaving.</li>
            <li> It was the most popular razor on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Nice weight, looks great, gives a consistent shave no matter what blade you are using.  </li>
            <li> excellent example of this stunning new DE Razor technology is the Merkur Barber Pole DE Razor.  </li>
            <li> With the right blades it&#x27;s a great shaver.</li>
            <li> and I wish I could properly express how great it is to engage in one of those forgotten rituals that remind a man why it&#x27;s great to be a man.</li>
            <li> This is a solid product it gives a great shave when paired with a great razor, (Astra) for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is certainly well&#x3D;made and beautiful</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s do ourselves and our lovely women a favor and give ourselves the kind of satisfying shave we deserve and that they love.</li>
            <li> Great and fast delivery !</li>
            <li> Respect the edge, lads and lasses, and you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Has a very comfortable handle.  </li>
            <li> Good, mild shave.  </li>
            <li> The grip is awesome, I dunk mine in hot water to start out with to get it warm and ready, and I take it out and begin to shave.</li>
            <li> but there are alot of types to try and find what works best on your face, also dont skimp on the lather, its cheap and worth the good stuff, also badger brush is a must, i got a cheap one at first and the hairs fall out....</li>
            <li> razor has a great feel in my large hands.</li>
            <li> Great Weight, smooth cut and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I use Cremo shave cream and Personna blades, so I&#x27;m sure they help too.  </li>
            <li> Love my HD.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this razor.</li>
            <li> so maybe an adjustabe would be a better choice depending on your beard.</li>
            <li> give or take a dollar or two at most.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it.......</li>
            <li> In no time at all you&#x27;ll experience the most absolutely wonderful shaves you have ever had in your entire life!!!!</li>
            <li> The heft of the razor is ideal for letting the weight of the razor shave your beard w/o adding any of your own pressure to move the razor across your face    At the time I purchased this razor here at Amazon, I also bought a package of Derby Extra DE Razor blades (5 pack) and a 10 pack of Feather DE blades, also purchased here at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> you want to make sure you tighten the handle after inserting the razor blade.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you always tighten the top of the razor well before using.  </li>
            <li> This razor is stunning.  </li>
            <li> The styling and design are top notch.  </li>
            <li> stylish.</li>
            <li> I love this safety razor.</li>
            <li> A couple of tips to keep it tip top</li>
            <li> more often!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I love using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I used the merkur blade that came with it and prefer the derbies much better.  </li>
            <li> col. cunk&#x27;s shave soap and found cunk&#x27;s to be my favorite</li>
            <li> but I use arko the most.  </li>
            <li> You must give yourself time to get used to using this shaver or else you will have many nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li> Your shaves will now take more time</li>
            <li> but they cost SO much more and wear out faster.  </li>
            <li> This setup will save me a lot of money over the years and will also be better for the environment as I can recycle the blades and keep the shaver and badger brush indefinitely.  </li>
            <li> Love this razor.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to buy them in the states for years over the counter</li>
            <li> but if you can find the \\&quot;Premium\\&quot; they are even better.  </li>
            <li> I have a Parker 22r that I like too, but this is a better razor and gives me a better shave.</li>
            <li> For a starter razor, the Parker is probably going to be better for most people, but once you get some time under your belt with DE shaving, try the Merkur.</li>
            <li> You can start with most any DE blade.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this razor.</li>
            <li> After 2 uses, I don&#x27;t see how on earth this DE razor is better than a mach 3 or a fushion.  </li>
            <li> The teeth allow more contact with the skin/hair for a better shave.      </li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks I&#x27;m pleased with the 38 HD.  </li>
            <li> I got better at lathering the cream and gained more confidence in my technique.  </li>
            <li> My technique improved and the sharper blades performed much better.  </li>
            <li> I love the feel of this razor.</li>
            <li> The thicker handle gives me a better grip, and the heft is both reassuring and advantageous when shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had fewer nicks and irritation as well, just a better shave experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You know that this is an item that you will be able to use for many years to come.</li>
            <li> I don’t just recommend this razor, I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> I don’t just recommend this razor, I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll understand even better.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> The razors are elegant and affordable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still enjoying and working on that, and it&#x27;s been months.  </li>
            <li> I actually find it to be a WAY better shave than the Proglide, which I had been impressed with and content with</li>
            <li> - any, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve tried that, and if you like that scent but want a better performer, you should try these&amp;#34;?).</li>
            <li> Mach3&#x27;s, however pricey, can flex, &amp; still seem to provide a better shave on all but the most squared off jaws.</li>
            <li> It also gives a better shave.</li>
            <li> I had another razor in my cart and after more research I ended up buying this one</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did...</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Safety razors are more \\&quot;green\\&quot; - no plastic blades to throw out.  </li>
            <li> Event better - get a badger hair brush and shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to get one of the packs with the Feather blades.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving enjoyable...</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I love tradition.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit more moisture and some finesse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many types of cartridge razors, waxing, and Nair cream (Don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Shaving with it is quite safe and a pleasure.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to pay 20 bucks for a razor but ended up paying 55 bucks for the merkel barber pole razor.its</li>
            <li> Double edge yields a marvelous shave.  </li>
            <li> I just like the 2 piece design better).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 4 years and love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor a year ago and have enjoyed it ever since.</li>
            <li> The quality is top notch</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with the quality and performance of this product.</li>
            <li> I had read so many reviews of dangers.  </li>
            <li> I have had good success with feather blades</li>
            <li> So glad I changed.</li>
            <li> Day after day, week after week, I have been shaving with this razor and I am kicking myself for paying a fortune for plastic cartridge razors for so many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> The quality was excellent with an all metal design that feels solid in your hand.</li>
            <li> Secondly, this thing cuts a close shave and feels awesome on your face.</li>
            <li> The blade came with a Merkur blade, which is OK</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> the many \\&quot;how to\\&quot; videos of shaving with a DE bladed razor.</li>
            <li> I never had a better shave.</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> If anything like that happens, I will be sure to update this review and rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is just OK, which makes it overpriced.  </li>
            <li> I love the Merkur razor.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> If you have been looking for a better shaving experience, this might be the way to go.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need 3,4,5 or more blades to shave.</li>
            <li> I love the heft and size of this razor.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work best for me with the sharper blades, but that may depend on your personal preference and beard.</li>
            <li> this razor seems to be better quality and gives better shave,  </li>
            <li> im glad i ordered it.</li>
            <li> So glad I made the change.</li>
            <li> that I just purchased more for Christmas gifts</li>
            <li> Many of my friends, and colleagues recommended that I get one of the market(Mach 3, Norelco etc...)</li>
            <li> I receive comments on my shave from many women...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll prove to be cheaper than my multi-blade setup,  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I am sure that once i get used to the idea of &amp;#34;hair</li>
            <li> ;, i will learn to love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Top quality razor.</li>
            <li> On top of that, Women&#x27;s and Men&#x27;s razors are identical except for color, yet Women&#x27;s razors always cost more.</li>
            <li> What could be better?</li>
            <li> The Weishi had been recommended for novice DE shavers, so it seemed like the safe choice.  </li>
            <li> Decided to convert to a DE safety razor from many years of using cartridge razors on a whim.</li>
            <li> and I figure it&#x27;ll just get better.</li>
            <li> I love it, and the delay in my purchase kept me from enjoying a rewarding shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> shave but wasn’t up until now that I need to get more shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I think most guys want.</li>
            <li> Get yourself a variety pack of razors because each person’s skin is different &amp; you need to know which blade works the best with your skin.</li>
            <li> Make sure those are in your variety pack.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Get yourself a variety pack of razors because each person’s skin is different &amp; you need to know which blade works the best with your skin.</li>
            <li> Make sure those are in your variety pack.)    </li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase because I know it will last me for many years to come</li>
            <li> Truth be told, I might end up wanting something a bit more aggressive as time goes on but for now I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this razor or the rest of my set up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> Gotta love those</li>
            <li> I love that the weight of the razor allows me to shave without using pressure, avoiding nicks.</li>
            <li> A Progress or better yet a Futur.</li>
            <li> What a hunk of steel, I love it.</li>
            <li> Slightly more aggressive than the Jagger db89l</li>
            <li> Much better than the one I used 40 years ago.</li>
            <li> I did 3 passes just to be safe and make sure I got all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Slightly more aggressive cut than my EJ89 and heavier.</li>
            <li> I expect many years of use with this quality product.</li>
            <li> Twist the bottom remove the top and set the razor in and done.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did, otherwise I could have injured myself.  </li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Outstanding razor, wish I would have switched over to this razor from the disposable ones along time ago.</li>
            <li> After 25+ years of shaving with overpriced cartridge razors, I now have the best shave short of going to the barber.  </li>
            <li> Handle&#x27;s knurling turns out to be OK after all, just had to make sure that my pre-shave oil was washed off my hands.</li>
            <li> The barber pole handle looks great and is very functional.  </li>
            <li> Thank you :)</li>
            <li> I like the 38HD much better</li>
            <li> Model 38 HD is an elegant piece of hardware.  </li>
            <li> :  So, I&#x27;ve been shaving with this razor now for about a week, and I still couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> Anyone still need convincing?  </li>
            <li> (32 more years)</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been shaving with this razor now for about a week, and I still couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> Anyone still need convincing?  </li>
            <li> (32 more years)</li>
            <li> I used a Parker razor before this, and this is even better.</li>
            <li> I did some more research and discovered a more aggressive razor which is the Merkur 38 HD.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> One of my better purchases.</li>
            <li> I am glad I picked this model of razor.  </li>
            <li> This particular razor has a good weight, is easy to clean and looks great.  </li>
            <li> Chrome is quality, weight is right, and length is good.</li>
            <li> The design is very nice and the razor is built very durable.  </li>
            <li> I used a smaller model very successfully</li>
            <li> I get a nice clean shave</li>
            <li> Pay special attention to your neck: It is its own labyrinth of errant, erratic hair growth patterns.</li>
            <li> so if your short handed and tire easy it may not be best for you</li>
            <li> The weight is perfect and the two-piece construction is simple and makes for easy cleaning.  </li>
            <li> First off, pair the 38 HD with a good quality blade (Feather or Israeli Personnas)</li>
            <li> The grip is usually pretty good.</li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;m still sticking with the straight-edge when I can at ALL squeeze in the time, but what first struck me about this safety razor is good my face felt afterwards, both just in itself and to the touch.  </li>
            <li> I imagine this will work pretty good for a while now.</li>
            <li> It gave me a good shave for using a DE for the first time, but my hand cramped up each time by the end of my shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There was a learning curve that resulted in plenty of nicks and cuts, at first, but coupled with a good quality shaving soap, all of the razor burn and rashes were history from day 1.  </li>
            <li> What I like better about this razor though is the, longer handle, the handle has a better grip than my smooth chrome EJ89, and what I like the most is the weight of this razor.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this product, and it was the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better razors but for the money this one is fine.  </li>
            <li> Great for guys with large hands for a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> It has fit my hands like a glove, so it&#x27;s easy to avoid &amp;#34;bloodbaths&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> the top blade guard easily comes off to change the blade</li>
            <li> /&gt;No more overpriced multi-blades that clog up easily.</li>
            <li> Next you&#x27;ll want a good shaving soap/cream, a brush, and a good shaving bowl or cup to work up your lather.</li>
            <li> If you want a more aggressive razor this will still fit your requirements just use a more aggressive blade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to clean, and after nine months it&#x27;s still as shiny as the day I got it.  </li>
            <li> This has singly been the best purchase to take me from being a boy to being a Marlboro Man...without smoking or stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, the build quality is excellent and I&#x27;m confident nothing will happen to it for years to come.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re both very good razors, and I&#x27;m currently using nothing else.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident that it will give you a very special and irritation free shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> Excellent construction, fine finish and craftsmanship combined with real heft and retro styling make this razor a real winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My bottom line is enjoy safety razor shaving, however I feel the experience could be with a better designed razor.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been conditioned to accept the cheap and disposable multi-blades that companies market today because it makes them lots of money - not because it&#x27;s a better product for us.</li>
            <li> It seems as if the Derby blades are the best so far, lasting me a good 5-7 days.  </li>
            <li> The Poraso seems to give me the most comfortable and close shave.  </li>
            <li> and I got a smooth results love the weight to it as well</li>
            <li> like I said it&#x27;s got the ideal weight and feel for a strongish guy with big hands like me.</li>
            <li> There are many DE blades available.</li>
            <li> expect?I feel more manly using it as opposed to the cheap plastic</li>
            <li> And I totally love how cheap it is to</li>
            <li> I love the quality and design are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have tried an extensive blade sampler from Barberia Italiana and have found the Personna blades from Israel to be ideal for me.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s more comfortable for me to hold in my hand</li>
            <li> Fits in hand very well, a good weight.</li>
            <li> Good aggressiveness but not too much and</li>
            <li> To be fair, I bought a whole system: This Merkur 38 HD razor</li>
            <li> before i get a straight edge, i felt this would be a good stepping stone to replace my fusion, as for i want to shave like they did in the olden days.</li>
            <li> Definitely a superior shave and the blades are really inexpensive.</li>
            <li> If you want a shave that is smooth, enjoyable, and easy, I would recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> very happy with purchase smooth shave very balanced would easily recommend to anyone looking for a good single blade razor</li>
            <li> Still looking for the right blades but thrilled with the razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy, well balanced, has a good grip, made to last a lifetime and delivers a wonderful shave with a good blade.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable and easy to load blade and clean.</li>
            <li> (I love the scent of the Art of Shaving Sandalwood line, but suspect that there are better options out there - any suggestions from anybody more seasoned?).  </li>
            <li> Full marks!</li>
            <li> Extremely well made and wonderful to hold in your hand.  </li>
            <li> The spiral handle is easy to grip and control.  </li>
            <li> i have a better shave and already saved enough from not using Gilette multiblade cartridges to pay for it also greatly reduces razor bumps</li>
            <li> I then tried the Parker 99R because I was hoping that the butterfly design would work for me so that changing blades would be easy.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to put blade in and out  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews stating that it&#x27;s easy to nick yourself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t scalp my face.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a technique, that in my opinion is quite easily mastered.</li>
            <li> Easy to change blades</li>
            <li> It sliced through the hair easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to grasp, and holds the blades rigidly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> The longer handle on this version is great as I have larger hands and allows for a more balanced grip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made, moderately aggressive, good for a beginner, and has a nice heft to it.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I highly recommend a pre-shave oil and a good after shave care regimen (witch hazel and Nivea</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as well as a really good after shave cream.</li>
            <li> This Merkur is longer, heavy, has a good grip and it is very nicely finished.</li>
            <li> I also use a badger hair brush and Taylor of Old Bond Street Shaving Cream (also incredible, and smells better than any modern shaving cream).  </li>
            <li> Even after a hot shower and a nice lather.</li>
            <li> The razor is beautifully finished, functional and will probably last me the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li> I have some experience with straight razors, so I am familiar with the prep work that is involved for ensuring that your face is good to go.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going through the trouble of making my own lather and buying a brush, I want a good shave!</li>
            <li> The strippers love my smooth, clean shaven face.  </li>
            <li> I am new in DE razors and this is a good starter</li>
            <li> This razor in combination w/ Colonel Conk Soap, a badger brush, and Wilkinson blades gives me a relatively, surprisingly smooth and easy shave.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had pretty good success with it.  </li>
            <li> It gives a pretty awesome shave, should order shop double edge safety razors like bic.</li>
            <li> The texture of the handle makes it easy to grip with a light touch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to feel when the blade is at the correct angle and the shaves have been close and comfortable.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve EVER shaved with a DE razor, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;ll get a clean shave and have money left over to afford to eat lol:)</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Shaves fine.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Merkur blades and they seem to do the job fine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It also did fine on my neck and cheeks as I just lined them up.</li>
            <li> During the work week, the EJ 89 maintains just fine.</li>
            <li> (alcohol is more volatile (evaporates quickly) and sanitizes rather well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really a super razor!</li>
            <li> So, for many years I&#x27;ve had adequate shaves.  </li>
            <li> Multi-blade systems might get this many, if you are lucky, but they cost over a dollar per head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and heavy, cleans easy and shaves great.</li>
            <li> I just have large hands and thought a longer handle would be nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and heavy, very high quality and archaeologist will probably find this razor in almost perfect condition somewhere a thousand years from now.  </li>
            <li> also have huge hands</li>
            <li> and I have huge hands.  </li>
            <li> and I get great shaves, especially if I do a third pass against the grain.  </li>
            <li> shave is so close and smooth; I feel I could go longer than 5 days without shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought this hefty and fantastic safety razor</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, the blade never clogs.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately the razor survived.</li>
            <li> I enjoy and look forward to shaving with this shaving system.</li>
            <li> In two weeks I tried four or five blades from a cheap sample pack I bought.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product for users just starting or that have been using a safety razor for years.</li>
            <li> Comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> CO Bigelow Premium Menthol Shave Cream with Eucalyptus Oil - 5.2 oz]] have made shaving something I enjoy doing as opposed to something I did every so often</li>
            <li> And since the soap is important, how you apply it is equally important.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it - time consuming, but it&#x27;s (as un-heterosexual as this might sound) kinda like pampering yourself.  </li>
            <li> it really didn&#x27;t come shave-ready from Amazon, but I found a guy in the area who did it effectively for $5).  </li>
            <li> This and a Feather blade are a combo that I have no complaints about and fully enjoy.  </li>
            <li> is great for a guy with big hands.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend getting a blade sampler as many people do not have success with the Merkur blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I have never been this smooth.</li>
            <li> GREAT Christmas Present!</li>
            <li> The receiver loves it and wont stop talking about it and how smooth his face is.</li>
            <li> so i think the heavy weight works best for my type of head.</li>
            <li> Overall great product</li>
            <li> blades!&lt;br /&gt;The razor has a comfortable handle.</li>
            <li> razor is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> of all of the &#x27;classics&#x27; I own, the Mercur is absolutely my go to razor.</li>
            <li> Since that was my primary razor, I went shopping for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I bought a cheap razor to learn how to shave with a DE razor.</li>
            <li> * Replacement blades are cheap.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic razor.</li>
            <li> Glass smooth,</li>
            <li> I now enjoy shaving.</li>
            <li> I found it to be a great starting off razor</li>
            <li> Strangely, I actually enjoy and look forward to shaving with the Merkur.    </li>
            <li> Smooth threading.</li>
            <li> My rationale is: Why not spend some extra money on what has been reviewed and recommended by many, many customers as the best thing they&#x27;ve ever shaved with instead of spending a lesser amount of money for a handle and a lot of money for &#x27;cartridges&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li> this shaver and enjoy a smooth face.</li>
            <li> Overall, this has been a great choice for me</li>
            <li> The performance is strictly middle of the road also; it does make a great travel Razor though; you won&#x27;t be that pissed if you lose it.    </li>
            <li> The chrome finish underneath the head is not as smooth as it could have been.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the shave.</li>
            <li> The bright chrome finish and rotating parts are holding up well, although it takes a bit of water and some occasional polishing to keep the top plate free of soap residue and</li>
            <li> He likes the shave, the closeness and smooth skin and not all the bumps.</li>
            <li> I put a light lather of the soap on my face, and began to shave with the 38 HD.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Congratulations, Merkur, on producing a fantastic piece of shaving equipment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I use cartridges, according to my math (which could be mistaken....feel free to check the numbers), I will have to replenish my cartridge razor supply 486.7 times, and at $25.00 a package at today&#x27;s cost, that equates to about $12,166.67 for the cartridges alone.  </li>
            <li> Anyone have any questions, feel free to message me.  </li>

            <li> Would you expect a smooth cut?</li>
            <li> So far, the brush seems good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no looking back for me now as I am absolutely hooked on this combo for the best shave ever.</li>
            <li> The shaving experience is far superior to anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.    </li>
            <li> I hear the Taylor of Old Bond Sandalwood is good soap too.  </li>
            <li> I have found that Shark stainless blades have worked better than Astra platinums, but I&#x27;ve yet to try out much more.</li>
            <li> And the brushing action is good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this razor will last me a lifetime--the construction just seems so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got some nice heft to it and features a nice longer handle for us bigger handed guys.</li>
            <li> This razor is very nice, nice packaging and arrived in a few days.</li>
            <li> still want to find out who in their right mind thought multi blade cartridges were better for shaving than this &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; tech and give them a piece of my mind....</li>
            <li> sure you get the right blades for your face</li>
            <li> The extra weight is very nice.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I was pleasantly-surprised at the weight, as well as the overall construction, - very nicely made.</li>
            <li> After much research I am really happy to have purchased the Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic &amp;</li>
            <li> To get the full effect of this shaving style you must use either shaving soap or shaving cream that you whip up with a pure badger brush, otherwise you might be kind of dissappointed.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for a more enjoyable shaving experience.</li>
            <li> It unscrews to 2 pieces and is super easy to change blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;All-in-all, using a DE over ANY disposable is light-years better, and the money you save in the long run can give you the opportunity to get some good food and a date with those baby-smooth cheeks.</li>
            <li> All-in-all, using a DE over ANY disposable is light-years better, and the money you save in the long run can give you the opportunity to get some good food and a date with those baby-smooth cheeks.</li>
            <li> I ordered a Dovo Best Solingen straight edge razor, a strop, a Parker Badger Hair shaving brush, a nice pretty shave bowl, Art of Shaving Sandalwood soap in the pretty wooden bowl AND their shaving cream, and I waited.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like a good choice because I  have broad hands</li>
            <li> Keeps the blade secure and easy to swap out for a fresh one.</li>
            <li> It has good heft to it, and is easy enough to get the angles with it.</li>
            <li> all in all its WELL worth a try!</li>
            <li> I use the Feather blades but have successfully used the Merkur blade and the Extra.</li>
            <li> This one is also a bit more forgiving on beginners (eliminating some of the more exotic models), and it had a bit of extra heft, which made it preferable to me over the HD.  </li>
            <li> Overall fit and finish was excellent and it gives the closest shave so far.</li>
            <li> It is Eco friendly and you can get DE blades from 2-5 dollars a 10 pack.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman, so I have a lot more real estate to shave than a man (just saying!).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cut/engraving (not sure how to describe it) on the handle is absolutely superb.</li>
            <li> Merkuur is worth the price!</li>
            <li> First, it is a bit heavier than most.</li>
            <li> My first DE was the Merkur 34c because that is the one that so many said to start with.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first safety razor, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but I know I love it.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I was excited to receive this razor</li>
            <li> This was more first safety razor</li>
            <li> first reaction to using this razor is that you don&#x27;t have to be a shaving connoisseur to be able to use the thing.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor and I love it.</li>
            <li> This one seems perfect, even when I was holding it with small hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are many demonstrations on YouTube to help the first time user of a DE razor.</li>
            <li> This was not my first D.E. razor, but it is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Okay so I just had my first shave with the Merkur.</li>
            <li> Good strong frame, holds blades straight and steady.</li>
            <li> pretty sure I want another one.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor and it really is a better way to shave.  </li>
            <li> The 2-piece loading of the blade is convenient and straightforward.</li>
            <li> I could tell from the first pass that this was better.</li>
            <li> And yes I said excited to shave again..........</li>
            <li> The first step for me was to get much more aggressive blades (Feather Pt coated).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice weight, feels good in the hand (not too long or short) and looks nice as well.</li>
            <li> but the new tech dose  not make for a real smooth shave</li>
            <li> I honestly like my new &amp;#</li>
            <li> This is the best by far, for several reasons:</li>
            <li> After a stroke or two, turn the razor over to use the clean side of the blade.</li>
            <li> Spirals weren&#x27;t machined as clean as I thought they would.  </li>
            <li> and my wife will attest to a super smooth face.  </li>
            <li> Double edge safety razors are more effective.</li>
            <li> But, if you don&#x27;t want to go whole hog, the razor is the most important component of the system.</li>
            <li> I may try to do a clean face shave now though.</li>
            <li> When finished with the shave, remove the blade and, using a clean paper towel or cloth, clean the razor blade thoroughly along with the razor.  </li>
            <li> This is ACROSS the grain, not AGAINST the grain, and it makes the single biggest difference in going from a decent to a superbly close shave.</li>
            <li> Incidentally, this razor, with some training and a shot of whiskey to attempt it the first time, will help you have the best shave down south, if you catch my drift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many positive reviews of this product online</li>
            <li> The weight of the razor took some getting used to, but the idea of letting the tool do most of the work, as opposed to pulling on the tool to get the cut is a positive attribute.</li>
            <li> This razor feels solid and steady in my hand and, with the right blade (Dorco ST-300 works best for me),</li>
            <li> have almost completely cleared, and my face feels much better all thru the day!     </li>
            <li> The handle is the right length and changing blades is extremely easy.</li>
            <li> The heft is the first thing I noticed right away, more than doubled of that cheap thing I bought.</li>
            <li> But it most certainly does.</li>
            <li> If I ever have an opportunity to use another DE razor for comparison or if I run into any major problems with the construction of this razor, I will edit the review, but for now I am very pleased with the feel and look of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> suggestions: I wash my face first with warm water and either Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint Pure Castile Peppermint Soap or Pears Soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a shaving brush, mug and shaving soap for years.</li>
            <li> Love this product very high quality.</li>
            <li> Here, in a nutshell, is all you need to know to get a great wet shave with this (or any)</li>
            <li> This Works cool soft skin its amazing and the closest cut I have ever had in my life with no razor burn or bumps.</li>
            <li> gives me a pretty close shave and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to cut your throat off, lol.  </li>
            <li> The stradegy of getting a good shave using a DE razor, unlike a cartridge razor that employs multiple blades in one throw away razor, the DE razor should be used making up to 3 passes during a shave.  </li>
            <li> The top of the head comes off when you unscrew at the very bottom of the handle.  </li>
            <li> full 24 hours passed when I noticed that my face still felt like I just shaved it.</li>
            <li> The weight is good and it feels like a product that will last me for years.</li>
            <li> Such a good shave</li>
            <li> Much better shave, and so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> The blade that initially comes with the razor is a good blade to train with.</li>
            <li> The blade that initially comes with the razor is a good blade to train with.</li>
            <li> this is by far more fun to use and i feel like i get a better shave...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it</li>
            <li> this razor is sweet.</li>
            <li> (use badger, its better than boar) and real shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Also says he only has to shave twice a week because it&#x27;s so good.</li>
            <li> A bit of up front investment gets you a way better shave for a much lower cost.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who wants a better shave,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Made&amp;#34; and it was cool to know the work put into this thing.</li>
            <li> problem is, i also shave my head, so it will take more getting used to this (let alone a straight edge) than if i were just shaving my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did another blade or a vibrating feature really make a better razor?</li>
            <li> I find that one blade lasts me a full week.</li>
            <li> Most of the information I got came from a there &amp; Mantic59 has some really informative videos which will help you in this process.</li>
            <li> Most of the information I got came from a there &amp; Mantic59 has some really informative videos which will help you in this process.</li>
            <li> , I took it and tried it myself and found the same results, lots of nicks, cuts and burn no matter how you used it, and this was with Derby blades which are fairly forgiving.  </li>
            <li> good back up</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m laughing at how much money I&#x27;m saving and what a better shave I get.  </li>
            <li> Good luck with your future in DE shaving.</li>
            <li> Nicks and cuts can be avoided by taking your time, doing a good face prep before shaving, building a proper lather with a quality shave brush and using a good shaving soap or shaving cream, and letting the weight of the razor cut your beard, and if you want a very close shave, make sure you make multiple passes with the razor</li>
            <li> Hot towel your face for 30+ seconds, apply a pre shave oil if you got sensitive skin like me, Work a good lather with your shaving brush, lather up and shave with the grain.</li>
            <li> Also, the handle is exactly the right length of the several popular DE razors I own.</li>
            <li> This thing works exactly the way it&#x27;s supposed to work, cleans up easily, and looks cool (and that&#x27;s not a bad thing at all).  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m good with the whole new old-fashioned style of shaving.</li>
            <li> It was the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years, and when I say years, I mean like 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is really easy to cut if the blade is not the first time use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The weight makes the razor easy to hold, maintain an angle, and keep consistent pressure on your face... even on curves.</li>
            <li> This is my first and was easy to get use to.</li>
            <li> For the first time since I was 18 and Gillette sent me my free Mach 3 razor in the mail I was excited to shave.</li>
            <li> Get on board with all the other DE converts and save money and treat yourself (and face) every day to a great shave.  </li>
            <li> The size and shape of the handle and head make shaving easy (at least in my large hands) and the weight is perfect.  </li>
            <li> A quick wipe with a towel or microfiber cloth after a soak brings everything to shiny, beautiful goodness once again (never wipe your blades, shake to get most of the alcohol off) and reassemble your razor and place everything back on your razor stand until the next shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp but does an exceptional job for you when you shave!</li>
            <li> LOVE the barber pole handle feature - the &amp;#34;screw at the bottom&amp;#34; allows me to unscrew it slightly while I am shaving to lift the top guard a bit if I need to rinse it out better.</li>
            <li> in all, if you&#x27;ve never shaved with a safety razor, you&#x27;re definitely missing out on one of the best shaves of your life (unless you take the time to learn to use a straight razor or find a barber like I did).</li>
            <li> I use the Parker on my head with a Shark Super Chrome blade</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way more fun to shave now and it&#x27;s much smoother afterwards.</li>
            <li> It smells awesome (though I wish the scent lasted longer than a few minutes) and really calmed the razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Of course, one cannot simply expect to get great shaves from this razor straight out of the box.</li>
            <li> The razor&#x27;s own weight is generally enough to do the job, I just let it rest against my skin while lightly pulling it along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It falls into the mild to medium range for aggressiveness.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as a back up to my Edwin Jagger DE89 which I love, and this has now become my favorite razor.</li>
            <li> Luckily Amazon sells them in bulk.</li>
            <li> what I&#x27;ve gathered this type of handle is the most popular for beginners in the wet shaving world.</li>
            <li> Heavy and great fit</li>
            <li> I also have a mild tremor in my hands that made me nervous to switch to a safety razor.</li>
            <li> It seems that the more things change, the more they stay the same.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The grip is still quite adequate and not slippery and there have been no issues loosening/tightening the bottom knob to change blades.</li>
            <li> Yes, after so many years, I went back to the basics of a safety razor &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li> Despite my novice DE shaving status, I have no problem with very close, comfortable shaves with very rare bloodshed.    </li>
            <li> No complaints with the EJ89, but when I want or need something with a little more aggressiveness and weight, the Merkur Barber Pole is the next best step up for me.</li>
            <li> The shave cream smells of sweet almonds, which I really like, but it seems more of a luxury (whereas the skin food, also pricey, seems far more worth it to me).  </li>
            <li> (I shave every other day)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet shaving is the best way to go by far.</li>
            <li> That also provides ample opportunity for a good long test drive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beautiful and heavy.</li>
            <li> I hope that this razor lasts a long time and that I continue to have a good experience with it.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I went back to the classic razor, refills are cheaper and I think a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful gift!</li>
            <li> Although everyone is different, for the most part I think the choice between the longer and shorter versions of the Merkur line should be mainly based on which suits your own particular shaving needs better.  </li>
            <li> F N times better than the new tech.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it will probably out live me.  </li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor and I am loving it so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many DE (double-edge) razors, knowing full well that DE shaves are far closer than the multi-blade Gillettes.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very sturdy, easy to use and provides a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I have really appreciated the strong build quality and weight of this razor.</li>
            <li> While I am fairly new to safety and straight razor shaving, I do also own the Merkur 180 (aka the 23c), the Merkur Futur, the Edwin Jagger DE89L and a Thiers Issard</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is only a very minor drawback to an otherwise excellent razor - however if I had known about this before buying I might have gone with a razor with a bi-directional knurling pattern.</li>
            <li> The Parker doesn&#x27;t get quite as close on looser areas of skin and around the neck, but it does fine shaving my head since the skin there is very taught.</li>
            <li> I began trying different blades and quickly found that the sharper ones were more comfortable for me (Astra and Feather).  </li>
            <li> Just a note to fellow beginners - a lot of the experienced users of DE razors comment on how the handle of this particular razor is quite long.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty steady growth of hair and my hair is thicker than most.</li>
            <li> but I enjoy shaving now so much that I don&#x27;t mind doing it</li>
            <li> I also tried proraso shaving cream which I enjoy but not as much as the soaps.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the razor but very seldom rate anything a highest level or lowest level.  </li>
            <li> Great for those with heavy beards.</li>
            <li> Has a good weight to it (not too light or too heavy).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Merkur product is solid and amazing quality.  </li>
            <li> weight of this razor is quite a bit more than the old Mach 3</li>
            <li> Spend some time on Badger and Blade forums and get a semi nice brush to go with it and shaving won&#x27;t seem like such a chore anymore with this razor.</li>
            <li> It was worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Safety razor shaving is worth it but not a \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; shaving experience like alot of others on here state.  </li>
            <li> Wash face with warm water (or just take a shower), then squeeze a quarter-sized dollop of shaving cream onto the warm, wet brush; start whipping up a lather directly on your face.</li>
            <li> In the most tightened position, the blade is held very stable without much wiggle room.</li>
            <li> I also wanted to note that I didn&#x27;t buy any of the shave soaps or brushes - I&#x27;ve been using regular shaving cream and shaving after I shower, which is probably the most important part since that makes the hairs easier to cut.  </li>
            <li> I also still haven&#x27;t run out of my &amp;#34;canned goo&amp;#34;, so what I do for now until I receive a few more things in the mail to try is apply some Aveeno Therapeutic Shave Gel (which I&#x27;d long ago determined to be the best performer of the &amp;#34;canned goo&amp;#34;) before getting into the shower.  </li>
            <li> Out of my collection this razor is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> It is so worth it.</li>
            <li> And once you get it, the blades don&#x27;t cost 12 bucks for 4 of them and only really give 3 or 4 good shaves.</li>
            <li> Shaving is now fun</li>
            <li> like I just had a refreshing professional barber shave when I walk out.      </li>
            <li> I rarely cut myself now.  </li>
            <li> The chrome is classy and the design is stylish.  </li>
            <li> Those are my favorite (so far, it could take a year to try everything).</li>
            <li> I just gave myself is as good or even better than a professional straight razor shave that I recently paid $35 for at a boutique barber shop.</li>
            <li> I am learning the skill of a double edge razor with this merkur and have to say I am loving it.</li>
            <li> I had to make multiple passes, and didn&#x27;t find the razor effective.</li>
            <li> Functions well, as good of or perhaps the best shave as I&#x27;ve ever had even with those 4, 5, or 6 blade or whatever Fusion razors that have replacement blades costing over $5 each and lasting only a few shaves.</li>
            <li> It will add about 10 minutes to your shaving routine but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I actually tried running it across my own face hairless though it may be</li>
            <li> I rarely cut myself.</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Also, check out geofatboy(free advertising) on Youtube for great shaving videos to help young guys like me to learn how to properly shave like our grandfathers used to.</li>
            <li> While there was a learning curve for its use, driving on through that learning curve has proven to be worth it.  </li>
            <li> This is the only DE razor I own.  </li>
            <li> I used cheap Barbasol aerosol cream, but will probably move on to the mug and brush gig later on, as it&#x27;s supposed to be the better way to a cleaner shave.</li>
            <li> and I Bought this for my wife to shave her legs with as I thought the extra weight and length would be handy for that purpose.</li>
            <li> With a fresh Feather loaded in there it gave me a BBS shave in 3 passes and no irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should note that to change blades, the top separates completely from the razor, so you need to take some care.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> In this case, the ole stereotype about superior German engineering really comes to mind.  </li>
            <li> a straight razor shave one time in the military in Japan, and it was also a great experience.  </li>
            <li> Nice middle of the road razor.  </li>
            <li> The razor itself is beautiful, very heavy.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean between passes whereas my other razors required more soaking and cleansing between passes.</li>
            <li> They are first time users of the double edged razor and they love it!  </li>
            <li> I successfully completed my first DE razor shave with absolutely no bleeding!  </li>
            <li> I read a ton of reviews on the 38 HD and other DE razors and settled on the this one based on excellent reviews, longer handle length, and the fact that it is basically almost the same product as the Merkur 34 HD.  </li>
            <li> Now I am able to quickly give myself a better shave than previously without any cuts or burn.</li>
            <li> My hands are large and shaped more like mittens than gloves, so the long handle is appealing.  </li>
            <li> But the overall opinion I&#x27;ve gathered is that Merkur is a really good brand, that many people prefer it over other brands, and that this particular model is one of the ones most recommended for newbies.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good bit more aggressive than my old Gillette Tech and took a little getting used to, but once I mastered it, my shaves are quick and close.    </li>
            <li> Works as advertised and as good as my other Merkur...</li>
            <li> double edge razors stop reading and just buy this (along with a high quality badger brush, good soap/cream, and a blade sampler pack).</li>
            <li> I have larger hands and the long handle gives very good control.  </li>
            <li> Yep, that&#x27;s right:</li>
            <li> This one is just so right.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box...</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> if I never tried I&#x27;d never know right??</li>
            <li> It just sliced the hair right off.</li>
            <li> And the Merkur 38 HD seems to have just the right design to reach everywhere on my face except right under the nostrils.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty amazing to me considering I didn&#x27;t do anything different.</li>
            <li> I was cautious of course, but really no issues, it was a breeze compared to a straight edge, and here&#x27;s the kicker: the results were surprisingly more comfortable than the Proglide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preparation is a big part of getting a good shave, and I&#x27;m still exploring pre-shave</li>
            <li> but it was enjoyable, almost as if I was back in the day, cheasy, yes, but true.  </li>
            <li> Without trying to sound like a conspiracy theorist, I realized I was being manipulated by clever marketing.</li>
            <li> Its a high quality razor which feels just right for a guy with huge hands.  </li>
            <li> This razor is a two piece unit which I really like and you unscrew the bottom of the handle to remove the top and put in a new blade.</li>
            <li> I chopped my neck up pretty good the first time and trimming around my goatee is kind of tricky, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised for a first round.</li>
            <li> I read previous reviews on different models and the best blades to use.  </li>
            <li> I clean it about once a month with an old toothbrush &amp; isopropyl alcohol to keep it shiny as well as clean.</li>
            <li> Your beard hairs will cut easier and more effectively if you shave them using multiple passes (from different directions), so take your time and don&#x27;t hurry.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the higher price up front</li>
            <li> I would not have purchased it, but in person it looks very stylish and does not slip when wet.  </li>
            <li> So far the best blades for me in this razor have been Personna Blue (made in USA) and Crystal (a.k.a. Personna Red, made in Israel).</li>
            <li> The long handle makes it feel more familiar, like</li>
            <li> This is a great razor and it is very heavy duty.</li>
            <li> You will enjoy waking up and shaving, heck, you may set your alarm clock a 10 minutes earlier to enjoy shaving with this.  </li>
            <li> Beyond the satisfaction of shaving with a sturdy piece of metal that feels like it will last for hundreds of years, the shave is far superior when compared to cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This might be the best investment I have made in the last few years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also just more fun to shave with, especially if you throw in a shave brush</li>
            <li> Works great, feels old-timey, and you&#x27;ll save so much $$$ not having to buy replaceable razors every few weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a heavy hence the &amp;#34;Heavy Duty&amp;#34; razor not the cheap kind.</li>
            <li> Merkur and its logo are engraved nicely at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor came in a box with a single Merkur razor blade.</li>
            <li> Another great tip (thank you [...]) is to keep the head submerged in mineral oil (which can be found at target or other stores I would guess) which will keep the water out of it and make the blades last significantly longer and prevent any possibility of rusting.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected and more !</li>
            <li> I like this shaver very much.  </li>
            <li> Replacement razor blades are very, very inexpensive</li>
            <li> It was a very straight forward operation.</li>
            <li> I am a tech-centric kind of guy, always trying the latest and greatest stuff, but in the case of razors I found every new model worse than the last - dulling quicker, clogging easier, and more and more expensive.</li>
            <li> It has great balance with an extra long handle and just the right amount of weight.....which is not too heavy.....but balanced well in my opinion......</li>
            <li> other, and probably the most important, aspect of DE&#x27;s are the blades.</li>
            <li> Shaving the right sideburn was not as much of an issue with my right hand.  </li>
            <li> the long handle is nice in my large hands.</li>
            <li> I currently use the Merkur progressive adjustable (on the lowest setting) and get a decent and reasonably comfortable shave and almost never see a nick or a cut, I&#x27;ve also used a bargain basement cheap safety razor and actually got a the best shave ever out of it, very comfortable and smooth especially with Derby blades, unfortunately that one broke (as I said cheap)</li>
            <li> Not luxurious like Trumper&#x27;s cream but a fraction of the cost and very effective (provides more slickness to give less drag than the cream).  </li>
            <li> This will keep it looking new as well as keep it clean and remove the excess water in between the blade and head</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an old pro with these kinds of razors, but I had owned one DE razor before and the difference in quality was huge.</li>
            <li> Really, this investment is worth it, it costs me about 40 cents a week to shave now, soap and blades, compare that to buying fancy Gillette blades.  </li>
            <li> HD Barber Pole DE Razor was the first DE Razor I used.  </li>
            <li> You make your lather, apply w/a brushand make your first pass WTG (with the grain), then rinse and re-lather.  </li>
            <li> That way you will be prepared for your first shave having taken the time to read how it is done    </li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> Like I said in my title I have been using this razor for three months, and I should note this is my first time with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I love this Razor did a lot of research as well prior to purchase blogs videos</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m as well glad that I went for this Razor vs 34c HD,  because I have big hands</li>
            <li> I dove right in, buying the HD along with the Perfecto 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush, Perfecto chrome stand, Geo F. Trumper Almond Shaving Cream Jar, and Geo F. Trumper Limes Skin Food.  </li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;re confident, especially around the nose and neck, don&#x27;t hesitate to try the sharper options.  </li>
            <li> this is my first,</li>
            <li> (My personal favorite are the Feather Platinum blades.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (My personal favorite are the Feather Platinum blades.)  </li>
            <li> Replaced the razor, but still took repeated passes if you weren&#x27;t daring enough to apply more pressure.</li>
            <li> This will last me for the rest of my life for sure...</li>
            <li> when i first got it i had to learn how to use it without leaving my face with a ton of nicks in it.</li>
            <li> but I actually have more control with this one.</li>
            <li> I felt it would be appropriate to write a review before actually using the razor</li>
            <li> Changing the blade is simple, all one has to do is unscrew the bottom and pull off the top and slip a blade in.</li>
            <li> Second, it has a longer handle than most.</li>
            <li> Since the knurling on the handle all runs in the same direction it acts more like threads on a screw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I consider myself a pretty environmentally aware person</li>
            <li> I knew their had to be a better way than to shave than what American society pushes at us...</li>
            <li> we first got it</li>
            <li> It was my first safety razor</li>
            <li> This is the first safety razor I have used in years.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I look forward to shaving every day.</li>
            <li> He loves it; I love it, and it&#x27;s a solid as it was the day it was purchased.  </li>
            <li> I am a first time DE shaver</li>
            <li> I decided to remove the top cap from my 34c and put it on this razor and instantly a world of difference it was shaving just as well as</li>
            <li> For top performance I used tag teamed it with the Japanese feather</li>
            <li> I would not recommend trying this razor for the first time the day of a job interview or if you are going to be on</li>
            <li> TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten much better after several shaves (and watching some YouTube videos).  </li>
            <li> read a ton of reviews on Amazon (thanks, Amazon customers!)</li>
            <li> I had no idea how many different types there were.</li>
            <li> the razor looked like a very well crafted piece of equipment!</li>
            <li> I allways intended to get a better razor, but I never saw anything in the drug store that was all that different from the Atra cartridge that I was useing.</li>
            <li> razor is also similar to the EJ in that it seems to be a forgiving razor, maybe more so without sacrificing closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li> It should also come with more than one blade, especially at that price.  </li>
            <li> With that said, I had a couple of weeks of consistent nicks and cuts on my neck region.</li>
            <li> Shaving really is something I look forward to now!</li>
            <li> Even when showed the exact angle to have it at, it still didn&#x27;t even feel like it was doing anything.</li>
            <li> I recently converted from a Schick Quadrillion (because more blades is better--right?)</li>
            <li> I use Wilkinson&#x27;s Sword blades which I am able to find in local drug stores or (ugh)</li>
            <li> Much better performance than the Wilkinson&#x27;s swords, but can&#x27;t be found locally.</li>
            <li> purchased their competitors razor first</li>
            <li> I was ready to opt out of the system!    </li>
            <li> The system is so sophisticated that unused foam is automatically recycled to be used for the next shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The system is so sophisticated that unused foam is automatically recycled to be used for the next shave.      </li>
            <li> and I find they last at most 5 shaves.</li>
            <li> Having decided to get into wet/DE shaving, I researched many different razors.  </li>
            <li> The first time was the experiment.</li>
            <li> I also have a Merkur short handle 34C which tends to cut a bit more aggressively and sometimes I bleed.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling smooth &amp; soft which</li>
            <li> (My technique to remember was each time I used a razor to take the wrapper the razor came in &amp; tape it to a piece of paper then wrote bad, good, best next to it</li>
            <li> (My technique to remember was each time I used a razor to take the wrapper the razor came in &amp; tape it to a piece of paper then wrote bad, good, best next to it</li>
            <li> First off the pictures on do it justice.  </li>
            <li> This is my first ever DE razor, so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything, but the look and feel of</li>
            <li> The 38c was the first DE razor I purchased.</li>
            <li> Would recommend as a first safety razor.</li>
            <li> I targeted the merkur line because of there consistent reviews for quality.</li>
            <li> The razor is well made and is pretty hefty.  </li>
            <li> First time using a de razor..</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor.</li>
            <li> This being my first safety razor</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and I must say I&#x27;m now a convert.  </li>
            <li> this is my first DE razor, and most likely all I will ever need.  </li>
            <li> This was my first DESR in about 30 years.  </li>
            <li> If this is your first safety razor I recommend you buy a blade sampler and try a selection of vendors.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> But overall, I think it&#x27;s a top notch razor.    </li>
            <li> I had bought the Merkur HD 34C as my first DE razor.</li>
            <li> I will only replenish my blade supply about 16.7 more times, at acurrent cost of around $16.00.  </li>
            <li> This is my first razor after using disposable razor heads.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and decided on buying the Merkur 23C first.  </li>
            <li> I bought the 38 HD and the first time I used it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a heavy bearded guy, but I like a smooth finish when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months, and I can say that it may not be a glitz and glamor model, but it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and the quality is as promised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, heavy, reliable, with good grippage.</li>
            <li> Still this one is more precise due to close up and weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave reinvented!</li>
            <li> So one day I was looking to buy some new cartridges for my Gillette Proglide (I had given up on the electric shavers years ago), and I looked at the price and thought, &amp;#34;That&#x27;s pretty much a full tank of gas!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I never thought that this old style shave would be better than the new style blade</li>
            <li> However, the heft and the slightly longer handle of this razor gives me a closer shave and is more comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> I may try a different blade manufacturer in hopes of a more positive shave.</li>
            <li> So, I come back to the 38, which I&#x27;m slowly coming to love more and more.</li>
            <li> Try this razor if you want to tell Gillette and Shick to shove their obscene profits where the lights don&#x27;t shine and get back into affordable comfortable shaving that will be sort of fun.</li>
            <li> Obviously, not all &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; technology is better technology, because this has really done the trick.  </li>
            <li> It may sound corny, but it makes shaving fun, and I wish I had switched from blade cartridges much, much earlier.</li>
            <li> I love that I can boil this stainless razor to keep it from getting gross.</li>
            <li> It is a nice simply designed and solidly built piece of equipment; the problem is that for a few dollars more you can get a much better Razor.</li>
            <li> Not only is it so much cheaper, but the closeness of the shave is not anything I&#x27;ve ever been able to get in an electric, disposable or cartridge razor.  </li>
            <li> The chrome plating is very good, and one other thing I need to mention, especially if you are a new DE Razor user....</li>
            <li> Honestly I think in general this should be the standard size in length for most even without big hands.</li>
            <li> it does take a little more time because i use the badger brush and lather up shaving cream but its well worth it!</li>
            <li> The Merkur brand has a good reputation, and because of the name I expected something a little better.  </li>
            <li> This is a positive case of &amp;</li>
            <li> [i.e. screwing the long handle clockwise tightens the blade assembly at the top of the razor.</li>
            <li> My first razor of this type and it shaves really well.  </li>
            <li> My first impression of this razor is that it&#x27;s very well made with the finest materials.</li>
            <li> with this one minor criticism, I am perfectly satisfied with this razor.</li>
            <li> Having sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve always had trouble shaving--in fact, I can only shave twice a week even with the best tinctures, lotions and shave soaps.</li>
            <li> The simple and old school design and operation makes it easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> The overall appearance is appealing and classic.</li>
            <li> Use a nice sharp blade, and you&#x27;re in business!</li>
            <li> I assume that the razor works exactly within spec and it will give a very close shave, but it can easily shave too close and draw blood if patience and proper technique are not part of the shaving session.</li>
            <li> This razor is highly recommended by many longtime double edge users.  </li>
            <li> The head is very heavy, which was fine -- but the shorter handle changed my elbow-shoulder-neck angles as I shaved my neck, changing my neck muscle tension, which lead to more nicks along the changed neck muscles.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this razor if you have medium to large man/woman hands and want to save money over the life of this razor, since blades are so cheap and at such a higher quality, not to mention the quality of your shave is infinitely better once you have learned the proper shave</li>
            <li> This razor is really easy to user and after watching some instructional videos I had no problem picking up basic wetshaving technique.    </li>
            <li> The body of the razor is very solid and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> It was physically lighter than the 34c, and the shave was no quite as easy as the shave I got with the 34c, and it is a 3-piece razor.  </li>
            <li> I used to dread shaving but with some Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream, my super badger brush and this razor; It is a relaxing pleasure.</li>
            <li> Never have my shaves been so close or so smooth, and after using this product for a week, the razor bumps I normally get on my neck are completely gone.</li>
            <li> It is a nice, heavy razor - my first DE safety razor.</li>
            <li> All in all a better shave than a cartridge razor and much cheaper in the long run</li>
            <li> Google for \\&quot;DE blade sampler packs choice\\&quot; to find a sampler pack with a large variety of blades.</li>
            <li> Pure Badger Shaving Brush]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> im 6&#x27;4&amp;#34; with rather large hands.</li>
            <li> This razor will certainly outlive me.  </li>
            <li> have large hands, and I like the length of this razor.</li>
            <li> I like my Merkur razor, but be advised that it takes a certain level of skill to use one.</li>
            <li> Since I have large hands, I opted for this model against the 34c.</li>
            <li> problem is that if you&#x27;re an experienced shaver this guy tends to be on the moderate side even with a very sharp (Feather) blade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty solid piece that looks really nice with the chrome on the outside.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay with starting out new and pampering myself a bit.</li>
            <li> most state of the art technology, there is a slight learning curve when using this powerful device.  </li>
            <li> eventually decided to get this Barber Pole Merkur HD as I thought the extra 3/4 inch long handle would be perfect for moving my hand back a little more while shaving</li>
            <li> That brought me to a whole new world where I&#x27;ve learned that shaving can actually be an enjoyable pleasure that I actually look forward to and find not just the look but both the feel AND FEELING of the results</li>
            <li> This new shaving device uses amazing \\&quot;mono blade\\&quot; technology that delivers a shave as close as the finest multi-blade cartridge system,  but the blades are completely bio-degradable and have a tiny \\&quot;carbon footprint.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> The DE (double edge) razor design has been around for 100+ years and with proper technique will give you a perfect shave in one pass, providing less irritation than the 3,4, 5 or by the time you read this 8 bladed cartridges.</li>
            <li> So I am pretty excited to see what it&#x27;s like when I actually shave the way you are suppose to with this thing.</li>
            <li> But, I didn&#x27;t cut myself, which was my main goal for the first try.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> I have large hands and this fits me very well.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I went with the slightly longer model, I feel I have the right amount of control.</li>
            <li> According to the commercials and the ads, the first blade of the multi-blade razors lifted the hair, the second blade cut it cleanly.</li>
            <li> Second shave was fine, much easier.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy, solid and has a good grip to it!</li>
            <li> Well made heavy razor with a nice handle for my large hands.</li>
            <li> It comes apart very easily into two pieces by twisting the knob at the bottom and you just put the blade in and tighten it down.</li>
            <li> The blades are very inexpensive relative to disposables, so do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t go on the cheap for blades.</li>
            <li> The blades are very inexpensive relative to disposables, so do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t go on the cheap for blades.</li>
            <li> fit and finish is fantastic, living up to its heavy duty name.</li>
            <li> A huge plus to a double sided safety razor is the cost of blades.</li>
            <li> I like the heft and feel of this razor a whole lot.  </li>
            <li> After doing much research.....and reading a lot of reviews.....I settled on the Merkur 38C.</li>
            <li> The added weight and longer handle really make a difference in shaving.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a very subjective thing I understand</li>
            <li> but I enjoy them so much that I don&#x27;t really mind and actually look forward to shaving now.  </li>
            <li> This Razor glides really well</li>
            <li> Then again, I&#x27;ll be saving so much on blades</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the Trumper&#x27;s skin food stuff</li>
            <li> i really like how close of a shave</li>
            <li> so im about to try a whole head shave excluding eyebrows of course.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Merkur 38HD to complement my use of a straight razor, and all I can say is \\&quot;Wow\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care what the package looked like</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> I would get such fantastic shaves.</li>
            <li> This is a really quality handle</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t much to say about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very well constructed, two piece razor.</li>
            <li> This razor works really well.  </li>
            <li> Well, I found out that a friend of mine got into straight edge shaving, and he said that when he&#x27;s in a hurry he uses a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> He thanks me whenever he shaves.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> That meant that if I placed too much pressure on the blade when shaving, I might twist the assembly to the side and loosen the blade.</li>
            <li> I does meet my expectations very well.</li>
            <li> it gives me a much nicer shave than today&#x27;s cartridge razors.  </li>
            <li> There are probably hundreds of double edge (DE) safety razors available, from antiques on eBay to present-day newly-manufactured razors.</li>
            <li> If you prefer a real \\&quot;vintage\\</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unlike anything you&#x27;ll ever get from a modern multi-bladed shaving razor from</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re someone that is coming straight from cartridge</li>
            <li> High reccomend it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t really cut myself at all.  </li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t need to drag it like most razors.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product and almost want to keep it a secret to all the women out there just so that the price doesn&#x27;t decide to jump on the replaceable razors.  </li>
            <li> Pick it up with some Shark Double Edge Razor Blades and free yourself from di$po$able razor hell...</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t for a fast shave, this is a Razor for a shaving experience.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made, quality razor.  </li>
            <li> In addition to all this safety razor blades are much cheaper than cartridges.  </li>
            <li> razor is stainless steel.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the top cap on the razor extends too far covering too much of the blade which prevents you from getting a proper shave</li>
            <li> a modern razor feels.</li>
            <li> The Barber Pole is well made and very functional.  </li>
            <li> My husband is very please with the razor.</li>
            <li> I conducted several shaves and at best I was left with an uneven shave.  </li>
            <li> razors with 3-5 blades because it fit their description of how to properly shave.  </li>
            <li> and I really got into it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I REALLY got a kick out of was what was printed on the wrapper of the Merkur razor blade that came with the razor:</li>
            <li> So much so I ended up buying a stand for it to hang from on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> She did not care for it because it was a very aggressive shaver</li>
            <li> A real work of art.</li>
            <li> With that thing I&#x27;d be feeling growth just 6 hours later, but with this I&#x27;m still smooth shaven when I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I think this weighs as much as 2 Merkur 180s together.</li>
            <li> I felt it was a much close shave than I have very had.</li>
            <li> I was very relieved.  </li>
            <li> I really like the feel of this razor in my hand, there is something to hold on to.</li>
            <li> to use and very well constructed.</li>
            <li> It took my about 30 days before I really started to really get it</li>
            <li> There really is a difference in sharpness, ease of use and durability among them.  </li>
            <li> I have saved so much money with this razor that I can now afford to go to Strip Clubs four times a month instead of twice a month.  </li>
            <li> straight.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Gentle finger tightening works quite well in securing the blade.</li>
            <li> If one is ready to develop the needed skills or already has those skills, Go for it.</li>
            <li> It was that much of a difference.</li>
            <li> It gives me a wonderfully smooth shave and it definitely is a money saver when it comes to razor blades.</li>
            <li> especially like the secure blade assembly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and heavy; built like a tank.  </li>
            <li> I use Poraso shave cream/soap with a good badger brush having tried the Col. Conks shave soap and a few others so far.  </li>
            <li> Nice shave in only two passes using Persona blue box blades.</li>
            <li> I went through a few of them until I found what I liked in style, weight, and ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> This is my second safety razor and by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> This Barber Pole also has that similar solid feel and weight that I got and liked from the shorter Merkur razor.</li>
            <li> I have large hands and the long handle makes it easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for something that is functional, well made (well enough to last several lifetimes, probably) and good looking then you have come to the right place.    </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to guess where it&#x27;s going on your face; and with a very sharp DE blade that&#x27;s pretty important!  </li>
            <li> Just wow!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job: I get through daily shaving pretty quickly (3-5mins tops)</li>
            <li> New to DE shaving and was nervous before my first shave.</li>
            <li> I made sure not to use much pressure, almost none at all, and was very very careful.  </li>
            <li> My Father-In Law gave me a classic razor years prior, which I keep in my gym bag, and I really enjoy the close shave they give.  </li>
            <li> The weight pretty much guarantees a smooth, effortless shave on the face (myself) with minimal passes and effort</li>
            <li> The replacement of blades is simple and straightforward.</li>
            <li> That being said, since I wasn&#x27;t able to hold other models, it is all I</li>
            <li> No amount of care in using the razors, or applying &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; creams, gels, or lotions, nor any amount of blade changes to make sure every edge was sharp helped.  </li>
            <li> It was the familiar &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34; type of razor with two doors that open to expose where the blade sits.</li>
            <li> The question here is do you want a \\&quot;barber pole\\&quot; \\&quot;old style\\&quot; razor or a new smooth \\&quot;futuristic\\&quot; looking old style safety razor?  </li>
            <li> It gives a very Close, Classic shave.</li>
            <li> If you are considering a classic razor I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> A very well thought out design for something so classic.</li>
            <li> K Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer]] that was given to me from my grandfather as a \\&quot;becoming a man\\&quot; gift.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice hefty feel to it, the handle is long so you wont feel like you have run out of room with it in your hand, yet you can choke up on it and not use the entire length of the handle.  </li>
            <li> The somewhat rare combination of long handle and extra weight along with the barber pole handle etching make this one stand out from most of the classic Merkur models.  </li>
            <li> While the razor handle is labeled as long, it is still rather short in my opinion, but I have large hands (usually wear size XL gloves) and the size is perfect.  </li>
            <li> Realizing that, (for this kind of money), I needed a little more info, I visited several sites, including &amp;#34;Badger &amp; Blade&amp;#34;, and read several reviews for each of the models I was looking at.</li>
            <li> I got tired of paying the 4700% profit to Gillette and Shick for multiple blade razors that are nothing more than gimmics and don&#x27;t do the job nearly as well as a good safety razor.  </li>
            <li> on to this razor in particular, I like the longer handle (although it really is not that long, shorter than a Mach 3 for example) and as with other Merkur razors the build quality is excellent.  </li>
            <li> If it doesn’t fit on your cute little stand… your stand’s too short.</li>
            <li> Get a good lather, which will be denser and less bulky than if you&#x27;d used commercial spraycan foams.&lt;br /&gt;3) SHAVE.</li>
            <li> Your small efforts will be rewarded with the knowledge that you are not only more \\&quot;green\\&quot; but you also have the latest new tech toy on the block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a fairly thick beard and it gives me an incredibly close shave without a single nick.</li>
            <li> Merkur makes nice razors but they are not known (at least in a positive sense) for their blades.    </li>
            <li> The long handle was important to me.</li>
            <li> The feel in the hand is at that sweet spot for my larger hands:</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Apparently, many other safety razors are considerably shorter that the 38HD, so for a convert like me, going from a cartridge razor to the 38D was pretty normal in terms of handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So, I was searching on Youtube one day and stumbled upon geofatboy&#x27;s videos that showed me how to shave properly and showcased many different versions of safety, and straight razors.  </li>
            <li> I must say that so far it is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> so I could see the full left sideburn edge.</li>
            <li> (if you do most of your skin will go down the drain, with your stubble - which is true of any double edge).  </li>
            <li> I originally thought I needed the long handle as most safety razors tend to be smaller, but I can say for certain it&#x27;s not necessary.</li>
            <li> A little more aggressive than I thought, but very close.  </li>
            <li> I read a lot online about options, and quite honestly, I remembered my dad&#x27;s old razor from when I was a little kid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy duty, has a nice weight and handle length.  </li>
            <li> The main reason I bought this razor was I was mad at Gillette always making a new razor that is the best, and the animal testing that they do.</li>
            <li> you get a new blade, and with real care, you will not hurt youself.</li>
            <li> I get a better shave with less irritation, and to me</li>
            <li> The knurling on the handle makes it easy to control with wet hands.</li>
            <li> Classic styling, solid construction and proper function are the three things that make this an outstanding choice.  </li>
            <li> A well built, solid razor that will last for many years.  </li>
            <li> The additional weight of the Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic requires time to develop skill.  </li>
            <li> Just like many of the reviewers on this board, I did my research on multiple websites and paid close attention to their directions for using this double edge razor.</li>
            <li> B003BRETQU 25 SHARK SUPER CHROME DOUBLE EDGE SAFETY RAZOR BLADES]],</li>
            <li> Give it a try and get rid of your plastic disposables, sometimes simple tools do the same job better.</li>
            <li> Why did I pick this particular razor?  </li>
            <li> Over the years, I have tried several DE razor brands but have come to realize that I love this DE razor above all the others.</li>
            <li> it definitely gets a super close shave.</li>
            <li> I was tired of the cheap disposable junk razors that sliced up my handsome face and end up in a landfill.</li>
            <li> Decent shave,</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using this same razor now for several years, spending pennies on replacement blades, no longer dealing with skin irritations, and getting a better shave.  </li>
            <li> but he must have bought his particular stand in Lilliput because this razor&#x27;s handle is about 2 1/2&amp;#34;-3&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Okay, a few weeks later after much more practice, this thing definitely shaves much closer than my mach 3.</li>
            <li> If you want weight and length just get a Futur, if you want the older style get a Progress or and HD.    </li>
            <li> And I can purchase hundreds of good DE blades for the same price as just a few disposable blades.  </li>
            <li> I bought the 38HD Classic, Personna Blades (100 in a pack), Tweezerman&#x27;s Badger Hair Brush, Williams shaving soap, a soap bowl, and a brush stand.  </li>
            <li> I will only replenish my blade supply about 16.7 more times, at a current cost of around $16.00.  </li>
            <li> The savings just grow as you get older.  </li>
            <li> I bought the 38HD Classic, Personna Blades (100 in a pack), Tweezerman&#x27;s Badger Hair Brush, Williams shaving soap, a soap bowl, and a brush stand.  </li>
            <li> The savings just grow as you get older.  </li>
            <li> While I am still learning, my experience so far has been a positive one.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this particular razor.  </li>
            <li> You can unscrew the handle as described above and you can also further pull the long axis of the handle to expose more parts and get a deeper clean.     </li>
            <li> When I used it the first time I really cut myself upI may just need more practice however the single blade is far different than the three blade schick I&#x27;ve been using for 30 years now.</li>
            <li> well worth the money.its stainless steel with a chrome finish and feels very solid and durable.it doesn&#x27;t pivot like the multi-blade razors wich takes some getting used to, but makes shaving seem like a little bit more of an art.it</li>
            <li> This was my first DE razor, and I had significant trouble getting used to zero pressure and steady angle for the jawline, but my face and neck feel and look much better due to the sharper shave.</li>
            <li> I took to it pretty quickly so there is not much of a learning curve.</li>
            <li> I definately recommend this product to anyone looking for a high quality safety razor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using/trying both the Derby and the Feather razor blade with this razor.  </li>
            <li> The weight is heavy enough to convince you of the craftsmanship in your hand, but light enough to let you deftly shave.      </li>
            <li> highly enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the product and the store.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was highly sceptical that the weight of the razor alone would be sufficent...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to make the switch from a cartridge razor to a DE razor I highly recommend trying this out</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I also highly recommend Feather blades.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product or any Merkur DE razor.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended Merkur razors for their durability and high build quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Nearly</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T put in your pick-up bin), I&#x27;m saving time shopping for the refills, and still getting a high quality product.</li>
            <li> always make high quality products.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> business and reeks high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only fault I can give this razor is that when it&#x27;s wet, the grip isn&#x27;t all that great to hold on to; but it&#x27;s a small complaint for an otherwise great razor.</li>
            <li> I often find myself gripping near the top of the razor to get the right angle, and I find the weight of the razor to be awkward when you grab it by the handle.</li>
            <li> : when you&#x27;re done shaving, unscrew it a little and rinse it, that will make sure to get all the stubble out of the head.</li>
            <li> I figured out that old school shaving is 10! 10!</li>
            <li> The handle is long-enough for my big hands and the design is classic and useful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few non-hightech gadgets I own, where &#x27;modern&#x27; has actually innovated some legitimate improvements over &#x27;classic&#x27;.</li>
            <li> First off, let me say this, compared to a few other DE razors I&#x27;ve purchased, vintage DE razors, this brand new DE razor made in Solingen Germany is very well made (I also own and use a DOVO straight razor made in Solingen).  </li>
            <li> This gives a comfortable shave without the nicks and burn that I always seem to get no matter how careful I am with my cartridge razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a secure grip even when wet or slippery.  </li>
            <li> This is more of a spot for wet shaving in general.</li>
            <li> I like this razor a lot, only thing i would say is a &amp;#34;checkered&amp;#34; grip as opposed to a barber pole style would give a better hand grip when wet, tends to feel like it wants to spin,lol</li>
            <li> I like the weight of the razor and now see how this can be an important factor when wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have much reference on which way to go as far as razors.  </li>
            <li> While I was skeptical after the first shave or two, I&#x27;m already convinced that it was a good move.  </li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, taking my time and doing multiple passes with the Mach3</li>
            <li> I followed the Internet&#x27;s collective advice: keeping the skin taught, using multiple light, short strokes, first with the grain, then re-lather, then against the grain, rinsing it frequently, and always trying to keep the blade at a 30 degree angle from my skin.</li>
            <li> People who are complaining need to watch more than a few video&#x27;s</li>
            <li> razor and &amp;#34;Personna Double Edge Razor Blades&amp;#34; give you a shave better than any disposable and the savings between this razor &amp; blades and disposable razors is gargantuan.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> A well made product and well worth the money considering the low price of replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Here are a few I found the most helpful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Here are a few I found the most helpful.      </li>
            <li> Well, I have to say, it does take much longer for inexperienced shavers to shave, however I enjoyed the entire process.  </li>
            <li> Not only do the blades only cost about $0.50 so they can be replaced more often, but I&#x27;ve found I get as many, if not more, shaves from this.</li>
            <li> I am new to safety razors and have always used the high dollar disposable type razors, including the Gillette lineup.</li>
            <li> Secure it down with a twist of the bottom and your ready to go.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the other Merkur classic razors; they are too light and come apart in three pieces to change the blade.  </li>
            <li> However, the significant weight of this razor helps me keep my hand steady while shaving (and the added closeness of a thorough wet shave means that I don&#x27;t look like an unkempt basement-dweller at the end of the three days I have to wait between shaves).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rinse your razor in hot, hot water; shake it dry and then dip it in 90% rubbing alcohol to displace the water and to disinfect and sterilize the blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades are a lot less exspencive, some of the old ways are better.</li>
            <li> I own the Merkur HD Classic 38C, along with six or eight vintage Gillettes, and have also expanded into straight-razor shaving as well (with some restored &#x27;seriously&#x27; antique razors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out</li>
            <li> A single blade will last 4 or 5 shaves (more, with some care).</li>
            <li> XTG shaving you would shave left to right or right to left.  </li>
            <li> The angle on the blade is just right for a close shave and even when I cut myself starting out</li>
            <li> I expect to try out the soaps sooner or later, but don&#x27;t feel like you need to make that leap right away.    </li>
            <li> just the right size if you have big hands like I do.</li>
            <li> Whether this is right for you is a matter of personal choice.</li>
            <li> I have bigger hands but matched with the right blade</li>
            <li> We both have very large hands and struggle with the pencil-thin handles on regular razors.</li>
            <li> The blades are extremely sharp and a light touch when shaving is mandatory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want an extremely close and comfortable shave, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Now at age 23, I am guilty to say that I have been using these same clippers to shave and trim up after I cut my hair(I&#x27;m very good at it).  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a new DE razor.  </li>
            <li> I am new to this after paying a ton of money for razor bumps and burn whoooo Wheeee</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get about 4-5 shaves before you need new ones.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get about 4-5 shaves before you need new ones.</li>
            <li> just so I could use the new razor when it came in</li>
            <li> This assumes you buy this razor at the age of 20 and live until 80 and invest the $10/month in the stock market at a 9% interest rate.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this almost a year ago I was new to the art of shaving like a man.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re new to DE shaving, i also recommend getting one of those &amp;#34;DE sample blade packs&amp;#34; so see which blades you like the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this razor after struggling for months to find refills for my 3-blade razor with no interest in buying a new 4-blade or vibrating razor.</li>
            <li> Safety razors are new to me, even though I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> TO REMEMBER IF YOU ARE NEW TO THIS STYLE OF SHAVE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> TO REMEMBER IF YOU ARE NEW TO THIS STYLE OF SHAVE:    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Being new to DE shaving</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the DE shaving</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 38, and if I live to be 70</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 38, and if I live to be 70</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the DE shaving world</li>
            <li> Like many others, I finally decided to take the plunge and try wet shaving using a DE safety razor.  </li>
            <li> The razor is nice to hold and it&#x27;s heavy enough to do the work for you, no pressure needed.</li>
            <li> The weight of the razor lends itself to the ease of the shave, since the razor is heavy enough to basically cut through the hair on its own.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First few shavings like I remember with my old razor many years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The major drawback of this razor as compared to modern razors is the lack of a pivoting head.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin so getting nicks and cuts has always been an issue for me when shaving.</li>
            <li> What I somehow had missed in my research is that this slanted head is generally not recommended for beginners for whom a straight head style is apparently less challenging.  </li>
            <li> That usually gets most of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I digress... not for sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> It is so satisfying to complete a close shave and know it costs pennies while not captive to a corporate price controlled industry.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is my second \\&quot;safety\\</li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality of this product is obvious at first glance.</li>
            <li> Having watched the various videos online, I had an idea of how to shave with one of these and on my first shave</li>
            <li> I rinse it in hot water and swish it briefly in some 91% rubbing alcohol after every shave and,</li>
            <li> This was my first double edge razor.</li>
            <li> Not only was the first shave easier</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The first time I picked this razor up, I could tell it was well-made meant to last.</li>
            <li> This is the first DE razor I&#x27;ve ever used... and I&#x27;m thinking will be the last razor I&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
            <li> First de razor I have purchased...never going going back.</li>
            <li> construction is solid and it is really pretty.</li>
            <li> This futuristic, yet elegant, device is made of durable metal instead of the usual plastic</li>
            <li> (Makes the antique Gillette look like a rickety, old wagon)!</li>
            <li> I wish this was my first DE razor purchase, it would have been my last.</li>
            <li> One for the first pass and another for the second pass).</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the polished finish and solid feel.</li>
            <li> B0077LAJT2 Personna Double Edge Razor Blades]] , which are also extremely cost-effective and outstanding razor blades.  </li>
            <li> B0077LAJT2 Personna Double Edge Razor Blades]] , which are also extremely cost-effective and outstanding razor blades.  </li>
            <li> There is a learning curve you must overcome at first, but once mastered there&#x27;s no turning back.</li>
            <li> Now, I typically slap a new razor blade in my Merkur every 3-4 days and enjoy a literally razor-sharp blade for just cents each.  </li>
            <li> With every blade change I simply take some baby wipes or tissue paper and rub it clean - very low maintenance.  </li>
            <li> The razors are sharp and so inexpensive compared to the cartridges that it&#x27;s worth spending a little time learning to get a safe, close shave with the Merkur.</li>
            <li> By a stroke of pure genius the replacement blades will cost about a tenth that of a classic cartridge and will actually provide two complete edges, in essence giving you two blades for the price of one.  </li>
            <li> This highly concentrated pellet can provide at least as many shaves as a can of shaving foam and doesn&#x27;t use propellants or a steel aerosol can.  </li>
            <li> Using Gillett and many other brands finally now at 28 years old</li>
            <li> To my pleasure, I shaved with it for the first time and, WOW, it shaves as good if not better than the 2 and 5 bladed razors out there and for half the extended price!</li>
            <li> The first shave didn&#x27;t go too bad, yet it wasn&#x27;t great either.  </li>
            <li> I get a much closer shave, my razor bumps had disappeared, and in the long run shaving will be MUCH cheaper.</li>
            <li> The few you might find in your local drug store may not be suitable.</li>
            <li> The refill blades that I buy are cheap and last a long time as well.</li>
            <li> As my first wet razor, I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.</li>
            <li> With the modern razors, I normally had to shave again the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Evidently, I have sensitive skin, especially on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got beefy hands (think burly and stocky, not long and lanky) and</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t blown away after the first shave; I had been using a Quattro and Jack Black&#x27;s Beard Lube and at first it seemed like there was no difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I have no complaints - this razor is built much more solidly than my previous safety razor.</li>
            <li> And once he got used to the razor (especially the weight), he was getting a closer, better shave than anything he had tried previously.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of buying razor blade cartridges for $2 a piece to keep my blades sharp for a nice clean shave not a rip your hair out as you go encounter.</li>
            <li> This means, as you&#x27;ll see in the post farther down, I am still YEARS away from using up the box of 100 blades I originally purchased.  </li>
            <li> again, that does not imply the Derby blade is not sharp, it is sharp, but the Feather is very sharp and you will feel the sharpness after your shave due to more of the top layer of skin cells will be removed when using the Feather razor blade    </li>
            <li> By keeping the razor blade dry and stored outside the bathroom away from steam and moisture, the blade should last quite a bit longer, and so be even more cost-effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By keeping the razor blade dry and stored outside the bathroom away from steam and moisture, the blade should last quite a bit longer, and so be even more cost-effective.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the 38c hd as I am a man with large hands and like the weight of a solid razor, not plastic.  </li>
            <li> Buy this razor with confidence as it is a fine shaving tool and one that will last you your entire life with proper use and care</li>
            <li> (I got the super sharp ones - feather, I think?</li>
            <li> It is super sharp</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;barber pole\\&quot; only breaks down into two which makes it easy to load new razors.</li>
            <li> The twisted finish adds a comfortable rigidity and it feels secure in your finger tips.</li>
            <li> sensitive skin aftershave balm (it&#x27;s cheap!)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if you would prefer a vintage 50s Ferrari to a modern supercar model then you and I are on the same page.    </li>
            <li> Check out mantic59 on youtube for an intro into this old fashioned technique.</li>
            <li> I just shaved with Catie&#x27;s Bubbles Soft Soap</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m complete now.</li>
            <li> It has taken me a few weeks to switch from a light weight disposable twin blade razor.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that I unfortunately cannot seem to find many razor stands to fit it.</li>
            <li> One thing I use to do is apply pressure with my plastic disposables, well you really don&#x27;t want to do that with this razor, you need to let it glide over your face and the weight of the razor should be enough.</li>
            <li> (speaking of, one box of refills nearly pays for this tool).</li>
            <li> The first couple of times you use this, you may get a nick or whatnot, so do it on a weekend and use the lawnmower hitting you with a rock as an excuse for your nicks.</li>
            <li> try a lot of different soaps, creams, and aftershaves looking for my \\&quot;absolute favorite\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few of the tools that are available after you lather up.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m still waiting on soap to arrive) because so much of the actual shave&#x27;s effectiveness has to do with the correct blade choice, preparation, and technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Classy look.  </li>
            <li> So I started thinking about the old barbers and how they shave men&#x27;s faces so close.</li>
            <li> After doing some research I found out that the multiple blade razors can actually cause more issues because you are essentially shaving each spot multiple times.  </li>
            <li> With all of the cash that had already been thrown at cartridges and razor changes, the price tag on this didn&#x27;t sting TOO much when considering that if it worked and held up that blade changes would only be pennies thereafter.  </li>
            <li> I did 3 passes and removed next to no hair on my face being very dissatisfied</li>
            <li> have a reasonable heavy beard, and it took the old Gillettes and the straight razors to really teach me just how _</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 50 years old... and have been shaving since I was 15.</li>
            <li> This is a greart razor for men with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Persona Blue blades work really well for me with the Merkur.</li>
            <li> and so far I have found no need to purchase another.</li>
            <li> I have spend a solid 2 weeks researching safety razors, as well as straight edge razors and shavettes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i decided to go with this one for 3 vital reason, the weight, the longer handle, and reviews said it was &amp;#34;more forgiving&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Price is fairly reasonable as well, especially knowing that I no longer have to pay $2.50 per fusion</li>
            <li> The German razor appears well made and well finished, so the price seems quite reasonable.  </li>
            <li> but then again I could only use one cartridge razor (Gillette Fusion) on my face per shave which became very costly in itself.</li>
            <li> After a lot of research I took the dive into the old fashion safety razer.</li>
            <li> 100 blades is considerably cheaper than a 5 pack of anything else.</li>
            <li> This razor is very well made, with solid construction and weight.  </li>
            <li> At 16 years old, Mom gave me a can of barbasol and a track II.  </li>
            <li> This old school razor puts overpriced cartridge razors and electric shavers to shame.</li>
            <li> I was immediately amazed at how smooth the save was, even though my beard was about 4 days heavy.  </li>
            <li> I am, however, looking at trying out a Dovo Straight Razor next.  </li>
            <li> I will also review that when I have developed an opinion about the experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think anyone that uses this razor in a reasonable fashion will be instantly hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased my complete setup for around $122 including shipping.  </li>
            <li> I think anyone that uses this razor in a reasonable fashion will be instantly hooked.  </li>
            <li> I purchased my complete setup for around $122 including shipping.  </li>
            <li> using it is a skill that has to be developed.</li>
            <li> I think the best part about it is that the head screws on via the base of the handle.</li>
            <li> If you re-insert the top of the razor to the rest of the razor and do not tighten correctly, the top of the razor can allow the razor blade to move up and down, which is not good as your skin can possibly get caught between the blade and the guard</li>
            <li> modern shaving tools are nothing more than a scam - they make shaving slightly easier at the expense of extremely high costs and lots of waste.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this particular razor over other DE safety razors, as it&#x27;s the first I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I see no change in shaving aggressiveness from its original little brother, Merkur 38C HD.</li>
            <li> Merkur also makes several other styles that may or may not be available on Amazon (you&#x27;ll have to Google them).    </li>
            <li> The sound you hear as the ultra sharp blade glides across your face is addictive.  </li>
            <li> There is a small learning curve but after 1 or 2 shaves it is easy.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic \\&quot;Barber Pole\\&quot; Long Safety Razor a year ago March 9, 2011, and the Feather Hi-Stainless Double edged razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> went the eBay route and figured that I should buy an older razor from that era because it was probably built better... or at least, built to last.</li>
            <li> , it is all true, but the basic design wasn&#x27;t developed in 2008, it was developed over 100 years ago and it is likely that your grandpa and possibly your dad used it.  </li>
            <li> Well, it is all true, but the basic design wasn&#x27;t developed in 2008, it was developed over 100 years ago and it is likely that your grandpa and possibly your dad used it.  </li>
            <li> Recently started experimenting with some new blades, and thought I would splurge on a new razor to go with them.</li>
            <li> so far no nicks or cuts (a little razor burn at first, but as I moved to sharper blades that hasn&#x27;t been too much of an issue).  </li>
            <li> how about instead we brush on a little sandalwood shave cream, use this fine razor, and a few smooth moves later we can be soft as a baby&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> When reassembling the razor, be sure the reassemble the long handle by pressing the little c-clip in with your fingers to make it glide into the body of the handle.    </li>
            <li> Occasionally I&#x27;ll get a loose badger bristle stuck under the guard and this allows me to quickly flush it out and keep shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have an older Merkur \\&quot;short handle\\&quot; razor that I&#x27;ve used for years</li>
            <li> (it was fine, not &#x27;mashed up&#x27; or damaged) when it arrived, and this purchase was placed in the final days of my Prime membership - so it was in my hand in less than 48 hrs.</li>
            <li> It was shortly thereafter that I decided to enter an older world of shaving.  </li>
            <li> Back to the Merkur Hd Classic Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> - gadgetry: various adjustables or clever mechanisms    </li>
            <li> After looking at different models, I settled on the 38 HD Classic Barber Pole because of its simplicity:</li>
            <li> The looks are classic and it&#x27;s a simple machine.</li>
            <li> Simply switching to a shaving soap and using a DE razor has saved me over $200 in the first year alone, including the cost of purchasing this handle which will probably last me the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was also very interested in trying a razor that did not have the typical butterfly opening</li>
            <li> Decided to go back to the old way of shaving because the results are comparable to the new devices and over time will save money on shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Razor Scientists have developed a radical new razor called the DE or \\&quot;Double Edge\\&quot; Razor.  </li>
            <li> If you like the idea of a little extra heft but want a more traditional handle length, try the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only downside is that I would like to see slightly more aggressiveness with the handle&#x27;s knurling because it&#x27;s been a little slippery, especially noticeable when I&#x27;m cleaning it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the other two items to complete my whole new shaving experience.</li>
            <li> After a couple of shaves, you&#x27;ll have the technique down to a proper shave each and every time, with no cuts (yes, I&#x27;ve actually cut myself, once when I first got it), and you&#x27;ll save money for the long run (a year or more of blades will set you back around $14 or so, and whatever the cost of your soap/creame and pre/after shave products).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was worried about this when I got the stand because of the long handle, but it fits very well.</li>
            <li> talking about small degrees of difference, so enjoy whatever choice</li>
            <li> I really like the weight in the handle and even thought the description says long handle</li>
            <li> you believe that if you spend a few more bucks you can get a \\&quot;Futur,\\&quot; got news, same company and same style of shaving!  </li>
            <li> Normally, when I go out in public</li>
            <li> After using the razor just a few times, I was able to master the technique to hold the razor properly to get it to shave properly.  </li>
            <li> I am right- handed and the shorter handle made it more difficult to get my hand back far enough to assure I was creating a straight edge for my entire sideburn.  </li>
            <li> The Personnas can be found on Amazon&#x27;s and are very sharp but also a little more forgiving for a new DE shaver like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do have to not that the razor I received was new and sealed, however there were some imperfections in the groves on the handle (simply cosmetic).  </li>
            <li> The blades are easily exchanged and once the mechanism is tightened down it does not come loose like some others I have used.  </li>
            <li> Proper shaving has become a lost art and today&#x27;s average joe hasn&#x27;t a clue about the fine art of the traditional shave that our grandfathers took part in.</li>
            <li> They will dry too fast and then the razor will not glide over your face without taking some skin as a trophy.</li>
            <li> whenever I clean my bathroom (less often than my wife would like), I use the same bathroom</li>
            <li> Lately, I have been maintaining a beard, and this is easy to use around the edges to groom the lines of my beard.</li>
            <li> finished shaving with cold water, followed by good old fashion Witch</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently 25 years old, and started shaving with a Mach3 (too young for my dad to have started on one of these,</li>
            <li> So... if moderate razors (like the standard Merkur DE&#x27;s or the Feather Stainless) haven&#x27;t worked well for you I recommend opting for the adjustable Merkur Futur instead.</li>
            <li> I chose this safety razor because I have big hands, so I really have difficulties with those tiny things we use to find.</li>
            <li> I am not about to go back to the multi-blade plastic disposables yet, but that could quite possibly be because of how much money I have invested in purchasing this yesterday&#x27;s technology razor and refill blades, Shaving Brush, Shaving Soap, Mug and a separate mirror.</li>
            <li> The Parker was the least expensive, but was very light, and the Feather was more money than I wanted to spend on shaving for the rest of my natural life, so I opted for the Merkur as a &amp;#34;middle ground&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these, the first replaced a more expensive handle, the second was a gift.</li>
            <li> It looks pretty sharp too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently begun moving from the marketing driven shaving devices I&#x27;ve used for the past 20+ years (Fusion, etc) to a more traditional shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Now, I haven&#x27;t seen a wide enough variety of vaginas to know what the average hair growth is, but from what I have seen, mine is a bit courser than most.</li>
            <li> MAJOR irritation).  </li>
            <li> (As I originally said, we&#x27;re talking small degrees of difference &amp; preference.  </li>
            <li> but after trying the Merkur \\&quot;barber pole\\&quot; DE razor for the first time with the Merkur blade that came with the safety razor I will never return to the Mach 3 or any other cartridge razor again.</li>
            <li> the routines that I now use, and my Merkur 38 HD \\&quot;Barber Pole\\&quot; DE razor... is the major part of my morning shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Long handle, heavy duty safety razor will last for many years.</li>
            <li> , I might as well buy a whole new printer for these prices!&amp;#34;  I felt used, put down the cartridges, and went home to pout and brood over this.  </li>
            <li> #34;Barber Pole&amp;#34; long handle classic razor.  </li>
            <li> B000RJUZMW Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic \\&quot;Barber Pole\\&quot; Long Safety Razor]].  </li>
            <li> B000RJUZMW Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic &amp;#34;Barber Pole&amp;#34; Long Safety Razor]]</li>
            <li> Interestingly, while my old razor&#x27;s handle is diamond knurled  (a cross-hatch design carved up and down the pole, rather rough on my hands), this razor is only diagonal knurled (carvings in the handle run only one direction diagonally).</li>
            <li> First, note that the &amp;#34;Barber Pole&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Long&amp;#34; description only applies relative to other DE razors: compared to a cartridge razor, the 38HD&#x27;s length is totally normal.</li>
            <li> We have also noted there was much less irritation and ingrown hairs after getting a grip with proper use of a safety razor (no shaving against the grain!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note for the ladies that may plan on using one of these: if you plan on shaving your legs with this razor, be sure to use a thick, stiff bristle brush to work up your lather and to stand up the hairs for a better shave.</li>
            <li> When connoisseurs of fine products speak of items where form intersects function with aesthetic appeal, the Merkur 38c HD is an example of what they mean.</li>
            <li> get a super close shave every time, something that I only got the first few uses of the other blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to write yet another glowing review for this razor&#x27;s positive attributes as they have all been throughly covered by other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I generally use DE razors in one position anyway.</li>
            <li> It is heavier than the #180, and probably on the heavier side of DE razors in general.</li>
            <li> If you want to experience a proper shave, hit up youtube and watch a few shave demonstrations, then come back and get this bad boy and get ready to knock your woman dead with that handsome baby smooth face (for you men) or completely erase your man&#x27;s mind with ridiculously smooth legs (for you women).</li>
            <li> In short, it took me a long time to make just two passes, and I didn&#x27;t get a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> Takes a while to get used to, but the item is clearly well made and seems like it will last forever.</li>
            <li> part of what attracted me to DE shaving, besides saving a bunch of money on blades, was the idea of using an old world style instrument in my daily routine and</li>
            <li> From an economic standpoint, I&#x27;ve already saved the price of this razor in what I would have spent on disposable cartridges, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have no regrets.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely a step up from my old razor in both aesthetics and engineering.</li>
            <li> A variety sampler pack of DE razors Proraso preshave cream in the White line for sensitive skin (smells a bit manly)</li>
            <li> only thing I can add to what&#x27;s been said is this:  the weight of the 38 surprised me.  </li>
            <li> , it looks classy and traditional.</li>
            <li> is, by far, a well-made razor... built to last...</li>
            <li> my entire adult shaving life...</li>
            <li> So, definitely take your time and becareful / ready for a couple of small cuts in the first weeks of usage.</li>
            <li> Old timers like my grandfather used this type of razor and men before him for hundreds of years for a reason; it get&#x27;s simple, reliable and get&#x27;s the job done.</li>
            <li> I was very reluctant to want to buy this handle &amp; start wet shaving but kept wondering if I&#x27;d ever get rid of my razor burn.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve yet to shave my head with thing, which I may attempt in the near future.</li>
            <li> It’s crafted to last forever &amp; has that old style look to it.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re ready to take the plunge into DE wet saving</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t be going back to my old Fusion.</li>
            <li> I also am very fond of the barber pole texture on the handle which helps me hold the razor when it is wet.  </li>
            <li> The one time expense to buy this beauty will be saved in no time from the difference in cost of the old blades especially if you shave every day!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want something with a little less &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; and better exfoliating properties.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was not hard to do or uncomfortable in any way.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen people review this type of razor and say it takes more time to shave this way.</li>
            <li> Functionally, the long handle is closer to my old Sensor razor than the standard HD allowing me to hold it in a similar fashion and reduce the amount of awkwardness I have to work through as I learn this new (old) method of shaving.  </li>
            <li> For those new to DE razors I offer this suggestion, experiment with different razor blade brands, since everyone&#x27;s face is different.</li>
            <li> There is not a single complaint in the 1-3 stars that I feel is justified.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little time to adjust the style of shaving and amount of pressure you need to apply to cut the hair when switching from modern razors to the old fashioned way.</li>
            <li> The Merkur gets a closer shave with less irritation as long as I&#x27;m careful and make sure my technique is solid.</li>
            <li> Seriously I get baby butt smooth</li>
            <li> I am a new  single blade shaver and this blade is forgiving.  </li>
            <li> Little nicks may come for the first week or two if you are not used to this</li>
            <li> A weeks worth of stubble, or a month&#x27;s - this a single swipe will take it down to bare skin, two inches at a time - just rinse (opening the blade chamber a bit can help) and repeat.</li>
            <li> Very nicely weighted and build quality (don&#x27;t fall for less expensive Chinese</li>
            <li> The only other razor I&#x27;ve used had a blade assembly that opened by twisting the whole assembly itself.</li>
            <li> I vacillated for far too long before I bought this razor.</li>
            <li> The grin I witnessed from someone who ordinarily hates hates HATES shaving and was using an electric and a Gillette Fusion Power with the fortune in replacement blades was worth everything and the finish?</li>
            <li> I got a few nicks the first couple of times</li>
            <li> Aside from a few nicks on the first shave I don&#x27;t get any razor burn and no ingrown hair.  </li>
            <li> With all of those, I have suffered with consistent irritation and trouble with shaving bumps.  </li>
            <li> I will never return to the muti-bladed disposable cartridges again... and my new Merkur 38 HD \\&quot;Barber Pole\\&quot; long handled razor, is one of the reasons I&#x27;m now a new wet shaver convert!</li>
            <li> The only thing that wasn&#x27;t perfect for my particular set of conditions was it was a little difficult to see clearly past my hand when shaving the edge of my long left side burn.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Merkur razor to cut down on the expense of modern razor cartridges.  </li>
            <li> Due to my particular beard growth patterns, I must shave my neck with a blade every day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to \\&quot;wet shaving\\&quot; and have been using cartridge disposable razors</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still new to wet shaving and shaving with a safety razor, so I still have to find my technique.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a razor everyone who enjoys wet shaving or people who are new to it like me, should have.</li>
            <li> but after I adjusted the razor angle, quit pressing down so hard and started taking my time, I did not experience any more nicks</li>
            <li> Other than that, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Using the double-sided safety razor blades work really well for me, much less rash than with a disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> It is possible that my initial enthusiasm with wet shaving might factor into my appraisal of this particular razor.  </li>
            <li> I finally took the plunge into traditional wet shaving with this Merkur 38HD Classic \\&quot;Barber</li>
            <li> I just go after it twice, once straight down from chin to collarbone in short strokes; and once diagonally from lobe to Adam&#x27;s apple.</li>
            <li> I was going to order the old style single blade razor that the bald guy from pawn stars was promoting.</li>
            <li> Definitley worth the expenditure either way, saves money in the long run, less garbage, and in fact recyclable!  </li>
            <li> It shed several hairs the first few shaves, but now only one or two per use.  </li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re careful and move slowly it&#x27;s not usually a problem.  </li>
            <li> The cost definitely is a bit pricier up front, but you&#x27;ll come out cheaper after a few months of switching from your cartridges (which can be $20 or more each month!), and have much less waste in the end</li>
            <li> I shaved the same way I always do and it was done very quickly ( maybe a little faster without having to deal with a razor clogging every few swipes).</li>
            <li> (the other two were a Futur and an HD, the HD feeling too small in my hand and the the Futur feeling too smooth,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the curve the doors formed on top was higher and made it difficult for me find the right angle for the blade to make contact with my face shape.  </li>
            <li> The knob on the end of the handle used to open up the razor for inserting the blade is polished smooth and a little slippery so sometimes takes a little finagling to open up.    </li>
            <li> Ifyou want to go even further back and save even more money, you can get a straight razor and strop, but those are a little too scary for me.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving and this will be your first DE Razor purchase, while you&#x27;re waiting for the razor to arrive, take your timeand read about wet shaving at some of the various wet shaving web sites (use a search engine looking for &#x27;wet shaving&#x27;).  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, when I first used this razor I was new to DE shaving, and I took my time shaving and did (always) a good face prep and was rewarded with a close shave w/o any nicking or cutting of my skin, but if I tried to hurry with this razor and got careless, it would nick here and there.  </li>
            <li> but in the mean time I&#x27;m really aggravating my sensitive skin with this thing...  especially on my neck</li>
            <li> and then the usual assortment of Store Brands, Gillette&#x27;s, Bic&#x27;s and the like for years, graduating from the good old Twin Blade to three, four and five blades and in bad economic times, the cheapie single blade throw-aways.</li>
            <li> The blade is clamped to a comfortable curvature, which helps the blades stiffness and keeps the edge steady against the hair during the cutting process.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34yrs old atm and shave every other day.</li>
            <li> Foam is created by simply whisking a wet puck with a soft and long life \\&quot;shaving brush\\&quot; which is then used to apply/massage the foam on the users face.  </li>
            <li> Buy this razor and a few other preparatory items (mentioned right here).</li>
            <li> &quot; razor and my only regret is that I waited so long to move to double edge safety razors from cartridges.  </li>
            <li> The razor does all of the work, so don&#x27;t apply any pressure and take short strokes instead of the long ones that you were using with current old-style cartridge system razor.  </li>
            <li> Do your due-diligence and research wet shaving -- there are a few tricks to the trade you need to know first.</li>
            <li> Went slow at first just to refresh my memory on the angle but after that it&#x27;s like riding a bike, it all comes back to you.</li>
            <li> As for the 34, for my large mitten shaped hands, it just felt too small in my hand.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have the experience to compare this to other safety razors, but while I can say that I&#x27;d like to eventually upgrade from my Dovo straight edge, I can also say that I am completely content with this safety razor and at least presently see no need to think ahead to trying any different ones.  </li>
            <li> It spirals downward and it has a sort of sharp cut to it (not sharp enough to cut you, but just for it to stay attached to your finger) that makes holding it a pleasure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> bottom line: in a few short passes I feel like a new man.</li>
            <li> bottom line: in a few short passes I feel like a new man.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to the Gillettes, I&#x27;d suggest starting with this razor since it will be less of a change for you, in addition to the extra heft making it less likely that you&#x27;ll apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li> The smooth chrome of the blade cover doesn&#x27;t irritate or drag the skin as long as the skin is soaped and wet, but will catch a little as the skin dries out, which is expected with polished metal.  </li>
            <li> My wife complained that the silvertip badger brush was too soft for her to be of any use outside of the majestic feel of the soft bristles.</li>
            <li> I am going to see how long the jarlasts, and then I am likely to experiment with an Arko stick.  </li>
            <li> My shave is now on par with anything I&#x27;ve ever done, and the long term investment pays for itself in a remarkably short time.    </li>
            <li> I hope anyone who reads my ridiculously long review here and decides to get this finds the same enjoyment out of it as I do</li>
            <li> In the long run when I finally learn how to do it</li>
            <li> Apparently not.</li>
            <li> definitely don&#x27;t worry about it being too long.</li>
            <li> The long handle gives you enough room to hold on without applying pressure.</li>
            <li> I am STILL using the same box of razors, though the shave soap ran out long ago.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve done this once&#x3D;:-(, and got a good cut for being negligent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a well built, timeless man-tool that I imagine lasting past my lifetime with decent care.</li>
            <li> It get very slippery when wet, and the grooves provide little grip.</li>
            <li> While it is early, I am guessing that little bottle will last me six months.  </li>
            <li> My very first shave took about 5 minutes less than it usually does with a cartridge razor.</li>
            <li> The 38 HD made the transition easier because of its design and weight, and it appears to be of a quality to last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> They are both well-made and should last me a very, very long time.</li>
            <li> I still dry the blade and razor after each use (maybe 2-3 shaves per week), and the blades are very consistently lasting between 5 and 7 shaves, depending on the thickness of the hair growth.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t cut yourself and end up having toilet paper glued to you for a while.</li>
            <li> The slightly longer handle does actually allow me to move my hand back just enough to see the left sideburn edge</li>
            <li> Granted when I changed to this I also upgraded to wet shaving and ditched the chemical formulated shaving creams at the same time, so that may be helping to make the blades last longer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> heavy, a long handle that is at the proper diameter for my hand size, and the solid construction definitely puts it up there with more expensive razors.</li>
            <li> Single blades require a slightly different shaving style and you can watch some informational uTube vids for info.  </li>
            <li> I have never shaved with a single razor prior to this, but I have had no razor burns or cuts.</li>
            <li> When my wife used it for her legs, she noticed (like me) that the shave was much closer than the previous cartridges we had been using for so long, with a lot less touch-ups and multiple passes.</li>
            <li> Problem is, at least at this relatively early stage of less than a year&#x27;s experience with it, I can&#x27;t really rush the process.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t mind that it is a little heavier than my old DE razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful razor and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> and I have come to like shaving now, where before it was more of an inconvenient chore.  </li>
            <li> This long handle razor is very heavy, giving  it an extremely high quality feel to match</li>
            <li> One negative point (but not negative enough to knock off that fifth star):</li>
            <li> This razor is about 3 3/4 inches long (about 89 mm) and is fairly heavy at almost a quarter pound (about 113 grams) and is completely chromed all over.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have started shaving with a DE a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time on forums before I took the plunge into the double edge shaving world.  </li>
            <li> The handle isn&#x27;t that long.</li>
            <li> anymore from letting it grow too long.    </li>
            <li> With this razor, to change the blade, you unscrew the long handle and</li>
            <li> Described as a Long Handle razor, but it wasn&#x27;t in comparison to my Merkur 180c or Parker 22r razors.....</li>
            <li> It’s the one HD and Long Handle combo by Merkur.</li>
            <li> I like the heft of the HD and the long handle</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited this long to buy this type of shaver.</li>
            <li> G Merkur Long Handled</li>
            <li> I have since purchased 2 Mekur long handled safety razors for travel bags</li>
            <li> G Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor - #180]].    </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;barber pole&amp;#34; handle has a tendency to twist in your hand when wet and especially if you get some shaving cream/soap on your fingers.</li>
            <li> So I still need to wait a long time between shaves (if I shave over ingrowns....</li>
            <li> disposables.it&#x27;ll be usable long after I&#x27;ve taken the dirt nap.</li>
            <li> I was worried it would be too long</li>
            <li> I like the long handle, and I like the weight of the razor.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who perpetually suffered from shaving with electric, cartridge, and disposal razors.  </li>
            <li> I am in the military and need to shave daily.</li>
            <li> (Back then, people didn&#x27;t freak out if you let your kid play with an empty safety razor in the bath tub to act like he was shaving!).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I chose the Merkur Model 38 HD \\&quot;Barber Pole\\&quot; long handled razor.  </li>
            <li> After several weeks wet shaving... I&#x27;ve noticed that my bumps and acne...</li>
            <li> I purchased the Axis package, Merkur 38 HD long handle Barber Pole razor, along with the Itailion shaving cream and the razor blades from Japan.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not too long at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who on here was down-voting it because it was too long for his stand</li>
            <li> I remembered my mother&#x27;s double-edged razor and realized it was not so long ago that no woman thought if she didn&#x27;t \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I like the longer handle because it&#x27;s roughly the same size as the handle of the razors</li>
            <li> I got this one and the long handle one.</li>
            <li> long ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pole\\&quot; Long Handle double-edged safety razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for a long time (20 years).</li>
            <li> not as long as you&#x27;d think.  </li>
            <li> But this is minor and does not detract from the product at all.</li>
            <li> The long handle makes it easier to use for head shaving.  </li>
            <li> Despite this minor flaw, shaving with the 38c HD makes me feel like I am going to meet Winston Churchill for a War Cabinet meeting.  </li>
            <li> I spent about 140 bucks a little over a year ago getting what I needed for this new style</li>
            <li> Slip the razor blade back into the razor and tighten the mechanism down on the blade before storing it OUTSIDE OF THE BATHROOM, perhaps in the bedroom or a closet.  </li>
            <li> We ladies (or anyone who doesn&#x27;t do frequent manual labor) appreciate the absence of pointy diamond knurls in the #38c.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the adjustable screw in the base (non-blade edge) releases the blade assembly, allowing for greater safety and allowing one to control the level of hold over the blade.</li>
            <li> and it is machined so well that it would be possible that a single DE Razor could last the average shaver a lifetime.  </li>
            <li> I now have enough Feather blades (purchased in bulk) to last me a lifetime, for less than the cost I used to pay for ONE YEAR of buying disposable plastic cartridges for $6.00 each.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The weight of the razor almost eliminates the need to go over and over the same spot, less likely to shred your face too.</li>
            <li> Looks totally vintage and super expensive.</li>
            <li> I have very stiff facial hair and somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> A solid feeling razor that has that little extra length in the handle.</li>
            <li> One sharp blade is enough.</li>
            <li> At about $50.00, I was skeptical about the price, but this razor is well worth it!</li>
            <li> I also purchased a variety of other blades to test out including Shark Chrome, Derby, Blue Bird, Gillette 7, and Feather.  </li>
            <li> After several months of use, there is no sign or rust or any other deterioration, and I have made no trips to the emergency room even when using with Feather blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m OCD, I want smooth &amp; soft in every direction when I shave which is why I would get razor burn so bad with cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> had started off just frustrated over the price of cartridges for something that I was otherwise satisfied with though it was simply something I had to do, like brushing your teeth, ya know?  </li>
            <li> wash and pat dry.</li>
            <li> And you should always be changing blades with a dry razor and hands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten to the point where I dry shave without a problem.</li>
            <li> Slow and steady.</li>
            <li> Would never new to buy another one after you buy this unless you just want to</li>
            <li> yes I’m a little bored, and yes I’m a little too excited about the whole wet shaving thing – and the second time around, after having the razor for less than a week</li>
            <li> I found myself dropping back from the Fusion, to the Mach 3, and then read an article that made me understand the issue - that there was nothing wrong with the old DE razors that had been in use for nearly a hundred years, other than the fact that they didn&#x27;t generate enough profits for the razor companies.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to shave every single day</li>
            <li> I decided I would give a single blade a try and purchased the Merkur 38 HD after reading reviews here.  </li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s an initial indulging investment that in the long run still leads to spending less than if you were buying replacement cartridges).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time getting a close shave with other modern multi-blade systems.</li>
            <li> If I could redesign it, my only addition would be a slightly longer handle (I would have made it about 125 mm long).  </li>
            <li> I spent a long time trying to convince myself to switch to the DE razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you want a really long handle for wet shaving anyway.  </li>
            <li> My first attempt left me cut up and with a very rough shave, but I did notice one or two small sections on my face that were a lot smoother than usual, so I kept practicing.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no chance the head could become loose and spin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With a little practice and patience (a couple weeks of practice and a few extra minutes per shave patience), a 100-year-old tech DE blade will do the same job for a tiny fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I got tired of the never ending manner in which cartridge razor manufacturers would change styles and add more blades at ridiculous prices.</li>
            <li> The weight of the razor allows me to apply just enough pressure to my stubble without pressing down and risking nicks and razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaving irritation is down, shaving bumps are disappearing, and I&#x27;m still using the same blade that came with the razor.  </li>
            <li> Shaving irritation is down, shaving bumps are disappearing, and I&#x27;m still using the same blade that came with the razor.  </li>
            <li> There is a little of a learning curve to using this style of razor, just go slow and take your time the first couple of times</li>
            <li> (However, I would suggest that you shave the real tight nooks and crannies -- where the sun don&#x27;t shine -- with your normal razor to avoid nicking yourself with this sharp blade.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no genius and not particularly coordinated</li>
            <li> Let me lead with the confession that this is my first safety razor - I made the switch very recently, however, I do not offer this review in a casual or otherwise flighty manner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a heavy razor, especially compared to little disposables, but apparently that weight really does mean there&#x27;s no need to push down at all.</li>
            <li> Starting with the unboxing of this very heavy solid feeling tool.</li>
            <li> I just prefer the Old Spice and Clubman&#x27;s to all the new expensive stuff.  </li>
            <li> Looking at it its the same razor except for the black handle in the center.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem except for the time I didn&#x27;t tighten the blade holder tight enough.</li>
            <li> A heavy contrast to my other razors (which can leave my neck feeling like sunburned hamburger if I&#x27;m not extremely careful).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saving a lot of money on expensive and elaborate refills, I&#x27;m creating less waste (refills aren&#x27;t encased in plastic and are</li>
            <li> Its a little aggressive, i cant shave every day, but every third day wouldn&#x27;t kill me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The handle is a little longer which I like, but it definitely isn&#x27;t too long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had a little razor burn and that was when I was trying to hurry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Don&#x27;t fall victim to the hype of the multi-blades, learn the art of shaving and save your money!</li>
            <li> The Barber Pole is very heavy and does all the work for me, it fits well in my hand, it holds the blade on both sides evenly (as far as I could tell by holding it eye level), and it grips extremely well in my hand.</li>
            <li> As a \\&quot;newbie\\&quot; to wet shaving.....I was amazed at all the choices of DE razors on the market these days.</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving 7 weeks ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try wet shaving with no soap one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I have learned with this specific razor though is there are a few things to consider.</li>
            <li> That means that after you relather, you shave from ear to nose, lobe to chin, going toward the center of the face.</li>
            <li> The transition was easier than expected.  </li>
            <li> To those who are about to try wet shaving, be patient.  </li>
            <li> The beauty is in the simplicity - there&#x27;s really not much to break or fall apart.</li>

            <li> like I would drop it if it got wet).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite hefty which was partially the reason I chose this model.  </li>
            <li> My personal preference is towards shorter handled razors but then it would be as heavy.  </li>
            <li> So after some thought, I picked this razor up along with a few Derby Extra blades.  </li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for quite some time now and</li>
            <li> , face feels smoother longer , you gotta be a bit careful, but</li>
            <li> I also like the cross hatch design on the handle for a firm control not slip grip.  </li>
            <li> Just...don&#x27;t.), as well as a few different serums and creams for ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> and then for the 3rd round I go against grain.  </li>
            <li> I like it that it is a heavy razor, but the &amp;#34;pole&amp;#34; is so short that it causes my hand to cramp.</li>
            <li> I paid $25 for 100 blades, which will last me a few years.</li>
            <li> So I took the doctors advise and did some research on wet shaving and</li>
            <li> and I was use to the larger handled heavy cartridge razors...</li>
            <li> (German made) Heavy metal construction</li>
            <li> The knurled handle helped me grip the razor, even when my hands were wet.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months now and will not switch be switching back to disposable razors ever again!</li>
            <li> I just had to write a review about this product, which has made me a lifelong subscriber to the DE community.  </li>
            <li> It was just time to graduate and enter the wet shaving market to satisfy my needs.  </li>
            <li> Solid, heavy.</li>
            <li> Very solid, if a tad heavy.</li>
            <li> However, it is much harder to use.</li>
            <li> Maybe your could just save a few dollars and get an HD; you see where i am going with this; it is just too middle of the road.</li>
            <li> The knurling pattern on the handle keeps it from slipping.</li>
            <li> It is extremely difficult to cut yourself with this razor as long as you shave like a normal human being and don&#x27;t try to hack away at your face.  </li>
            <li> I did the math on this, just to give those that may be curious an idea of the savings with this equipment.  </li>
            <li> I did the math on this, just to give those that may be curious an idea of the savings with this equipment.  </li>
            <li> I have very tough and coarse facial hair but sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The weight feels just right to me and after a few practice shaves I will never go back to the expensive cartridge razors again.</li>
            <li> The only small difference I see between the shorter Merkur Hd and this Barber Pole version besides the slightly longer handle is that the Barber Pole version also has handle grip grooves that are cut a bit less deeply into the handle and there is a more aesthetically rounded bottom tip (Barber Pole like) instead of the knurled knob at the base of the smaller 38C model.</li>
            <li> I managed to not nick myself, but I also spent two hours on YouTube watching other men shave.</li>
            <li> I usually finish with a splash of Old Spice and put a little post shave cream on my face after that.  </li>
            <li> The poor grip along with the awkward handle means constant readjusting yourself, and this is something that can be easily addressed with a different razor.</li>
            <li> DONT PUSH DOWN, let the blade do the work, un learn your bad habits, and you will LOVE THIS BLADE</li>
            <li> That stuff is pricey but a little goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li> Stop wasting money on disposable blades and invest a little money on this and save a lot in the long run.</li>
            <li> A word of caution for anyone with sensitive skin or less than a medium to thick beard, this razor is a monster and will eat your face up.  </li>
            <li> 48 hours after the initial shave, I noticed that the razor bumps that usually plague the area under my chin were nowhere to be found.</li>
            <li> maybe the merkur blade that comes with it is duller than other blades?</li>
            <li> The weight of this razor is all the force needed to get it to cut the hair, and it does so extremely well.</li>
            <li> It has through lose parts that screw together with a somewhat longer rod than some other models, which gives it strength.</li>
            <li> I have tried other companies that sell Merkur&#x27;s and they also have not replied.  </li>
            <li> It was by chance, due to our mutual affinity for anachronistic devices, that he came across the safety razor.  </li>
            <li> and I was a bit skeptical at first,</li>
            <li> This gives me an extremely close shave</li>
            <li> Extremely well.</li>
            <li> I purchased Feather razors and these things are wicked sharp.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak to how it compares with other razors on the market.  </li>
            <li> Think of power drills, woodworking tools, downhill skis and a host of other &#x27;tools&#x27; out there</li>
            <li> For me, the Wilkinson Sword and the Astra blades work extremely well in these razors for my stubble.</li>
            <li> I try to use them for a month due to the expense they cost.</li>
            <li> Well.. I was reading the other night and saw in my rss</li>
            <li> Even with the other equipment (stand, bowl, soap, and brush), I&#x27;m still averaging about 17 cents per shave.  </li>
            <li> Even with the other equipment (stand, bowl, soap, and brush), I&#x27;m still averaging about 17 cents per shave.  </li>
            <li> Also the packaging is very minimal and the blades are biodegradable.  </li>
            <li> Be VERY careful using this blade.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering the all chrome model, but the 38 HD with the center black handle arrived.</li>
            <li> Shaving everyday is like going to the spa every single day.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that sharp and had a little drag.</li>
            <li> grandparents had it right when they used these bad boys back in theday.</li>
            <li> If you want something a little smaller - get the Merkur Heavy Duty (shorter handle - slightly lighter).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;He was having a lot of issue with conventional razors feeling like a scrap piece of metal was being dragged across his face.and</li>
            <li> This razor does have a couple of characteristics that differentiate it from other razors that the previous paragraph could just as well describe.    </li>
            <li> Handle provided had some rusted internal threading, &amp; the included razor was quite dull.</li>
            <li> , my son dropped my daily razor onto the hard tile floor in our bathroom and broke the mechanism.</li>
            <li> I got cut up pretty bad on my cheeks and especially the neck area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few years now and the only regret I have is that I bought it for $100 at a small store instead of $50 here on amazon.  </li>
            <li> The first few weeks after swapping from a cartridge razor were a bit daunting, it was difficult to get a close shave, but as I learned how to hold this razor and use it, shaving became a joyful ritual.</li>
            <li> In the world of wet shaving, there are multi-bladed bank account draining cartridge poppers, double edged razors of mediocre tolerances and works of art built to last a lifetime.  </li>
            <li> If I use the blades as I stated above, I&#x27;m getting at least seven shaves out of each blade.  </li>
            <li> If I use the blades as I stated above, I&#x27;m getting at least seven shaves out of each blade.  </li>
            <li> Start out with a \\&quot;calmer blade\\&quot; such as Dorco before trying a sharper brand like Feather.....which I find to be excellent.....and just go slow without ANY PRESSURE......</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just remember to start slowly with short strokes.</li>
            <li> Just remember to start slowly with short strokes.</li>
            <li> The Feathers are considered some of the sharpest blades around, so I only use them when I can take the time to go slow.</li>
            <li> i wanted a heavy one because i believed the weight would help with the cutting of the hairs, rather me pulling to cut the hairs, and i found this to be true.</li>
            <li> This razor is very heavy and the long handle allows for a close shave without applying any pressure which helps reduce cuts.  </li>
            <li> so you aren&#x27;t tempted to press down</li>
            <li> so the WTG pass you will shave using down strokes.  </li>
            <li> The weight of the razor drives the shave - you don&#x27;t have to bear down on the razor - it glides over your beard.  </li>
            <li> let the weight of razor glide down you face.</li>
            <li> Some Safety razors break down into three parts but</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t bear down on it while shaving.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s something that can be passed down to others.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, what it comes down to is</li>
            <li> As  girl I have struggled with stupid razors never being sharp enough or last long enough.  </li>
            <li> I typically disassemble my razor after use and, along with the used blade, soak them in 90%+ alcohol for around 30 minutes after a shave.</li>
            <li> Typically, a lot of beards grow downwards</li>
            <li> I still use Jack Black&#x27;s Beard Lube.</li>
            <li> [I believe this also has something to do with using less water with this razor].     </li>
            <li> I found that out slightly before this razor arrived in the mail, but decided to stick with it.  </li>
            <li> There is so much less bacteria with safety razors than cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> I have big hands and felt that the smaller handled razors were difficult to hold on to...</li>
            <li> There does not appear to be anything on the box to indicate chrome or black handle model</li>
            <li> and I decided to keep the black handle one.</li>
            <li> Looking at the picture of the black handle online</li>
            <li> I think it gives a smoother and closer shave and less irritation then the mach3</li>
            <li> Better than any terrible razor you can purchase at your local grocery store.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Blades being less than $.50</li>
            <li> but if anything I find that this razor is a bit less aggressive that I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> The blades are a fraction of the cost of the multi blade cartridges I had to buy for my previous razor.</li>
            <li> it is slightly heavier</li>
            <li> I have a slight hand tremor and the added size and weight</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely a razor everyone should keep in their arsenal, especially if you have a thick beard or stubble, or like me, a thin stubble , but goes in every direction.</li>
            <li> The doctor suggested that I try wet shaving and told me that many men who have bumps and acne... is the direct result of ingrown hairs due to using a muti-bladed cartridges, cutting the hairs off too close to the skin or worse... pulling the hair away from the skin and cutting it off below the surface of the skin... causing ingrown hairs and acne.    </li>
            <li> Since there is only one cutting surface you no longer have to worry about clogging the razor head with hair and shave cream and the DE Razor is less likely to cause bumps and other skin</li>
            <li> I replaced a Parker three-part razor after the threads wore out, and after a few weeks of use I&#x27;ve identified one slight drawback.</li>
            <li> It is not as heavy or rugged as a previous model I owned.  </li>
            <li> It might be a little too aggressive for some......</li>
            <li> but I have been shaving with cartridge razors for a little over 35 years.  </li>
            <li> So the razor is everything you&#x27;d expect, maybe a little</li>
            <li> Just hold it a little tighter.</li>
            <li> The blade angle is a little aggressive for my taste</li>
            <li> Takes one little investment and now i am set for a year of shaving.  </li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving every other day for the past 14 years</li>
            <li> It does get a little slippery.</li>
            <li> but it can be a little tricky to get the blade to line up well on both sides.</li>
            <li> A little heavier than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I dont think im using it wrong either because ive watched several videos on how to \\&quot;wet shave\\&quot;..</li>
            <li> Sounds crazy but I really look forward to shaving and doing so for about one twentieth of what it was costing with Gillette.</li>
            <li> Amazons description of this razor failed to disclose length of razor, and I was guessing that it would fit on my expensive razor/brush stand.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on Gillette.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this safety razor a few weeks ago, and my wife and I put it through it&#x27;s paces.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t you prefer to hold a piece of heavy, sturdy metal in your hand while you&#x27;re shaving as opposed to a piece of cheap-o plastic?</li>
            <li> im 16 and have used a mach 3 since it came out, and then the mach 3 turbo, with a few differt gels and aways</li>
            <li> i sold to a friend with blades for a few bucks.  </li>
            <li> If you buy it and then say ‘I didn’t expect it to be this heavy’… that’s on you.  </li>
            <li> I’m not experienced enough to opine on brushes at this point, but the Trumper’s soap is quite a step up from Edge gel.elf or don’t know how to use it</li>
            <li> I’m not experienced enough to opine on brushes at this point, but the Trumper’s soap is quite a step up from Edge gel.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get in trouble at work.</li>
            <li> Built well, heavy.  </li>
            <li> i like the heavy feel of it in your hand.</li>
            <li> B000QYEK88 Merkur Heavy Duty</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble getting a &#x27;baby bottom shave&#x27; on my lower neck even with an inordinate number of passes.</li>
            <li> I finally have found the secret weapon to shaving.  </li>
            <li> The razor is heavy</li>
            <li> It is heavy, but well balanced.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to treat myself and buy the heavy duty Merkur 34c.</li>
            <li> Mercur is distinctively heavy in your hand - a feature that permits the razor to cut whiskers with almost no pressure.</li>
            <li> I also purchased a Parker razor to try out a different brand, albeit the travel version, and the material and build quality are poor.</li>
            <li> I started D.E. shaving a few months ago</li>
            <li> The safety razor is heavy, and its heft provides the momentum for the blade to slice through your bristles.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m getting approximately two years of shaving for the cost of about a month of the current multi-blade face scraper sold by the big-name razor</li>
            <li> I like this razor, heavy in the hand and</li>
            <li> They are a reminder of old handmade craftsmanship that had to be cared for because it was too difficult to replicate.</li>
            <li> The head is firmly attached to the handle.</li>
            <li> If you have a heavy beard</li>
            <li> An added bonus that I found was the accuracy with which I can shape my beard and mustache, since the one blade is extremely narrow.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and don&#x27;t regret for once that I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Heavy and durable razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d expected at least a few cuts</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick enough to grip well but not so thick that  </li>
            <li> I have been on both ends of the spectrum from the gillette 56,000 blade system which is rediculously expensive for replacement blades and only gives a mediocre shave to the classic strait razor which was just a little too time consuming and nick prone for my liking.</li>
            <li> After I shave, I have to wait about a week before my skin calms down enough to shave again (with red bumps and ugly regrowth between).  </li>
            <li> There is a technique to this style of shaving or you can cut yourself pretty bad</li>
            <li> There is a technique to this style of shaving or you can cut yourself pretty bad</li>
            <li> There is no greater waste of money than buying disposable razors.</li>
            <li> you know, 5 in one cartridges etc , slow down and learn to shave again</li>
            <li> Can not buy the Merkur blades in the town I live in and generics just aren&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> As a person who prefers not to shave daily, I found myself constantly frustrated by the multiple blade systems that I grew up on.</li>
            <li> I had one very small nick on my neck, probably due to a small pimple or something there that I didn&#x27;t notice.  </li>
            <li> When you first begin to use the razor, you have to train yourself to use it or your face will end up a bloody mess.  </li>
            <li> Use very little pressure, let the blade do the work.</li>
            <li> Learn the technique on forgiving (dull) blades and watch a few demo videos on YouTube.  </li>
            <li> I had been using for the past 5 years or so.</li>
            <li> When combined with the Merkur razor, there is no better shave.</li>
            <li> imo, theres a reason DE razors are a thing of the past..</li>
            <li> Took some adjustment but after about two weeks I had no more issues.</li>
            <li> Pretend you are a piece of canvas that a maestro needs to paint...and paint yourself (usually the face, but whatever works for you).</li>
            <li> Upon receiving these products, I was eager to try them, and I suppose I went through the usual beginner fumbling though YouTube was once again a helpful resource.  </li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t want to pay a small fortune for an 87 blade contraption.the electric razors seem like overkill and unnessessary.</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t shave everyday, but still!)</li>
            <li> I used disposable razors in the past and there is no comparison in how close the shave is.</li>
            <li> I have only cut myself once, and that was because I was being careless.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to the expensive plastic razors and blade refills.</li>
            <li> After a small learning curve... shaving with a DE razor...</li>
            <li> At first, I was disappointed having installed the Merkur DE blade that the razor came with.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;boy is this thing heavy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the past 25+ years.  </li>
            <li> With past razors I would get five o&#x27;clock shadow about noon.  </li>
            <li> No more fusions for me.</li>
            <li> No more gillettes for me from here on out though.</li>
            <li> I just received my Merkur 38 HD in the mail and was anxious to try it out.  </li>
            <li> Not as aggressive as some other brands, but can handle tough whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t realize that it is ill-equipped to handle coarse, thick beards.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is that they sent me the wrong model, without the knurled handle and it is a little tough to hang on to in the shower.</li>
            <li> This not only leads to an eventual disposal, but also uneven pressure on the razor and a shoddy dangerous shave.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong by a long shot.</li>
            <li> did I mention they dull quickly?&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> with hardly any added pressure from me.    </li>
            <li> This razor was designed to shave you well letting only the weight of the shaver head do the work of cutting along with your choice of razor blade.  </li>
            <li> I honestly never imagined i&#x27;d find a razor I preferred over the 23 without spending $100</li>
            <li> The problem with that is, that I got razor burn really bad when my ex girlfriend bought one for me a few years back...</li>
            <li> I read some negative things about the Merkur razor it comes with, so we&#x27;ll see how that goes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cumbersome or clumsy.  </li>
            <li> The bit under the lower lip is a bit tricky, at least for me, and the neck area is work in progress.  </li>
            <li> Feels like it at least.</li>
            <li> With the added weight to it, it cuts through thick hair with ease.</li>
            <li> Just go slow.</li>
            <li> Other than being expensive</li>
            <li> i mean, its not &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;, but after holding a plastic gillette fusion (or mach 3, or whatever it was at the time), you can feel the weight.</li>
            <li> but now I have them no more!  </li>
            <li> they just flat out make me mad.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my opinion that the difference between the two razors is purely random, and a product of slight variation in production  </li>
            <li> a little expensive, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one thing to note is that the shape of the razor&#x27;s head makes it a little difficult to trim under the nose.</li>
            <li> but I hate how short and slick the handle is.</li>
            <li> but deep down I know that it is a terrible shave to say the least.  </li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and have used nearly every multi blade cartridge razor and electric but always get terrible razor burn.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t nick myself the first time, but did get a nasty cut on my pinky.</li>
            <li> and we were both disappointed when we couldn&#x27;t get them locally anymore.  </li>
            <li> My first shaves were horrible.  </li>
            <li> So, a few years back I decided to give up the expensive and annoying cartridge/multi-blade razors like the Gillette Sensor Excel, blah blah.</li>
            <li> The blade gap on this razor is 0.64 mm which is neither aggressive or weak.  </li>
            <li> There is a design flaw with this razor though or at the very least I got a defective model.</li>
            <li> Spend a few bucks on a razor that&#x27;ll last you a lifetime, then stop paying the insane prices for cartridge refills.</li>
            <li> Not happy.  </li>
            <li> Im used to Gillette andi got tired of the tugging and razor burn.</li>
            <li> Got tired of the price of blades for our Mach razors.</li>
            <li> I got tired of paying $15 for four Venus refill blades</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that the chrome will start to chip off within a year, and that Merkur will not stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> short of the base of the Escali stand I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy, and cuts the stubble well without cutting my skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I was tired of paying big-bucks per cartridge for my Gillette Mach-3</li>
            <li> Worse that could happen is I&#x27;d have to return it if I didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor approximately 2 years ago and lost it during a move.  </li>
            <li> A pack of 10 Merkur Razor blades costs approximately 5 dollars.  </li>
            <li> A razor blade on this razor lasts approximately 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I hope that other frustrated ladies will read my review and benefit from this shaving revelation.</li>
            <li> Not good!</li>
            <li> It is very heavy and mad well.  </li>
            <li> This is simply impossible to do with a multi-blade system - they will clog and become useless after half an inch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can see someone really cutting the bejesus out of themselves if they tried, but it just didn&#x27;t seem that hard to use at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hated it because the next morning my face looked like a burn victim(no offense).  </li>
            <li> an tired of buying the expensive Mach 3 blades.  </li>
            <li> Although shaving is much less irritating now, this razor unfortunately did not prevent ingrown hairs :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to see what the other handles looked like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, if you want to be filthy, dirty rich or bang the hoes so your just a filthy dirty d-bag, purchase this razor.</li>
            <li> So some shavers find this type of shaving pattern may cut too close to their skin, so you might find this shave pass to be uncomfortable for you, or you may find some areas of your face will not like an ATG shaving pass.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with the 38C.</li>
            <li> can get a lousy pass.</li>
            <li> but with this its scary how close you can get, and maybe if you read this i can save you some learning curve.  </li>
            <li> I used to cringe tossing a few-dollar cartridge in the trash--it just seemed wasteful to keep trowing away a relatively expensive cartridge every week or so.  </li>
            <li> Things to consider: Trying a cheaper model to see if its for you before buying an expensive model.</li>
            <li> They would also get clogged and be utterly useless.</li>
            <li> Basically you have a useless piece of metal because you cannot place a blade on the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll see what your doing wrong.</li>
            <li> but this is a gift to my husband and it was carelessly put in a bubble envelope that was smashed up when I received it.</li>
            <li> and I like how the handle feels I can&#x27;t shave with it without replacing stock parts which makes it useless to me</li>
            <li> I wanted to find an alternative to expensive multi razors</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to but is not at all difficult.</li>
            <li> Way cheaper than those expensive 18 bladed, twisting, vibrating garbage razors also.</li>
            <li> This made shaving under the nostirls, around the lips, and the trasition of cheek to neck difficult.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried it on my head yet, but ill update this when i do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> gave it 4 stars because i am finding it difficult to get a closer shave compared to the 4 bladed fusion i used to use, so my deduction of 1 star is at no fault of the product, rather the &amp;#34;idea&amp;#34; of a DE safety razor.</li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned that preparing the razor and using it would be difficult and take a lot of time to learn how.</li>
            <li> I have to say that there is definitely a nostalgic feeling when you use a DE razor.</li>
            <li> After getting sick of cutting myself and the irritation I got from the Mach3, I switched to a Norelco electric razor and used that for about 6 years, but was never thrilled with the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> I have never really enjoyed shaving, in fact, I hated it.</li>
            <li> and now a cold towel, this closes the pores.</li>
            <li> The weight of the chromed razor head... worked like a champ as it glided across my face... cutting my whiskers...</li>
            <li> while letting the weight of the razor do all the cutting...</li>
            <li> awkward, fortune-cookie-esque translations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard and a terrible five o-clock shadow.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about this razor.</li>
            <li> it was never as bad as a disposable razor cut.</li>
            <li> Slap a Feather blade in this bad boy and it will cut any beard like butter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> dont buy in the corprate hype, i have yet to get that painful \\&quot;pulling feeling\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was sick</li>
            <li> For anyone considering this razor as an addition to a collection, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to get the closest shave of your life!</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> if it weren&#x27;t for the price of the stupid cartridges.&lt;br</li>
            <li> all that fifty million blade crap.  </li>
            <li> , we hate it, really hate it .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Merkur models come apart into three pieces (the head is two pieces that you have to put together, which is annoying).  </li>
            <li> For 8 measly blades!!</li>
            <li> Your neck looks awful.  </li>
            <li> did I mention they&#x27;re insanely expensive?&lt;br</li>
            <li> I looked into Safety razors because of the outrageous costs of cartridge replacements.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these, the first replaced a more expensive handle, the second was a gift. While I liked the heaver adjustable handle I had before this one gives me a much more pleasant shave and the longer handle is great.</li>
            <li> I like the heft and feel of this razor a whole lot.  Just started wet-shaving and am a big fan.  This thing works exactly the way it&#x27;s supposed to work, cleans up easily, and looks cool (and that&#x27;s not a bad thing at all).  Respect the edge, lads and lasses, and you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new DE razor.  This is the perfect one for me.  I like the heft of it.  The razor glides across my skin perfectly.  I use Cremo shave cream and Personna blades, so I&#x27;m sure they help too.  But I get a perfect shave with no nicks. I even have to look closely and feel my face when I shave to see if its actually doing something, or did I forget to put a blade in.  Nope, it&#x27;s working.  Awesome.  Love my HD.</li>
            <li> Great razor.  Nice weight.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Don&#x27;t waste money on Gillette.  They are deutche bags.</li>
            <li> I use to shave with the $5 dollar replacement cartridge razors that everyone else uses. I bought this to see how it works. I will NEVER shave with anything else ever again. The only thing that beats the shave is the price. Great product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this razor. I wish I would have started shaving with a DE a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Buy this now.  You will enjoy waking up and shaving, heck, you may set your alarm clock a 10 minutes earlier to enjoy shaving with this.  Pair it with a badger hair brush and some nice shaving soap or cream and you&#x27;ll be amazed at how great your skin feels and looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, looks.  Your neck looks awful.  Stop ripping hairs out, gentlemen.</li>
            <li> I purchased this safety razor a few weeks ago, and my wife and I put it through it&#x27;s paces. First off, pair the 38 HD with a good quality blade (Feather or Israeli Personnas), you won&#x27;t go back to disposables or cartridges. Next you&#x27;ll want a good shaving soap/cream, a brush, and a good shaving bowl or cup to work up your lather. Finally, I highly recommend a pre-shave oil and a good after shave care regimen (witch hazel and Nivea sensitive skin aftershave balm (it&#x27;s cheap!)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight of this razor is quite a bit more than the old Mach 3 I had been using for the past 5 years or so. The Merkur 38 HD could easily double as a hammer or personal defence tool if needed. The feel in the hand is at that sweet spot for my larger hands: heavy, a long handle that is at the proper diameter for my hand size, and the solid construction definitely puts it up there with more expensive razors. The weight pretty much guarantees a smooth, effortless shave on the face (myself) with minimal passes and effort (you don&#x27;t have to apply pressure to get a good pass), since that weight and a good blade take all of the work out of shaving. When my wife used it for her legs, she noticed (like me) that the shave was much closer than the previous cartridges we had been using for so long, with a lot less touch-ups and multiple passes. We have also noted there was much less irritation and ingrown hairs after getting a grip with proper use of a safety razor (no shaving against the grain!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note for the ladies that may plan on using one of these: if you plan on shaving your legs with this razor, be sure to use a thick, stiff bristle brush to work up your lather and to stand up the hairs for a better shave. My wife complained that the silvertip badger brush was too soft for her to be of any use outside of the majestic feel of the soft bristles. I&#x27;m not saying to grab a toothbrush, but you may want to look at a boar bristle or one of the cheaper Escali badger bristle brushes if you plan on shaving legs. You&#x27;ll want something with a little less &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; and better exfoliating properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you got your razor, some good blades, an amazing brush, some soap/creame, a pre and after-shave care package: how do you clean and maintain the razor and blades? I typically disassemble my razor after use and, along with the used blade, soak them in 90%+ alcohol for around 30 minutes after a shave. This cleans and disinfects the blade and the razor&#x27;s head, as well as removes any remaining soap or creame residue from between the blade and head. A quick wipe with a towel or microfiber cloth after a soak brings everything to shiny, beautiful goodness once again (never wipe your blades, shake to get most of the alcohol off) and reassemble your razor and place everything back on your razor stand until the next shave. This will keep it looking new as well as keep it clean and remove the excess water in between the blade and head (alcohol is more volatile (evaporates quickly) and sanitizes rather well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you&#x27;ve never shaved with a safety razor, you&#x27;re definitely missing out on one of the best shaves of your life (unless you take the time to learn to use a straight razor or find a barber like I did). If you want to experience a proper shave, hit up youtube and watch a few shave demonstrations, then come back and get this bad boy and get ready to knock your woman dead with that handsome baby smooth face (for you men) or completely erase your man&#x27;s mind with ridiculously smooth legs (for you women). After a couple of shaves, you&#x27;ll have the technique down to a proper shave each and every time, with no cuts (yes, I&#x27;ve actually cut myself, once when I first got it), and you&#x27;ll save money for the long run (a year or more of blades will set you back around $14 or so, and whatever the cost of your soap/creame and pre/after shave products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your grandparents had it right when they used these bad boys back in theday. Your dad probably learned to shave with one of these when he was younger. The cost definitely is a bit pricier up front, but you&#x27;ll come out cheaper after a few months of switching from your cartridges (which can be $20 or more each month!), and have much less waste in the end (the blades are fully recyclable, and only come wrapped in paper) which makes them prime for someone who recycles at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor if you have medium to large man/woman hands and want to save money over the life of this razor, since blades are so cheap and at such a higher quality, not to mention the quality of your shave is infinitely better once you have learned the proper shave technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still want to find out who in their right mind thought multi blade cartridges were better for shaving than this &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; tech and give them a piece of my mind....</li>
            <li> As a \\&quot;newbie\\&quot; to wet shaving.....I was amazed at all the choices of DE razors on the market these days. After doing much research.....and reading a lot of reviews.....I settled on the Merkur 38C. Its a high quality razor which feels just right for a guy with huge hands.  If your thinking of learning to shave like our Dads &amp; Grandfathers did......this is a good razor to start with and get some experience. It might be a little too aggressive for some......so maybe an adjustabe would be a better choice depending on your beard. It has great balance with an extra long handle and just the right amount of weight.....which is not too heavy.....but balanced well in my opinion......and it looks absolutely awesome.  The price I paid here at Amazon was the just about the best offered anywhere.....give or take a dollar or two at most.  You&#x27;ll love it.......I know that I do........just GET IT ALREADY!!!  Start out with a \\&quot;calmer blade\\&quot; such as Dorco before trying a sharper brand like Feather.....which I find to be excellent.....and just go slow without ANY PRESSURE......let the weight of the head do all the work. In no time at all you&#x27;ll experience the most absolutely wonderful shaves you have ever had in your entire life!!!!</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time on forums before I took the plunge into the double edge shaving world.  This razor is highly recommended by many longtime double edge users.  I&#x27;ve been using Derby blades and Proraso soap with it and I get great shaves, especially if I do a third pass against the grain.  This model has a heavier handle so you aren&#x27;t tempted to press down (if you do most of your skin will go down the drain, with your stubble - which is true of any double edge).  Really, this investment is worth it, it costs me about 40 cents a week to shave now, soap and blades, compare that to buying fancy Gillette blades.  Spend some time on Badger and Blade forums and get a semi nice brush to go with it and shaving won&#x27;t seem like such a chore anymore with this razor.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this razor!  It&#x27;s very heavy duty, has a nice weight and handle length.  It was worth the money.  I definately recommend this product to anyone looking for a high quality safety razor.</li>
            <li> The merkur Model 38 HD Barber Pole DE Razor was the first DE Razor I used.  I started wet shaving 7 weeks ago but I have been shaving with cartridge razors for a little over 35 years.  First off, let me say this, compared to a few other DE razors I&#x27;ve purchased, vintage DE razors, this brand new DE razor made in Solingen Germany is very well made (I also own and use a DOVO straight razor made in Solingen).  The heft of the razor is ideal for letting the weight of the razor shave your beard w/o adding any of your own pressure to move the razor across your face    At the time I purchased this razor here at Amazon, I also bought a package of Derby Extra DE Razor blades (5 pack) and a 10 pack of Feather DE blades, also purchased here at Amazon.  I highly recommend using/trying both the Derby and the Feather razor blade with this razor.  Both work well with this razor with the Feather being the sharper of the two, yet the Derby will give a good close shave used in this shaver.  If you buy both of the aforementioned DE razor blades, you will know what I&#x27;m talking about when I mention the Feather is sharper, and again, that does not imply the Derby blade is not sharp, it is sharp, but the Feather is very sharp and you will feel the sharpness after your shave due to more of the top layer of skin cells will be removed when using the Feather razor blade    When using this or any DE Razor, you do not want to add pressure with your hand.  That is a big no no.  You want to let the weight of the razor cut your whiskars.  Adding pressure with your hand will result in your face getting nicked or cut.  This razor was designed to shave you well letting only the weight of the shaver head do the work of cutting along with your choice of razor blade.  The stradegy of getting a good shave using a DE razor, unlike a cartridge razor that employs multiple blades in one throw away razor, the DE razor should be used making up to 3 passes during a shave.  You make your lather, apply w/a brushand make your first pass WTG (with the grain), then rinse and re-lather.  Doing your 2nd pass, you want to shave XTG (across the grain), and I&#x27;m talking about the grain or the direction which your beard grows.  Typically, a lot of beards grow downwards so the WTG pass you will shave using down strokes.  XTG shaving you would shave left to right or right to left.  For your 3rd pass if you so choose, this pass may be ATG (against the grain), so you would shave starting anywhere on your face but using upwards strokes with the razor.  So some shavers find this type of shaving pattern may cut too close to their skin, so you might find this shave pass to be uncomfortable for you, or you may find some areas of your face will not like an ATG shaving pass.  Experience is the best teacher.  I should mention here and now, shaving in this way using multiple passes with a DE razor accomplishes what is known as beard reduction.  Your beard hairs will cut easier and more effectively if you shave them using multiple passes (from different directions), so take your time and don&#x27;t hurry.  Let the weight of the razor cut the hair      In my opinion, when I first used this razor I was new to DE shaving, and I took my time shaving and did (always) a good face prep and was rewarded with a close shave w/o any nicking or cutting of my skin, but if I tried to hurry with this razor and got careless, it would nick here and there.  Nicks and cuts can be avoided by taking your time, doing a good face prep before shaving, building a proper lather with a quality shave brush and using a good shaving soap or shaving cream, and letting the weight of the razor cut your beard, and if you want a very close shave, make sure you make multiple passes with the razor one pass at a time.  Lather, shave, rinse, repeat, but shave in a different direction or pass each time    If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving and this will be your first DE Razor purchase, while you&#x27;re waiting for the razor to arrive, take your timeand read about wet shaving at some of the various wet shaving web sites (use a search engine looking for &#x27;wet shaving&#x27;).  That way you will be prepared for your first shave having taken the time to read how it is done    I highly recommend this particular razor.  It has a nice hefty feel to it, the handle is long so you wont feel like you have run out of room with it in your hand, yet you can choke up on it and not use the entire length of the handle.  The chrome plating is very good, and one other thing I need to mention, especially if you are a new DE Razor user....you want to make sure you tighten the handle after inserting the razor blade.  This is a two piece DE Razor.  The top of the head comes off when you unscrew at the very bottom of the handle.  You do this so you can insert the razor blade.  If you re-insert the top of the razor to the rest of the razor and do not tighten correctly, the top of the razor can allow the razor blade to move up and down, which is not good as your skin can possibly get caught between the blade and the guard (I&#x27;ve done this once&#x3D;:-(, and got a good cut for being negligent.  Don&#x27;t make this rookie mistake.  Make sure you always tighten the top of the razor well before using.  Buy this razor with confidence as it is a fine shaving tool and one that will last you your entire life with proper use and care</li>
            <li> This razor is stunning.  The chrome finish is perfect.  The styling and design are top notch.  The spiral handle is easy to grip and control.  The weight is heavy enough to convince you of the craftsmanship in your hand, but light enough to let you deftly shave.      It&#x27;s a good bit more aggressive than my old Gillette Tech and took a little getting used to, but once I mastered it, my shaves are quick and close.    A wonderful Father&#x27;s day gift.</li>
            <li> stylish. sophiscated. well made as all mekur razors are.</li>
            <li> I got what I paid for in a Quality razor, one that will be passed on after I&#x27;m gone. The added weight and longer handle really make a difference in shaving.</li>
            <li> I love this safety razor. It&#x27;s nice and heavy, cleans easy and shaves great. I bought a Parker piece of junk before this and boy was that a mistake. Accept no substitutes. The only fault I can give this razor is that when it&#x27;s wet, the grip isn&#x27;t all that great to hold on to; but it&#x27;s a small complaint for an otherwise great razor. It unscrews to 2 pieces and is super easy to change blades. A couple of tips to keep it tip top: when you&#x27;re done shaving, unscrew it a little and rinse it, that will make sure to get all the stubble out of the head. Another great tip (thank you [...]) is to keep the head submerged in mineral oil (which can be found at target or other stores I would guess) which will keep the water out of it and make the blades last significantly longer and prevent any possibility of rusting. (not that it ever will)</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. This long handle razor is very heavy, giving  it an extremely high quality feel to match it&#x27;s beautiful look. The chrome finish is flawless and the styling is wonderfully classic.  Yes, you can get a Progress or a Futur for the same price but part of what attracted me to DE shaving, besides saving a bunch of money on blades, was the idea of using an old world style instrument in my daily routine and the neither the Progress nor the Futur give me the warm fuzzies like  the 38C does. That&#x27;s a very subjective thing I understand but if you would prefer a vintage 50s Ferrari to a modern supercar model then you and I are on the same page.    Functionally, the long handle is closer to my old Sensor razor than the standard HD allowing me to hold it in a similar fashion and reduce the amount of awkwardness I have to work through as I learn this new (old) method of shaving.  The heft of the razor is enough that you can get a close shave without applying any pressure on the shave head. This gives a comfortable shave without the nicks and burn that I always seem to get no matter how careful I am with my cartridge razor.  I&#x27;m no genius and not particularly coordinated yet I&#x27;ve been able to get a good shave with this from day one with no cuts or discomfort.    Classic styling, solid construction and proper function are the three things that make this an outstanding choice.  I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with the 38C.</li>
            <li> OK, why would people ever have moved to cartridge razors when this kind of shaving goodness existed all along?? This is my first DE razor and I am loving it so far. Beyond the satisfaction of shaving with a sturdy piece of metal that feels like it will last for hundreds of years, the shave is far superior when compared to cartridge razors. I get a much closer shave, my razor bumps had disappeared, and in the long run shaving will be MUCH cheaper. I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about this razor. Totally worth the higher price up front and I will never again go back to shaving with overpriced plastic toys.</li>
            <li> I researched double edged razors after getting fed up with razor burn and grocery store razors that are backed by marketing and advertising instead of results and durability and COST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews here and decided to give it a shot. I wasn&#x27;t blown away after the first shave; I had been using a Quattro and Jack Black&#x27;s Beard Lube and at first it seemed like there was no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A full 24 hours passed when I noticed that my face still felt like I just shaved it. 48 hours after the initial shave, I noticed that the razor bumps that usually plague the area under my chin were nowhere to be found. If you&#x27;re a guy that is prone to razor burn, give this a shot (and stop shaving against the grain).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is so close and smooth; I feel I could go longer than 5 days without shaving. I probably could, but I enjoy shaving now so much that I don&#x27;t mind doing it more often!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other things to note:&lt;br /&gt;- The handle isn&#x27;t that long. Just about 3.5 inches. I&#x27;d hate to see what the other handles looked like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The quality of the Merkur 38c is impeccable. It looks brilliant in my bathroom and has a nice weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I still use Jack Black&#x27;s Beard Lube. I&#x27;ll try wet shaving with no soap one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before initial use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Mind the angle of the blade before you start using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No need to press the blade against your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Short strokes and rinse often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I didn&#x27;t nick myself the first time, but did get a nasty cut on my pinky.</li>
            <li> Like I said in my title I have been using this razor for three months, and I should note this is my first time with a safety razor. I&#x27;ll start by saying I love using a safety razor. I get a better shave with less irritation, and to me it&#x27;s kind of therapeutic. What I have learned with this specific razor though is there are a few things to consider. I originally thought I needed the long handle as most safety razors tend to be smaller, but I can say for certain it&#x27;s not necessary. I often find myself gripping near the top of the razor to get the right angle, and I find the weight of the razor to be awkward when you grab it by the handle. I often have to readjust my positioning, and if I&#x27;m not paying attention can get a lousy pass. My biggest gripe though with this razor though is the grip. It get very slippery when wet, and the grooves provide little grip. The poor grip along with the awkward handle means constant readjusting yourself, and this is something that can be easily addressed with a different razor. My bottom line is enjoy safety razor shaving, however I feel the experience could be with a better designed razor. I would personally recommend a different razor if you&#x27;re in the market.</li>
            <li> An 8-pack of four blade cartridge razors can set a man back almost $30! For 8 measly blades!! What are we, made of money?!&lt;br /&gt;And did I mention they dull quickly?&lt;br /&gt;And did I mention they get clogged with hair?&lt;br /&gt;And did I mention they&#x27;re insanely expensive?&lt;br /&gt;Hey, THAT&#x27;S FANTASTIC!&lt;br /&gt;Where do I sign up? Take my money, please!&lt;br /&gt;Or how about instead we brush on a little sandalwood shave cream, use this fine razor, and a few smooth moves later we can be soft as a baby&#x27;s... well, you know. Let&#x27;s do ourselves and our lovely women a favor and give ourselves the kind of satisfying shave we deserve and that they love. Switching from a disposable razor to a double-edged safety razor is like upgrading from a plastic knife to a samurai sword. Wouldn&#x27;t you prefer to hold a piece of heavy, sturdy metal in your hand while you&#x27;re shaving as opposed to a piece of cheap-o plastic? I bought this hefty and fantastic safety razor and I wish I could properly express how great it is to engage in one of those forgotten rituals that remind a man why it&#x27;s great to be a man. Proper shaving has become a lost art and today&#x27;s average joe hasn&#x27;t a clue about the fine art of the traditional shave that our grandfathers took part in. We&#x27;ve been conditioned to accept the cheap and disposable multi-blades that companies market today because it makes them lots of money - not because it&#x27;s a better product for us. I can&#x27;t recommend this Merkur razor highly enough.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a smoother shave, if you want to save money, if you want to reduce your environmental impact, and if you want to engage in a ritual that great men like your grandfather, John F. Kennedy, and Teddy Roosevelt took part in, then buy this fantastic safety razor. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver with derby blades, the cheap tweezerman badger brush and arko shave soap for about two months and must say it&#x27;s been a very pleasant experience.  I switched to DE when the replaceable shavers kept tearing my face up and causing ingrown hairs.  To get the full effect of this shaving style you must use either shaving soap or shaving cream that you whip up with a pure badger brush, otherwise you might be kind of dissappointed.  I used the merkur blade that came with it and prefer the derbies much better.  I tried arko, williams mug and col. cunk&#x27;s shave soap and found cunk&#x27;s to be my favorite but I use arko the most.  I also tried proraso shaving cream which I enjoy but not as much as the soaps.  You must give yourself time to get used to using this shaver or else you will have many nicks and cuts.  Your shaves will now take more time but I enjoy them so much that I don&#x27;t really mind and actually look forward to shaving now.  I do think that you can get just as CLOSE of a shave using a good replaceable shaver but they cost SO much more and wear out faster.  This setup will save me a lot of money over the years and will also be better for the environment as I can recycle the blades and keep the shaver and badger brush indefinitely.  Safety razor shaving is worth it but not a \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; shaving experience like alot of others on here state.  I think I will be doing it for life though.  Check out mantic59 on youtube for an intro into this old fashioned technique.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.  I have an older Merkur \\&quot;short handle\\&quot; razor that I&#x27;ve used for years and when I saw the longer \\&quot;Barber Pole\\&quot; handle deceided to replace it.  The longer handle makes it easier to hold and get a great shave.  Easy to clean, the blade never clogs.  A well built, solid razor that will last for many years.  I&#x27;d also recommend the Wilkinson Sword razor blades.  Haven&#x27;t been able to buy them in the states for years over the counter but Amazon has them.  My father got me using those when I was in my twenties and we were both disappointed when we couldn&#x27;t get them locally anymore.  I ordered 50 of them when I ordered the razor and gave some to Dad.  He was real happy.  They only have the \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; but if you can find the \\&quot;Premium\\&quot; they are even better.  When combined with the Merkur razor, there is no better shave.</li>
            <li> For my skin, this unit just works. I have a Parker 22r that I like too, but this is a better razor and gives me a better shave. The Parker doesn&#x27;t get quite as close on looser areas of skin and around the neck, but it does fine shaving my head since the skin there is very taught. I use the Parker on my head with a Shark Super Chrome blade and I use the Merkur 38 HD on my face and neck with Feather blades. The Merkur gets a closer shave with less irritation as long as I&#x27;m careful and make sure my technique is solid. I expect that I&#x27;ll be using this combination for quite a while. For a starter razor, the Parker is probably going to be better for most people, but once you get some time under your belt with DE shaving, try the Merkur.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many DE (double-edge) razors, knowing full well that DE shaves are far closer than the multi-blade Gillettes. This is the best by far, for several reasons: Best heft and balance; best weight and length; funtional-yet-esthetic design; and an unbelievably close shave as the result. Do your due-diligence and research wet shaving -- there are a few tricks to the trade you need to know first. Here, in a nutshell, is all you need to know to get a great wet shave with this (or any) DE razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) PREP. Buy this razor and a few other preparatory items (mentioned right here). You can start with most any DE blade. Also have: Proraso shaving cream; a badger shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;2) LATHER. Wash face with warm water (or just take a shower), then squeeze a quarter-sized dollop of shaving cream onto the warm, wet brush; start whipping up a lather directly on your face. Use circular motions, diagonal motions, horizontal, vertical -- it doesn&#x27;t matter. Get a good lather, which will be denser and less bulky than if you&#x27;d used commercial spraycan foams.&lt;br /&gt;3) SHAVE. Slow and steady. Short strokes at all times. After a stroke or two, turn the razor over to use the clean side of the blade. Rinse and repeat. Always shave with the grain.&lt;br /&gt;4) RELATHER; SHAVE AGAIN. Yep, that&#x27;s right: Do it all over again -- but with one change: Shave across the grain. That means that after you relather, you shave from ear to nose, lobe to chin, going toward the center of the face. This is ACROSS the grain, not AGAINST the grain, and it makes the single biggest difference in going from a decent to a superbly close shave. Pay special attention to your neck: It is its own labyrinth of errant, erratic hair growth patterns. I just go after it twice, once straight down from chin to collarbone in short strokes; and once diagonally from lobe to Adam&#x27;s apple. That usually gets most of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps. I went from cordless-electric-shave-in-the-car to spend-10-minutes-on-your-face-after-shower and there is no going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to start slowly with short strokes. That&#x27;s the only thumbrule you need. You won&#x27;t regret the switch to DE shaving.here is no going back.     Just remember to start slowly with short strokes. That&#x27;s the only thumbrule you need. You won&#x27;t regret the switch to DE shaving.</li>
            <li> Handle grip is not too grippy</li>
            <li> im 16 and have used a mach 3 since it came out, and then the mach 3 turbo, with a few differt gels and aways had razor burn on neck from it.  but with this its scary how close you can get, and maybe if you read this i can save you some learning curve.  DONT PUSH DOWN, let the blade do the work, un learn your bad habits, and you will LOVE THIS BLADE, i had 2 mach 3&#x27;s i sold to a friend with blades for a few bucks.  you might want to try Meckur and dansin blades but there are alot of types to try and find what works best on your face, also dont skimp on the lather, its cheap and worth the good stuff, also badger brush is a must, i got a cheap one at first and the hairs fall out.... you get what you pay for.    Your grandpa was on to something with these.... dont buy in the corprate hype, i have yet to get that painful \\&quot;pulling feeling\\&quot; anymore from letting it grow too long.    all in all its WELL worth a try!</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this razor. I chopped my neck up pretty good the first time and trimming around my goatee is kind of tricky, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised for a first round. My face feels like a baby&#x27;s butt. Bought in a set from vintagebladesllc . com  Highly recommend the product and the store.</li>
            <li> Not happy.  After 2 uses, I don&#x27;t see how on earth this DE razor is better than a mach 3 or a fushion.  Takes TRIPLE the amount of time to shave, and even when you go against the grain it STILL DOESNT GET ALL MY HAIRS.  maybe the merkur blade that comes with it is duller than other blades? doubt it.. I dont think im using it wrong either because ive watched several videos on how to \\&quot;wet shave\\&quot;.. It will cut up your face in no time.. I had an open mind going in to this \\&quot;DE Expierience\\&quot; but I digress... not for sensitive skin!  imo, theres a reason DE razors are a thing of the past.. dont believe the hype</li>
            <li> New to DE shaving and was nervous before my first shave. The 38 delivered very nice. The weight is perfect on this razor and I am very happy with this purchase. That being said, when I got the package the box inside was smashed. Fortunately the razor survived.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a DE razor before but decided to make the switch when my current batch of replacement Mach 3 blades was close to running out. This razor is really easy to user and after watching some instructional videos I had no problem picking up basic wetshaving technique.    The angle on the blade is just right for a close shave and even when I cut myself starting out it was never as bad as a disposable razor cut. The body of the razor is very solid and easy to hold. The weight is good and it feels like a product that will last me for years. It&#x27;s way more fun to shave now and it&#x27;s much smoother afterwards. Took some adjustment but after about two weeks I had no more issues.</li>
            <li> I love this Razor did a lot of research as well prior to purchase blogs videos etc...  and it paid off. This Razor glides really well no nicks at all.  I used to have a Bevel Razor by Bevel and it was good but this Razor is Grrrrrrreattt like Tony the Tiger says! I&#x27;m as well glad that I went for this Razor vs 34c HD,  because I have big hands I can palm a basketball and I&#x27;d don&#x27;t see how I could have any shorter of a Razor. Honestly I think in general this should be the standard size in length for most even without big hands. I just shaved with Catie&#x27;s Bubbles Soft Soap and I&#x27;m complete now. I have all the tools and after spending a life time with razor bumps from cartridge razors I have peace. Such a good shave it cut so close and I didn&#x27;t even feel the blade I was so impressed how painless it was it&#x27;s perfectly designed.</li>
            <li> It has taken me a few weeks to switch from a light weight disposable twin blade razor.  The additional weight of the Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic requires time to develop skill.  It is so satisfying to complete a close shave and know it costs pennies while not captive to a corporate price controlled industry.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I started shaving with this style and wanted to see if it is something I can use today. When I used it the first time I really cut myself upI may just need more practice however the single blade is far different than the three blade schick I&#x27;ve been using for 30 years now. I may try a different blade manufacturer in hopes of a more positive shave.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor and it is very heavy duty. I am a long-time fan of DE safety razors. I already have a Merkur VISION which I am very happy with except thoroughly cleaning/maintaining it is cumbersome.     With this razor, to change the blade, you unscrew the long handle and the top blade guard easily comes off to change the blade [i.e. screwing the long handle clockwise tightens the blade assembly at the top of the razor. Cleaning is very easy. You can unscrew the handle as described above and you can also further pull the long axis of the handle to expose more parts and get a deeper clean.     When reassembling the razor, be sure the reassemble the long handle by pressing the little c-clip in with your fingers to make it glide into the body of the handle.    This razor is not adjustable per Se. I generally use DE razors in one position anyway. In the most tightened position, the blade is held very stable without much wiggle room. The teeth allow more contact with the skin/hair for a better shave.      I have very tough and coarse facial hair but sensitive skin. What a combo. This razor in combination w/ Colonel Conk Soap, a badger brush, and Wilkinson blades gives me a relatively, surprisingly smooth and easy shave. In fact, the blades seem to be lasting 10-15 shaves rather than just 2-5 shaves...big difference [I believe this also has something to do with using less water with this razor].     I enjoy and look forward to shaving with this shaving system.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I finally decided to take the plunge and try wet shaving using a DE safety razor.  After a couple of weeks I&#x27;m pleased with the 38 HD.  The transition was easier than expected.  I think the heft of the HD made it easier to learn the technique, and so far no nicks or cuts (a little razor burn at first, but as I moved to sharper blades that hasn&#x27;t been too much of an issue).  While I am still learning, my experience so far has been a positive one.  I dove right in, buying the HD along with the Perfecto 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush, Perfecto chrome stand, Geo F. Trumper Almond Shaving Cream Jar, and Geo F. Trumper Limes Skin Food.  The first shave didn&#x27;t go too bad, yet it wasn&#x27;t great either.  I was worried I would end up in the ER getting stitches all over my neck, so I was overly cautious.  I didn&#x27;t use quite enough shave cream to build a solid lather, and I found that the Merkur blade that came with the HD wasn&#x27;t for me.  In short, it took me a long time to make just two passes, and I didn&#x27;t get a very close shave.  But, I didn&#x27;t cut myself, which was my main goal for the first try.  I began trying different blades and quickly found that the sharper ones were more comfortable for me (Astra and Feather).  I got better at lathering the cream and gained more confidence in my technique.  The skin food was a great buy and I highly recommend it.  It smells awesome (though I wish the scent lasted longer than a few minutes) and really calmed the razor burn.  That stuff is pricey but a little goes a long ways.  While it is early, I am guessing that little bottle will last me six months.  So far, the brush seems good.  It shed several hairs the first few shaves, but now only one or two per use.  The Perfecto stand is well built and looks nice on my countertop.  The shave cream smells of sweet almonds, which I really like, but it seems more of a luxury (whereas the skin food, also pricey, seems far more worth it to me).  I am going to see how long the jarlasts, and then I am likely to experiment with an Arko stick.  Then again, I&#x27;ll be saving so much on blades maybe I&#x27;ll stick with the Trumper product and allow myself that splurge.  To those who are about to try wet shaving, be patient.  Learn the technique on forgiving (dull) blades and watch a few demo videos on YouTube.  Once you&#x27;re confident, especially around the nose and neck, don&#x27;t hesitate to try the sharper options.  In two weeks I tried four or five blades from a cheap sample pack I bought.  My technique improved and the sharper blades performed much better.  I can now do a three pass shave in about 10 minutes with very good results, and the skin food soothes any razor burn.  While I was skeptical after the first shave or two, I&#x27;m already convinced that it was a good move.  I don&#x27;t have to shave every single day and I have come to like shaving now, where before it was more of an inconvenient chore.  The 38 HD made the transition easier because of its design and weight, and it appears to be of a quality to last a very long time.  Update - tried the Arko stick and it is great.  Not luxurious like Trumper&#x27;s cream but a fraction of the cost and very effective (provides more slickness to give less drag than the cream).  I suggest those looking to move to wet shaving for cost reasons try the Arko stick and pick up some Nivea Sensitive Skin Post Shave Balm.  Much cheaper than the Trumper&#x27;s skin food stuff but performance is great.</li>
            <li> HD is where it&#x27;s at.I love the feel of this razor. The thicker handle gives me a better grip, and the heft is both reassuring and advantageous when shaving. The only problem I have is that I unfortunately cannot seem to find many razor stands to fit it.</li>
            <li> Sounds crazy but I really look forward to shaving and doing so for about one twentieth of what it was costing with Gillette. I use the Feather blades but have successfully used the Merkur blade and the Extra. Use highend shaving paste and get the best shaves of my life. Use very little pressure, let the blade do the work. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I Bought the Merkur shaving kit came with a shaver and brush with a stand, also the bowl. The shaving products I use are Van Der Hagen Shave soap Proraso cream and aftershave all these products are amazing. I am new to this after paying a ton of money for razor bumps and burn whoooo Wheeee Truly stopped me from shaving every day. Using Gillett and many other brands finally now at 28 years old I figured out that old school shaving is 10! 10! F N times better than the new tech. I never type reviews at all this is my first, This Works cool soft skin its amazing and the closest cut I have ever had in my life with no razor burn or bumps. Recomond it to everyone</li>
            <li> Described as a Long Handle razor, but it wasn&#x27;t in comparison to my Merkur 180c or Parker 22r razors.....Although the Barber Pole design was nice, I Returned it!</li>
            <li> As my first wet razor, I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to. That being said, it seems solid, and I like the length and the weight of it. The grip is usually pretty good. It can get slick if I get shaving soap on my hand first, but I imagine that&#x27;s not the fault of the product.</li>
            <li> Its a little aggressive, i cant shave every day, but every third day wouldn&#x27;t kill me.&lt;br /&gt;I like the design the handle the wieght is heavier. i really like how close of a shave i get.&lt;br /&gt;Im balding so im about to try a whole head shave excluding eyebrows of course.</li>
            <li> Fits in hand very well, a good weight. Not aggressive at all. Would never new to buy another one after you buy this unless you just want to</li>
            <li> This is a great product for users just starting or that have been using a safety razor for years. Comfortable in the hand. Also you cant beat a Merkur Razor.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic \\&quot;Barber Pole\\&quot; Long Safety Razor a year ago March 9, 2011, and the Feather Hi-Stainless Double edged razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no looking back for me now as I am absolutely hooked on this combo for the best shave ever. I bought a second Merkur Razor....just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To date I have used 22 blades for a year of shaving. The blades are extremely sharp and a light touch when shaving is mandatory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some suggestions: I wash my face first with warm water and either Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint Pure Castile Peppermint Soap or Pears Soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a shaving brush, mug and shaving soap for years. I have tried just about every brand out there and the Van Der Hagen Aloe Vera &amp; Shea Butter is as good as any for 5 or 6 times the price. I get it at Wal-Mart for a $1.59.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rinse well after I&#x27;m finished shaving with cold water, followed by good old fashion Witch Hazel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse your razor in hot, hot water; shake it dry and then dip it in 90% rubbing alcohol to displace the water and to disinfect and sterilize the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my opinion that the fancy three and four blade razor blades in a plastic body  hold bacteria because they can&#x27;t be rinsed properly and this contributes to razor burn and skin irritations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give both the razor and the blades a solid five.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is my second \\&quot;safety\\&quot; razor and my only regret is that I waited so long to move to double edge safety razors from cartridges.  Much better shave, and so much cheaper. I used to cringe tossing a few-dollar cartridge in the trash--it just seemed wasteful to keep trowing away a relatively expensive cartridge every week or so.  Now, I typically slap a new razor blade in my Merkur every 3-4 days and enjoy a literally razor-sharp blade for just cents each.  I&#x27;ve had fewer nicks and irritation as well, just a better shave experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to this razor in particular, I like the longer handle (although it really is not that long, shorter than a Mach 3 for example) and as with other Merkur razors the build quality is excellent.  I can see this item lasting literally decades and when you consider the price for that type of longevity it is a steal.  It looks pretty sharp too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is truly a no-brainer purchase, just do it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently begun moving from the marketing driven shaving devices I&#x27;ve used for the past 20+ years (Fusion, etc) to a more traditional shaving experience. I purchased the Merkur 38HD to complement my use of a straight razor, and all I can say is \\&quot;Wow\\&quot;. The shaving experience is far superior to anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.    Just like many of the reviewers on this board, I did my research on multiple websites and paid close attention to their directions for using this double edge razor. I was highly sceptical that the weight of the razor alone would be sufficent...but I could not have been more wrong. My shave is now on par with anything I&#x27;ve ever done, and the long term investment pays for itself in a remarkably short time.    The razor itself is solid. Like any good piece of hardware the Merkur has good construction, heft, and quality materials. You know that this is an item that you will be able to use for many years to come. The replacement of blades is simple and straightforward.</li>
            <li> Let me lead with the confession that this is my first safety razor - I made the switch very recently, however, I do not offer this review in a casual or otherwise flighty manner.  It is possible that my initial enthusiasm with wet shaving might factor into my appraisal of this particular razor.  I don&#x27;t really care what the package looked like (it was fine, not &#x27;mashed up&#x27; or damaged) when it arrived, and this purchase was placed in the final days of my Prime membership - so it was in my hand in less than 48 hrs. For anyone considering this razor as an addition to a collection, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d be disappointed.  The somewhat rare combination of long handle and extra weight along with the barber pole handle etching make this one stand out from most of the classic Merkur models.  That being said, since I wasn&#x27;t able to hold other models, it is all I know.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this product is obvious at first glance. It&#x27;s a well built, timeless man-tool that I imagine lasting past my lifetime with decent care. The beauty is in the simplicity - there&#x27;s really not much to break or fall apart. So the razor is everything you&#x27;d expect, maybe a little more.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I’m writing this is to vent about the 1,2,and 3 star reviews (to date 3/23/15) which distract from the informative 4 and 5 star reviews. I read each review again – yes I’m a little bored, and yes I’m a little too excited about the whole wet shaving thing – and the second time around, after having the razor for less than a week they just flat out make me mad.  There is not a single complaint in the 1-3 stars that I feel is justified.  The only one that made me think twice before refuting is the ‘slippery handle’ comment.  I guess. Just hold it a little tighter. It’s the one HD and Long Handle combo by Merkur. If you buy it and then say ‘I didn’t expect it to be this heavy’… that’s on you.  If it doesn’t fit on your cute little stand… your stand’s too short. If you cut yourself or don’t know how to use it… you know where I’m going but I don’t want to curse for fear of Amazon not posting this.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line: in a few short passes I feel like a new man. I don’t just recommend this razor, I love this razor.  If you’re looking for info or encouragement to switch to wet shaving check out Shaving 101.com or The Art of Manliness. In case you’re wondering, I’ve been using Derby blades and Geo F Trumper’s Lime Soap. I also ordered a low-end badger brush, but the even-lower-end one that I bought at Target won’t seem to die. I’m not experienced enough to opine on brushes at this point, but the Trumper’s soap is quite a step up from Edge gel.elf or don’t know how to use it… you know where I’m going but I don’t want to curse for fear of Amazon not posting this.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line: in a few short passes I feel like a new man.

            <li> Great razor well worth the price i have a better shave and already saved enough from not using Gilette multiblade cartridges to pay for it also greatly reduces razor bumps</li>
            <li> I purchased the Barber Pole after I went to my local Art of Shaving store and got to hold the different razors. I liked the feel of this razor the best of the three I held (the other two were a Futur and an HD, the HD feeling too small in my hand and the the Futur feeling too smooth, like I would drop it if it got wet). I do not regret my decision in the slightest. The Barber Pole is very heavy and does all the work for me, it fits well in my hand, it holds the blade on both sides evenly (as far as I could tell by holding it eye level), and it grips extremely well in my hand. Haven&#x27;t dropped it once since I bought it over two months ago. This razor, coupled with [[ASIN:B003BRETQU 25 SHARK SUPER CHROME DOUBLE EDGE SAFETY RAZOR BLADES]], [[ASIN:B004L4EING Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury, Shave Set]], and [[ASIN:B002L03N74 CO Bigelow Premium Menthol Shave Cream with Eucalyptus Oil - 5.2 oz]] have made shaving something I enjoy doing as opposed to something I did every so often so I don&#x27;t get in trouble at work. Love it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been a while since i&#x27;ve come across something i know i&#x27;ll have for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;type \\&quot;Swissco Leather Case\\&quot; in Amazon&#x27;s search box, and you&#x27;ll understand even better.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. I looked into Safety razors because of the outrageous costs of cartridge replacements. Well I had no idea I would get such fantastic shaves. Seriously I get baby butt smooth shaves now. The razor itself is beautiful, very heavy. One thing I use to do is apply pressure with my plastic disposables, well you really don&#x27;t want to do that with this razor, you need to let it glide over your face and the weight of the razor should be enough. I lather, shave and lather shave for two passes. I get a nice clean shave overtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing you will want to do is get some razor blades. I use either Personna Red (made in Israel) or the Feather (Japan) The Feathers are considered some of the sharpest blades around, so I only use them when I can take the time to go slow. The Personnas can be found on Amazon&#x27;s and are very sharp but also a little more forgiving for a new DE shaver like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might be the best investment I have made in the last few years. Give it a try and get rid of your plastic disposables, sometimes simple tools do the same job better. Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resources (places for information on wetshaving)&lt;br /&gt;* Badger and Blade (great forums, great place to learn and ask)&lt;br /&gt;* The Shave Den ( I go to BB but another shaving forum)&lt;br /&gt;* West Coast Shaving (Good place to get supplies, razor sampler packs are well known)</li>
            <li> This is a really quality handle and I&#x27;ve had pretty good success with it.  The blade angle is a little aggressive for my taste but if you&#x27;re careful and move slowly it&#x27;s not usually a problem.  It&#x27;s quite hefty which was partially the reason I chose this model.  My personal preference is towards shorter handled razors but then it would be as heavy.  Very attractive as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving.  I&#x27;m currently 25 years old, and started shaving with a Mach3 (too young for my dad to have started on one of these, so I guess I&#x27;m a pioneer of sorts in my family).  After getting sick of cutting myself and the irritation I got from the Mach3, I switched to a Norelco electric razor and used that for about 6 years, but was never thrilled with the closeness of the shave.  I was about to buy replacement blades for the electric when I came across these retro double-edge razors.    So after some thought, I picked this razor up along with a few Derby Extra blades.  I have to say, this razor is just awesome.  It&#x27;s nice and heavy; built like a tank.  Likely built to the same standards they had back in the 1920s and 1930s.  Having watched the various videos online, I had an idea of how to shave with one of these and on my first shave, I didn&#x27;t cut myself once, didn&#x27;t have any irritation, and had the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  The key seems to be applying no pressure, and shaving in different directions on multiple passes, removing stubble bit by bit.  Whenever I used the Mach3, it felt like I was yanking out my stubble.  Not so with this razor.  For what it&#x27;s worth, taking my time and doing multiple passes with the Mach3 didn&#x27;t help - I still got the yanking feeling.    I also wanted to note that I didn&#x27;t buy any of the shave soaps or brushes - I&#x27;ve been using regular shaving cream and shaving after I shower, which is probably the most important part since that makes the hairs easier to cut.  I expect to try out the soaps sooner or later, but don&#x27;t feel like you need to make that leap right away.    Why did I pick this particular razor?  Well, after researching, I came to the conclusion that Merkur arguably makes the best DE razors on the market.  This one is also a bit more forgiving on beginners (eliminating some of the more exotic models), and it had a bit of extra heft, which made it preferable to me over the HD.  The internet forums also suggested this razor as a good one to make the leap into DE shaving.    Just a note to fellow beginners - a lot of the experienced users of DE razors comment on how the handle of this particular razor is quite long.  Indeed, compared to the Merkur HD (34C), it&#x27;s a longer handle.  But, compared to the Gillette cartridge razors, the handle of the 38C is about the same.  If you&#x27;re used to the Gillettes, I&#x27;d suggest starting with this razor since it will be less of a change for you, in addition to the extra heft making it less likely that you&#x27;ll apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li> Although some of the wet-shaving purists might say this is a bit of an aggressive razor to learn on, I found it to work quite well in that respect. There really isn&#x27;t much to say about it. It&#x27;s a very well constructed, two piece razor. The weight is well balanced and it wields great shaves for me. Of course, one cannot simply expect to get great shaves from this razor straight out of the box. Practice makes perfect.</li>
            <li> I spent a long time trying to convince myself to switch to the DE razor. This has singly been the best purchase to take me from being a boy to being a Marlboro Man...without smoking or stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is where this German piece of equipment excels...taking away the stubble. I will say that don&#x27;t expect it to work if you use it like the Gillette disposables or the Mach3 (speaking of, one box of refills nearly pays for this tool). DE razors require a bit of finesse in handling so you don&#x27;t cut yourself and end up having toilet paper glued to you for a while. The weight of this razor is all the force needed to get it to cut the hair, and it does so extremely well. DO NOT PUSH!!! YOU WILL GET CUT!! The first couple of times you use this, you may get a nick or whatnot, so do it on a weekend and use the lawnmower hitting you with a rock as an excuse for your nicks. I managed to not nick myself, but I also spent two hours on YouTube watching other men shave. What a Saturday Night!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second trick to this is to use soap that has tallow. I would not suggest your grocery store shaving gel or foam. They will dry too fast and then the razor will not glide over your face without taking some skin as a trophy. I am still trying to find the best one, so I don&#x27;t have a review for that yet. And since the soap is important, how you apply it is equally important. Remember your granddad shaving and using a brush? Well, get yourself a brush too. Pretend you are a piece of canvas that a maestro needs to paint...and paint yourself (usually the face, but whatever works for you). It helps get the soap under the hair and makes it stand up and therefore the razor can shave it off. Incidentally, this razor, with some training and a shot of whiskey to attempt it the first time, will help you have the best shave down south, if you catch my drift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other, and probably the most important, aspect of DE&#x27;s are the blades. Each person is different, and each blade is different. Different sharpness, different materials, etc. The blade that initially comes with the razor is a good blade to train with. You&#x27;ll get about 4-5 shaves before you need new ones. The blades are very inexpensive relative to disposables, so do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t go on the cheap for blades. Your face and your S.O. will thank you. (My personal favorite are the Feather Platinum blades.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, using a DE over ANY disposable is light-years better, and the money you save in the long run can give you the opportunity to get some good food and a date with those baby-smooth cheeks., different materials, etc. The blade that initially comes with the razor is a good blade to train with.

            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever had!!</li>
            <li> This shaver is very sturdy, easy to use and provides a close shave.  I absolutely love it.  However, do not buy the Merkur blades.  Research for something else.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband and son.  They are first time users of the double edged razor and they love it!  The weight of the razor feels so good in your hand.  The razors are elegant and affordable.</li>
            <li> This was the first safety razor I bought when I decided to stop shelling out a small fortune for multi-bladed marketing gimmicks.  After reading reviews on a couple of different shaving forums and here on Amazon, I settled on the 38c.  It seemed like a good choice because I  have broad hands and I tend to favor heavier fountain pens for writing and knives with substantial handles in the kitchen.  I have not been disappointed.  This razor feels solid and steady in my hand and, with the right blade (Dorco ST-300 works best for me), gives me smoother shaves than I ever got with disposable cartridges.  The weight of the razor allows me to apply just enough pressure to my stubble without pressing down and risking nicks and razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With only two parts, this razor makes swapping out blades very easy.  It&#x27;s also very easy to clean, and after nine months it&#x27;s still as shiny as the day I got it.  I rinse it in hot water and swish it briefly in some 91% rubbing alcohol after every shave and, whenever I clean my bathroom (less often than my wife would like), I use the same bathroom cleaner I use on my sink &amp; faucet to get rid of any stray soap or water spots.  From an economic standpoint, I&#x27;ve already saved the price of this razor in what I would have spent on disposable cartridges, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try a lot of different soaps, creams, and aftershaves looking for my \\&quot;absolute favorite\\&quot;.  I have not been tempted at all, yet, to try a different razor since I started using this one.</li>
            <li> purchased this item in Dec 2014; already fell apart.  I have emailed the seller and hope I can still get a replacement since it is outside a refund window.</li>
            <li> Great razor! been using it daily and i hate shaving! I also have a Gillette proglide, schik hydro and braun 7 series...this is by far more fun to use and i feel like i get a better shave...it does take a little more time because i use the badger brush and lather up shaving cream but its well worth it!</li>
            <li> This razor works really well.  It&#x27;s well made, moderately aggressive, good for a beginner, and has a nice heft to it.  I find it works best with Feather blades, but your mileage may vary.  I have large hands and the long handle makes it easy to hold.  The grip works well.  I&#x27;ve always had a secure grip even when wet or slippery.  It fits in the Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand with no problems.  I was worried about this when I got the stand because of the long handle, but it fits very well.</li>
            <li> Solid well made product!</li>
            <li> So one day I was looking to buy some new cartridges for my Gillette Proglide (I had given up on the electric shavers years ago), and I looked at the price and thought, &amp;#34;That&#x27;s pretty much a full tank of gas!&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s kinda like buying ink cartridges and you think, &amp;#34;Wait, I might as well buy a whole new printer for these prices!&amp;#34;  I felt used, put down the cartridges, and went home to pout and brood over this.  It was shortly thereafter that I decided to enter an older world of shaving.  I ordered a Dovo Best Solingen straight edge razor, a strop, a Parker Badger Hair shaving brush, a nice pretty shave bowl, Art of Shaving Sandalwood soap in the pretty wooden bowl AND their shaving cream, and I waited.  (It&#x27;s an initial indulging investment that in the long run still leads to spending less than if you were buying replacement cartridges).  Upon receiving these products, I was eager to try them, and I suppose I went through the usual beginner fumbling though YouTube was once again a helpful resource.  I&#x27;m still enjoying and working on that, and it&#x27;s been months.  I enjoy it - time consuming, but it&#x27;s (as un-heterosexual as this might sound) kinda like pampering yourself.  Problem is, at least at this relatively early stage of less than a year&#x27;s experience with it, I can&#x27;t really rush the process.  If I&#x27;m in a hurry, I either grab the Proglide or quite possibly nick myself with the Dovo (which, by the way, I had to have sharpened - it really didn&#x27;t come shave-ready from Amazon, but I found a guy in the area who did it effectively for $5).  Well, I found out that a friend of mine got into straight edge shaving, and he said that when he&#x27;s in a hurry he uses a safety razor.  That&#x27;s what brought me to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He uses Parker razors in both cases.  I did some research and decided to invest in this.  NOTE: What I somehow had missed in my research is that this slanted head is generally not recommended for beginners for whom a straight head style is apparently less challenging.  I found that out slightly before this razor arrived in the mail, but decided to stick with it.  I have no regrets.  I was cautious of course, but really no issues, it was a breeze compared to a straight edge, and here&#x27;s the kicker: the results were surprisingly more comfortable than the Proglide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preparation is a big part of getting a good shave, and I&#x27;m still exploring pre-shave (I love the scent of the Art of Shaving Sandalwood line, but suspect that there are better options out there - any suggestions from anybody more seasoned?).  I also still haven&#x27;t run out of my &amp;#34;canned goo&amp;#34;, so what I do for now until I receive a few more things in the mail to try is apply some Aveeno Therapeutic Shave Gel (which I&#x27;d long ago determined to be the best performer of the &amp;#34;canned goo&amp;#34;) before getting into the shower.  At the end of a nice warm shower, I rinse it off.  Then I go through the usual routine with first applying the shaving soap to the badger brush and stirring that in the bowl, then adding in some of the cream.  After shaving, I applied two squirts of the Art of Shaving Sandalwood aftershave.  Again, I&#x27;m still sticking with the straight-edge when I can at ALL squeeze in the time, but what first struck me about this safety razor is good my face felt afterwards, both just in itself and to the touch.  I actually find it to be a WAY better shave than the Proglide, which I had been impressed with and content with if it weren&#x27;t for the price of the stupid cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had started off just frustrated over the price of cartridges for something that I was otherwise satisfied with though it was simply something I had to do, like brushing your teeth, ya know?  That brought me to a whole new world where I&#x27;ve learned that shaving can actually be an enjoyable pleasure that I actually look forward to and find not just the look but both the feel AND FEELING of the results to be enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have the experience to compare this to other safety razors, but while I can say that I&#x27;d like to eventually upgrade from my Dovo straight edge, I can also say that I am completely content with this safety razor and at least presently see no need to think ahead to trying any different ones.  This and a Feather blade are a combo that I have no complaints about and fully enjoy.  I hope anyone who reads my ridiculously long review here and decides to get this finds the same enjoyment out of it as I do (I also hope to get some suggestions about pre-shave, shave, and aftershave products relative to my affinity for the Art of Shaving&#x27;s sandalwood scent! - any, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve tried that, and if you like that scent but want a better performer, you should try these&amp;#34;?).</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have tried several DE razor brands but have come to realize that I love this DE razor above all the others. The handle is the right length and changing blades is extremely easy. I also don&#x27;t mind that it is a little heavier than my old DE razor. For those new to DE razors I offer this suggestion, experiment with different razor blade brands, since everyone&#x27;s face is different. Don&#x27;t just go with the sharpest blades on the market just because you might fall for the misconception that sharper will equal a closer shave. Also, it will take several shaving attempts before mastering the technique. There are websites out there that can help you perfect your technique and prevent your face from getting chewed up by the razor.</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for quite some time now and while I don&#x27;t consider myself the definitive expert I have tried quite a few of the tools that are available after you lather up. I have been on both ends of the spectrum from the gillette 56,000 blade system which is rediculously expensive for replacement blades and only gives a mediocre shave to the classic strait razor which was just a little too time consuming and nick prone for my liking. I am a traditionalist by nature and so have tried a number of the double edged razors like dad used to use.   The merkur is the best by far.    I like the heft of the HD and the long handle is great for a guy with big hands.  The blades are easily exchanged and once the mechanism is tightened down it does not come loose like some others I have used.  Overall fit and finish was excellent and it gives the closest shave so far.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband and now I need to get one for myself.  I had forgotten how close these razors shave.  My husband is MORE than happy with it.  He thanks me whenever he shaves.  great product.</li>
            <li> Handle provided had some rusted internal threading, &amp; the included razor was quite dull. Replaced the razor, but still took repeated passes if you weren&#x27;t daring enough to apply more pressure. Mach3&#x27;s, however pricey, can flex, &amp; still seem to provide a better shave on all but the most squared off jaws.</li>
            <li> This was my first double edge razor. I took to it pretty quickly so there is not much of a learning curve. It gives a pretty awesome shave, should order shop double edge safety razors like bic. I can&#x27;t believe I waited this long to buy this type of shaver. Long-term it&#x27;s cheaper buying the blades online as well as these shaving soap, then buying the cartridges from drugstores. It also gives a better shave.</li>
            <li> Built well, heavy.  Spirals weren&#x27;t machined as clean as I thought they would.  The best part about this razor is how it shaves.  A little more aggressive than I thought, but very close.  I tried a cheapo DE razor to see if I would like that style of shaving, then I decided this would be the next one.  I imagine this will work pretty good for a while now.</li>
            <li> Works well, and good quality.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I wanted... A solid feeling razor that has that little extra length in the handle. Keeps the blade secure and easy to swap out for a fresh one. I had another razor in my cart and after more research I ended up buying this one and I&#x27;m glad I did... This will last me for the rest of my life for sure...</li>
            <li> Out of my collection this razor is by far my favorite. Very comfortable and easy to load blade and clean.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. It shaves closer, face feels smoother longer , you gotta be a bit careful, but so what. It is so worth it. And once you get it, the blades don&#x27;t cost 12 bucks for 4 of them and only really give 3 or 4 good shaves. I go a week before changing the blade on this thing. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it</li>
            <li> The main reason I bought this razor was I was mad at Gillette always making a new razor that is the best, and the animal testing that they do. Back to the Merkur Hd Classic Safety Razor. I got it today I shaved with it and it was a awesome shave. It is Eco friendly and you can get DE blades from 2-5 dollars a 10 pack. You can hear the beard being cut as you shave. It gives a very Close, Classic shave. I really like it. I did not get cut and I did not have to go over the and over to get a close shave. I&#x27;m going to try it next time with shaving soap &amp; brush.</li>
            <li> this razor is sweet. i like the heavy feel of it in your hand. when i first got it i had to learn how to use it without leaving my face with a ton of nicks in it. it definitely gets a super close shave. a little expensive, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> First impression: it&#x27;s a beautiful thing and it feels well-balanced in the hand. I&#x27;m a woman, so I have a lot more real estate to shave than a man (just saying!). That also provides ample opportunity for a good long test drive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this razor to replace my [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor - #180 - Made In Germany]] and it&#x27;s definitely a step up from my old razor in both aesthetics and engineering. It is heavier than the #180, and probably on the heavier side of DE razors in general. Interestingly, while my old razor&#x27;s handle is diamond knurled  (a cross-hatch design carved up and down the pole, rather rough on my hands), this razor is only diagonal knurled (carvings in the handle run only one direction diagonally). So this razor handle is rather smoother. This will of course affect your grip. We ladies (or anyone who doesn&#x27;t do frequent manual labor) appreciate the absence of pointy diamond knurls in the #38c.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the adjustable screw in the base (non-blade edge) releases the blade assembly, allowing for greater safety and allowing one to control the level of hold over the blade. The only other razor I&#x27;ve used had a blade assembly that opened by twisting the whole assembly itself. That meant that if I placed too much pressure on the blade when shaving, I might twist the assembly to the side and loosen the blade. Not good! The #38c&#x27;s design ensures that that won&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s something you&#x27;d be proud to display, as compared with many more utilitarian designs (#180, I&#x27;m looking at you), and it&#x27;s a great work of engineering too. Full marks!</li>
            <li> Love this razor. There is so much less bacteria with safety razors than cartridge razors. I purchased the other two items to complete my whole new shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant upon buying this razor because I thought I was going to cut my own throat with it!  To my pleasure, I shaved with it for the first time and, WOW, it shaves as good if not better than the 2 and 5 bladed razors out there and for half the extended price! Not only was the first shave easier but it was enjoyable, almost as if I was back in the day, cheasy, yes, but true.  If you want a shave that is smooth, enjoyable, and easy, I would recommend this razor to anyone. I prefer the 38c hd as I am a man with large hands and like the weight of a solid razor, not plastic.  don&#x27;t be swayed by people who would have you believe that if you spend a few more bucks you can get a \\&quot;Futur,\\&quot; got news, same company and same style of shaving!  The question here is do you want a \\&quot;barber pole\\&quot; \\&quot;old style\\&quot; razor or a new smooth \\&quot;futuristic\\&quot; looking old style safety razor?  Definitley worth the expenditure either way, saves money in the long run, less garbage, and in fact recyclable!  Win, win for everyone.</li>
            <li> After searching reviews for a couple of months on razors I went with this one.  I love it. I got tired of paying the 4700% profit to Gillette and Shick for multiple blade razors that are nothing more than gimmics and don&#x27;t do the job nearly as well as a good safety razor.  I purchased Shark and Derby blades as well.  It seems as if the Derby blades are the best so far, lasting me a good 5-7 days.  I have a very thick beard and a terrible five o-clock shadow.  But now I don&#x27;t have that and my wife will attest to a super smooth face.  I use Poraso shave cream/soap with a good badger brush having tried the Col. Conks shave soap and a few others so far.  The Poraso seems to give me the most comfortable and close shave.  I wish they had it in a Bay fragrance.  I hear the Taylor of Old Bond Sandalwood is good soap too.  I usually finish with a splash of Old Spice and put a little post shave cream on my face after that.  I just prefer the Old Spice and Clubman&#x27;s to all the new expensive stuff.  Shaving is now fun and I feel and smell like I just had a refreshing professional barber shave when I walk out.      I have since purchased 2 Mekur long handled safety razors for travel bags but I still prefer the Mekur HD Barber Pole razor.  It&#x27;s heavy, well balanced, has a good grip, made to last a lifetime and delivers a wonderful shave with a good blade.  Little nicks may come for the first week or two if you are not used to this but it&#x27;s just a learning curve.  I rarely cut myself now.  Try this razor if you want to tell Gillette and Shick to shove their obscene profits where the lights don&#x27;t shine and get back into affordable comfortable shaving that will be sort of fun.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the razor but very seldom rate anything a highest level or lowest level.  I does meet my expectations very well.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor. I&#x27;ve been shaving with this for about a month now and it gives me a much nicer shave than today&#x27;s cartridge razors.  It&#x27;s also just more fun to shave with, especially if you throw in a shave brush (use badger, its better than boar) and real shaving soap. If you&#x27;re looking to make the switch from a cartridge razor to a DE razor I highly recommend trying this out</li>
            <li> After much research I am really happy to have purchased the Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic &amp;#34;Barber Pole&amp;#34; long handle classic razor.  My Father-In Law gave me a classic razor years prior, which I keep in my gym bag, and I really enjoy the close shave they give.  This one in particular is the perfect weight.  I thought I would want a short handle razor but I actually have more control with this one. The chrome is classy and the design is stylish.  I also like the cross hatch design on the handle for a firm control not slip grip.  If you are considering a classic razor I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this one deserved it just tried it today and it was great. Im used to Gillette andi got tired of the tugging and razor burn. There was no learning curve with this and I got a smooth results love the weight to it as well just the right size if you have big hands like I do.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as I sought an entry razor as I took up wetshaving this summer. I felt it would be appropriate to write a review before actually using the razor (I&#x27;m still waiting on soap to arrive) because so much of the actual shave&#x27;s effectiveness has to do with the correct blade choice, preparation, and technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has a great feel in my large hands. The handle is a little longer which I like, but it definitely isn&#x27;t too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cut/engraving (not sure how to describe it) on the handle is absolutely superb. It spirals downward and it has a sort of sharp cut to it (not sharp enough to cut you, but just for it to stay attached to your finger) that makes holding it a pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction is very nice. Changing the blade is simple, all one has to do is unscrew the bottom and pull off the top and slip a blade in. Merkur and its logo are engraved nicely at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor came in a box with a single Merkur razor blade. I would recommend getting a blade sampler as many people do not have success with the Merkur blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to shaving with this razor. If I ever have an opportunity to use another DE razor for comparison or if I run into any major problems with the construction of this razor, I will edit the review, but for now I am very pleased with the feel and look of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, now that I&#x27;ve used it for about two weeks- it&#x27;s great. Definitely buy into the hype. I have found that Shark stainless blades have worked better than Astra platinums, but I&#x27;ve yet to try out much more. The razor itself is great though. Good aggressiveness but not too much and like I said it&#x27;s got the ideal weight and feel for a strongish guy with big hands like me.</li>
            <li> I got fed up with 4 blade razors that are a product of marketing and not practical science.  Double edge safety razors are more effective. This razor has the weight and size of the more expensive Merkur razors.  The weight of the razor drives the shave - you don&#x27;t have to bear down on the razor - it glides over your beard.  Safety razors are more \\&quot;green\\&quot; - no plastic blades to throw out.  The steel blades are biodegradable.  Event better - get a badger hair brush and shaving soap.  No cans to throw away.  And the brushing action is good for your skin.  Finally - double edge razor blades are way cheaper than the \\&quot;modern\\&quot; blades.  If you want something a little smaller - get the Merkur Heavy Duty (shorter handle - slightly lighter).  I don&#x27;t like the other Merkur classic razors; they are too light and come apart in three pieces to change the blade.  This one and the HD are two piece.</li>
            <li> I bought the Weishi and I thought it was good but the Merkur HD is the way to go.  Imean there is no comparison!  Great Shave! Superlative product.  Don&#x27;t get anything else....Merkuur is worth the price!</li>
            <li> There are probably hundreds of double edge (DE) safety razors available, from antiques on eBay to present-day newly-manufactured razors. They are not all the same. Some people will go for:    - historical collector&#x27;s items  - luxury razors: gold plated, ivory handled, presentation cases, etc.  - gadgetry: various adjustables or clever mechanisms    This razor is not for any of those people (except perhaps to fill out the collector&#x27;s stable of razors).    If you are looking for something that is functional, well made (well enough to last several lifetimes, probably) and good looking then you have come to the right place.    This razor does have a couple of characteristics that differentiate it from other razors that the previous paragraph could just as well describe.    First, it is a bit heavier than most. Whether this is right for you is a matter of personal choice. I like the heft. If you want a similar, but lighter razor try the [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor - #180]].    Second, it has a longer handle than most. Again this is a matter of personal choice and perhaps the size of your hand. If you like the idea of a little extra heft but want a more traditional handle length, try the [[ASIN:B000QYEK88 Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor #34C]]. This one is so popular it has a nick-name: The \\&quot;Merkur HD\\&quot; (or in shaving circles simply the \\&quot;HD\\&quot;).    If you prefer neither the extra heft nor the longer handle, go for the [[ASIN:B000S5OK9E Merkur Standard Safety Razor with Bar #33C]].    If you prefer a real \\&quot;vintage\\&quot; look try the [[ASIN:B001LYAQCG Merkur \\&quot;1904\\&quot; Safety Razor 42C]].    Merkur also makes several other styles that may or may not be available on Amazon (you&#x27;ll have to Google them).    One negative point (but not negative enough to knock off that fifth star): The knob on the end of the handle used to open up the razor for inserting the blade is polished smooth and a little slippery so sometimes takes a little finagling to open up.    BLADES:    There are many DE blades available. The few you might find in your local drug store may not be suitable. Google for \\&quot;DE blade sampler packs choice\\&quot; to find a sampler pack with a large variety of blades. You can decide which you like. Be sure to get one of the packs with the Feather blades. Those are my favorite (so far, it could take a year to try everything). Oh, yes, the sample blade that comes with the razor is a Merkur. Merkur makes nice razors but they are not known (at least in a positive sense) for their blades.    WARNING!    If you start viewing the above razors with designations like 34C, 38C and 42C, Amazon will start showing you bras and womens&#x27; dresses as suggestions based on your browsing history!</li>
            <li> This is a great safety razor. It&#x27;s a good weight and holds the razor securely. I&#x27;m trying the razor it came with, but finding I prefer the Gillette razors. Other than that, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Well made heavy razor with a nice handle for my large hands.</li>
            <li> Wow! Just wow!!! LOVE IT!!! Have been shaving with it for a month or so.... This is my first safety razor and it&#x27;s GREAT!! Makes shaving enjoyable...&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you get the right blades for your face and I guarantee you&#x27;re gonna love it too! (I got the super sharp ones - feather, I think? - and shaving is just so good!)&lt;br /&gt;I also have huge hands so I can&#x27;t imagine using the smaller one. This one is just so right.</li>
            <li> Always liked Mekur. Nice shave in only two passes using Persona blue box blades. Nice weight. No need to push . let the weight of razor glide down you face. No nicks here.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Perfect handle length.  Impressive craftsmanship.  Classy look.  Ideal weight.  Good grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just used it for the first time with the included Merkur Platinum blade and got the best shave of my life.  I used Proraso shaving soap which is also good.  The sound you hear as the ultra sharp blade glides across your face is addictive.  You can hear the results!  It&#x27;s unlike anything you&#x27;ll ever get from a modern multi-bladed shaving razor from Gillete/Bic/Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave I just gave myself is as good or even better than a professional straight razor shave that I recently paid $35 for at a boutique barber shop.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver very much.  It works as advertised.</li>
            <li> A solid DE razor choice for everyone. Good grip, good angle, good weight and a longer handle for easy of use and precision. I&#x27;ve had it for about 8 years now and its the only one I use.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re someone that is coming straight from cartridge (think Mach 3) razors and looking to get into double edge razors stop reading and just buy this (along with a high quality badger brush, good soap/cream, and a blade sampler pack). This razor, when combined with good technique, will produce shaves that will exceed your wildest dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of build quality, this thing is built like a precision whisker-annihilating weapon. Not a luxury watch. The quality of the knurling and the heft of this thing leads me to believe it will probably outlive us all... even if you use it as a meat tenderizer. That said, it looks beautiful on the counter. The finish on all the parts isn&#x27;t as &#x27;immaculate&#x27; as on Mühle or Feather razors but then again it&#x27;s a fraction of the price and it shaves just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that if you&#x27;re an experienced shaver this guy tends to be on the moderate side even with a very sharp (Feather) blade. I have a lot of trouble getting a &#x27;baby bottom shave&#x27; on my lower neck even with an inordinate number of passes. So... if moderate razors (like the standard Merkur DE&#x27;s or the Feather Stainless) haven&#x27;t worked well for you I recommend opting for the adjustable Merkur Futur instead.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The extra weight is very nice. And gives a smooth shave. It also looks great on the bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to write yet another glowing review for this razor&#x27;s positive attributes as they have all been throughly covered by other reviewers. I replaced a Parker three-part razor after the threads wore out, and after a few weeks of use I&#x27;ve identified one slight drawback. The &amp;#34;barber pole&amp;#34; handle has a tendency to twist in your hand when wet and especially if you get some shaving cream/soap on your fingers. Since the knurling on the handle all runs in the same direction it acts more like threads on a screw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is only a very minor drawback to an otherwise excellent razor - however if I had known about this before buying I might have gone with a razor with a bi-directional knurling pattern.</li>
            <li> Great razor with great weight and longer handle!</li>
            <li> Great razor - I have no complaints - this razor is built much more solidly than my previous safety razor. It has through lose parts that screw together with a somewhat longer rod than some other models, which gives it strength. High reccomend it!</li>
            <li> Good razor, bought it to have a longer handle, but use it, I think the razor should be supplied with a cheap plastic case.</li>
            <li> My first DE was the Merkur 34c because that is the one that so many said to start with.  It gave me a good shave for using a DE for the first time, but my hand cramped up each time by the end of my shave.  I then tried what is called the Merkur model 180 in the US.  It was physically lighter than the 34c, and the shave was no quite as easy as the shave I got with the 34c, and it is a 3-piece razor.  I then tried the Parker 99R because I was hoping that the butterfly design would work for me so that changing blades would be easy.  Unfortunately the curve the doors formed on top was higher and made it difficult for me find the right angle for the blade to make contact with my face shape.  One review for the Merkur Model 38 Hd said something to the effect that it is similar to the Merkur 34c, but with a longer handle.  I found that to be the case.  I find the shave for me to be really good and it has a longer handle than the Merkur Model 34c, so I think this might be the one I stick with.</li>
            <li> I love tradition. This is a beautiful razor.  It&#x27;s nice and heavy, very high quality and archaeologist will probably find this razor in almost perfect condition somewhere a thousand years from now.  It does take some getting used to though, especially after 20+ years of pivot head razors that slime your face as you shave. It takes a bit more moisture and some finesse so there is a bit of a learning curve to using it.  Things to consider: Trying a cheaper model to see if its for you before buying an expensive model. Trying an adjustable model that may be easier on your face.  If you like this type of razor, it will pay for itself in a year over the multibladed, vibrating, slime your face with god only knows what type.</li>
            <li> Since that fateful day that my teenage self decided to start removing the hair from my nether regions, I have had problems. Now, I haven&#x27;t seen a wide enough variety of vaginas to know what the average hair growth is, but from what I have seen, mine is a bit courser than most. I&#x27;ve tried many types of cartridge razors, waxing, and Nair cream (Don&#x27;t. Just...don&#x27;t.), as well as a few different serums and creams for ingrown hairs. I exfoliate, moisturize, all the basic rules of thumb. I have NEVER found a system that prevents razor burn, irritation, or ingrown hairs. After I shave, I have to wait about a week before my skin calms down enough to shave again (with red bumps and ugly regrowth between).  It never crossed my mind to try a DE safety razor because, well, it&#x27;s kind of a guy thing. When I stumbled upon the concept, and saw that it&#x27;s touted for preventing razor burn, I did a bunch of research and ended up settling on this razor.  To be fair, I bought a whole system: This Merkur 38 HD razor A variety sampler pack of DE razors Proraso preshave cream in the White line for sensitive skin (smells a bit manly) Kiss My Face lavender shave cream  ...But, if you don&#x27;t want to go whole hog, the razor is the most important component of the system. I followed the Internet&#x27;s collective advice: keeping the skin taught, using multiple light, short strokes, first with the grain, then re-lather, then against the grain, rinsing it frequently, and always trying to keep the blade at a 30 degree angle from my skin. (However, I would suggest that you shave the real tight nooks and crannies -- where the sun don&#x27;t shine -- with your normal razor to avoid nicking yourself with this sharp blade.) Also used it on my underarms, which can get a tad irritated too.  In short, I&#x27;m blown away. I have never been this smooth. No pain. NO RED BUMPS. I hope that other frustrated ladies will read my review and benefit from this shaving revelation. It&#x27;s not just a guy thing!! *EDIT LATER: Although shaving is much less irritating now, this razor unfortunately did not prevent ingrown hairs :( So I still need to wait a long time between shaves (if I shave over ingrowns....MAJOR irritation).  I can&#x27;t recommend this particular razor over other DE safety razors, as it&#x27;s the first I&#x27;ve tried. This is more of a spot for wet shaving in general. But the overall opinion I&#x27;ve gathered is that Merkur is a really good brand, that many people prefer it over other brands, and that this particular model is one of the ones most recommended for newbies.</li>
            <li> Such a quality razor.  It will last a lifetime.  Excellent in every way.  Exactly as described.  Fast shipping.  A+++++  Great!</li>
            <li> I chose this safety razor because I have big hands, so I really have difficulties with those tiny things we use to find. When you&#x27;re shaving, you must have good control of the blade in your hands, otherwise you will be hurt. This Merkur is longer, heavy, has a good grip and it is very nicely finished. Shaving with it is quite safe and a pleasure. It has fit my hands like a glove, so it&#x27;s easy to avoid &amp;#34;bloodbaths&amp;#34;! Rs! I do recommend it, moreover if you&#x27;re a guy with big hands like me!</li>
            <li> I was going to order the old style single blade razor that the bald guy from pawn stars was promoting.I was tired of the cheap disposable junk razors that sliced up my handsome face and end up in a landfill.I also didn&#x27;t want to pay a small fortune for an 87 blade contraption.the electric razors seem like overkill and unnessessary.I looked into the razor from the pawn star guy comercial and discovered the merkur razors.I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to pay 20 bucks for a razor but ended up paying 55 bucks for the merkel barber pole razor.its well worth the money.its stainless steel with a chrome finish and feels very solid and durable.it doesn&#x27;t pivot like the multi-blade razors wich takes some getting used to, but makes shaving seem like a little bit more of an art.it gives me a pretty close shave and is easy to clean.I still get cut on occasion, but its a damn razor, what do you expect?I feel more manly using it as opposed to the cheap plastic disposables.it&#x27;ll be usable long after I&#x27;ve taken the dirt nap.</li>
            <li> I finally have found the secret weapon to shaving.  As  girl I have struggled with stupid razors never being sharp enough or last long enough.  They would also get clogged and be utterly useless. So I started thinking about the old barbers and how they shave men&#x27;s faces so close. That research let me to this glorious tool.  It is easy to put blade in and out  just screw the bottom.  It does not get clogged and if it does, just rinse or open a bit and rinse.  IT is only takes one or two strokes.  It is super sharp but I haven&#x27;t really cut myself at all.  It is heavier so it helps shave as you go, don&#x27;t need to drag it like most razors. Also the packaging is very minimal and the blades are biodegradable.  Takes one little investment and now i am set for a year of shaving.  I consider myself a pretty environmentally aware person so this fits me beautifully.  I knew their had to be a better way than to shave than what American society pushes at us...all that fifty million blade crap.  I am so happy with this product and almost want to keep it a secret to all the women out there just so that the price doesn&#x27;t decide to jump on the replaceable razors.  Heres to  happy shaving.</li>
            <li> I like the razor.  Double edge yields a marvelous shave.  And I totally love how cheap it is to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can add to what&#x27;s been said is this:  the weight of the 38 surprised me.  And the heft is in the handle,  not the head.  The one open question is whether I would prefer the 23c a/k/a  the 180,  which is about 1/2 the weight,  I believe.  My hands are large and shaped more like mittens than gloves, so the long handle is appealing.  But I just have this question about the weight.  It&#x27;s  not a problem  with the razor, just a preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose if I did it over,  I&#x27;d buy the 23c.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway,  I just wanted to mention that observation of the 38.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re talking about small degrees of difference, so enjoy whatever choice you make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I have since held both a 23c and a 34.  The 23c is a 3 piece, which I don&#x27;t like. (As I originally said, we&#x27;re talking small degrees of difference &amp; preference.  I just like the 2 piece design better).  As for the 34, for my large mitten shaped hands, it just felt too small in my hand.  So, I come back to the 38, which I&#x27;m slowly coming to love more and more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 4 years and love it. Nice close shave. Pick it up with some Shark Double Edge Razor Blades and free yourself from di$po$able razor hell...</li>
            <li> The first time I picked this razor up, I could tell it was well-made meant to last. Provides a great shave at a fraction of the cost of cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> Get this now. Works great, feels old-timey, and you&#x27;ll save so much $$$ not having to buy replaceable razors every few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this product over a year and have only had to order replacements blades just once (don&#x27;t shave everyday, but still!)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been using electric razors and disposable blades all these years, I&#x27;ve never had a better shave!</li>
            <li> The Merkur 38C is a wonderful razor; perfect weight, balance, and design. I even prefer it over my vintage 1958 Gillette Fat Boy. Spend a few bucks on a razor that&#x27;ll last you a lifetime, then stop paying the insane prices for cartridge refills. Add a badger brush, and a fine cream like Truefitt &amp; Hill, and you&#x27;ll have the perfect, enjoyable shave.</li>
            <li> GREAT Christmas Present! The receiver loves it and wont stop talking about it and how smooth his face is. Also says he only has to shave twice a week because it&#x27;s so good. Best Christmas gift I&#x27;ve gotten ever.</li>
            <li> Always wondered why my dad used a Double Edged razor, now I know! I purchased this razor a year ago and have enjoyed it ever since. I like the length of the handle and the extra weight . I used disposable razors in the past and there is no comparison in how close the shave is. The quality is top notch and I see no reason why it won&#x27;t last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Con: The razor is heavy so if your short handed and tire easy it may not be best for you&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Im a bald man with thicker hair still left on my scalp so i think the heavy weight works best for my type of head.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I have never really enjoyed shaving, in fact, I hated it. Now since I&#x27;ve found the Mercury 38, all of that&#x27;s changed. This is the best of the best. Stop wasting money on disposable blades and invest a little money on this and save a lot in the long run.</li>
            <li> It looks pretty.&lt;br /&gt;when we first got it, we hate it, really hate it .&lt;br /&gt;About 60 dollars for this metal thing, even though it looks pretty.&lt;br /&gt;However, it is been while, it does not rust or anything.&lt;br /&gt;It is really easy to cut if the blade is not the first time use.&lt;br /&gt;If you get a new blade, and with real care, you will not hurt youself.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to get used to, but the item is clearly well made and seems like it will last forever. Weights well also. It was my first safety razor and I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now with no complaints.</li>
            <li> This safety razor gets 5 stars anyday.  The build quality and the experience of using it is second to none.</li>
            <li> The end pops out and I cannot get it back together.  I have tried to contact Merkur but they have not replied.  I have tried other companies that sell Merkur&#x27;s and they also have not replied.  Basically you have a useless piece of metal because you cannot place a blade on the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, but no customer service.  I have replaced my Merkur with an Edwin Jagger and a Parker brand products.  Will no longer purchase Merkur products.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this model. Decent shave, but I hate how short and slick the handle is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean and perfect shave!</li>
            <li> Great shaver. It&#x27;s the perfect size. I was worried it would be too long but the size is what you&#x27;d expect if you&#x27;ve been shaving with a plastic razor.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Good price. Quality razor. I have been pleased with the quality and performance of this product. Chrome is quality, weight is right, and length is good. Many positive reviews of this product online and I now know why. Highly recommend. Will last a lifetime and then some.</li>
            <li> I researched DE&#x27;s for a week.  I picked this one after I got bleary eyed. In retrospect I probably could have done well with any of them. I had read so many reviews of dangers.  I have never even nicked myself.  My shaves are spectacular compared to Mach III.</li>
            <li> I am learning the skill of a double edge razor with this merkur and have to say I am loving it. People who are complaining need to watch more than a few video&#x27;s and you&#x27;ll see what your doing wrong. This isn&#x27;t for a fast shave, this is a Razor for a shaving experience. You got do a process. Hot towel your face for 30+ seconds, apply a pre shave oil if you got sensitive skin like me, Work a good lather with your shaving brush, lather up and shave with the grain. Then back to step 1 but when you get to the razor part go across grain. and then for the 3rd round I go against grain.  wash and pat dry. then after shave. and now a cold towel, this closes the pores. Tada... Baby face.</li>
            <li> Nice razor with a longer handle. The texture of the handle makes it easy to grip with a light touch. I have had good success with feather blades might try something different but these seem to work well for me.</li>
            <li> This is the first safety razor I have used in years. Got tired of the price of blades for our Mach razors. So glad I changed. Went slow at first just to refresh my memory on the angle but after that it&#x27;s like riding a bike, it all comes back to you.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made, quality razor.  It is heavy, but well balanced.  Great for those with heavy beards.</li>
            <li> The product is great but this is a gift to my husband and it was carelessly put in a bubble envelope that was smashed up when I received it. When I opened it, the razor box was smashed in so I have to figure out how I&#x27;m going to wrap it now. Should have been mailed in another box...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few years now and the only regret I have is that I bought it for $100 at a small store instead of $50 here on amazon.  It feels very solid and well built.  Personally I like having a bit of extra heft to it.  This one comes apart into two pieces when you unscrew it.  Some of the lower end Merkur models come apart into three pieces (the head is two pieces that you have to put together, which is annoying).  I also like the barber pole design, it looks classy and traditional.</li>
            <li> So after speaking with my barber I decided to look in to safety razors.  I have pretty sensitive skin and it seems that no matter how &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; (read:expensive) of a cartridge razor I tried I would always have irritation. After doing some research I found out that the multiple blade razors can actually cause more issues because you are essentially shaving each spot multiple times.  That was very interesting to learn.  After that I basically decided to jump in to the safety razor and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  This is an incredibly well built product and I&#x27;m sure it will probably out live me.  I also use a badger hair brush and Taylor of Old Bond Street Shaving Cream (also incredible, and smells better than any modern shaving cream).  In addition to all this safety razor blades are much cheaper than cartridges.  A bit of up front investment gets you a way better shave for a much lower cost.  For the first time in my life I look forward to shaving every day.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these razors in April 2013.  It&#x27;s now July, and I&#x27;ve used it to shave exclusively since then.  I&#x27;m not looking back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first safety razor, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but I know I love it.  I&#x27;m a big guy (6&#x27;6\\&quot;, 250 lbs) and I have huge hands.  I like the long handle, and I like the weight of the razor.  I have only cut myself once, and that was because I was being careless.  Day after day, week after week, I have been shaving with this razor and I am kicking myself for paying a fortune for plastic cartridge razors for so many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice to the newbie is to buy some quality soap (I like the stuff from Ogallala Bay Rum), a badger-hair brush, and read some FAQs online about shaving with a safety razor.  I also highly recommend Feather blades.  I now have enough Feather blades (purchased in bulk) to last me a lifetime, for less than the cost I used to pay for ONE YEAR of buying disposable plastic cartridges for $6.00 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is stainless steel.  I haven&#x27;t seen any signs of rust, and I get close shaves from it.  I love this razor.  I look forward someday to either passing this razor on to my son, or buying him one just like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who perpetually suffered from shaving with electric, cartridge, and disposal razors.  No amount of care in using the razors, or applying &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; creams, gels, or lotions, nor any amount of blade changes to make sure every edge was sharp helped.  He always ended up with razor burn, on his neck and chin.  It was by chance, due to our mutual affinity for anachronistic devices, that he came across the safety razor.  With all of the cash that had already been thrown at cartridges and razor changes, the price tag on this didn&#x27;t sting TOO much when considering that if it worked and held up that blade changes would only be pennies thereafter.  So he decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a learning curve that resulted in plenty of nicks and cuts, at first, but coupled with a good quality shaving soap, all of the razor burn and rashes were history from day 1.  It was amazing.  And once he got used to the razor (especially the weight), he was getting a closer, better shave than anything he had tried previously.  He&#x27;s been using this same razor now for several years, spending pennies on replacement blades, no longer dealing with skin irritations, and getting a better shave.  Obviously, not all &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; technology is better technology, because this has really done the trick.  He loves it; I love it, and it&#x27;s a solid as it was the day it was purchased.  Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Be careful not to cut your throat off, lol.  Awesome product.  With the right blades it&#x27;s a great shaver. 5 stars</li>
            <li> Anyone who wants a better shave,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur \\&quot;barber pole\\&quot; is an excellent investment. I am a first time DE shaver and I was a bit skeptical at first, but after trying the Merkur \\&quot;barber pole\\&quot; DE razor for the first time with the Merkur blade that came with the safety razor I will never return to the Mach 3 or any other cartridge razor again. I am in the military and need to shave daily. This process use to be a hassle every morning, but now I look forward to shaving. I would highly recommend this product or any Merkur DE razor. The quality was excellent with an all metal design that feels solid in your hand. Some Safety razors break down into three parts but the \\&quot;barber pole\\&quot; only breaks down into two which makes it easy to load new razors. Overall great product no complaints.</li>
            <li> Very high quality. Very pleased. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a safety razor for 3 years now it&#x27;s all I use to shave. I bought this to replace my Merkur 34c which is still in perfect order I just have large hands and thought a longer handle would be nice. There is a design flaw with this razor though or at the very least I got a defective model. When I received it I shaved the next day I had held off just so I could use the new razor when it came in I noticed the top cap on the razor extends too far covering too much of the blade which prevents you from getting a proper shave I did 3 passes and removed next to no hair on my face being very dissatisfied I decided to remove the top cap from my 34c and put it on this razor and instantly a world of difference it was shaving just as well as my 34c.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was excited to receive this razor and I like how the handle feels I can&#x27;t shave with it without replacing stock parts which makes it useless to me</li>
            <li> My friend recommended Merkur razors for their durability and high build quality. After looking at different models, I settled on the 38 HD Classic Barber Pole because of its simplicity: You unscrew the bottom and the butterfly blade guard opens for changing razors. That&#x27;s it. This is also non-adjustable, so you tighten the barber pole at the bottom snugly and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fit and finish is fantastic, living up to its heavy duty name. The razors are sharp and so inexpensive compared to the cartridges that it&#x27;s worth spending a little time learning to get a safe, close shave with the Merkur. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Nearly 3 years later and I&#x27;m happy to report no rust and same excellent build quality. I&#x27;m going to treat myself and buy the heavy duty Merkur 34c.</li>
            <li> Really a super razor! I bought this to keep at home and moved my 23C to my travel kit. I honestly never imagined i&#x27;d find a razor I preferred over the 23 without spending $100 but this one exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> Great razor, meets all expectations</li>
            <li> Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  Quality product.</li>
            <li> Feels so good in my hand and go pleased I made the purchase.  Only wish I would have made the switch from a triple blade years ago.</li>
            <li> This is a well-crafted razor. I love the quality and design are fantastic. My only grievance is that it is very short - even though this is the &amp;#34;Long&amp;#34; razor, the length is short. I like it that it is a heavy razor, but the &amp;#34;pole&amp;#34; is so short that it causes my hand to cramp. It is certainly well&#x3D;made and beautiful</li>
            <li> Everything I wanted in a razor! For top performance I used tag teamed it with the Japanese feather blades!&lt;br /&gt;The razor has a comfortable handle. The weight of the razor is on point.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after getting tired of spending so much money on modern razor cartridges.  My first shaves were horrible.  I have to admit that was me.  The razor has a stationary blade.  You have to learn to rotate the razor based on the contours of your face and neck and to not push the razor onto your face.  Let the weight of the razor be the pressure that is applied.  This comes with practice and blood.  I would not recommend trying this razor for the first time the day of a job interview or if you are going to be on TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten much better after several shaves (and watching some YouTube videos).  This gives me an extremely close shave and I can get away without shaving again for two or three days.  With the modern razors, I normally had to shave again the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is easy to clean.  Has a good weight to it (not too light or too heavy).  The handle fits nicely into my hand.</li>
            <li> It gave me an awesome close shave. The weight of it is perfect ...what a difference from the store razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been Double-Edged shaving for the last four years. I own the Merkur HD Classic 38C, along with six or eight vintage Gillettes, and have also expanded into straight-razor shaving as well (with some restored &#x27;seriously&#x27; antique razors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of all of the &#x27;classics&#x27; I own, the Mercur is absolutely my go to razor. It&#x27;s one of the few non-hightech gadgets I own, where &#x27;modern&#x27; has actually innovated some legitimate improvements over &#x27;classic&#x27;. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a reasonable heavy beard, and it took the old Gillettes and the straight razors to really teach me just how _well_ the Mercur does it&#x27;s job: I get through daily shaving pretty quickly (3-5mins tops) and I almost never cut myself or agitate my skin with the Mercur. A heavy contrast to my other razors (which can leave my neck feeling like sunburned hamburger if I&#x27;m not extremely careful). :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mercur is distinctively heavy in your hand - a feature that permits the razor to cut whiskers with almost no pressure. The razor&#x27;s own weight is generally enough to do the job, I just let it rest against my skin while lightly pulling it along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course, it&#x27;s built like a tank. I have no doubt that my son and grandchildren will be using this razor. I can&#x27;t say that about any TracII, Atra, flavor-of-the-week razor my Dad ever used. :D</li>
            <li> Very nice shave, happy with product</li>
            <li> The blades that come with the razor are like shaving with a lawn mower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor and &amp;#34;Personna Double Edge Razor Blades&amp;#34; give you a shave better than any disposable and the savings between this razor &amp; blades and disposable razors is gargantuan. There is no greater waste of money than buying disposable razors.</li>
            <li> This was more first safety razor and I have had no problem learning to use it.  I&#x27;d expected at least a few cuts but I&#x27;m a week in and no problem.  It&#x27;s easy to feel when the blade is at the correct angle and the shaves have been close and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very nice for the price. I am new in DE razors and this is a good starter</li>
            <li> So, a few years back I decided to give up the expensive and annoying cartridge/multi-blade razors like the Gillette Sensor Excel, blah blah. I read a lot online about options, and quite honestly, I remembered my dad&#x27;s old razor from when I was a little kid. (Back then, people didn&#x27;t freak out if you let your kid play with an empty safety razor in the bath tub to act like he was shaving!).&lt;br /&gt;I went the eBay route and figured that I should buy an older razor from that era because it was probably built better... or at least, built to last. I went through a few of them until I found what I liked in style, weight, and ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;Well, my son dropped my daily razor onto the hard tile floor in our bathroom and broke the mechanism. It was the familiar &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34; type of razor with two doors that open to expose where the blade sits. Since that was my primary razor, I went shopping for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I read a ton of reviews on Amazon (thanks, Amazon customers!) and decided that this razor would be a good fit for my hands, have good weight to it, and provide an excellent shave. I recalled seeing Merkur razors being made on the show &amp;#34;How It&#x27;s Made&amp;#34; and it was cool to know the work put into this thing. I was also very interested in trying a razor that did not have the typical butterfly opening mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;My first reaction to using this razor is that you don&#x27;t have to be a shaving connoisseur to be able to use the thing. If you&#x27;ve EVER shaved with a DE razor, you&#x27;ll be fine. Secondly, this thing cuts a close shave and feels awesome on your face. The weight makes the razor easy to hold, maintain an angle, and keep consistent pressure on your face... even on curves. You&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to make a cut or nick by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of blades, including &amp;#34;7am&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Merkur&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Astra Superior Platinum&amp;#34;, and others. They ALL shave well in this razor.&lt;br /&gt;This is, by far, a well-made razor... built to last... and it provides the shave you are probably looking for. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Be VERY careful using this blade. It&#x27;s very sharp but does an exceptional job for you when you shave! Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought a crappy Micro Touch thinggy from a commercial and thought, hey I want to try that. I wanted to find an alternative to expensive multi razors so I bought a cheap razor to learn how to shave with a DE razor. I then started doing multiple searches online to figure out techniques and what razors were good/bad and the same for the blades. I had no idea how many different types there were. So through my research I find that Merkur makes really good quality DE razors. The difference between the blade I bought off the commercial and an actual piece of quality is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the blade itself. The heft is the first thing I noticed right away, more than doubled of that cheap thing I bought. The long handle makes it feel more familiar, like a modern razor feels. And the ability to manuever the blade was exceptional. The blade came with a Merkur blade, which is OK, I&#x27;m still going through the exploratory phase of what blades I like and don&#x27;t like. But for a practice run with this razor allowed me to figure out how to use the weight of the blade and not maul my face. I absolutely love this razor! Its a beautiful 3 piece stunner of a shaving machine, a work of art! Now I just need to hone my technique and find the perfect blade for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a razor everyone should keep in their arsenal, especially if you have a thick beard or stubble, or like me, a thin stubble , but goes in every direction. The weight of the razor almost eliminates the need to go over and over the same spot, less likely to shred your face too.</li>
            <li> You can shave with this.</li>
            <li> The Barber Pole is well made and very functional.  Decided to go back to the old way of shaving because the results are comparable to the new devices and over time will save money on shaving.</li>
            <li> I got tired of paying $15 for four Venus refill blades so I made the switch to this razor. It took a little getting used to but I love it. I paid $25 for 100 blades, which will last me a few years. It&#x27;s a great shave and not just for men to use. I&#x27;ll never go back to the expensive plastic razors and blade refills.</li>
            <li> This is the first DE razor I&#x27;ve ever used... and I&#x27;m thinking will be the last razor I&#x27;ll ever need. I&#x27;m new to \\&quot;wet shaving\\&quot; and have been using cartridge disposable razors my entire adult shaving life... I&#x27;m over 50 years old... and have been shaving since I was 15. I have always had bumps and acne problems and always thought it was just me and my oily skin condition... until I talked to my dermatologist a couple of months ago.    The doctor suggested that I try wet shaving and told me that many men who have bumps and acne... is the direct result of ingrown hairs due to using a muti-bladed cartridges, cutting the hairs off too close to the skin or worse... pulling the hair away from the skin and cutting it off below the surface of the skin... causing ingrown hairs and acne.    So I took the doctors advise and did some research on wet shaving and the many \\&quot;how to\\&quot; videos of shaving with a DE bladed razor. I have big hands and felt that the smaller handled razors were difficult to hold on to... and I was use to the larger handled heavy cartridge razors... so after reviewing several razors on the Internet... I chose the Merkur Model 38 HD \\&quot;Barber Pole\\&quot; long handled razor.  Right out of the box... the razor looked like a very well crafted piece of equipment! (German made) Heavy metal construction... felt good in my hands. The knurled handle helped me grip the razor, even when my hands were wet. The weight of the chromed razor head... worked like a champ as it glided across my face... cutting my whiskers... while letting the weight of the razor do all the cutting... with hardly any added pressure from me.    After a small learning curve... shaving with a DE razor... I found that I now look forward to shaving in the mornings... the routines that I now use, and my Merkur 38 HD \\&quot;Barber Pole\\&quot; DE razor... is the major part of my morning shaving experience. After several weeks wet shaving... I&#x27;ve noticed that my bumps and acne... have almost completely cleared, and my face feels much better all thru the day!     I will never return to the muti-bladed disposable cartridges again... and my new Merkur 38 HD \\&quot;Barber Pole\\&quot; long handled razor, is one of the reasons I&#x27;m now a new wet shaver convert!</li>
            <li> I allways intended to get a better razor, but I never saw anything in the drug store that was all that different from the Atra cartridge that I was useing.I knew there were dbl edge razors out there but I had no idea how great they work and how nice they look. It was the user reviews that got my attention, and they are correct. I purchased the Axis package, Merkur 38 HD long handle Barber Pole razor, along with the Itailion shaving cream and the razor blades from Japan.The Merkur 38 is beautiful to look at and has a great heafty feel. I never had a better shave. It takes some getting used to but is not at all difficult. I like not putting plastic cartridges in the trash. The Merkur shaves great, looks great, cheaper to use and is better for the environment. I could not be more pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> What can I say. It&#x27;s a Merkur razor.  As with all Merkur razors the German engineering shines through.&lt;br /&gt;The 38 HD comes with both the barber pole design handle as well as a longer handle them you would get on a 34 -c. This is a greart razor for men with sensitive skin. It falls into the mild to medium range for aggressiveness. If you want a more aggressive razor this will still fit your requirements just use a more aggressive blade.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering the all chrome model, but the 38 HD with the center black handle arrived. Looking at it its the same razor except for the black handle in the center. There does not appear to be anything on the box to indicate chrome or black handle model so I either order incorrectly or the order fulfillment did not know the difference picking it off the shelf. This is a heavy hence the &amp;#34;Heavy Duty&amp;#34; razor not the cheap kind. It appears well made and I decided to keep the black handle one. Looking at the picture of the black handle online I would not have purchased it, but in person it looks very stylish and does not slip when wet.  Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as a back up to my Edwin Jagger DE89 which I love, and this has now become my favorite razor. At first, I was disappointed having installed the Merkur DE blade that the razor came with. I had to make multiple passes, and didn&#x27;t find the razor effective. I know different blades work for different people, so I swapped out the Merkur Blade and installed a Feather blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next shave was completely different- awesome, much like my EJ89 delivers. What I like better about this razor though is the, longer handle, the handle has a better grip than my smooth chrome EJ89, and what I like the most is the weight of this razor. While I like the EJ, if I had to do it over again I&#x27;d spend the extra $15 and buy the Merkur 38HD and skip the EJ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is also similar to the EJ in that it seems to be a forgiving razor, maybe more so without sacrificing closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 12/30/13: I&#x27;ve read that the chrome will start to chip off within a year, and that Merkur will not stand behind their product. If anything like that happens, I will be sure to update this review and rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 2/5/2014: I also own a 1960 Gillette Fat Boy Adjustable, and a &#x27;65 Gillette Slim Adjustable. I&#x27;ve toyed with every setting on those two razors, and the Merkur is the winner for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9/2015: No chipping or flaking of the chrome. I also prefer this over the Muhle r41. The handle is heavier on the Merkur, and the weight of the razor is more effective in shaving. Persona Blue blades work really well for me with the Merkur.</li>
            <li> Great product. It is not as heavy or rugged as a previous model I owned.  However, it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I just switched back to this type razor, its been years since I&#x27;ve used one. I think it gives a smoother and closer shave and less irritation then the mach3 I was using. The blades are a lot less exspencive, some of the old ways are better.</li>
            <li> The Merkur brand has a good reputation, and because of the name I expected something a little better.  Perhaps heavier, or something.  It is just OK, which makes it overpriced.  It should also come with more than one blade, especially at that price.  Can not buy the Merkur blades in the town I live in and generics just aren&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> Other than being expensive I love the Merkur razor. The Mercedes of razors I suspect, with German styling and engineering. Functions well, as good of or perhaps the best shave as I&#x27;ve ever had even with those 4, 5, or 6 blade or whatever Fusion razors that have replacement blades costing over $5 each and lasting only a few shaves. No nicks or cuts which I thought might be an issue with a safety razor. Get one, it will be the last razor you need.</li>
            <li> This razor is extremely comfortable, perfect weight distribution - my face definitely feels the difference a great product can make!</li>
            <li> This razor is life changing. It works. Extremely well. You should buy it now:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Amazing shave! Better than any terrible razor you can purchase at your local grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;* Replacement blades are cheap. 100 for $10 and they&#x27;ll last you for several shaves each.&lt;br /&gt;* It will save you $233,551.09 over the course of your life. This assumes you buy this razor at the age of 20 and live until 80 and invest the $10/month in the stock market at a 9% interest rate. Bam!! You are $233,551.09 richer on your death bed. Beat that!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want to be filthy, dirty rich or bang the hoes so your just a filthy dirty d-bag, purchase this razor.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor and I love it. I have been using it for a few months now and will not switch be switching back to disposable razors ever again! I really like the weight in the handle and even thought the description says long handle, it&#x27;s not too long at all.</li>
            <li> Great Weight, smooth cut and well worth the money. This is my second safety razor and by far my favorite. With the added weight to it, it cuts through thick hair with ease. I think the best part about it is that the head screws on via the base of the handle. Simply put the blade on the head, then place the threads in the handle and then twist the butt of the handle. That simple. A very well thought out design for something so classic.</li>
            <li> Very nice shaver. Well balanced and when used with the Feather blades will provide the closest shave possible.</li>
            <li> My husband is very please with the razor.</li>
            <li> Great weight and length of handle. I love this razor.  Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic razor. I&#x27;ve always had a hard time getting a close shave with other modern multi-blade systems. I&#x27;ve been shaving every other day for the past 14 years and I tell you, I can&#x27;t be happier since switching to this razor. With that said, I had a couple of weeks of consistent nicks and cuts on my neck region. It takes a little time to adjust the style of shaving and amount of pressure you need to apply to cut the hair when switching from modern razors to the old fashioned way. Since then, I&#x27;ve perfected the technique and no longer have any nicks or cuts during shaving. So, definitely take your time and becareful / ready for a couple of small cuts in the first weeks of usage. Other than that, the build quality is excellent and I&#x27;m confident nothing will happen to it for years to come. If you have been looking for a better shaving experience, this might be the way to go. It will add about 10 minutes to your shaving routine but it&#x27;s well worth it. Old timers like my grandfather used this type of razor and men before him for hundreds of years for a reason; it get&#x27;s simple, reliable and get&#x27;s the job done. You have the option of picking which blades works with your skin type best. You don&#x27;t need 3,4,5 or more blades to shave. One sharp blade is enough. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> First de razor I have purchased...never going going back. Best shave I have ever had.  Way cheaper than those expensive 18 bladed, twisting, vibrating garbage razors also.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor to start my DE razor adventure. I love the heft and size of this razor. To be honest there was virtually no adjustment from using a cartridge razor to using a DE razor for me! Don&#x27;t be afraid to get the closest shave of your life! I will never go back to my cartridge razor! Shaving really is something I look forward to now!</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing. It seems to work well with all the different blades I have used. I have a fairly thick beard and it gives me an incredibly close shave without a single nick. It seemed to work best for me with the sharper blades, but that may depend on your personal preference and beard. The weight is well balanced and feels proper in your hand. The overall appearance is appealing and classic. I also purchased a Parker razor to try out a different brand, albeit the travel version, and the material and build quality are poor. This not only leads to an eventual disposal, but also uneven pressure on the razor and a shoddy dangerous shave. I will be replacing that one with a Merkur.</li>
            <li> I like this razor a lot, only thing i would say is a &amp;#34;checkered&amp;#34; grip as opposed to a barber pole style would give a better hand grip when wet, tends to feel like it wants to spin,lol but i gout used to it and it gives me great shaves without spending a literal fortune on the blades i was buying before..you know, 5 in one cartridges etc , slow down and learn to shave again, you&#x27;ll get a clean shave and have money left over to afford to eat lol:)</li>
            <li> Bought this, the Escali beaver brush and stand, the Senna shaving soap and 50 silver blue DE razor blades, and have been thanked ever since. The grin I witnessed from someone who ordinarily hates hates HATES shaving and was using an electric and a Gillette Fusion Power with the fortune in replacement blades was worth everything and the finish? Glass smooth, no nicks, no cuts (or I&#x27;d have heard the squealing and seen the hand wringing). Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a heavy razor, especially compared to little disposables, but apparently that weight really does mean there&#x27;s no need to push down at all. I actually tried running it across my own face hairless though it may be and I couldn&#x27;t actually tell whether the blade was on it or not. Even when showed the exact angle to have it at, it still didn&#x27;t even feel like it was doing anything. But it most certainly does. I can see someone really cutting the bejesus out of themselves if they tried, but it just didn&#x27;t seem that hard to use at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction is solid and it is really pretty. Looks totally vintage and super expensive. It comes apart very easily into two pieces by twisting the knob at the bottom and you just put the blade in and tighten it down. I thought it would be longer. Looking at it, I have to wonder what the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;short&amp;#34; handles look like. This one seems perfect, even when I was holding it with small hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits perfectly in the Escali stand btw. I don&#x27;t know who on here was down-voting it because it was too long for his stand but he must have bought his particular stand in Lilliput because this razor&#x27;s handle is about 2 1/2&amp;#34;-3&amp;#34; short of the base of the Escali stand I bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone looking for a great razor would do well to give this one a try!</li>
            <li> REplaced parker razor this razor seems to be better quality and gives better shave,  im glad i ordered it.</li>
            <li> I gave as a gift and it is well liked.  I am told the balance is great and it looks nice.</li>
            <li> I recently converted from a Schick Quadrillion (because more blades is better--right?) to a safety/double-edge (DE) razor, and I settled on the Merkur 38HD after reading reviews. So glad I made the change. First, note that the &amp;#34;Barber Pole&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Long&amp;#34; description only applies relative to other DE razors: compared to a cartridge razor, the 38HD&#x27;s length is totally normal. Apparently, many other safety razors are considerably shorter that the 38HD, so for a convert like me, going from a cartridge razor to the 38D was pretty normal in terms of handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the heft of the 38HD. I&#x27;m sure this razor will last me a lifetime--the construction just seems so good.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Merkur razor to cut down on the expense of modern razor cartridges.  I read previous reviews on different models and the best blades to use.  Here is my take on the razor.  The design is very nice and the razor is built very durable.  I purchased Feather razors and these things are wicked sharp. The major drawback of this razor as compared to modern razors is the lack of a pivoting head.  This made shaving under the nostirls, around the lips, and the trasition of cheek to neck difficult.  I conducted several shaves and at best I was left with an uneven shave.  Technology has the advantage over this razor.</li>
            <li> Good, mild shave.  A keeper</li>
            <li> When I purchased this almost a year ago I was new to the art of shaving like a man. Before I had shaved using girly battery powered devices. I now enjoy shaving. I rarely cut myself. This is worth every penny. I found it to be a great starting off razor and so far I have found no need to purchase another. It is simple to operate and has not altered in form or function since day one. I use Wilkinson&#x27;s Sword blades which I am able to find in local drug stores or (ugh) in walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it enough that I just purchased more for Christmas gifts this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;switched to Feather Hi-Stainless razor blades. Much better performance than the Wilkinson&#x27;s swords, but can&#x27;t be found locally. Luckily Amazon sells them in bulk.</li>
            <li> I just had to write a review about this product, which has made me a lifelong subscriber to the DE community.  Basically, for six years I have been using the [[ASIN:B000143C0K Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer]] that was given to me from my grandfather as a \\&quot;becoming a man\\&quot; gift.  Now at age 23, I am guilty to say that I have been using these same clippers to shave and trim up after I cut my hair(I&#x27;m very good at it).  It was just time to graduate and enter the wet shaving market to satisfy my needs.  Many of my friends, and colleagues recommended that I get one of the market(Mach 3, Norelco etc...) razors with 3-5 blades because it fit their description of how to properly shave.  The problem with that is, that I got razor burn really bad when my ex girlfriend bought one for me a few years back...I hated it because the next morning my face looked like a burn victim(no offense).  So, I was searching on Youtube one day and stumbled upon geofatboy&#x27;s videos that showed me how to shave properly and showcased many different versions of safety, and straight razors.  I ended up with this model and I must say that this has been the best shave of my life literally.  Normally, when I go out in public I receive comments on my shave from many women...but deep down I know that it is a terrible shave to say the least.  Now, I feel like \\&quot;Baby Face Nelson\\&quot; with the quality of shave that I received from the [[ASIN:B000RJUZMW Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic \\&quot;Barber Pole\\&quot; Long Safety Razor]].  I recommend anyone who had the same problems with ingrown hairs, razor burn, and lackluster shaves to try out this razor...you will not be disappointed.  Also, check out geofatboy(free advertising) on Youtube for great shaving videos to help young guys like me to learn how to properly shave like our grandfathers used to.</li>
            <li> My first razor of this type and it shaves really well.  Fits and fells good in the hand.  I bought this because I was sick an tired of buying the expensive Mach 3 blades.  Boy I am I glade I got this.  I Think this does just as good of a job as the others at a fraction of the cost. There is a little of a learning curve to using this style of razor, just go slow and take your time the first couple of times and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for ~8 years and bought another for my teenage son who just started shaving. We both have very large hands and struggle with the pencil-thin handles on regular razors. A well made product and well worth the money considering the low price of replacement blades.</li>
            <li> In the long run when I finally learn how to do it right I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll prove to be cheaper than my multi-blade setup,  but in the mean time I&#x27;m really aggravating my sensitive skin with this thing...  especially on my neck</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice weight, feels good in the hand (not too long or short) and looks nice as well. Love it.</li>
            <li> Awesome safety razor and gives a perfect smooth shave every time! I ordered two of these and two Merkur 23c safety razor&#x27;s and all four of them had deep scratches on them! I am still trying to order one that is perfect but I doubt it will happen.. One of the workers at Merkur is scratching the razor&#x27;s with their tools or something but I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with this. The razor is a 3 piece safety razor where as the handle slides out of the razor and the head unscrews from the handle that slides through the razor. It&#x27;s a awesome setup and easy to clean. It&#x27;s very heavy, solid and has a good grip to it! It&#x27;s a beautiful razor and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is typiclal German engineering!&lt;br /&gt;If you learn to use it properly, you will never get a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;There are many demonstrations on YouTube to help the first time user of a DE razor.</li>
            <li> This was not my first D.E. razor, but it is my favorite. I started D.E. shaving a few months ago and I really got into it. I will never go back to the cartridge razor again. This is a solid product it gives a great shave when paired with a great razor, (Astra) for me.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased their competitors razor first and I was quite happy with that one as well. However, the heft and the slightly longer handle of this razor gives me a closer shave and is more comfortable to hold. I used to dread shaving but with some Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream, my super badger brush and this razor; It is a relaxing pleasure.</li>
            <li> Have yet to use this Merkur 38c HD. My first impression of this razor is that it&#x27;s very well made with the finest materials. It&#x27;s got some nice heft to it and features a nice longer handle for us bigger handed guys. I read some negative things about the Merkur razor it comes with, so we&#x27;ll see how that goes. I bought a 100pk of Astras based on the good reviews and price. I&#x27;ll review those later. This razor is very nice, nice packaging and arrived in a few days. I&#x27;ll edit this once I shave with it.  EDIT: Okay so I just had my first shave with the Merkur. I got cut up pretty bad on my cheeks and especially the neck area. Even after a hot shower and a nice lather. I have very sensitive skin so getting nicks and cuts has always been an issue for me when shaving. I love the razor handle itself, but felt the Merkur brand blade is came with sucked! It wasn&#x27;t that sharp and had a little drag. I&#x27;m still new to wet shaving and shaving with a safety razor, so I still have to find my technique. I&#x27;d recommend buying a pack of blades with this Merkur 38cHD. The razor is nice to hold and it&#x27;s heavy enough to do the work for you, no pressure needed. Do I recommend? Absolutely. I think it&#x27;s a razor everyone who enjoys wet shaving or people who are new to it like me, should have.</li>
            <li> It is a nice, heavy razor - my first DE safety razor. It does get a little slippery. I&#x27;m thinking I might prefer a lighter razor, but it&#x27;s only been a month.</li>
            <li> I have spend a solid 2 weeks researching safety razors, as well as straight edge razors and shavettes. before i get a straight edge, i felt this would be a good stepping stone to replace my fusion, as for i want to shave like they did in the olden days. problem is, i also shave my head, so it will take more getting used to this (let alone a straight edge) than if i were just shaving my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i decided to go with this one for 3 vital reason, the weight, the longer handle, and reviews said it was &amp;#34;more forgiving&amp;#34; than others, so good for a beginner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;boy is this thing heavy! i mean, its not &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;, but after holding a plastic gillette fusion (or mach 3, or whatever it was at the time), you can feel the weight. i wanted a heavy one because i believed the weight would help with the cutting of the hairs, rather me pulling to cut the hairs, and i found this to be true. i have big hands, so the length is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it on my head yet, but ill update this when i do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because i am finding it difficult to get a closer shave compared to the 4 bladed fusion i used to use, so my deduction of 1 star is at no fault of the product, rather the &amp;#34;idea&amp;#34; of a DE safety razor. I am sure that once i get used to the idea of &amp;#34;hair reduction, rather than hair removal&amp;#34;, i will learn to love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase. Price is fairly reasonable as well, especially knowing that I no longer have to pay $2.50 per fusion cartridges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to DE shaving, i also recommend getting one of those &amp;#34;DE sample blade packs&amp;#34; so see which blades you like the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this was helpful!</li>
            <li> Solid and built to last. I&#x27;ve read reviews stating that it&#x27;s easy to nick yourself. I haven&#x27;t had a problem except for the time I didn&#x27;t tighten the blade holder tight enough. I use it with Feather brand blades.</li>
            <li> Top quality razor. Fast shipping. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Can you save money, time, and the environment with a razor?    I bought this razor after struggling for months to find refills for my 3-blade razor with no interest in buying a new 4-blade or vibrating razor. Without trying to sound like a conspiracy theorist, I realized I was being manipulated by clever marketing. Did another blade or a vibrating feature really make a better razor? I didn&#x27;t think so. On top of that, Women&#x27;s and Men&#x27;s razors are identical except for color, yet Women&#x27;s razors always cost more. I was ready to opt out of the system!    I remembered my mother&#x27;s double-edged razor and realized it was not so long ago that no woman thought if she didn&#x27;t \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; her razor, she wouldn&#x27;t get a good shave.    I took a chance on this product, and it was the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time. I&#x27;m saving a lot of money on expensive and elaborate refills, I&#x27;m creating less waste (refills aren&#x27;t encased in plastic and are 100% recyclable - drop off at an art store with blade recycling. DON&#x27;T put in your pick-up bin), I&#x27;m saving time shopping for the refills, and still getting a high quality product. And I&#x27;m sending a message to the shaving industry that I don&#x27;t want their pricey 20-blade razors. What could be better?</li>
            <li> News Flash...2008.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor Scientists have developed a radical new razor called the DE or \\&quot;Double Edge\\&quot; Razor.  This futuristic, yet elegant, device is made of durable metal instead of the usual plastic and it is machined so well that it would be possible that a single DE Razor could last the average shaver a lifetime.  This new shaving device uses amazing \\&quot;mono blade\\&quot; technology that delivers a shave as close as the finest multi-blade cartridge system,  but the blades are completely bio-degradable and have a tiny \\&quot;carbon footprint.\\&quot;  By a stroke of pure genius the replacement blades will cost about a tenth that of a classic cartridge and will actually provide two complete edges, in essence giving you two blades for the price of one.  Since there is only one cutting surface you no longer have to worry about clogging the razor head with hair and shave cream and the DE Razor is less likely to cause bumps and other skin conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An excellent example of this stunning new DE Razor technology is the Merkur Barber Pole DE Razor.  Excellent construction, fine finish and craftsmanship combined with real heft and retro styling make this razor a real winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most state of the art technology, there is a slight learning curve when using this powerful device.  The razor does all of the work, so don&#x27;t apply any pressure and take short strokes instead of the long ones that you were using with current old-style cartridge system razor.  Your small efforts will be rewarded with the knowledge that you are not only more \\&quot;green\\&quot; but you also have the latest new tech toy on the block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a related story, shaving researchers have created a solid shaving lubricant called a shaving soap puck.  This highly concentrated pellet can provide at least as many shaves as a can of shaving foam and doesn&#x27;t use propellants or a steel aerosol can.  Foam is created by simply whisking a wet puck with a soft and long life \\&quot;shaving brush\\&quot; which is then used to apply/massage the foam on the users face.  The system is so sophisticated that unused foam is automatically recycled to be used for the next shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FACT???  FICTION??? FANTASY???  OUTRAGEOUS EXAGERATION???&lt;br /&gt;Well, it is all true, but the basic design wasn&#x27;t developed in 2008, it was developed over 100 years ago and it is likely that your grandpa and possibly your dad used it.  Stop paying $3 for a razor cartridge.  Put that cash in your pocket and give the Merkur Barber Pole DE razor a try!users face.

            <li> After trying the Weishi toy razor, I traded up to the Merkur 38C.  What a difference!  The Weishi had been recommended for novice DE shavers, so it seemed like the safe choice.  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t realize that it is ill-equipped to handle coarse, thick beards.  After a couple of days with the Weishi, I threw it into the drawer and there it has stayed.    The Merkur 38C was highly recommended by Giovanni at Barberia Italiana and it has proven to be a wonderful piece of gear.  The German razor appears well made and well finished, so the price seems quite reasonable.  The size and shape of the handle and head make shaving easy (at least in my large hands) and the weight is perfect.  Despite my novice DE shaving status, I have no problem with very close, comfortable shaves with very rare bloodshed.    I have tried an extensive blade sampler from Barberia Italiana and have found the Personna blades from Israel to be ideal for me.  Strangely, I actually enjoy and look forward to shaving with the Merkur.    Hope this is helpful.</li>
            <li> Decided to convert to a DE safety razor from many years of using cartridge razors on a whim. I have to say it took me about 2 weeks to get used to it. Now I am able to quickly give myself a better shave than previously without any cuts or burn. I have been using the Merkur razor blades with it and I find they last at most 5 shaves. All in all a better shave than a cartridge razor and much cheaper in the long run</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, heavy, reliable, with good grippage.</li>
            <li> Solid, heavy. Feels good in hand. Smooth threading. Feels and looks the way things used to be made.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for almost a year now.  While there was a learning curve for its use, driving on through that learning curve has proven to be worth it.  This is the only DE razor I own.  In fact, I&#x27;ve never even used a DE razor before so I can&#x27;t speak to how it compares with other razors on the market.  That being said, I like this razor.  Having decided to get into wet/DE shaving, I researched many different razors.  Based on my findings, I felt this one would be a good one to start with.  Although I may eventually want to buy another razor, I see no reason to do so as of now.  The Merkur 38HD has met and surpassed all my expectations.  It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t scalp my face.  I like the longer handle because it&#x27;s roughly the same size as the handle of the razors I&#x27;ve been using the past 25+ years.  It&#x27;s thick enough to grip well but not so thick that  it&#x27;s cumbersome or clumsy.  With every blade change I simply take some baby wipes or tissue paper and rub it clean - very low maintenance.  This razor shaves so close, I don&#x27;t get five o&#x27;clock shadow until five o&#x27;clock!  With past razors I would get five o&#x27;clock shadow about noon.  If I had it to do all over again, I&#x27;d buy this razor without any second thoughts.</li>
            <li> I got this one and the long handle one. Both are great in respect to expectations, results and feel. Still this one is more precise due to close up and weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave reinvented! It is a mark of one man&#x27;s self esteem.</li>
            <li> I do not see why all men are not using safety razors these days.  This thing with the feather blades shaves closer than anything I have ever experienced. How can you NOT afford to switch to a safety razor? Blades being less than $.50 each where my Gillette Fusions were about $3.00 each?  This razor, a brush, Williams shaving soap and after shave cream make shaving a joy again and a rewarding experience.</li>
            <li> After over 20 years of cartridge razors, I decided to try a DE razor.  I love it!  I have larger hands and the long handle gives very good control.  Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Very solid, if a tad heavy.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a couple of months and it works great.  I switched from using a brand name 5-blade shaving system to this razor.  After using the razor just a few times, I was able to master the technique to hold the razor properly to get it to shave properly.  I am now able to produce as good of a shave with this razor as I was getting from the $5 a pop cartridge of the 5-blade shaving system.</li>
            <li> Safety razors are new to me, even though I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve used electrics (ugh) and then the usual assortment of Store Brands, Gillette&#x27;s, Bic&#x27;s and the like for years, graduating from the good old Twin Blade to three, four and five blades and in bad economic times, the cheapie single blade throw-aways. So, for many years I&#x27;ve had adequate shaves.  According to the commercials and the ads, the first blade of the multi-blade razors lifted the hair, the second blade cut it cleanly. I have no idea what the remaining blades did. Wait...they collected hair and they emptied my wallet. The cost of replacement &#x27;cartridges&#x27; (sounds like buying bullets) is out of this world. I should&#x27;ve bought stock in these companies long ago.&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this safety razor simply out of curiosity. My rationale is: Why not spend some extra money on what has been reviewed and recommended by many, many customers as the best thing they&#x27;ve ever shaved with instead of spending a lesser amount of money for a handle and a lot of money for &#x27;cartridges&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I bought the Merkur shaver and extra blades and have shaved twice with it. The first time was the experiment. There&#x27;s a technique, that in my opinion is quite easily mastered. The bit under the lower lip is a bit tricky, at least for me, and the neck area is work in progress.  Just go slow. Second shave was fine, much easier.  So, I&#x27;m good with the whole new old-fashioned style of shaving. I used cheap Barbasol aerosol cream, but will probably move on to the mug and brush gig later on, as it&#x27;s supposed to be the better way to a cleaner shave. Sounds like a commercial, eh? Probably is.&lt;br /&gt;End of story: The second shave is the closest, cleanest shave I&#x27;ve every had and I figure it&#x27;ll just get better. Replacement razor blades are very, very inexpensive so I figure I&#x27;ll recoup the cost of the razor in short order. The weight of the razor took some getting used to, but the idea of letting the tool do most of the work, as opposed to pulling on the tool to get the cut is a positive attribute. Think of power drills, woodworking tools, downhill skis and a host of other &#x27;tools&#x27; out there and you get the idea, and if you don&#x27;t get the idea, there&#x27;s a Norelco out there with your name on it.&lt;br /&gt;Try this shaver and enjoy a smooth face.</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I vacillated for far too long before I bought this razor. I love it, and the delay in my purchase kept me from enjoying a rewarding shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use this &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; safety razor you can hear the blade slice through individual hairs, but you don&#x27;t feel any irritation to the skin. The safety razor is heavy, and its heft provides the momentum for the blade to slice through your bristles. Your hand guides the blade, but there&#x27;s no tugging or pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor exudes quality. The chromed finish is perfect, and the screw mechanism for the head is sure and steady. Thought went into the design, and care went into the production. It&#x27;s trite to celebrate German engineering, but in this case the description seems appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this razor with Personna Double Edge Razor Blades. A box of 100 blades currently costs $13.22 on Amazon. I find that one blade lasts me a full week. So, I&#x27;m getting approximately two years of shaving for the cost of about a month of the current multi-blade face scraper sold by the big-name razor companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing to note is that the shape of the razor&#x27;s head makes it a little difficult to trim under the nose. You can do it, but you have to take care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with this one minor criticism, I am perfectly satisfied with this razor. It may sound corny, but it makes shaving fun, and I wish I had switched from blade cartridges much, much earlier.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; razor has a plastic head. For $50, I&#x27;d hope the company could afford metal. Apparently not. Shaves fine.</li>
            <li> I got tired of the never ending manner in which cartridge razor manufacturers would change styles and add more blades at ridiculous prices. I decided I would give a single blade a try and purchased the Merkur 38 HD after reading reviews here.  I got a few nicks the first couple of times but after I adjusted the razor angle, quit pressing down so hard and started taking my time, I did not experience any more nicks but DID get the closest longest lasting shave ever! I don&#x27;t think I will go back to multi-blades. I like the heft of this razor and the Germans always make high quality products. The razor is beautifully finished, functional and will probably last me the rest of my life.  I have been using the Merkur blades and they seem to do the job fine.  Some day I may try the Feather blades. Single blades require a slightly different shaving style and you can watch some informational uTube vids for info.  Overall, this has been a great choice for me and I recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This is the best Double-Edge Razor that I have ever used.  It&#x27;s heavy, and cuts the stubble well without cutting my skin.  I also have a Merkur short handle 34C which tends to cut a bit more aggressively and sometimes I bleed.  It&#x27;s my opinion that the difference between the two razors is purely random, and a product of slight variation in production  lots  -- your mileage may vary.  They&#x27;re both very good razors, and I&#x27;m currently using nothing else.  For me, the Wilkinson Sword and the Astra blades work extremely well in these razors for my stubble.</li>
            <li> I was very reluctant to want to buy this handle &amp; start wet shaving but kept wondering if I&#x27;d ever get rid of my razor burn. I figured what the hell if I never tried I&#x27;d never know right?? Well I did &amp; I&#x27;ll never go back to Cartridge razors ever again on my face. (I&#x27;ve yet to shave my head with thing, which I may attempt in the near future. I’m still debating). It seems like a lot of money when you add it all up (The handle, the razors, the shaving cream &amp; optional stand) but then again I could only use one cartridge razor (Gillette Fusion) on my face per shave which became very costly in itself. All in all I spent about 140 bucks a little over a year ago getting what I needed for this new style shave but wasn’t up until now that I need to get more shaving cream. (I shave every other day)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet shaving is the best way to go by far. I never thought that this old style shave would be better than the new style blade but I was wrong by a long shot. This handle &amp; the blades cut through my hairs with ease &amp; you do not get that tug you get with standard cartridges. It leaves my face feeling smooth &amp; soft which I think most guys want. I&#x27;m OCD, I want smooth &amp; soft in every direction when I shave which is why I would get razor burn so bad with cartridge razors. This type of shave minimizes that by 10 fold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I&#x27;ve gathered this type of handle is the most popular for beginners in the wet shaving world. (Who knew I fell into that category myself unknowingly. I guess if 20 people are looking up into the sky, curiosity is going to get the best of me &amp; I&#x27;m going to look up as well.) It’s crafted to last forever &amp; has that old style look to it. It’s heavier than I thought it would be but that’s what I needed it to be so I wouldn&#x27;t bear down on it while shaving. In the year I&#x27;ve had this I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. I clean it about once a month with an old toothbrush &amp; isopropyl alcohol to keep it shiny as well as clean. Taking it apart is a very simple process. 2 pieces &amp; then the blade your done. I replace the razor after every 3rd shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THINGS TO REMEMBER IF YOU ARE NEW TO THIS STYLE OF SHAVE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.

            <li> No more fusions for me. I&#x27;m hooked on DE razors.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I went back to the classic razor, refills are cheaper and I think a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful gift!</li>
            <li> Has a very comfortable handle.  Easy to handle and get a great shave.  Well made.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor, it feels really good in your hand, the blades are easy to change and it&#x27;s easy to wash out. It&#x27;s a pretty solid piece that looks really nice with the chrome on the outside. I am very happy with this purchase because I know it will last me for many years to come and it&#x27;s something that can be passed down to others.</li>
            <li> I finally took the plunge into traditional wet shaving with this Merkur 38HD Classic \\&quot;Barber Pole\\&quot; Long Handle double-edged safety razor.  The razor appears to be of good quality and has a wonderful feel, just the right size and weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being new to DE shaving I was concerned about cuts and nicks but if anything I find that this razor is a bit less aggressive that I was expecting.  Truth be told, I might end up wanting something a bit more aggressive as time goes on but for now I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this razor or the rest of my set up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0001KBP9E Marvy * Shaving Mug Rubber Green]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001L2U61E Proraso Shaving Cream With Eucalyptus Oil &amp; Menthol (5.2 oz.)]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B007OL72B8 16 FEATHER DERBY 7 O&#x27;clock ASTRA NACET BIC BLUEBIRD Blade Sampler]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001B8E77M RoyalShave Chrome Safety Razor and Brush Stand]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I REALLY got a kick out of was what was printed on the wrapper of the Merkur razor blade that came with the razor: \\&quot;Please try this magnificent stainless steel razor blade. You will be enthusiastic!\\&quot;  Gotta love those awkward, fortune-cookie-esque translations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re ready to take the plunge into DE wet saving then this razor should be on your short list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck and happy shaving!</li>
            <li> fits nicely in my hand.</li>
            <li> Good, but cut me too often.</li>
            <li> First off the pictures on do it justice.  This thing is very good looking.  So much so I ended up buying a stand for it to hang from on my bathroom counter.  It has a very nice weight and is easily controllable.  I am glad I went with the slightly longer model, I feel I have the right amount of control.</li>
            <li> A word of caution for anyone with sensitive skin or less than a medium to thick beard, this razor is a monster and will eat your face up.  I used a smaller model very successfully and I Bought this for my wife to shave her legs with as I thought the extra weight and length would be handy for that purpose. She did not care for it because it was a very aggressive shaver, I took it and tried it myself and found the same results, lots of nicks, cuts and burn no matter how you used it, and this was with Derby blades which are fairly forgiving.  I currently use the Merkur progressive adjustable (on the lowest setting) and get a decent and reasonably comfortable shave and almost never see a nick or a cut, I&#x27;ve also used a bargain basement cheap safety razor and actually got a the best shave ever out of it, very comfortable and smooth especially with Derby blades, unfortunately that one broke (as I said cheap) and I have no idea what brand it was.  3 stars because it was solidly constructed and seemed to hold up well for the brief time I used it.</li>
            <li> I have been wet-shaving for 35 years, using Williams Mug Soap, Wilkinson Sword Blades and a Gillette Butterfly safety razor that was my Grandfathers. Recently started experimenting with some new blades, and thought I would splurge on a new razor to go with them. Looked at several brands including Parker, Merkur and Feather, and was drawn to the &amp;#34;Long Handle&amp;#34; models. Realizing that, (for this kind of money), I needed a little more info, I visited several sites, including &amp;#34;Badger &amp; Blade&amp;#34;, and read several reviews for each of the models I was looking at. The Parker was the least expensive, but was very light, and the Feather was more money than I wanted to spend on shaving for the rest of my natural life, so I opted for the Merkur as a &amp;#34;middle ground&amp;#34;.  When it arrived, I was pleasantly-surprised at the weight, as well as the overall construction, - very nicely made. (Makes the antique Gillette look like a rickety, old wagon)! It fits my hand nicely, and shaves beatufully. At about $50.00, I was skeptical about the price, but this razor is well worth it! I have tried it with several different blades, and prefer the Personna Blue, the Derby and the &amp;#34;old stand-by&amp;#34; Wilkinson Swords. I still keep my Grandfathers razor in the stand, but after decades of faithful service, the upgrade to the Merkur has been a very welcome change.</li>
            <li> Actually ordered this for a friend of mine but he says it&#x27;s an excellent razor and the quality is top notch.</li>
            <li> I like this razor, heavy in the hand and the long handle is nice in my large hands. Easy to change blades but it can be a little tricky to get the blade to line up well on both sides. My only problem is that they sent me the wrong model, without the knurled handle and it is a little tough to hang on to in the shower. However they Amazon did refund me the cost of the razor after I realized I couldn&#x27;t return it. Good razor, great costumer service!</li>
            <li> Nice weight, and feels good in my hand.  It seems to be well-built, and I have no complaints.  Use a nice sharp blade, and you&#x27;re in business!</li>
            <li> I have large hands and this fits me very well.  I am a new  single blade shaver and this blade is forgiving.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Good strong frame, holds blades straight and steady. Easy to replace blades, easy to clean, and the weight is perfect to allow it to do all the work for shaving.  This was my first DE razor, and I had significant trouble getting used to zero pressure and steady angle for the jawline, but my face and neck feel and look much better due to the sharper shave.</li>
            <li> good back up but the new tech dose  not make for a real smooth shave</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was tired of paying big-bucks per cartridge for my Gillette Mach-3 and I was trying to save money.  Due to my particular beard growth patterns, I must shave my neck with a blade every day.  I can use an electric on my cheeks and save the Mach-3 for times when I need an extra-smooth shave, but as I said, I must use a blade to shave my neck every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This just does not have the handle length I thought it would.  The head is very heavy, which was fine -- but the shorter handle changed my elbow-shoulder-neck angles as I shaved my neck, changing my neck muscle tension, which lead to more nicks along the changed neck muscles.  If they made this razon with a handle 1.5 to 2 inches (3.8 cm to 5 cm) longer, it would have made for a much better shave -- for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some of you, this will be a great razor, but it was not for me.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and as good as my other Merkur...</li>
            <li> I love that I can boil this stainless razor to keep it from getting gross. I love that the weight of the razor allows me to shave without using pressure, avoiding nicks. The looks are classic and it&#x27;s a simple machine.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever DE razor, so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything, but the look and feel of it is really great! A real work of art. However, like everyone says, there&#x27;s a learning curve with these things. My first attempt left me cut up and with a very rough shave, but I did notice one or two small sections on my face that were a lot smoother than usual, so I kept practicing. Now after five attempts I&#x27;m starting to get the hang of it and it really works great!    edit:  Okay, a few weeks later after much more practice, this thing definitely shaves much closer than my mach 3. With that thing I&#x27;d be feeling growth just 6 hours later, but with this I&#x27;m still smooth shaven when I go to bed. However, it is much harder to use. My face now comes out well every time, but mastering my jaw and neck has been a losing battle, so I&#x27;m switching back to my mach 3 for those areas.</li>
            <li> The 38c was the first DE razor I purchased. It is a nice simply designed and solidly built piece of equipment; the problem is that for a few dollars more you can get a much better Razor. A Progress or better yet a Futur. Maybe your could just save a few dollars and get an HD; you see where i am going with this; it is just too middle of the road. If you want weight and length just get a Futur, if you want the older style get a Progress or and HD.    The performance is strictly middle of the road also; it does make a great travel Razor though; you won&#x27;t be that pissed if you lose it.    Lose your Vision or your Futur, you might hurt somebody.</li>
            <li> Best Shave Ever! This razor is great, but it will punish haste.   I am getting a closer shave than ever before with 2,3,4,5 blade disposables.   I highly recommend this product as well as a really good after shave cream. Not some alcohol based smelly sauce, a good quality cream.  What will the world come to if all men start pampering them selves?</li>
            <li> I wish this was my first DE razor purchase, it would have been my last. I should write a song about this thing... I think my wife is jealous. I have a couple of Merkurs and Edwin Jaggers and heard about this one and figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I was initially attracted to the mention of its heft and weight as well as the knurled handle so I went ahead. Worse that could happen is I&#x27;d have to return it if I didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight is awesome. I think this weighs as much as 2 Merkur 180s together. Feels like it at least. What a hunk of steel, I love it. I think if I dropped this on the tile it would break the tile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is perfect. I&#x27;ve got beefy hands (think burly and stocky, not long and lanky) and this razor feels perfectly at home. The knurling pattern on the handle keeps it from slipping. That was a downside on my db89l - it was a bit slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the barber pole handle feature - the &amp;#34;screw at the bottom&amp;#34; allows me to unscrew it slightly while I am shaving to lift the top guard a bit if I need to rinse it out better. Occasionally I&#x27;ll get a loose badger bristle stuck under the guard and this allows me to quickly flush it out and keep shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of shaving aggressiveness it&#x27;s about the same as the Merkur 180. Slightly more aggressive than the Jagger db89l. With a fresh Feather loaded in there it gave me a BBS shave in 3 passes and no irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure I want another one.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor and it really is a better way to shave.  I have a heavy beard and have used nearly every multi blade cartridge razor and electric but always get terrible razor burn. This razor is very heavy and the long handle allows for a close shave without applying any pressure which helps reduce cuts.  There is a small learning curve but after 1 or 2 shaves it is easy. Aside from a few nicks on the first shave I don&#x27;t get any razor burn and no ingrown hair.  I haven&#x27;t nicked myself since the second day. Definitely a superior shave and the blades are really inexpensive.</li>
            <li> very happy with purchase smooth shave very balanced would easily recommend to anyone looking for a good single blade razor</li>
            <li> Beautiful and heavy. Feels great in the hand. Moderately aggressive. The 2-piece loading of the blade is convenient and straightforward.</li>
            <li> Long handle, heavy duty safety razor will last for many years. Would recommend as a first safety razor. Blades are inexpensive compared to regular razors.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected and more ! Still looking for the right blades but thrilled with the razor. The weight and balance are perfect!</li>
            <li> Nice weight, looks great, gives a consistent shave no matter what blade you are using.  Recommend it with BIC, Crystal, or Feather blades</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Much better than the one I used 40 years ago. It compliments the art of shaving lotions. A definite buy.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it! He said it was the best shave in his life! It came with a razor blade and is a solid build and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was having a lot of issue with conventional razors feeling like a scrap piece of metal was being dragged across his face.and it left him with bumps and irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny for his smooth shave and a happy boyfriend.</li>
            <li> One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made. A clearly superior shave compared to a multi blade razor. Never have my shaves been so close or so smooth, and after using this product for a week, the razor bumps I normally get on my neck are completely gone. The blades are a fraction of the cost of the multi blade cartridges I had to buy for my previous razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for a long time (20 years). I&#x27;m 34yrs old atm and shave every other day. I have pretty steady growth of hair and my hair is thicker than most. I&#x27;ve been using gillettes for years and spend tons on blades (I use 2 blades at a time. One for the first pass and another for the second pass). I try to use them for a month due to the expense they cost. Well.. I was reading the other night and saw in my rss feeds an article about safety razors. I started looking into them and decided to try one out. I bought this razor and some Personna Double Edge Razor Blades. I let my hair grow for 4 days while I waited for these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrived today and I decided to try them out. I took a shower and shaved after. I could tell from the first pass that this was better. It sliced through the hair easily. No tugging or pulling. It just sliced the hair right off. Best thing was, I didn&#x27;t even nick or cut myself. I did 3 passes just to be safe and make sure I got all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just to let whoever reads this know - This was and is used for shaving my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also did fine on my neck and cheeks as I just lined them up. I may try to do a clean face shave now though. No more gillettes for me from here on out though.</li>
            <li> im 6&#x27;4&amp;#34; with rather large hands. this is a great razor for me. it is slightly heavier but i found that a plus. great for any level shaver</li>
            <li> Slightly more aggressive cut than my EJ89 and heavier. Also, the handle is exactly the right length of the several popular DE razors I own. The chrome finish underneath the head is not as smooth as it could have been. My EJ 89 is like a beagle puppy - no temper, doesn&#x27;t growl, always happy to see me. No complaints with the EJ89, but when I want or need something with a little more aggressiveness and weight, the Merkur Barber Pole is the next best step up for me. I prefer it Monday/Tuesday to get rid of the weekend stubble. During the work week, the EJ 89 maintains just fine.</li>
            <li> Amazons description of this razor failed to disclose length of razor, and I was guessing that it would fit on my expensive razor/brush stand.  It did not.  Plus, the length of the razor, in inches, was not stated.</li>
            <li> Just got this and have used it twice. No nicks. The extra weight of this razor does the work. Very nice.</li>
            <li> Just holding this razor you can tell it is a quality product. The weight feels just right to me and after a few practice shaves I will never go back to the expensive cartridge razors again. The DE (double edge) razor design has been around for 100+ years and with proper technique will give you a perfect shave in one pass, providing less irritation than the 3,4, 5 or by the time you read this 8 bladed cartridges. Simply switching to a shaving soap and using a DE razor has saved me over $200 in the first year alone, including the cost of purchasing this handle which will probably last me the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t fall victim to the hype of the multi-blades, learn the art of shaving and save your money!</li>
            <li> Extremely well made and wonderful to hold in your hand.  It is robust and has very good balance.  I expect many years of use with this quality product.</li>
            <li> Love this product very high quality. I am new to safety razors and have always used the high dollar disposable type razors, including the Gillette lineup. They preformed as they where suppose to but the cost of the cartridges was outrages. They always seemed to cause eritation on my neck. After a lot of research I took the dive into the old fashion safety razer. I targeted the merkur line because of there consistent reviews for quality. I must say that so far it is exactly as advertised. Starting with the unboxing of this very heavy solid feeling tool. The first thing I noticed was the polished finish and solid feel. For the first time since I was 18 and Gillette sent me my free Mach 3 razor in the mail I was excited to shave. I was a bit concerned that preparing the razor and using it would be difficult and take a lot of time to learn how. To my amazement it was a breeze to do. Twist the bottom remove the top and set the razor in and done. Secure it down with a twist of the bottom and your ready to go. I lathered up with my regular Gillette foam and went at it. It was not hard to do or uncomfortable in any way.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen people review this type of razor and say it takes more time to shave this way. Well it didn&#x27;t..... I shaved the same way I always do and it was done very quickly ( maybe a little faster without having to deal with a razor clogging every few swipes). I felt it was a much close shave than I have very had. This is pretty amazing to me considering I didn&#x27;t do anything different. So I am pretty excited to see what it&#x27;s like when I actually shave the way you are suppose to with this thing. And yes I said excited to shave again..........</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good razor.  Haven&#x27;t used it yet since the blades never arrived...  Don&#x27;t know if they will.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love.  I always had red irritation bumps after shaving but now I have them no more!  The refill blades that I buy are cheap and last a long time as well.</li>
            <li> I bought the Merkur 38Hd after doing quite a bit of research and reading of reviews.  I&#x27;m sure there are better razors but for the money this one is fine.  I used a DE razor years (and years) ago.  I had forgotten what a close shave you can get.  I did have to relearn patience while shaving and not to just flick the razor across my face.  I&#x27;ve only had a little razor burn and that was when I was trying to hurry.  If you want an extremely close and comfortable shave, this is the way to go. Disposable razor blades don&#x27;t even touch this razor for closeness. And I can purchase hundreds of good DE blades for the same price as just a few disposable blades.  The razor is well made and is pretty hefty.  My only recommendation for improvement would be to have a groove in the handle so it could be hung on my brush holder.</li>
            <li> I like the heftyness of this razor. Love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor! I like it so well I bought one for my dad! A huge plus to a double sided safety razor is the cost of blades. 100 blades is considerably cheaper than a 5 pack of anything else.</li>
            <li> I just received my Merkur 38 HD in the mail and was anxious to try it out.  I watched some videos on You Tube and did some online research before getting started.  I&#x27;m glad I did, otherwise I could have injured myself.  Well, I have to say, it does take much longer for inexperienced shavers to shave, however I enjoyed the entire process.  I have some experience with straight razors, so I am familiar with the prep work that is involved for ensuring that your face is good to go.  I made sure not to use much pressure, almost none at all, and was very very careful.  I successfully completed my first DE razor shave with absolutely no bleeding!  I was very relieved.  I used Astra Platinum blades and was glad I did, since they worked great.  I also purchased a variety of other blades to test out including Shark Chrome, Derby, Blue Bird, Gillette 7, and Feather.  I read a ton of reviews on the 38 HD and other DE razors and settled on the this one based on excellent reviews, longer handle length, and the fact that it is basically almost the same product as the Merkur 34 HD.  I do have to not that the razor I received was new and sealed, however there were some imperfections in the groves on the handle (simply cosmetic).  I like the weight of the razor and now see how this can be an important factor when wet shaving.  While the razor handle is labeled as long, it is still rather short in my opinion, but I have large hands (usually wear size XL gloves) and the size is perfect.  I don&#x27;t think you want a really long handle for wet shaving anyway.  I hope that this razor lasts a long time and that I continue to have a good experience with it.  I have to say that there is definitely a nostalgic feeling when you use a DE razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to grasp, and holds the blades rigidly and evenly.  After several months of use, there is no sign or rust or any other deterioration, and I have made no trips to the emergency room even when using with Feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> First time using a de razor..Beautiful experience..this razor has a nice nice balance..fits well in your hands, nice weigh..go for it!!</li>
            <li> I have really appreciated the strong build quality and weight of this razor. The handle is long-enough for my big hands and the design is classic and useful. I use Feather blades in the razor and change them after two shaves - I have very stiff facial hair and somewhat sensitive skin. That said, I haven&#x27;t cut myself in three months using the Merkur/Feather combo.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for a more enjoyable shaving experience.</li>
            <li> This is a tool that will last a lifetime, if properly taken care of. They are beautifully crafted. I realize that these razors are made on a precision automated lathe and mill in 2014. They are a reminder of old handmade craftsmanship that had to be cared for because it was too difficult to replicate. From the quality of the chrome polished frame &amp; handle to the smooth quality of the threads on the screw in handle Merkur did a beautiful job of building the razor. Then you get to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big person. The long handle was important to me. I really like the feel of this razor in my hand, there is something to hold on to. You don&#x27;t have to guess where it&#x27;s going on your face; and with a very sharp DE blade that&#x27;s pretty important!  I will tell you that facial cuts for me have been no issue at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is the supply of the blade I am trying to purchase. But that&#x27;s nothing to do with the Safety Razor Handle. It works as advertised! I would recommend it to anyone. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Nice razor,smooth shave.A little heavier than I thought it would be. Best razor I have used. Will recommend to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed my [[ASIN:B000RJUZMW Merkur Model 38 Hd Classic &amp;#34;Barber Pole&amp;#34; Long Safety Razor]], it is a hefty razor that provides a good grip for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and very well constructed. The first few weeks after swapping from a cartridge razor were a bit daunting, it was difficult to get a close shave, but as I learned how to hold this razor and use it, shaving became a joyful ritual.</li>
            <li> Merkur makes an amazing product!  I&#x27;m new to the DE shaving and I&#x27;m laughing at how much money I&#x27;m saving and what a better shave I get.  Shaving with the DE Merkur HD BP is amazing.  Shaving everyday is like going to the spa every single day.  Get on board with all the other DE converts and save money and treat yourself (and face) every day to a great shave.  It took my about 30 days before I really started to really get it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merkur product is solid and amazing quality.  This razor will certainly outlive me.  Enjoy the shave.</li>
            <li> Outstanding razor, wish I would have switched over to this razor from the disposable ones along time ago.</li>
            <li> Just as described.Heavy and great fit</li>
            <li> not as long as you&#x27;d think.  definitely don&#x27;t worry about it being too long.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor. I have very coarse facial hair, and while this is advertised as aggressive, it&#x27;s almost not enough for me. I&#x27;m still working it out. The first step for me was to get much more aggressive blades (Feather Pt coated).</li>
            <li> Having sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve always had trouble shaving--in fact, I can only shave twice a week even with the best tinctures, lotions and shave soaps. I also have a mild tremor in my hands that made me nervous to switch to a safety razor. However, the significant weight of this razor helps me keep my hand steady while shaving (and the added closeness of a thorough wet shave means that I don&#x27;t look like an unkempt basement-dweller at the end of the three days I have to wait between shaves). This being my first safety razor, I don&#x27;t know how well it compares to others, but I can say that if you&#x27;re coming from an electric shaver or a cartridge razor, you will be in for a treat.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and I must say I&#x27;m now a convert.  This razor is very well made, with solid construction and weight.  The weight is perfect and the two-piece construction is simple and makes for easy cleaning.  Using the double-sided safety razor blades work really well for me, much less rash than with a disposable razor.  Now I only use disposables when traveling.  Can&#x27;t recommend the razor enough.  Happy shaving my friends.</li>
            <li> After 25+ years of shaving with overpriced cartridge razors, I now have the best shave short of going to the barber.  At 16 years old, Mom gave me a can of barbasol and a track II.  That was the beginning of acne and ingrown hairs. that didn&#x27;t go away until I learned how to shave properly. this is my first DE razor, and most likely all I will ever need.  If I could give 10 stars, I would. excellent build quality, and good weight.  Finally at 42, I have a close shave with no blemishes, ingrown hairs, or razor burn.  saving a bunch of money on blades as well.</li>
            <li> Solid double edge razor.  The construction is of pure quality and it is balanced perfectly.  The wieght of it provides perfect pressure for a perfect shave.  This is a positive case of &amp;#34;you get, what you pay for&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Have owned this now for about 6 months. It is a great razor. It is sturdy and has some heft in the hand. The knurling on the handle makes it easy to control with wet hands. I should note that to change blades, the top separates completely from the razor, so you need to take some care. But this is minor and does not detract from the product at all. A very nice product...</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by a friend, and I will be sticking with this razor for years to come. The longer handle on this version is great as I have larger hands and allows for a more balanced grip. The twisted finish adds a comfortable rigidity and it feels secure in your finger tips. I have never shaved with a single razor prior to this, but I have had no razor burns or cuts. It was a very straight forward operation. The simple and old school design and operation makes it easy to clean and maintain. It is easy to clean between passes whereas my other razors required more soaking and cleansing between passes. Lately, I have been maintaining a beard, and this is easy to use around the edges to groom the lines of my beard.</li>
            <li> Nice weight for shaving. This is my first and was easy to get use to. I like the longer handle bc I have bigger hands but matched with the right blade it&#x27;ll give you the perfect shave.</li>
            <li> This was my first DESR in about 30 years.  I had forgotten just how hefty they can be.  This particular razor has a good weight, is easy to clean and looks great.  The long handle makes it easier to use for head shaving.  The package includes a Merkur blade, which shaved well, although I&#x27;ve since switched to another vendor.  If this is your first safety razor I recommend you buy a blade sampler and try a selection of vendors.  There really is a difference in sharpness, ease of use and durability among them.  The bright chrome finish and rotating parts are holding up well, although it takes a bit of water and some occasional polishing to keep the top plate free of soap residue and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the razor and I won&#x27;t be going back to my old Fusion.</li>
            <li> As a person who prefers not to shave daily, I found myself constantly frustrated by the multiple blade systems that I grew up on. I am a tech-centric kind of guy, always trying the latest and greatest stuff, but in the case of razors I found every new model worse than the last - dulling quicker, clogging easier, and more and more expensive. I found myself dropping back from the Fusion, to the Mach 3, and then read an article that made me understand the issue - that there was nothing wrong with the old DE razors that had been in use for nearly a hundred years, other than the fact that they didn&#x27;t generate enough profits for the razor companies. I picked one up, along with a brush and a cake of soap, and will never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADVANTAGES:&lt;br /&gt;  * A weeks worth of stubble, or a month&#x27;s - this a single swipe will take it down to bare skin, two inches at a time - just rinse (opening the blade chamber a bit can help) and repeat. This is simply impossible to do with a multi-blade system - they will clog and become useless after half an inch.&lt;br /&gt;  * A single blade will last 4 or 5 shaves (more, with some care). Multi-blade systems might get this many, if you are lucky, but they cost over a dollar per head. I picked up a 100 pack of Gilette DE blades for $7 - you do the math.&lt;br /&gt;  * The blades can just be wrapped back up in the paper they come in, and thrown away - where they will rust away to nothing in the landfill. No piles of plastic, no shaving cream cans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, what it comes down to is modern shaving tools are nothing more than a scam - they make shaving slightly easier at the expense of extremely high costs and lots of waste. With a little practice and patience (a couple weeks of practice and a few extra minutes per shave patience), a 100-year-old tech DE blade will do the same job for a tiny fraction of the cost. The razor itself is a lifetime purchase - and then you can leave it to your grandson and THEY can use it for their lifetime. Ifyou want to go even further back and save even more money, you can get a straight razor and strop, but those are a little too scary for me. ;)</li>
            <li> It has good weight and balance which I think made it very easy for me to get use to it. And I like it being just two pieces which for me is safer when taking blades in and out.  It&#x27;s only downside is that I would like to see slightly more aggressiveness with the handle&#x27;s knurling because it&#x27;s been a little slippery, especially noticeable when I&#x27;m cleaning it.  But overall, I think it&#x27;s a top notch razor.    Update: Handle&#x27;s knurling turns out to be OK after all, just had to make sure that my pre-shave oil was washed off my hands. So far the best blades for me in this razor have been Personna Blue (made in USA) and Crystal (a.k.a. Personna Red, made in Israel).</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor approximately 2 years ago and lost it during a move.  It was so nice that I purchased another one.  I have saved so much money with this razor that I can now afford to go to Strip Clubs four times a month instead of twice a month.  The strippers love my smooth, clean shaven face.  I recommend using this razor with Merkur double sided platinum coated razor blades.  When you first begin to use the razor, you have to train yourself to use it or your face will end up a bloody mess.  It is recommended that you use short strokes. Do not use a canned shaving cream.  I always shave with Kiehl&#x27;s White Eagle, and never cut my face anymore.  Here is the cost breakdown for operating this type of razor.  A pack of 10 Merkur Razor blades costs approximately 5 dollars.  Compare that to an 8 pack of Gillette razor blades which costs 28 dollars.  A razor blade on this razor lasts approximately 2 weeks.  You can use a strop and resharpen them, or you can just pitch them into the back of the container.  This is your grandpa&#x27;s razor blade, and can also be yours.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> great tool for starters</li>
            <li> It seems that the more things change, the more they stay the same. My father etc. used something similar years ago. He switched to the newer brands &amp; electric. But, came back to this. He likes the shave, the closeness and smooth skin and not all the bumps.</li>
            <li> Shave like a boss and feel like a boss... this is a wonderful safety razor with a perfectly sized handle and just the right amount of weight.</li>
            <li> This razor is a precision work of art.  The Merkur 38 HD is solid and hefty with a deep chrome finish. The barber pole handle looks great and is very functional.  The head is firmly attached to the handle. The blade cover has three posts, one that engages the tensioner. The head is tightened, securing the blade, using the &amp;#34;globe&amp;#34; at the end of the barber pole. There&#x27;s no chance the head could become loose and spin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaved with it this morning.  It worked great and gave the best shave I can ever recall.  This old school razor puts overpriced cartridge razors and electric shavers to shame.</li>
            <li> I had been searching around for different D.E. (double edge) razors and this one I just could not pass up. I was told it was good for beginners and I have to say, It&#x27;s the best! Take your time with it..don&#x27;t pressure..and let the weight do it&#x27;s thing. The long handle gives you enough room to hold on without applying pressure. The grip is awesome, I dunk mine in hot water to start out with to get it warm and ready, and I take it out and begin to shave. No Slip No Worry. I recommend this to everyone and anyone. Awesome Razor..</li>
            <li> My husband loves it! Thank you :)</li>
            <li> Great and fast delivery !</li>
            <li> I had bought the Merkur HD 34C as my first DE razor. It took a while to get used to but I loved it. I left it in a cabin when I went snowboarding so I bought this one the 38HD to replace the HD 34C. I like the 38HD much better, it&#x27;s more comfortable for me to hold in my hand and I get a closer shave.</li>
            <li> In the world of wet shaving, there are multi-bladed bank account draining cartridge poppers, double edged razors of mediocre tolerances and works of art built to last a lifetime.  The Merkur 38c HD falls in the latter group.  In this case, the ole stereotype about superior German engineering really comes to mind.  This razor is about 3 3/4 inches long (about 89 mm) and is fairly heavy at almost a quarter pound (about 113 grams) and is completely chromed all over.  When you pick it up, you feel you could shave with it or beat a man to death with it.  It has heft that means business and reeks high quality.&lt;br /&gt;  While I am fairly new to safety and straight razor shaving, I do also own the Merkur 180 (aka the 23c), the Merkur Futur, the Edwin Jagger DE89L and a Thiers Issard straight.  While I am practicing and learning with all the razors (especially the Thiers), the Merkur 38 HD is my daily go to beard cutter.  This razor is a two piece unit which I really like and you unscrew the bottom of the handle to remove the top and put in a new blade. I also am very fond of the barber pole texture on the handle which helps me hold the razor when it is wet.  (How did you miss this when designing the Futur, Merkur?) The blade gap on this razor is 0.64 mm which is neither aggressive or weak.  And the Merkur 38 HD seems to have just the right design to reach everywhere on my face except right under the nostrils.  Slap a Feather blade in this bad boy and it will cut any beard like butter.&lt;br /&gt;  Overall, I would give the 38c HD about 4.8 stars out of five. If I could redesign it, my only addition would be a slightly longer handle (I would have made it about 125 mm long).  Despite this minor flaw, shaving with the 38c HD makes me feel like I am going to meet Winston Churchill for a War Cabinet meeting.  When connoisseurs of fine products speak of items where form intersects function with aesthetic appeal, the Merkur 38c HD is an example of what they mean.</li>
            <li> Great balanced razor.  Great for guys with large hands for a smooth shave.  If you have a heavy beard this is the one for you!</li>
            <li> EDIT (3 years later):  I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about 3 years now.  I am STILL using the same box of razors, though the shave soap ran out long ago.  The soap dish and brush stand are still working fine, and the shave brush is also still in very good shape.  I still dry the blade and razor after each use (maybe 2-3 shaves per week), and the blades are very consistently lasting between 5 and 7 shaves, depending on the thickness of the hair growth.  This means, as you&#x27;ll see in the post farther down, I am still YEARS away from using up the box of 100 blades I originally purchased.  Very happy with this razor, and I would still recommend it to anyone looking for a great safety razor with a great look, great lines, and superior engineering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW STARTS HERE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used cartridge razors for years.  I&#x27;ve gone from single-bladed cartridge or disposable razors all the way up to 3 and 4 bladed cartridges.  I&#x27;ve used electric razors and even tried depilatories.  With all of those, I have suffered with consistent irritation and trouble with shaving bumps.  Evidently, I have sensitive skin, especially on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Model 38 HD a bit over a week ago.  I received it in the mail and loaded it with the included Merkur razor blade.  I also bought some [[ASIN:B00008X5CH Williams Mug Shaving Soap - 1.75 oz]].  I put a light lather of the soap on my face, and began to shave with the 38 HD.  I was immediately amazed at how smooth the save was, even though my beard was about 4 days heavy.  The razor cuts the way a razor should cut, without snagging or pulling at the hair.  An added bonus that I found was the accuracy with which I can shape my beard and mustache, since the one blade is extremely narrow.  After the shave, splashing on some cold water finished the experience off nicely.  It was the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years, and when I say years, I mean like 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen reviewers talk about the extended length of time it takes to shave, or the nicks and cuts they get from using a Merkur safety razor.  My very first shave took about 5 minutes less than it usually does with a cartridge razor. I had one very small nick on my neck, probably due to a small pimple or something there that I didn&#x27;t notice.  With the Williams Mug Shaving Soap, the razor glides as though it had its own comfort strip attached.  It is extremely difficult to cut yourself with this razor as long as you shave like a normal human being and don&#x27;t try to hack away at your face.  I&#x27;m confident that it will give you a very special and irritation free shaving experience.  I will never go back to the cartridge razor, and I&#x27;m actually thinking of purchasing this along with shaving equipment as a gift for some of my family and friends.  It has impressed me that much.  I am, however, looking at trying out a Dovo Straight Razor next.  I received a straight razor shave one time in the military in Japan, and it was also a great experience.  I will also review that when I have developed an opinion about the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Model 38 HD is an elegant piece of hardware.  It is well-designed and feels well-made in the hand.  The weight of the razor lends itself to the ease of the shave, since the razor is heavy enough to basically cut through the hair on its own.  The smooth chrome of the blade cover doesn&#x27;t irritate or drag the skin as long as the skin is soaped and wet, but will catch a little as the skin dries out, which is expected with polished metal.  The blade is clamped to a comfortable curvature, which helps the blades stiffness and keeps the edge steady against the hair during the cutting process.  This razor is a great piece of equipment, and I am thoroughly pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip I would give:  When finished with the shave, remove the blade and, using a clean paper towel or cloth, clean the razor blade thoroughly along with the razor.  Slip the razor blade back into the razor and tighten the mechanism down on the blade before storing it OUTSIDE OF THE BATHROOM, perhaps in the bedroom or a closet.  By keeping the razor blade dry and stored outside the bathroom away from steam and moisture, the blade should last quite a bit longer, and so be even more cost-effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fully recommend this razor and the blades by Merkur (though I also use [[ASIN:B0077LAJT2 Personna Double Edge Razor Blades]] , which are also extremely cost-effective and outstanding razor blades.  I think anyone that uses this razor in a reasonable fashion will be instantly hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations, Merkur, on producing a fantastic piece of shaving equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  So, I&#x27;ve been shaving with this razor now for about a week, and I still couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  Shaving irritation is down, shaving bumps are disappearing, and I&#x27;m still using the same blade that came with the razor.  I did the math on this, just to give those that may be curious an idea of the savings with this equipment.  I purchased my complete setup for around $122 including shipping.  I bought the 38HD Classic, Personna Blades (100 in a pack), Tweezerman&#x27;s Badger Hair Brush, Williams shaving soap, a soap bowl, and a brush stand.  If I use the blades as I stated above, I&#x27;m getting at least seven shaves out of each blade.  That gives me 700 shaves with one box of razors.  Comparing that to the Mach3 cartridge razors, I spend about $25 on eight blades, and get around three shaves per cartridge.  That comes to about $1.04 per shave.  At that cost, using the Merkur would have cost around $728, just for the razor blades alone, so about $783 for the razor and blades.  The razor and the blades ran me a bit over $70 with shipping, which comes to about 10 cents per shave.  Even with the other equipment (stand, bowl, soap, and brush), I&#x27;m still averaging about 17 cents per shave.  That is over 6.12 times cheaper than using cartridges.  Anyone still need convincing?  I&#x27;m 38, and if I live to be 70 (32 more years) I will only replenish my blade supply about 16.7 more times, at a current cost of around $16.00.  That comes to about $266.97 over the next 32 years for the blades alone.  If I use cartridges, according to my math (which could be mistaken....feel free to check the numbers), I will have to replenish my cartridge razor supply 486.7 times, and at $25.00 a package at today&#x27;s cost, that equates to about $12,166.67 for the cartridges alone.  That&#x27;s more expensive than the Merkur over 32 years by a factor of 45.  The savings just grow as you get older.  Anyone have any questions, feel free to message me.  But go today and order this razor and a box of blades.SIDE OF THE BATHROOM, perhaps in the bedroom or a closet.

            <li> I started my DE shaving adventure with a Merkur 38C HD razor (3 inch handle). I used this alone for just over 4 months and I really like it. The only thing that wasn&#x27;t perfect for my particular set of conditions was it was a little difficult to see clearly past my hand when shaving the edge of my long left side burn. I am right- handed and the shorter handle made it more difficult to get my hand back far enough to assure I was creating a straight edge for my entire sideburn.  Shaving the right sideburn was not as much of an issue with my right hand.  And the rest of my shaving with the smaller handled razor was just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eventually decided to get this Barber Pole Merkur HD as I thought the extra 3/4 inch long handle would be perfect for moving my hand back a little more while shaving so I could see the full left sideburn edge. Before purchasing this I verified that it also had only 2 sectional pieces for removing/inserting blades.  The only small difference I see between the shorter Merkur Hd and this Barber Pole version besides the slightly longer handle is that the Barber Pole version also has handle grip grooves that are cut a bit less deeply into the handle and there is a more aesthetically rounded bottom tip (Barber Pole like) instead of the knurled knob at the base of the smaller 38C model. The perfect razor for me would be the 38C HD with the Barber Pole length handle, but this Barber Pole works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip is still quite adequate and not slippery and there have been no issues loosening/tightening the bottom knob to change blades. Gentle finger tightening works quite well in securing the blade. And you should always be changing blades with a dry razor and hands anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I see no change in shaving aggressiveness from its original little brother, Merkur 38C HD. So I am quite happy with this purchase. The slightly longer handle does actually allow me to move my hand back just enough to see the left sideburn edge betterand shave a straighter edge there. This Barber Pole also has that similar solid feel and weight that I got and liked from the shorter Merkur razor. I therefore will be keeping both of these Merkur razors in my arsenal. They are both well-made and should last me a very, very long time. Although everyone is different, for the most part I think the choice between the longer and shorter versions of the Merkur line should be mainly based on which suits your own particular shaving needs better.  Good luck with your future in DE shaving.</li>
            <li> I got tired of buying razor blade cartridges for $2 a piece to keep my blades sharp for a nice clean shave not a rip your hair out as you go encounter. I did a bunch of research and read a bunch of reviews across several sites to figure out what I wanted and I came to this safety razor and now I&#x27;ll never go back! Not only do the blades only cost about $0.50 so they can be replaced more often, but I&#x27;ve found I get as many, if not more, shaves from this. Granted when I changed to this I also upgraded to wet shaving and ditched the chemical formulated shaving creams at the same time, so that may be helping to make the blades last longer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a super close shave every time, something that I only got the first few uses of the other blades. If I so wanted I could buy a sharpener to hone the blades to extend the life, but after saving $1.50 per blade I&#x27;m okay with starting out new and pampering myself a bit. If you&#x27;re on the edge of making the jump to safety razors do it! The one time expense to buy this beauty will be saved in no time from the difference in cost of the old blades especially if you shave every day!</li>
            <li> Will never go back to disposables. Ever try to cut meat with a plastic knife or a butter knife? Would you expect a smooth cut? Cut hair with plastic scissors? So why would you do that to your face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have large hands, and I like the length of this razor. It has good heft to it, and is easy enough to get the angles with it.</li>
            <li> This is my first razor after using disposable razor heads. The handle is shorter than I&#x27;m used to, but it has a nice weight to it. The razor comes apart very easily for cleaning and razor changes. It also absorbs heat when you&#x27;re rinsing the razor with warm water, which feels nice.</li>
            <li> Picking up the Merkur 38 HD for the 1st time lets you know that this razor is the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with my Merkur is a great way to start  the day.  Wonderful shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started shaving with a Parker.  It now stays in a drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike&lt;br /&gt;Atlanta, GA</li>
            <li> I used a Parker razor before this, and this is even better. I switched to DE shaving because of razor burn with Mach 3s and also the cost involved. Simply put, if you need to shave, use this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor for over 2 years now and am very satisfied with the quality of this product. I would recommend to someone looking for a simple safety razor that doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Yes, after so many years, I went back to the basics of a safety razor &amp; I love it. Not only is it so much cheaper, but the closeness of the shave is not anything I&#x27;ve ever been able to get in an electric, disposable or cartridge razor.  I&#x27;m an oldie but a goodie &amp; so is my reliable safety razor.</li>
            <li> I honestly like my new &amp;#34;Safety Razor&amp;#34; a lot, but using it is a skill that has to be developed. I am not about to go back to the multi-blade plastic disposables yet, but that could quite possibly be because of how much money I have invested in purchasing this yesterday&#x27;s technology razor and refill blades, Shaving Brush, Shaving Soap, Mug and a separate mirror. I assume that the razor works exactly within spec and it will give a very close shave, but it can easily shave too close and draw blood if patience and proper technique are not part of the shaving session. I like my Merkur razor, but be advised that it takes a certain level of skill to use one. This skill can be learned with practice and could be a source of pride for the shaver. If one is ready to develop the needed skills or already has those skills, Go for it. The Merkur 38 Hd is well engineered and feels great in the hand, IMHO of course.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband. It is very heavy and mad well.  He loves the incredibly close shave he gets!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the DE shaving world so I didn&#x27;t have much reference on which way to go as far as razors.  I read the reviews and decided on buying the Merkur 23C first.  It was the most popular razor on Amazon.  I used it for about three weeks and decided it was just not giving me the close shave I wanted.  I did some more research and discovered a more aggressive razor which is the Merkur 38 HD.  I bought the 38 HD and the first time I used it I took the blade out of the 23C and put it in my drawer.  It was that much of a difference. I&#x27;m not a heavy bearded guy, but I like a smooth finish when I&#x27;m done.  If I&#x27;m going through the trouble of making my own lather and buying a brush, I want a good shave! I&#x27;ll just use the 23C for my travel case.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is the 23C just didn&#x27;t do the job the 38 HD did.  I hope reading this prevents you from making the same mistake I made.  Happy Shaving.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and don&#x27;t regret for once that I purchased it. It gives me a wonderfully smooth shave and it definitely is a money saver when it comes to razor blades. There is a learning curve you must overcome at first, but once mastered there&#x27;s no turning back. I&#x27;ve gotten to the point where I dry shave without a problem. I love it.</li>
            <li> Very nicely weighted and build quality (don&#x27;t fall for less expensive Chinese knockoff.)&lt;br /&gt;First few shavings like I remember with my old razor many years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more overpriced multi-blades that clog up easily.</li>
            <li> Stop shaving like a girl and man up and save some money on razors. This thing cost like 10 bucks a year to shave with! Think about that when you go buy the next 5 blade razor for 45 bucks a two  month supply</li>
            <li> Nice middle of the road razor.  Not as aggressive as some other brands, but can handle tough whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the secure blade assembly.</li>
            <li> Heavy and durable razor. One of my better purchases. I suspect it will outlast me.</li>
            <li> Since I have large hands, I opted for this model against the 34c. I&#x27;m not an old pro with these kinds of razors, but I had owned one DE razor before and the difference in quality was huge. This razor is well balanced and much more attractive than the picture can show. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months, and I can say that it may not be a glitz and glamor model, but it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and the quality is as promised.</li>
            <li> I am glad I picked this model of razor.  I have a slight hand tremor and the added size and weight helps combat that.</li>
