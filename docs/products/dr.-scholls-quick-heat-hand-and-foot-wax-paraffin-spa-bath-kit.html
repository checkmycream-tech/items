            <li>, in summary, this is a great product for arthritic hands and anyone in general as it makes you feel pampered and is a great way to relax and treat yourself at a great price.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing</li>
            <li>OMG this is amazing .  </li>
            <li>Item works as described, cheap, efficient, smells great my wife loves it and didn&#x27;t bother having it done at the salon anymore...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wanted this for a while I really enjoy using its great for my hands since I have carpal tunnel</li>
            <li>But the effects are amazing and that is reason to use the product.  </li>
            <li>It brings amazing comfort to arthritic joints.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does take serveral hours to warm all the wax</li>
            <li>Mitts/booties are nice.</li>
            <li>Having this paraffin bath at home is cost effective and convenient.</li>
            <li>I think it would be nice if it came with another pound of wax.</li>
            <li>Your hand has just gotten used to the temperature &amp; it is probably still warm inside.</li>
            <li>any kind of relief as it claimed.  </li>
            <li>the warm wax also help for people that have arthuritis</li>
            <li>I have plugged in my Spa bath for 28 hours now, and the paraffin wax is barely warm.</li>
            <li>wait to get this, you will use it more often and get that great salon treatment more frequetly than you expect.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if it could melt the paraffin wax quicker</li>
            <li>Packaging was nice, wax smelled nice, so I followed the instructions and plugged it in.</li>
            <li>Nice unit for the price.</li>
            <li>It takes about 2 hours to completely warm up.  </li>
            <li>The warm wax helps my arthritis</li>
            <li>But this is so nice.</li>
            <li>I figured it&#x27;d also feel nice after giving myself a pedicure.</li>
            <li>Liked the scented wax that came with the product and</li>
            <li>My daughter got to it before I did and took it as her own.  </li>
            <li>his whole family does so happy i found it!!!</li>
            <li>Some people complain about the time it takes to warm up the wax.</li>
            <li>nice size.  </li>
            <li>Nice at home treatment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a handy unit that I carry with me to all of my health fairs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought one for myself and I liked it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this has done the trick, but so far so good -- and it is wonderfully comforting.  </li>
            <li>I kind of like the smell...</li>
            <li>Dip them in the nice warm paraffin once or twice and let it absorb.  </li>
            <li>Sooo nice and warm and takes away pain.  </li>
            <li>Been using it to help warm and moisturize my hands after working with soil and water during the day.  </li>
            <li>An on/off switch would have been nice, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a necessity.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used a candy thermometer and it registered 144 degrees, again this was on the keep warm setting.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just nice to have others doing it for me.</li>
            <li>.. Came with plastic packs and a nice glove...</li>
            <li>The warm parafin wax helps in easing some of the discomfort</li>
            <li>Nice to have choice of temperature.</li>
            <li>It is a very good spa for the money, the wax gets quite hot, and the mitts are really nice....</li>

            <li>This is a very easy machine to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This takes forever to heat up and the wax has a very strong odor of petroleum.  </li>
            <li>Love Love this item!</li>
            <li>I regret having to return it and it looked fine, wax smelled good, and I was dying to try it.</li>
            <li>Works well, wife likes it, came on time and heats very good, price was reasonable</li>
            <li>, so I went to a beauty supply store and purchased some that I liked better.</li>
            <li>It does takes an hour or more to warm the paraffin, so keep that in mind.</li>
            <li>I replaced my old unit (Homedics) with this one, and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li>The temperature is perfect and the wax, gloves and hand-warmer mittens make the spa treatment complete.</li>
            <li>The wax does leave your hands a bit greasy, but it&#x27;s a good massage oil and your hands feel smooth.</li>
            <li>Once you get the wax melted and the temperature just right, the results are great.  </li>
            <li>my hands are pretty beat up, the spa bath helps a great deal.</li>
            <li>sweet and well packaged for a good price.</li>
            <li>Very light weight.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t care for the strong rose smelling paraffin wax.</li>
            <li>this was not a task happily done.&lt;br /&gt;Although the wax has a pleasant aroma, it is far too strong.  </li>
            <li>Customers were very satisfied as long as they are happy &amp; pleased I am also very pleased and confident in the product .</li>
            <li>I worked for the that very first time, and that was it!!  </li>
            <li>The wax doesn&#x27;t smell very good - like an old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love it.</li>
            <li>I am very happy I went this way instead of going bigger.</li>
            <li>Lid does not snap on but lies on top of tub</li>
            <li>the paraffin melted as described and I was pleased with the treatment on my fingers.</li>
            <li>Now my hands are nice and smooth with the waxy compound that remained after cracking off the cooled</li>
            <li>really feels great,</li>
            <li>Scholl is visually appealing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I have this at home.  </li>
            <li>Then the top layer of wax started to harden before I could use it.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I&#x27;m well pleased.</li>
            <li>I have not used the product for more than one week and it stopped functioning...</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t faulty -- but I feel it could be a lot better.</li>
            <li>I love this machine.  </li>
            <li>If you keep your fingers apart it will build up wax between them as well as on the top and bottom.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased at Amazon as I do many items.</li>
            <li>your feet/.hands feel better and softer</li>
            <li>How I am going to pay more for something that does not work.</li>
            <li>All enjoyed their results.  </li>
            <li>I wish I used it more often.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hands feel so much better.    </li>
            <li>Be sure to remove everything from inside the spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I  twist the baggie top around my wrist then place my hand into a mitten.</li>
            <li>but I love doing needlework.</li>
            <li>It is such a wonderful feeling.</li>
            <li>Needs more than 3 pounds of paraffin though.</li>
            <li>Love to come home and soak my hands in this spa bath.  </li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>It works great, my hands are much softer and healing.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Really glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>Love this hand spa</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>was wondering if I can order more wax.</li>
            <li>I am using it for my arthritic hands and they do feel better when finished.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Love, Love Love it.</li>
            <li>I love using this.  </li>
            <li>heats up in 10 min or so love that it doesn&#x27;t create steam.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my wife&#x27;s birthday, as she had asked for one.&lt;br /&gt;Works great, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and we both love it.</li>
            <li>My hands look much better now.</li>
            <li>i like it a lot but wish there was more control of the temperature.</li>
            <li>We tried everything within reason but the switch is defective and we are returning it for a unit of much better quality.</li>
            <li>Beyond that, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>I love this and use it all the time.  </li>
            <li>I love that it came with paraffin.</li>
            <li>I love mine.</li>
            <li>This is better for hands and wrists.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love these spas.  </li>
            <li>Ok for the price.</li>
            <li>I actually love this warmer.</li>
            <li>It dumped most of wax on counter top.</li>
            <li>Okay but too time consuming.  </li>
            <li>My arthritic hands feel so much better since I have been using this paraffin bath.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love it...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Three would be better.</li>
            <li>This is not a Saturn V rocket or a sophisticated particle accelerator.</li>
            <li>I love love love my spa bath, I use it for my hands</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Takes a while to heat up, but works ok.</li>
            <li>I love amazon because they deliver on time every time</li>
            <li>I should have read more closely.  </li>
            <li>I rated ths OK because the problem is with me.</li>
            <li>I have a 10 1/2 foot and it does not come close to fitting.</li>
            <li>I love the lid as well.</li>
            <li>but it seems I have used it more.</li>
            <li>The replacement arrived two days later in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>They are so enjoyable to hold and kiss.  </li>
            <li>This is actually better than doing the treatment at a spa.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect size for personal use and even for feet women&#x27;s 7.</li>
            <li>We picked this one mostly based on price comparison on the day I did the research.  </li>
            <li>I can see why they have a warning about touching the sides of the unit,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that had I kept it indoors</li>
            <li>but its just like what they use in a real spa and worked great on my feet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about a month or more</li>
            <li>but... I bought this one because of the size they said it was, so my husband would be able to use it as well......</li>
            <li>ON or wax will get a skim on top.  </li>
            <li>This is Ok but the temperature flustuates, you need to use more wax than what shipped with the bath itself.</li>
            <li>I love my spa bath kit and the fragrant paraffin that came with it.</li>
            <li>It cost more than the oldone, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I have tried this for two or more weeks.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I Love</li>
            <li>I love the dial feature that controls temperature.  </li>
            <li>I had surgery in 2012 to repair two tendons in my pinky finger, and have endured more than a year of occupational therapy to get the hand working again.</li>
            <li>Much better</li>
            <li>-o much better after a wax dip</li>
            <li>Love the &amp;#34;rain&amp;#34; scented wax that came with the wax warmer.</li>
            <li>It is also better than any pill I have ever taken.</li>
            <li>I love this paraffin bath, it&#x27;s basically a crock pot dedicated just to wax.</li>
            <li>It also keeps my hands more limber.</li>
            <li>I drop items that I used to be able to carry to the fridge.. yogurt etc.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for better.</li>
            <li>and I love how the glove works on my hand, at therapy they just wrap my hand in a towel.</li>
            <li>This is the best way to thaw back out again.</li>
            <li>My Sons love to use it.</li>
            <li>It is a family favorite.</li>
            <li>Thicker wax is much more moisturizing</li>
            <li>Thicker wax is much more moisturizing</li>
            <li>I read the reviews of several brands and Dr. Scholl&#x27;s seemed to be the best buy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely more for hands than feet.</li>
            <li>I love this paraffin spa.  </li>
            <li>If you want it for your hands only it will be perfect.  </li>
            <li>I love the scented smell and ordered more scented wax.  </li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t too many of these spa baths on the market</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my paraffin warmer.</li>
            <li>I am glad I ordered this and am going to get one for my mom also.</li>
            <li>Really enjoy the hand spa!</li>
            <li>you... have already bought booties and more parafin for this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Louisa</li>
            <li>Enjoy! ))&lt;</li>
            <li>Pleased with unit, exceeds expectations and will recommend to friends &amp; family.very satisfying &amp; exhilarating.one-ywo-three-four five words!!!&lt;br /&gt;WILL</li>
            <li>NOT RESPOND TO ANY MORE RATINGS.</li>
            <li>It heats up plenty fast and is very warm.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this product</li>
            <li>The effect of the hot wax is wonderful, the oils in the wax really soften my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>The spa bath is great and does make the whole process easy.</li>
            <li>It is really good exact what I need and the price is wonderfull</li>
            <li>Ours worked good at first, then started leaking.</li>
            <li>Be aware that it will take a good 2 hours for the paraffin blocks to melt.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price!!</li>
            <li>I am still  using original wax pack!</li>
            <li>To get the wax off easily you need to put more than one coat of the wax on.</li>
            <li>Aside from the wax/unit smelling strongly of burnt diesel, it was ok.</li>
            <li>It came very quickly and well packed for a safe arrival.</li>
            <li>I am NOT happy happy happy!</li>
            <li>Overall a good product for the money with good results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this item is fine</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m very happy with mine and am so glad I got it.</li>
            <li>Colorado winters get very, very dry, so this has been wonderful.</li>
            <li>It truly is a fantastic product for a fantastic price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, and this is most important, there is no on/off dial or switch.</li>
            <li>I had a hand &amp;#34;bath&amp;#34; many years ago and remembered how fabulous it was.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that there are so many baggies that come with this, and the fact that it comes with a full set of wax.</li>
            <li>Safety warnings and cautions about using hot wax very appropriate.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much, that I also bought my Mom one for Mother&#x27;s Day</li>
            <li>one of the treatments was a paraffin bath-i saw this&lt;br /&gt;one for sale on Amazon and purchased it-works as good as the one at the hospital and really helps with the pain in his hands</li>
            <li>It melts the wax in about three hours, the instructions are easy and clear and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s very light, it is not greasy and leaves your hands feeling clean afterwards with no residue which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s very light, it is not greasy and leaves your hands feeling clean afterwards with no residue which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Takes away the pain and leaves you feeling soft and smooth!!!  </li>
            <li>the wax that is included smells very nice too, and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is working perfectly for our purposes.</li>
            <li>It is the best thirty dollars I&#x27;ve spent in awhile!</li>
            <li>When you plug it in It takes like a full day to melt the wax!</li>
            <li>The bath is very light, even while full of wax.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle,</li>
            <li>Easy to set up, operate and store (after cooling)</li>
            <li>The wax refills are also easy to use and come with the liners.    </li>
            <li>Easy to use, serves the purpose, alleviates my joint pains.</li>
            <li>I do wish it came with more wax, the 3lbs only lasts for a couple of waxes but for the price I would say that I got a great deal.</li>
            <li>Easy to follow instructions.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The machine is so easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to operate.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use and did the job.</li>
            <li>It was easy to set up and easy to use</li>
            <li>The strong scent of the wax bothered my asthma.  </li>
            <li>But, the scent is not overly strong at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, the scent is not overly strong at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find the very reasonably priced Dr. Scholl&#x27;s paraffin spa bath.  </li>
            <li>Worked fine once</li>
            <li>and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>The machine itself is fine.</li>
            <li>, it is hotter, but it heats evenly, quicker, and has been just fine.</li>
            <li>&gt; - Microplane 35002 Home Series Fine Grater (meant for food, I know..</li>
            <li>This wax heater seems to be fine in it;s operation and is as stated.</li>
            <li>Everything appears to work fine.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this bath because the wax truly melts quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Quick Heat Paraffin Bath Spa because it relieves arthritis pain in my hands.  </li>
            <li>Bonus, my manicure seems to stay nice longer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic hand covers and the insulated mitts are also a great part of the deal because it makes it mess free AND keeps in the warmth for the 15 minutes I leave the Paraffin on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One of the reviews indicated that this product had a smooth easy to clean interior.</li>
            <li>I have early stages of RA in my hands and the heat from the paraffin has provided excellent relief (and my hands are soft as a baby&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li>Great product, but just a tad smaller than I like.</li>
            <li>I suppose you could double-dip if your feet didn&#x27;t fit in one go, though.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it everyday since, and it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be too cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Clean up is easy.</li>
            <li>We really wanted one with a timer so it could shut off (or turn on) on its own</li>
            <li>Always check that the wax temperature is comfortable  for you before using.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s top quality - absolutely worth the money</li>
            <li>The power light came on but it did not produce any heat.</li>
            <li>The variable temperature control is fantastic -</li>
            <li>I thoroughly enjoy my wax bath both for my hand and my feet.</li>
            <li>I have gotten extra wax and it works great as well.</li>
            <li>The theraputic warm wax is very healing.</li>
            <li>The wax seems to have some kind of oil in it that is very healing.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>A great relief from the deep continuous ache of arthritic thumb joints.</li>
            <li>Having used it every day for several weeks, I can truly say it has helped greatly.  </li>
            <li>Also, the size can fit an 8 1/2 foot size for waxing my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the price it does a great job and definitely helping the arthritis in my hands and also my husbands.  </li>
            <li>The description said hands and feet would fit.</li>
            <li>My hands and feet stay silky smooth for weeks after.</li>
            <li>warm paraffin is very soothing.</li>
            <li>I was  using the supplied 3 bars of wax per the instructions said to use, and there was a &amp;#34;Max&amp;#34; guideline level for the wax on the inside of the tub that it was filled up to</li>
            <li>Does make the skin smooth, but</li>
            <li>Using a scrub on your hands and applying a generous layer of hand cream on the hands prior to dipping allows for a great experience when the wax comes off.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made product.</li>
            <li>The wax that comes in the kit has a very lavender smell to it, but it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and comes with plenty of bags.</li>
            <li>also I can fit my size 8 foot in comfortably.</li>
            <li>I am not going to get rid of it because my skin is smooth</li>
            <li>It is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>Eventhough the heating light came on when plugged in, the heating element did not ever heat.</li>
            <li>Great product - 2nd one-</li>
            <li>I will keep it and enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect miracles, just good old fashioned comfort.</li>
            <li>I am surprised to receive this machine in a good size, nice looking and with all the accessory I needed to use it with just a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hands feels soft and smells good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>As for complaints about wax scent, it smells good to me, but if you know you are sensitive to scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it so much I need to look for more wax:)</li>
            <li>I think if the kit had at least 1 more brick of paraffin wax it would have been perfect.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>This looks good so far</li>
            <li>For a cheap parrafin spa bath, this is worth buying!</li>
            <li>Thanks - works good &amp; got it fast!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and melts the wax quickly.  </li>
            <li>If you like the idea of dipping your hands in hot wax and having them come out smooth and supple when you are done, you will love it too.</li>
            <li>It needs quite some time to warm up the wax even on high but it does the job.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, only it takes almost two  hours to  melt the wax , good product, I like it.</li>
            <li>The product is other wise outstanding and highly easy to use and understand.</li>
            <li>Was so excited to receive this as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li>Small for the feet, but perfect if you want it for your hands.</li>
            <li>And a plastic shell, remember to melt the wax first before putting the plastic shell, then you hand, the shell is to prevent you hands from touching the heat cores at the bottom of wax</li>
            <li>I love this and would absolutely buy again!</li>
            <li>Its also a great excuse to sit unbothered for 30 minutes with the product on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So after returning it, I did what I should have done in the first place and ordered this one off amazon and to this day have been extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>I love putting my hands in the hot wax.  </li>
            <li>Unit works fine comes up to temp fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Ordered the item and was excited about the temperature control feature.  </li>
            <li>After the first use, it never quite melted the wax any more.  </li>
            <li>The softness lasts for a really long time and the warmth is great for my arthritic hands.</li>
            <li>DOES A GREAT JOB ON DRY CHAPPED HANDS.  </li>
            <li>It feels great and helps if you have arthritic hands and also helps dry skin on hands and feet.</li>
            <li>and I had to clean it up before using it.</li>
            <li>This product is great for dry hands</li>
            <li>And, her hands are so soft, smooth, and nice smelling.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how to describe the scent, and when I saw that they called it &amp;#34;Rain scent&amp;#34;, I was a bit surprised as it smells a bit more like clean cotton to me.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had to clean it yet</li>
            <li>When done dipping and sitting with the warm wax on your hands, it leaves hands soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but if I turn it up to heat it more quickly, it is way too hot for me.</li>
            <li>Reviewers who mentioned the strong odor of the wax that comes with this are right.</li>
            <li>and he was right!</li>
            <li>Feels very nice and helps my dry hands a lot.</li>
            <li>This wax heating machine is great because it melts the 3 pounds of wax provided very quickly in about one half hour</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this so quickly, but after having it a week I can say this is no deal.</li>
            <li>Although my husband liked the warmth, he said he got as much relief washing dishes in hot water.</li>
            <li>I am not sure it would cure the problem, but making her happy is just as important!  </li>
            <li>This is great for arthritis or rough skin.</li>
            <li>really like the way this makes my skin feel, though it seems to work better if you put lotion on before dipping in the wax.  </li>
            <li>The description states a waiting time of 2-3 hours, meanwhile, I have to wait a FULL day for the wax to melt.</li>
            <li>This bath is inexpensive and does a good job of melting the wax and keeping it at a constant temperature so you can dip in whenever you want.  </li>
            <li>I ENJOYED SO MUCH</li>
            <li>I love it so much .</li>
            <li>but I have used it with the full heat setting too.  </li>
            <li>However, the disadvantage is that it takes a full two hours to heat the paraffin.</li>
            <li>I still could not cover my own hand completely.</li>
            <li>I loved the way it made my hands feel and the wax softness does seem to last about a day.</li>
            <li>allows for some real luxury at home for sure.  </li>
            <li>It makes my feet feel sooooo good, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>I will try to use it more often to see if there is a real benefit.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad price either.</li>
            <li>The price was surprisingly not bad and the wax can be reused</li>
            <li>The wax that comes with the package is strong smelling at first</li>
            <li>Melts pretty quickly and easy to store.  </li>
            <li>I get very dry hands in the Winter time, and this product is by far the best thing that I have used to fix that issue.</li>
            <li>Stays warm and is the perfect size, not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li>The wax gets pretty hot at highest melting setting, so I need to let it cool a bit WITH TOP</li>
            <li>It may be fine for cosmetic use, but it is ineffective for applications requiring higher heat</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice such and am quite happy with the whole purchase.  </li>
            <li>Works great, I would recommend getting extra wax because it goes fast</li>
            <li>I keep it on warm setting and it&#x27;s always ready when I&#x27;m ready to use it.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly, plenty of room for hands or feet.  </li>
            <li>And it says \\&quot; quick heat\\&quot; ;0)</li>
            <li>but that is the fault of the Dr Scholl&#x27;s Co for stating Quick Heat.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>3 lbs is not enough wax for the bath it needs more to be more</li>
            <li>It has multiple heat settings, and can fit up to a lady&#x27;s size 91/2 shoe in it.&lt;br /&gt;The mitts are nice and comfy.</li>
            <li>the dimensions are adequate for size 8 feet and medium sized hand...</li>
            <li>I have owned the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Quick Heat Paraffin Spa Bath three times now.</li>
            <li>Not so quick to heat</li>
            <li>i use the quick heat paraffin spa bath.</li>
            <li>so smaller womans hand might work a lot better, but just a bit more wax would help.</li>
            <li>I can understand the bottom of the unit being hot (thus the plastic plate) but the top should not be so hot as to harm the skin.</li>
            <li>The paraffin bath has been tremendous.....</li>
            <li>The 3 temperatures help me to adjust quickly.  </li>
            <li>Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Quick Heat Paraffin Spa Bath says  it is a &amp;#34;quick heat[er].&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It reduces the swelling and pain quickly.</li>
            <li>Nothing quick about this.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind the heat of it wasn&#x27;t that it felt like it was burning (which it was mildly)</li>
            <li>This is done quickly</li>
            <li>After 5 hours on the high setting, the wax still had not melted into more than an inch of liquid.</li>
            <li>It does get very hot</li>
            <li>I like it very hot</li>
            <li>and it DOES get VERY hot so do use caution</li>
            <li>Wax gets very hot.</li>
            <li>The paraffin does not get very hot.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>Leaked out of the bottom on the very first use.  </li>
            <li>The gift recipient seems to like it very much!</li>
            <li>For less than $30 this seemed great and it is.</li>
            <li>We got it at a great price, I think it was $10 less than it is advertised now.</li>
            <li>The melted paraffin is much too hot and I wasn&#x27;t able to use it.</li>
            <li>It works fine; a bit of trouble to use the first time, but as time goes on it will be great.  </li>
            <li>It takes at least an hour to heat up, but it feels wonderful once the wax is hot.  </li>
            <li>It was always way too hot!</li>
            <li>Gets way too hot!  </li>
            <li>When I went to put my hands in it, it was really hot!  </li>
            <li>Only wish it came with a bit more wax, but no complaints!</li>
            <li>It heats fast and helps ease her arthritis in her hands!!</li>
            <li>Its great in the winter for when her hands and feet start to dry out and crack, this really helps to moisturize and soothe the pain.</li>
            <li>Takes too much time to heat the paraffin, but works fine.</li>
            <li>heated up just fine - wax included is very soapy.  </li>
            <li>has made a huge difference for me - I do it on a weekly basis now and doing so much better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works great for smoothing skin by pulling dead stuff off.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it every once in a while to make my hands really soft.me to preheat it</li>
            <li>Messy to use,  Feels great on hands.</li>
            <li>This takes A LOT longer than it should to warm up, even when I break the wax into smaller pieces.  </li>
            <li>There is no off button; there is only warm to hot.&lt;br /&gt;2)  </li>
            <li>We had been very pleased with the first one, which was often used multiple times each day (</li>
            <li>What a fun way to pamper yourself.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>By the time it was warm enough the wax had started melting.</li>
            <li>The scent is a nice extra and it softens my hands, feet and elbows which as you move up the ladder seems to be a dire necessity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so its completely worth the effort.</li>
            <li>This is also nice for a treat for myself without having to leave home to pay the extra $$ to go to the spa.</li>
            <li>leaves your hands wonderfully soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>It helps with the pain but also makes his hand soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>NIce item to keep your hands really soft and doesn&#x27;t take up much room in the bath.  </li>
            <li>the more sensitive parts of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>warm setting only.  </li>
            <li>Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>now my star is quite off the chart it isn&#x27;t worth buying DON&#x27;T</li>
            <li>BUT,  the tub absorbed the smell of the scented wax packaged in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>came with the scented wax packaged in the wax bath tub, so that the tub absorbed  the scent of the scented wax.</li>
            <li>I love how really soft the Paraffin Spa Bath makes my hands feel.</li>
            <li>I have been experiencing some hand pain and it was recommended that I get a spa bath (I tried one at the physical therapist and liked it).  </li>
            <li>You can optionally use lotion on your hands before dipping (lotion is not included here) for extra moisturizing if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax that comes with it  has a very light clean scent to it.</li>
            <li>It is also extremely oily once you peel the wax off, but that just means more moisture for you hand :).</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping as well!</li>
            <li>As other reviewers noted, it takes a good 2 hours for the wax to melt.</li>
            <li>I sometimes dip my hands right before bed since I won&#x27;t be using them.  </li>
            <li>: I dip my right hand into the spa twice, wait 20 seconds then cover it in a plastic baggie.</li>
            <li>I like it because it comes with everything that you need to start right away since you buy it.</li>
            <li>price is right, quality is marginal.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is that sometimes the was feels to hot when in the warm setting.</li>
            <li>I had to continue to turn it to high to get the heat light to come on.  </li>
            <li>This heat paraffin spa bath is just fine, once the wax is hot, but it takes 2 hours to heat it up, so you cannot use it spur of the moment unless you keep it on, so then you need to find a place to keep it, plugged in and hot and ready to use.  </li>
            <li>The first time, once the wax finally all melted, it was too hot, so I turned it to the keep warm setting, as instructed.  </li>
            <li>and I bought more through a different site where it is cheaper and was pleasantly surprised that it came with more plastic bags.  </li>
            <li>The benefits of this product are worth this reasonable price !</li>
            <li>That is quite long - otherwise it&#x27;s a nice unit.  </li>
            <li>I leave my paraffin bath thawed and warm on the counter all winter long.</li>
            <li>My foot is size 8 1/2 and felt like I could barely fit it in the tub unless I turned it a certain way, completely straight as it&#x27;s oval shaped.</li>
            <li>wax that comes with the spa smells nice to me and the thermal gloves (mittens sans the thumb) that came with it where large enough to cover my feet</li>
            <li>hot wax melted all right, all over my kidtchen</li>
            <li>I also found it to be very helpful after I had surgery on my thumb for arthritis and needed to warm my hand before doing my physical therapy exercises.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27; s easy to do and no messy at all.</li>
            <li>Between the skin burn, issues with heating the wax properly, and nauseating stench, I&#x27;d much rather spend a little more and get something I&#x27;ll be happy with.</li>
            <li>and she enjoys it very much.</li>
            <li>or it&#x27;s very very</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to how the product works generally, as I think mine must have been defective, but what a pain to clean up!</li>
            <li>Followed directions exactly to use it the first time, went to check on it after about 45min</li>
            <li>I was dipping my hands in the hot bath.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more than enough for home use!!</li>
            <li>The plastic part that you put in the bottom should set up higher and not touch the heating element.</li>
            <li>Maybe a different brand of wax would be better</li>
            <li>As a sufferer of arhtritis in my fingers and hands, someone suggested I try hot wax and</li>
            <li>The hot is burning hot.</li>
            <li>Works well and leaves your skin hydrated, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice for rough hands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The hot is HOT.</li>
            <li>The unit leaks hot wax</li>
            <li>A friend recommended hot wax treatment - and this unit is just what I needed.  </li>
            <li>The first time it was plugged in, it leaked wax all over my counter.  </li>
            <li>But once it&#x27;s ready, the fun begins.  </li>
            <li>but then it is scalding hot when you put your hand or foot in.  </li>
            <li>(Note-my daughter said it was too hot for her.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first, the dial for the heater seemed to not be cycling at it</li>
            <li>She fractured her ankle and hot wax</li>
            <li>but I know not everyone can tolerate it that hot -</li>
            <li>, it is hot wax, afterall.  </li>
            <li>After the wax was melted it was too hot to use</li>
            <li>I knew it was just to hot</li>
            <li>It was just too hot.</li>
            <li>I actually purchased 2 more as gifts for my mother and mother im law.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance after reading the mixed reviews.  </li>
            <li>You have to grit your teeth the first time you use it, but once you dip your hand in, the paraffin insulates you from the heat when you dip again.</li>
            <li>It does heat up in exactly 2 hours just like it says.</li>
            <li>was the first of 2 paraffin baths that were defective.  </li>
            <li>After using it the first time, I shut it off, per instructions, however it took 5-6 hours to remelt the wax.  </li>
            <li>The wax was just too hot and the switch would not stay on.  </li>
            <li>It gets way to hot</li>
            <li>Absolute joke!</li>
            <li>Then the second one would never heat the top layer of wax.  </li>
            <li>I FIRST TRIED THE PARAFIN</li>
            <li>Wax was way too hot.  </li>
            <li>first thing every morning and have no pain the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>So make sure to plug in hours before you actually want to use.</li>
            <li>It is hot but not  burn your skin hot.  </li>
            <li>First time had a pool of wax under the bottom, and leaked around guage.</li>
            <li>Wax, even on the &amp;#34;keep warm&amp;#34; setting was too hot to be usable.  </li>
            <li>I had one that I bought at Sally&#x27;s (a different brand) that I love.  </li>
            <li>I needed something to help my eczema and it has really helped!</li>
            <li>Instructions were paraffin soaked and illegible,but using it is pretty intuitive.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try paraffin wax on a more regular, cost efficient basis as I&#x27;ve had it before during a mani pedi.</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not too hot when you use it.</li>
            <li>I gave away the first two.</li>
            <li>the first use.</li>
            <li>Thanks Dr. Scholl&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>The first unit was damaged in transit.</li>
            <li>They love the multiple temperature settings.</li>
            <li>However it works well and was a gift to someone with severe arthritis who absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>According to the directions the heating time until first use can take up to just over 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Dip 4-5 times in the wax and finally let it sit on my hands and provide heat and relaxation to my hand for about 10-15 minutes (I get restless not being able to move my hands).</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it every once in a while to make my hands really soft.</li>
            <li>It is either too hot or it goes off.  </li>
            <li>After several hours, the wax was mostly melted and I tried it out.</li>
            <li>I turned it up first thing this morning</li>
            <li>Its hot out in Texas</li>
            <li>After using the paraffin bath the first time, i&#x27;ve taken just one dose of medicine.</li>
            <li>The product arrived on time and exactly how it was described in the ad.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 2 more, one for my daughter and one for my daughter - in - law for Christmas presents along with extra wax.</li>
            <li>First time buyer of this type product.  </li>
            <li>EXACTLY</li>
            <li>Ive used it several times and I love it.</li>
            <li>It gets too hot to use even when you use the keep</li>
            <li>Melted wax is too hot.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for still selling it, though!</li>
            <li>Gets pretty got</li>
            <li>Fo leg, I have to do first for ties and then for heel.</li>
            <li>Yes, it takes two hours to heat up the wax the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>Thermostat works well to keep it from getting too hot.</li>
            <li>Paraffin will get too hot to apply it immediately.</li>
            <li>The hand one is so relaxing and makes your hands feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love this bath except I should have gone bigger....</li>
            <li>I got this for my mom to use and the few times that she has used it she has absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>Also does a nice job of moisturizing dry skin as well!!  </li>
            <li>If you get pedicures on a normal basis, you know that the cost of a &amp;#34;spa pedicure package&amp;#34; can add up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>You can easily use it everywhere, it&#x27;s not as heavy as the pro&#x27;s and still has their healthy effects with the warmness of your home.</li>
            <li>Maybe I wasn&#x27;t using this right, but it really burned my hands.</li>
            <li>Soak feet in very warm water for at least 5 minutes before using. )</li>
            <li>Other than that the machine worked well and the hot wax felt great on my super dry hands.</li>
            <li>At first the wax smell strange but after melted it smell better, I should say acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t believe something with such good reviews could be such a pain.</li>
            <li>I definitely advise to anyone who is sensitive to scents to purchase their own unscented wax because the &amp;#34;rain&amp;#34; scented wax  </li>
            <li>Feels so good since I had a car accident and extensive surgery on my left hand..</li>
            <li>Everything was positive except stated that it took 2 hours to heat up.</li>
            <li>I have been enjoying the nice results on my hands which need the moisture and heat due to dry skin and arthritis.  </li>
            <li>but it didnt get too hot and worked very well.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, the product is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty much a crockpot sans the removable bowl.</li>
            <li>When it is ready, the wax is really hot even at the lowest level, but at the lowest level the wax is hardening again.</li>
            <li>Gently dip your hand in the melted wax over &amp; over until there is a good solid white covering on all the fingers &amp; the hand.</li>
            <li>The mitts that are included are a bit small, but that&#x27;s good for those who have clients/patients who are petite.</li>
            <li>If the tub is full, it takes about 2-3 hours to melt completely.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with a similar problem-it is easy to use and really works-i would also recommend purchasing extra parrafin at the same time to more easily cover the hands-love this product</li>
            <li>It works well for hands and smaller size feet, but the pain of having to clean it isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have been wanting one for a very long time and am completely satisfied with this machine.</li>
            <li>Once the warming light goes back on, I know the wax is not too hot to use.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and only takes two hours to heat up.  </li>
            <li>Really like &amp;#34;foot fixer&amp;#34; better for long heat and soak.</li>
            <li>I had to open windows to air the smell and couldn&#x27;t use it because of the strong odor.</li>
            <li>but it is amply large to do so.  </li>
            <li>I accidentally scalded a large section of my wrist when I was removing my hand from the tub.</li>
            <li>and  is not as large.</li>
            <li>Went back to the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s and love this new one.</li>
            <li>Worked fine once, then the next time I plugged it in the lights came one</li>
            <li>hands get very dry in the winter and my feet always are, so I&#x27;ve been wanting something that will work better than lotions or body</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it melted the paraffin a little faster.</li>
            <li>When the wax is no longer feels warm, leave it on for a little while longer.</li>
            <li>Feels wonderful when you have been out in the cold</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like this</li>
            <li>I found it easier this way because I did it myself and how the heck can you do your whole foot at a time, you need some part of your foot to put on the ground when you take your foot out of the bath.</li>
            <li>Don’t know how I would have done my whole foot by myself.</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact it has variable heat settings.  </li>
            <li>This paraffin spa bath works very well..</li>
            <li>and it really soothes my arthritic hand.</li>
            <li>Really eases the arthritis pain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit too much.</li>
            <li>Even after getting as much of the wax as I could out of the machine &amp; refilling it with unscented wax, the smell still lingers.</li>
            <li>SOFTEN THE PALMS AND HELPS THE MOISTURIZER SOAK INTO THE SKIN MUCH QUICKER</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really find anything like this.</li>
            <li>More pain relieving than I expected.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s much easier to use</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to use this as a weekly routine to help my hand dryness and arthritis.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing  before my exercises for arthritis in my hand</li>
            <li>It did more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>The procedure went smoothly I am very grateful I forgot to ask a 220 volt machine</li>
            <li>but I succeed to find an adaptor quit fast.</li>
            <li>Also it is very flowery</li>
            <li>Really helps soothe my achy hands</li>
            <li>Very displeased with the machine and Amazon.</li>
            <li>It takes quite a while for the wax to melt so we don&#x27;t use it as often as we might if the whole process were quicker.</li>
            <li>So now I finally got the satin smooth one</li>
            <li>Wax melted fast.</li>
            <li>I have to turn it on when I leave for work and hope it&#x27;s ready by the time I get home.</li>
            <li>Parent was very please.</li>
            <li>Much to my shugrin</li>
            <li>Very helpful to ease tension and sensitivity form carpal tunnel syndrome.</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference</li>
            <li>It is very comforting.</li>
            <li>I use this for my hands that really hurt in winter.</li>
            <li>The shipping was so fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used more expensive ones and the only difference is that this one is not as deep and holds 3lbs of paraffin, but everything else about this warmer is excellent.</li>
            <li>I shall keep using it because it is very soothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>WORKS REALLY WELL.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for a friend of mine who absolutely loves the way it has made her hands and feet feel.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I have use it often and it really helps with my circulation in my hands.</li>
            <li>it was much faster.</li>
            <li>It takes 2 hours for the wax to melt which is one reason why I am not using it as much as I&#x27;d like to.</li>
            <li>This paraffin bath is compact enough to fit any space.</li>
            <li>It is really helpful.</li>
            <li>I purchased primarily for my hands anyway, so not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li>After unplugging it, and plugging it back in, the heater light no longer turns on at all and the wax sits there.</li>
            <li>This unit requires too much work before and after.</li>
            <li>It is really reasonably priced and works really well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a Speddy delivery...</li>
            <li>Really helped my  hands.</li>
            <li>She really likes it.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>It really stunk up the bathroom</li>
            <li>It really does Help your hands.</li>
            <li>Very dissappointed with this product.</li>
            <li>The entire spa is sturdy yet light plastic.</li>
            <li>We will perfume the yard instead of the whole house.</li>
            <li>and i haven&#x27;t had as much relieve as i do now.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really help the reason I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>People with arthritis, such as husband, can no longer get a foot comfortably into the basin.  </li>
            <li>It really has helped him with the circulation and softening of  his hand.  </li>
            <li>If you have sore hands for whatever reason or even just cold achy hands, this product is superb.  </li>
            <li>It is VERY</li>
            <li>Takes hours to get the wax melted and ready for use.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much easier to remove from your hands when you are done with the treatment.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much easier to remove from your hands when you are done with the treatment.  </li>
            <li>Very dodgy purchase.</li>
            <li>The wax that was provided with the system is very oily which I do not like</li>
            <li>It is a real blessing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ready when you need it.  </li>
            <li>Its excellant, took the aches and pain out of my hands and the oils left on my hands after taking wax off helped smooth my skin.</li>
            <li>Very affordable price too.</li>
            <li>but once it is ready each can be done in its turn.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Nice item, but a bit messy</li>
            <li>It has a pair of soft gloves and enough wax and liners to get you thru many paraffin sessions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this since Monday (almost every day) and so far I love it.  </li>
            <li>I DECIDED I MUST HAVE MY OWN, ESPECIALLY SINCE ONLY ONE HAND WAS BEING TREATED THERE.</li>
            <li>I soaked my hands every night for a few weeks and to be honest all the aches and pains have gone away.</li>
            <li>Slow to heat out, but feels good and lessens the arthritic pain in my hands.</li>
            <li>A good product but slow to melt the paraffin wax.</li>
            <li>Therefore the wax did not even get warm, much less melt!</li>
            <li>I have helped fellow musicians warm up sore stiff hands with this as well.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that there&#x27;s no off switch, other than that it works good.</li>
            <li>My physical therapist had me use his professional quality paraffin bath, and I decided I needed one at home, but I saw online that his model cost far more than I was willing to pay.</li>
            <li>Walmart and other stores sell this at some times for 10 dollars more.</li>
            <li>As per some other comments, unscented wax would be better, but if you order wax separately you&#x27;ll want to use the unscented stuff.</li>
            <li>now i use this every day or other day and it makes my hands so much better.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use it and bought extra wax, gloves, liners, etc.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a lot better than other brand names.</li>
            <li>The variable heat setting was the major reason I went with this specific unit, and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I was glad I listened to other reviews on the smell and bought wax (and bags) with no odor, just didn&#x27;t relized needed 3 lbs.</li>
            <li>but I just added a few more ounces of wax to cover a higher section on the wrist.</li>
            <li>Also, it is apparently a decent price for these types of things, I really can&#x27;t afford to spend hundreds of dollars on a thing to melt wax...</li>
            <li>Seems that the 3 lbs that comes with it is only good for about half a dozen applications.  </li>
            <li>Seemed to melt quickly the first time, but now it takes so long</li>
            <li>Regardless of this minor inconvenience, I&#x27;ll continue to use it and enjoy the benefits.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using my hand spa on a weekly basis to ease the arthritis in my hands and the aches after a long days work as well as with my hobbies.</li>
            <li>I have to unplug the unit and let it sit for about 15 minutes before it is cool enough to use.  </li>
            <li>Allow the hand to cool briefly before dipping it again.</li>
            <li>you hand, wash away the scrab then you can put your hand in the wax for 1-2 second take it up and dip back into the wax again, repeat it 3 times in and out to ensure your hand waxed with good enough ply then immediately placed your hand in the gloves sealed for 10 mins, remove the gloves and wax.</li>
            <li>I am not sure of MIL liked it, but I don&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like hand creams as they normally feel greasy and don&#x27;t like the slippery feeling when working on a computer...</li>
            <li>I have given it enough time to cool and it has burned me twice.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of small</li>
            <li>the was is too hot for my over sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Then you must unplug it and wait quite a while until it gets cool enough to use.  </li>
            <li>When I first received the product, naturally I plugged it immediately.  </li>
            <li>The wax smell very good but is a little messy when trying to get it off your hands.</li>
            <li>High setting is probably too hot for your hands, but melt wax at this temp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Unplug after using or it will draw electricity and wax will  still be soft.  </li>
            <li>The inside make of it makes it hard to clean, but for the price it can easily be replaced.</li>
            <li>I was even able to use it on my feet, putting half the foot in at a time.</li>
            <li>It would be better if the bath were of a piece and elements were completely hidden.  </li>
            <li>People just need to learn to complain less and problem solve more.</li>
            <li>I recently suffered a severe dog bite to the hand, and this product helped tremendously with pain and stiffness.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t particularly like the scent</li>
            <li>Of course I started giving treatments to my Mom and husband and more frequently to myself than I expected.</li>
            <li>Much better than the more expensive Homedics one I purchased and which stopped heating within a year.</li>
            <li>This wax bath was recommended to me by my physical therapist for relief from finger surgery and some mild arthritis.</li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t particularly like?</li>
            <li>More of a challenge is learning how to use it without creating a paraffin mess.</li>
            <li>Took way too long to heat up it, it was leaking from the bottom of the right side on first use called Amazon</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>You need to have it on high heat to melt the wax (or keep it liquid)</li>
            <li>I found it to be a high quality product that exceeds all that I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to those that have osteoarthritis and cannot tolerate pain killers.</li>
            <li>which is the reason I kept trying to get it on high heat.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Paraffin heats up high or medium or to whatever you like.</li>
            <li>You need to turn it on high when reheating the wax which takes around 2 hours to fully melt.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this with high hopes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for any one who has stiffness/pain in hands and a bonus....</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend for arthritis in your hands.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>do not have to put on high when ,already</li>
            <li>Even though the temperature settings are adjustable, it takes forever for the wax to melt even on the high setting.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>important.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this unit to anyone looking for this type of machine.</li>
            <li>It tells you to turn it on high for 2 hours.  </li>
            <li>I am highly allergic to scents and the chemicals that carry them.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had no issues with mine after using it about 4 times, so I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The other reason for the lower rating is the wax - although it smells great, it is super thin.  </li>
            <li>The other reason for the lower rating is the wax - although it smells great, it is super thin.  </li>
            <li>The hand therapist warned me that the home units were much hotter than the professional one they use.  </li>
            <li>It really helps as well as making my hands soft.  </li>
            <li>great for the price, cant go wrong.</li>
            <li>I really wish it had a well marked \\&quot;fill line\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Use it every day and it really does keep your hands hydraed and soft.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is normal, but it takes about 90 minutes for the paraffin to melt.  </li>
            <li>sure if this product could last how long but comparing the price why not give it a try?</li>
            <li>After just a few uses, I needed more parafin.</li>
            <li>The parafin bath doesn&#x27;t really get hot enough.</li>
            <li>It does sometimes stick to your fingernails when trying to take it off, but this is normal for any wax.</li>
            <li>It does sometimes stick to your fingernails when trying to take it off, but this is normal for any wax.</li>
            <li>Even though I took out the scented wax and used the unscented wax that I bought at the same time, the unscented wax picked up the scent of the scented wax that had been absorbed into the tub..  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday and it does make my hands feel so much better.</li>
            <li>The wax that comes with this is thin, so you have to dip your hand about 3 times to get good coverage.  </li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s going right back.</li>
            <li>Hands definitely feel softer and moisturized right after.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this warmer to anyone that has a small business, limited space, or that just wants a exceptional warmer without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li>You have to start on maximum temperature to melt the wax but remember to turn it down or you&#x27;ll easily give yourself a 1st degree burn.</li>
            <li>(but I&#x27;ll live with it:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There new slogans are about customer service?</li>
            <li>I would recomend to live with the pain.</li>
            <li>I thought I would have to buy new wax</li>
            <li>The red light wouldn&#x27;t stay on, as if there was an electrical short.  </li>
            <li>Makes skin very soft as well.</li>
            <li>and I was concerned since I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li>The set up was easy, and I have established a part of my kitchen counter for this equipment, so it won&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for, a bit pricey, but compared to the other vendors I tried very reasonable considering everthing that came with it.</li>
            <li>I had bought one from Revlon and it was the exact same.</li>
            <li>Not too many choices when a small one is needed...</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get hot enough to even keep the parraffin melted.</li>
            <li>The newer unit came with a different wax though, much too heavily scented for our preference, and seems to contain more emollient.  </li>
            <li>Took 6 hours to melt the included wax on first try, then 6 hours on next day.</li>
            <li>i bought this product for my mother in law for the mother&#x27;s day, she is 85 years old with arthritis in her hands!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t really big enough to dip your feet, hence only four stars, but I love it for hands.  </li>
            <li>I found the temperature of the wax either too hot or not melted enough.  </li>
            <li>It was such a disaster that I threw the spa bath away after using it the first time.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>the wax does not melt properly and I left this gadget on all day and still the was was solid on top and melting on bottom.</li>
            <li>I was able to use it for both my hands and my feet, but I do have fairly small feet (Women&#x27;s size 6.5 US).</li>
            <li>I was excited by the prospect of getting relief from the pain and stiffness in my hands due to arthritis.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll go back to Tylenol and soaking my hands in hot water..  </li>
            <li>first one lasted 15 years of daily use!</li>
            <li>When I did use it the first time, it took over 3 hours and the wax was still not totally melted!  </li>
            <li>I usually take the lid off, switch the heat bottom to low and let it cool off 10-15 min, until the temp is comfortable for my skin.</li>
            <li>Melts the wax quickly (1hour and half) and it really helps my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>or I can just leave it on high all the time and have wax ready in an instant.</li>
            <li>The offers more in a starter kit than other similar products.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty messy procedure but worth it.  </li>
            <li>I had one like the picture for several years and this is no where near the quality of my first one.  </li>
            <li>should, I had to tap it a few times, but now it works fine.  </li>
            <li>Totally fine for everyday home use</li>
            <li>If the wax is scented, it&#x27;s very lightly because I am sensitive to perfumes and this hasn&#x27;t bothered me in the least.  </li>
            <li>Love dipping my hands in it at night after a hard day&#x27;s work as I use my hands a lot during the day.</li>
            <li>I also use my right hand along with half of a wooden clothes pin to remove the plastic piece that goes over the heating element before putting my right hand in the bag.  </li>
            <li>Works great, we use it for hands,would be small to use for feet unless your feet are small.</li>
            <li>it Talks nearly two hours to heat up.</li>
            <li>Returning second one for a refund, two duds in a row is too much.</li>
            <li>Really hoping my mom can get her money back.</li>
            <li>The machine works very well &amp; the temperature is totally adjustable.</li>
            <li>Ive left this one days straight</li>
            <li>With my old one, it didn&#x27;t matter what the temperature was, it was tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have no trouble dipping my hands into the spa.</li>
            <li>It took over 24 hours to melt the wax and it wasn&#x27;t completely melted.  </li>
            <li>This has completely taken the pain out of my hands.</li>
            <li>So far, I have not had any problems with leaks or spills.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is that it&#x27; s taking a while for the wax to be ready ...</li>
            <li>reply to my email directly, so that I can figure out what to do.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now left it on but have real safety and energy cost concerns about doing that.  </li>
            <li>My hands are so soft.</li>
            <li>I am 59 yrs old and have used my hands alot in my life.</li>
            <li>Can buy directly from Walmart for 24.99 and avoid additional charges from this site.</li>
            <li>For a least an hour or two at a time, I&#x27;m pain free!</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions, but I have tried on three different occasions for hours at a time but can&#x27;t get the wax to melt as much as it should even on the highest setting.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it because it hot too long</li>
            <li>This leaves your hands soooo soft.</li>
            <li>It is very basic but doesn&#x27;t hold much paraffin wax.</li>
            <li>Plus it makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>In fact the wax never did completely melt.  </li>
            <li>I have used this nearly every day since I got it.  </li>
            <li>I works grreat though and wouod recommend it to others who are not so sensitive.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, once the wax had melted the product worked as promised, but I will never have that much time to be present and wait until it can be used.</li>
            <li>Convenient for busy lifestyles.  </li>
            <li>I love to use this  heat my hands in the winter when it is so bitter cold that I feel like I will never feel warm again.</li>
            <li>I nearly seared all the flesh from my hands.  </li>
            <li>The wax takes two hours to completely melt.</li>
            <li>It requires 2 hours for the paraffin to completely heat up.</li>
            <li>Allow yourself extra time to melt the wax if you plan on using it soon unless you plan on leaving it on the whole time.</li>
            <li>and my hands are so soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I am just now getting ready to use it for the second time</li>
            <li>, my hands felt wonderfully soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I love coming home after work and puting my hands in the wax, put use a thick coat to help with the pain in my hands and fingers from the work I do in the warehouse.  </li>
            <li>Works OK, only problem is slow to melt wax, other then that it has worked fine.</li>
            <li>The temperature knob stopped operating, and now I have to unplug it in order to cool it down...</li>
            <li>The wax takes FOREVER to fully melt and then you have to let it cool down a bit, takes attention but once dipped and wrapped my Rheumatoid Arthritis</li>
            <li>If I unplugged it to allow the wax to cool down, the wax just hardened up and was unusable.</li>
            <li>The wax takes abut 2 hours to melt and then it needs to cool down a bit before you can use it.</li>
            <li>a mess to clean up.</li>
            <li>Had previously used one at a friends house and loved it (not sure of the brand)</li>
            <li>One bit of advice - don&#x27;t eat finger food after removing your paraffin, it does leave your hands a bit perfumed and it makes anything you touch taste funny until your hands dry completely.</li>
            <li>only other thing of import is to mention that this unit shipped with a lightly scented wax (\\&quot;rain\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>It was recommended that I use a hot wax treatment on my hands for arthritus and dry skin.</li>
            <li>Made a huge mess!</li>
            <li>I have tried to use it while it is cooling down but that doesn&#x27;t work because the paraffin solidifies quickly.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used a wax dip before, know that it comes off easily; you won&#x27;t be left with a mess.</li>
            <li>The hot wax treatment works better on my hand/finger arthritis than the expensive prescription pain creams and pills my doctor prescribes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that you could get anything larger than a size 7.5 in it comfortably or safely.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it didn&#x27;t heat the wax to such a high temperature.  </li>
            <li>but since then it takes over 6 HOURS!, which makes it not very convenient to use, which I regret as I like the sensation very much</li>
            <li>This product does not heat the paraffin to a high enough temperature.</li>
            <li>; Not true, my Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Quick Heat Paraffin Spa Bath takes 2 hours to heat up.</li>
            <li>If I need to keep the unit off, I usually heat the wax on the stove and then put it in the unit, allowing a couple of hours for the wax temperature to reach the unit&#x27;s programmed temp as indicated by the light on the front.  </li>
            <li>I usually have the wax dip in the evening so that I have a comfortable nights sleep.</li>
            <li>The first time I heated the wax it took the expected 2 hours</li>
            <li>Be careful not to touch the sides or the bottom of the paraffin bath-those areas get hot.</li>
            <li>The high setting is a little too hot for the hands though.  </li>
            <li>It took a long time to first melt the wax, but not s much subsequent times.</li>
            <li>The wax also starts as a few massive blocks that you must tear apart to fit into the bath.</li>
            <li>It is supposed to be totally melted and ready for use within 2 hours of heating it back up.</li>
            <li>they do not even want it back too much hassle but gave me my money back so kudos to Amazon for their customer service</li>
            <li>My other unit is digital and only has a low, medium and hot setting which is too hot for some people.  </li>
            <li>No reason to throw out the wax and start with fresh if a little tweak will solve the problem....</li>
            <li>I am happy to pass this information on to others who also have painful joints.</li>
            <li>The only downside to the Paraffin Spa bath is how long it takes to heat up and be ready to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is lots smaller than my old one.</li>
            <li>Was surprised that this didn&#x27;t heat up enough to melt the wax?</li>
            <li>Hand barely fits &amp; not the wrist.  </li>
            <li>The wax on the initial melt had a perfume like smell and since I am sensitive to that</li>
            <li>It also leaves a tiny bit of the fragrance onto your skin which is soft and soothing.</li>
            <li>It also leaves a tiny bit of the fragrance onto your skin which is soft and soothing.</li>
            <li>I wear a females size 7 1/2 shoe &amp; my foot barely fits into this unit.  </li>
            <li>My foot barely fits into let alone</li>
            <li>Next time I will try another brand at a shop near home.</li>
            <li>you just cant go wrong with a parrafin spa...its a nice slice of heaven every time you use it...</li>
            <li>Kind of a silly thing to happen to a devie that needs to heat up in order to work.</li>
            <li>and then you have to turn it down to the low setting for it to be cool enough to submerge your hand or foot.</li>
            <li>I have gotten adept with using the mitten and it doesn&#x27;t slow me down.</li>
            <li>The Spa bath is almost exactly everything I wanted but not large enough for my foot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I knew it would take a while to get the wax melted down the first time</li>
            <li>It was so hot after being turned down it burned hand.</li>
            <li>I originally got anxious and went to a local Bed Bath and Beyond and purchased the Homedics brand.</li>
            <li>too cumbersome and hard to clean out - did not even use it - did not like the look of the inside - heated coil exposed..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for hand pains and also very dry skin.</li>
            <li>bath is barely big enough for adult hands.</li>
            <li>It keeps my achy cold hands warm and soft.</li>
            <li>Not worth returning it as I would pay just as much in shipping.  </li>
            <li>Wax takes far too long to melt AND from time to time leaks through the bottom of the warmer, regardless of instructions followed.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take too long to heat up &amp; it makes my feet so soft.</li>
            <li>The set up the first time is a bit messy because you have to break the paraffin into 4 sections.</li>
            <li>wish it was a little heavier  or had a bigger platform i bumped it when i was picking my foot up and wore a bunch of hot wax</li>
            <li>/&gt;The heat quickly but melting 2 pkg of wax hard like</li>
            <li>After I do my dips, I&#x27;m ready to start my day with much less pain, and also oils add moisture loss in the winter months..</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know what else to tell you other than she uses it and never complained to me about it.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product, not only for personal use, but at this price and comparison, this would be a good product for a salon, instead of buying those very expensive spa&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I usually dip my left hand about four times, put a bag on it and then do my right hand.  </li>
            <li>It has a temperature control setting-you can turn it up on high to heat the paraffin which can take a couple of hours, and then turn the temperature down</li>
            <li>THIS IS A VERY CHEAP PRODUCT AND THE WAX NEVER MELTS, TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY AND TOTAL WASTE OF TIME!!</li>

            <li> Absolutely amazing</li>
            <li> OMG this is amazing .  </li>
            <li> Item works as described, cheap, efficient, smells great my wife loves it and didn&#x27;t bother having it done at the salon anymore...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted this for a while I really enjoy using its great for my hands since I have carpal tunnel</li>
            <li> But the effects are amazing and that is reason to use the product.  </li>
            <li> It brings amazing comfort to arthritic joints.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take serveral hours to warm all the wax</li>
            <li> Mitts/booties are nice.</li>
            <li> Having this paraffin bath at home is cost effective and convenient.</li>
            <li> I think it would be nice if it came with another pound of wax.</li>
            <li> Your hand has just gotten used to the temperature &amp; it is probably still warm inside.</li>
            <li> any kind of relief as it claimed.  </li>
            <li> the warm wax also help for people that have arthuritis</li>
            <li> I have plugged in my Spa bath for 28 hours now, and the paraffin wax is barely warm.</li>
            <li> wait to get this, you will use it more often and get that great salon treatment more frequetly than you expect.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if it could melt the paraffin wax quicker</li>
            <li> Packaging was nice, wax smelled nice, so I followed the instructions and plugged it in.</li>
            <li> Nice unit for the price.</li>
            <li> It takes about 2 hours to completely warm up.  </li>
            <li> The warm wax helps my arthritis</li>
            <li> But this is so nice.</li>
            <li> I figured it&#x27;d also feel nice after giving myself a pedicure.</li>
            <li> Liked the scented wax that came with the product and</li>
            <li> My daughter got to it before I did and took it as her own.  </li>
            <li> his whole family does so happy i found it!!!</li>
            <li> Some people complain about the time it takes to warm up the wax.</li>
            <li> nice size.  </li>
            <li> Nice at home treatment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a handy unit that I carry with me to all of my health fairs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and I liked it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this has done the trick, but so far so good -- and it is wonderfully comforting.  </li>
            <li> I kind of like the smell...</li>
            <li> Dip them in the nice warm paraffin once or twice and let it absorb.  </li>
            <li> Sooo nice and warm and takes away pain.  </li>
            <li> Been using it to help warm and moisturize my hands after working with soil and water during the day.  </li>
            <li> An on/off switch would have been nice, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a necessity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used a candy thermometer and it registered 144 degrees, again this was on the keep warm setting.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just nice to have others doing it for me.</li>
            <li> .. Came with plastic packs and a nice glove...</li>
            <li> The warm parafin wax helps in easing some of the discomfort</li>
            <li> Nice to have choice of temperature.</li>
            <li> It is a very good spa for the money, the wax gets quite hot, and the mitts are really nice....</li>
            <li> it is a great product and the price was right!</li>
            <li> Great product; heats quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and feels so good.</li>
            <li> It easy to use and my hands and feet feel so good after using it.  </li>
            <li> This easy to use Paraffin Spa Bath is good for hands,feet and elbows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Meets the needs I purchased it for and very easy to maintain and use.</li>
            <li> It work well and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a very easy machine to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This takes forever to heat up and the wax has a very strong odor of petroleum.  </li>
            <li> Love Love this item!</li>
            <li> I regret having to return it and it looked fine, wax smelled good, and I was dying to try it.</li>
            <li> Works well, wife likes it, came on time and heats very good, price was reasonable</li>
            <li> , so I went to a beauty supply store and purchased some that I liked better.</li>
            <li> It does takes an hour or more to warm the paraffin, so keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old unit (Homedics) with this one, and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> The temperature is perfect and the wax, gloves and hand-warmer mittens make the spa treatment complete.</li>
            <li> The wax does leave your hands a bit greasy, but it&#x27;s a good massage oil and your hands feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Once you get the wax melted and the temperature just right, the results are great.  </li>
            <li> my hands are pretty beat up, the spa bath helps a great deal.</li>
            <li> sweet and well packaged for a good price.</li>
            <li> Very light weight.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t care for the strong rose smelling paraffin wax.</li>
            <li> this was not a task happily done.&lt;br /&gt;Although the wax has a pleasant aroma, it is far too strong.  </li>
            <li> Customers were very satisfied as long as they are happy &amp; pleased I am also very pleased and confident in the product .</li>
            <li> I worked for the that very first time, and that was it!!  </li>
            <li> The wax doesn&#x27;t smell very good - like an old lady perfume.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I love it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy I went this way instead of going bigger.</li>
            <li> Lid does not snap on but lies on top of tub</li>
            <li> the paraffin melted as described and I was pleased with the treatment on my fingers.</li>
            <li> Now my hands are nice and smooth with the waxy compound that remained after cracking off the cooled</li>
            <li> really feels great,</li>
            <li> Scholl is visually appealing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I have this at home.  </li>
            <li> Then the top layer of wax started to harden before I could use it.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;m well pleased.</li>
            <li> I have not used the product for more than one week and it stopped functioning...</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t faulty -- but I feel it could be a lot better.</li>
            <li> I love this machine.  </li>
            <li> If you keep your fingers apart it will build up wax between them as well as on the top and bottom.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased at Amazon as I do many items.</li>
            <li> your feet/.hands feel better and softer</li>
            <li> How I am going to pay more for something that does not work.</li>
            <li> All enjoyed their results.  </li>
            <li> I wish I used it more often.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hands feel so much better.    </li>
            <li> Be sure to remove everything from inside the spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I  twist the baggie top around my wrist then place my hand into a mitten.</li>
            <li> but I love doing needlework.</li>
            <li> It is such a wonderful feeling.</li>
            <li> Needs more than 3 pounds of paraffin though.</li>
            <li> Love to come home and soak my hands in this spa bath.  </li>
            <li> love it.  </li>
            <li> It works great, my hands are much softer and healing.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Really glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> Love this hand spa</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> was wondering if I can order more wax.</li>
            <li> I am using it for my arthritic hands and they do feel better when finished.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Love, Love Love it.</li>
            <li> I love using this.  </li>
            <li> heats up in 10 min or so love that it doesn&#x27;t create steam.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife&#x27;s birthday, as she had asked for one.&lt;br /&gt;Works great, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> and we both love it.</li>
            <li> My hands look much better now.</li>
            <li> i like it a lot but wish there was more control of the temperature.</li>
            <li> We tried everything within reason but the switch is defective and we are returning it for a unit of much better quality.</li>
            <li> Beyond that, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I love this and use it all the time.  </li>
            <li> I love that it came with paraffin.</li>
            <li> I love mine.</li>
            <li> This is better for hands and wrists.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love these spas.  </li>
            <li> Ok for the price.</li>
            <li> I actually love this warmer.</li>
            <li> It dumped most of wax on counter top.</li>
            <li> Okay but too time consuming.  </li>
            <li> My arthritic hands feel so much better since I have been using this paraffin bath.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love it...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Three would be better.</li>
            <li> This is not a Saturn V rocket or a sophisticated particle accelerator.</li>
            <li> I love love love my spa bath, I use it for my hands</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Takes a while to heat up, but works ok.</li>
            <li> I love amazon because they deliver on time every time</li>
            <li> I should have read more closely.  </li>
            <li> I rated ths OK because the problem is with me.</li>
            <li> I have a 10 1/2 foot and it does not come close to fitting.</li>
            <li> I love the lid as well.</li>
            <li> but it seems I have used it more.</li>
            <li> The replacement arrived two days later in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> They are so enjoyable to hold and kiss.  </li>
            <li> This is actually better than doing the treatment at a spa.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect size for personal use and even for feet women&#x27;s 7.</li>
            <li> We picked this one mostly based on price comparison on the day I did the research.  </li>
            <li> I can see why they have a warning about touching the sides of the unit,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that had I kept it indoors</li>
            <li> but its just like what they use in a real spa and worked great on my feet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a month or more</li>
            <li> but... I bought this one because of the size they said it was, so my husband would be able to use it as well......</li>
            <li> ON or wax will get a skim on top.  </li>
            <li> This is Ok but the temperature flustuates, you need to use more wax than what shipped with the bath itself.</li>
            <li> I love my spa bath kit and the fragrant paraffin that came with it.</li>
            <li> It cost more than the oldone, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I have tried this for two or more weeks.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I Love</li>
            <li> I love the dial feature that controls temperature.  </li>
            <li> I had surgery in 2012 to repair two tendons in my pinky finger, and have endured more than a year of occupational therapy to get the hand working again.</li>
            <li> Much better</li>
            <li> -o much better after a wax dip</li>
            <li> Love the &amp;#34;rain&amp;#34; scented wax that came with the wax warmer.</li>
            <li> It is also better than any pill I have ever taken.</li>
            <li> I love this paraffin bath, it&#x27;s basically a crock pot dedicated just to wax.</li>
            <li> It also keeps my hands more limber.</li>
            <li> I drop items that I used to be able to carry to the fridge.. yogurt etc.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for better.</li>
            <li> and I love how the glove works on my hand, at therapy they just wrap my hand in a towel.</li>
            <li> This is the best way to thaw back out again.</li>
            <li> My Sons love to use it.</li>
            <li> It is a family favorite.</li>
            <li> Thicker wax is much more moisturizing</li>
            <li> Thicker wax is much more moisturizing</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of several brands and Dr. Scholl&#x27;s seemed to be the best buy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely more for hands than feet.</li>
            <li> I love this paraffin spa.  </li>
            <li> If you want it for your hands only it will be perfect.  </li>
            <li> I love the scented smell and ordered more scented wax.  </li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t too many of these spa baths on the market</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my paraffin warmer.</li>
            <li> I am glad I ordered this and am going to get one for my mom also.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy the hand spa!</li>
            <li> you... have already bought booties and more parafin for this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Louisa</li>

            <li> It is really good exact what I need and the price is wonderfull</li>
            <li> Ours worked good at first, then started leaking.</li>
            <li> Be aware that it will take a good 2 hours for the paraffin blocks to melt.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price!!</li>
            <li> I am still  using original wax pack!</li>
            <li> To get the wax off easily you need to put more than one coat of the wax on.</li>
            <li> Aside from the wax/unit smelling strongly of burnt diesel, it was ok.</li>
            <li> It came very quickly and well packed for a safe arrival.</li>
            <li> I am NOT happy happy happy!</li>

            <li> /&gt;Lastly, and this is most important, there is no on/off dial or switch.</li>
            <li> I had a hand &amp;#34;bath&amp;#34; many years ago and remembered how fabulous it was.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that there are so many baggies that come with this, and the fact that it comes with a full set of wax.</li>
            <li> Safety warnings and cautions about using hot wax very appropriate.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much, that I also bought my Mom one for Mother&#x27;s Day</li>
            <li> one of the treatments was a paraffin bath-i saw this&lt;br /&gt;one for sale on Amazon and purchased it-works as good as the one at the hospital and really helps with the pain in his hands</li>
            <li> It melts the wax in about three hours, the instructions are easy and clear and it works great.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s very light, it is not greasy and leaves your hands feeling clean afterwards with no residue which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s very light, it is not greasy and leaves your hands feeling clean afterwards with no residue which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes away the pain and leaves you feeling soft and smooth!!!  </li>
            <li> the wax that is included smells very nice too, and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is working perfectly for our purposes.</li>
            <li> It is the best thirty dollars I&#x27;ve spent in awhile!</li>
            <li> When you plug it in It takes like a full day to melt the wax!</li>
            <li> The bath is very light, even while full of wax.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle,</li>
            <li> Easy to set up, operate and store (after cooling)</li>
            <li> The wax refills are also easy to use and come with the liners.    </li>
            <li> Easy to use, serves the purpose, alleviates my joint pains.</li>
            <li> I do wish it came with more wax, the 3lbs only lasts for a couple of waxes but for the price I would say that I got a great deal.</li>
            <li> Easy to follow instructions.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The machine is so easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to operate.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to use and did the job.</li>
            <li> It was easy to set up and easy to use</li>
            <li> The strong scent of the wax bothered my asthma.  </li>
            <li> But, the scent is not overly strong at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the scent is not overly strong at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find the very reasonably priced Dr. Scholl&#x27;s paraffin spa bath.  </li>
            <li> Worked fine once</li>
            <li> and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> The machine itself is fine.</li>
            <li> , it is hotter, but it heats evenly, quicker, and has been just fine.</li>
            <li> &gt; - Microplane 35002 Home Series Fine Grater (meant for food, I know..</li>
            <li> This wax heater seems to be fine in it;s operation and is as stated.</li>
            <li> Everything appears to work fine.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this bath because the wax truly melts quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Quick Heat Paraffin Bath Spa because it relieves arthritis pain in my hands.  </li>
            <li> Bonus, my manicure seems to stay nice longer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic hand covers and the insulated mitts are also a great part of the deal because it makes it mess free AND keeps in the warmth for the 15 minutes I leave the Paraffin on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> One of the reviews indicated that this product had a smooth easy to clean interior.</li>
            <li> I have early stages of RA in my hands and the heat from the paraffin has provided excellent relief (and my hands are soft as a baby&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li> Great product, but just a tad smaller than I like.</li>
            <li> I suppose you could double-dip if your feet didn&#x27;t fit in one go, though.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it everyday since, and it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be too cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Clean up is easy.</li>
            <li> We really wanted one with a timer so it could shut off (or turn on) on its own</li>
            <li> Always check that the wax temperature is comfortable  for you before using.</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s top quality - absolutely worth the money</li>
            <li> The power light came on but it did not produce any heat.</li>
            <li> The variable temperature control is fantastic -</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoy my wax bath both for my hand and my feet.</li>
            <li> I have gotten extra wax and it works great as well.</li>
            <li> The theraputic warm wax is very healing.</li>
            <li> The wax seems to have some kind of oil in it that is very healing.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> A great relief from the deep continuous ache of arthritic thumb joints.</li>
            <li> Having used it every day for several weeks, I can truly say it has helped greatly.  </li>
            <li> Also, the size can fit an 8 1/2 foot size for waxing my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the price it does a great job and definitely helping the arthritis in my hands and also my husbands.  </li>
            <li> The description said hands and feet would fit.</li>
            <li> My hands and feet stay silky smooth for weeks after.</li>
            <li> warm paraffin is very soothing.</li>
            <li> I was  using the supplied 3 bars of wax per the instructions said to use, and there was a &amp;#34;Max&amp;#34; guideline level for the wax on the inside of the tub that it was filled up to</li>
            <li> Does make the skin smooth, but</li>
            <li> Using a scrub on your hands and applying a generous layer of hand cream on the hands prior to dipping allows for a great experience when the wax comes off.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made product.</li>
            <li> The wax that comes in the kit has a very lavender smell to it, but it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and comes with plenty of bags.</li>
            <li> also I can fit my size 8 foot in comfortably.</li>
            <li> I am not going to get rid of it because my skin is smooth</li>
            <li> It is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li> Eventhough the heating light came on when plugged in, the heating element did not ever heat.</li>
            <li> Great product - 2nd one-</li>
            <li> I will keep it and enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect miracles, just good old fashioned comfort.</li>
            <li> I am surprised to receive this machine in a good size, nice looking and with all the accessory I needed to use it with just a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hands feels soft and smells good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> As for complaints about wax scent, it smells good to me, but if you know you are sensitive to scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it so much I need to look for more wax:)</li>
            <li> I think if the kit had at least 1 more brick of paraffin wax it would have been perfect.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> This looks good so far</li>
            <li> For a cheap parrafin spa bath, this is worth buying!</li>
            <li> Thanks - works good &amp; got it fast!  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and melts the wax quickly.  </li>
            <li> If you like the idea of dipping your hands in hot wax and having them come out smooth and supple when you are done, you will love it too.</li>
            <li> It needs quite some time to warm up the wax even on high but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, only it takes almost two  hours to  melt the wax , good product, I like it.</li>
            <li> The product is other wise outstanding and highly easy to use and understand.</li>
            <li> Was so excited to receive this as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Small for the feet, but perfect if you want it for your hands.</li>
            <li> And a plastic shell, remember to melt the wax first before putting the plastic shell, then you hand, the shell is to prevent you hands from touching the heat cores at the bottom of wax</li>
            <li> I love this and would absolutely buy again!</li>
            <li> Its also a great excuse to sit unbothered for 30 minutes with the product on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So after returning it, I did what I should have done in the first place and ordered this one off amazon and to this day have been extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> I love putting my hands in the hot wax.  </li>
            <li> Unit works fine comes up to temp fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Ordered the item and was excited about the temperature control feature.  </li>
            <li> After the first use, it never quite melted the wax any more.  </li>
            <li> The softness lasts for a really long time and the warmth is great for my arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> DOES A GREAT JOB ON DRY CHAPPED HANDS.  </li>
            <li> It feels great and helps if you have arthritic hands and also helps dry skin on hands and feet.</li>
            <li> and I had to clean it up before using it.</li>
            <li> This product is great for dry hands</li>
            <li> And, her hands are so soft, smooth, and nice smelling.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how to describe the scent, and when I saw that they called it &amp;#34;Rain scent&amp;#34;, I was a bit surprised as it smells a bit more like clean cotton to me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to clean it yet</li>
            <li> When done dipping and sitting with the warm wax on your hands, it leaves hands soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but if I turn it up to heat it more quickly, it is way too hot for me.</li>
            <li> Reviewers who mentioned the strong odor of the wax that comes with this are right.</li>
            <li> and he was right!</li>
            <li> Feels very nice and helps my dry hands a lot.</li>
            <li> This wax heating machine is great because it melts the 3 pounds of wax provided very quickly in about one half hour</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this so quickly, but after having it a week I can say this is no deal.</li>
            <li> Although my husband liked the warmth, he said he got as much relief washing dishes in hot water.</li>
            <li> I am not sure it would cure the problem, but making her happy is just as important!  </li>
            <li> This is great for arthritis or rough skin.</li>
            <li> really like the way this makes my skin feel, though it seems to work better if you put lotion on before dipping in the wax.  </li>
            <li> The description states a waiting time of 2-3 hours, meanwhile, I have to wait a FULL day for the wax to melt.</li>
            <li> This bath is inexpensive and does a good job of melting the wax and keeping it at a constant temperature so you can dip in whenever you want.  </li>
            <li> I ENJOYED SO MUCH</li>
            <li> I love it so much .</li>
            <li> but I have used it with the full heat setting too.  </li>
            <li> However, the disadvantage is that it takes a full two hours to heat the paraffin.</li>
            <li> I still could not cover my own hand completely.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it made my hands feel and the wax softness does seem to last about a day.</li>
            <li> allows for some real luxury at home for sure.  </li>
            <li> It makes my feet feel sooooo good, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> I will try to use it more often to see if there is a real benefit.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad price either.</li>
            <li> The price was surprisingly not bad and the wax can be reused</li>
            <li> The wax that comes with the package is strong smelling at first</li>
            <li> Melts pretty quickly and easy to store.  </li>
            <li> I get very dry hands in the Winter time, and this product is by far the best thing that I have used to fix that issue.</li>
            <li> Stays warm and is the perfect size, not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li> The wax gets pretty hot at highest melting setting, so I need to let it cool a bit WITH TOP</li>
            <li> It may be fine for cosmetic use, but it is ineffective for applications requiring higher heat</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice such and am quite happy with the whole purchase.  </li>
            <li> Works great, I would recommend getting extra wax because it goes fast</li>
            <li> I keep it on warm setting and it&#x27;s always ready when I&#x27;m ready to use it.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly, plenty of room for hands or feet.  </li>
            <li> And it says \\&quot; quick heat\\&quot; ;0)</li>
            <li> but that is the fault of the Dr Scholl&#x27;s Co for stating Quick Heat.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> 3 lbs is not enough wax for the bath it needs more to be more</li>
            <li> It has multiple heat settings, and can fit up to a lady&#x27;s size 91/2 shoe in it.&lt;br /&gt;The mitts are nice and comfy.</li>
            <li> the dimensions are adequate for size 8 feet and medium sized hand...</li>
            <li> I have owned the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Quick Heat Paraffin Spa Bath three times now.</li>
            <li> Not so quick to heat</li>
            <li> i use the quick heat paraffin spa bath.</li>
            <li> so smaller womans hand might work a lot better, but just a bit more wax would help.</li>
            <li> I can understand the bottom of the unit being hot (thus the plastic plate) but the top should not be so hot as to harm the skin.</li>
            <li> The paraffin bath has been tremendous.....</li>
            <li> The 3 temperatures help me to adjust quickly.  </li>
            <li> Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Quick Heat Paraffin Spa Bath says  it is a &amp;#34;quick heat[er].&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It reduces the swelling and pain quickly.</li>
            <li> Nothing quick about this.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind the heat of it wasn&#x27;t that it felt like it was burning (which it was mildly)</li>
            <li> This is done quickly</li>
            <li> After 5 hours on the high setting, the wax still had not melted into more than an inch of liquid.</li>
            <li> It does get very hot</li>
            <li> I like it very hot</li>
            <li> and it DOES get VERY hot so do use caution</li>
            <li> Wax gets very hot.</li>
            <li> The paraffin does not get very hot.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Leaked out of the bottom on the very first use.  </li>
            <li> The gift recipient seems to like it very much!</li>
            <li> For less than $30 this seemed great and it is.</li>
            <li> We got it at a great price, I think it was $10 less than it is advertised now.</li>
            <li> The melted paraffin is much too hot and I wasn&#x27;t able to use it.</li>
            <li> It works fine; a bit of trouble to use the first time, but as time goes on it will be great.  </li>
            <li> It takes at least an hour to heat up, but it feels wonderful once the wax is hot.  </li>
            <li> It was always way too hot!</li>
            <li> Gets way too hot!  </li>
            <li> When I went to put my hands in it, it was really hot!  </li>
            <li> Only wish it came with a bit more wax, but no complaints!</li>
            <li> It heats fast and helps ease her arthritis in her hands!!</li>
            <li> Its great in the winter for when her hands and feet start to dry out and crack, this really helps to moisturize and soothe the pain.</li>
            <li> Takes too much time to heat the paraffin, but works fine.</li>
            <li> heated up just fine - wax included is very soapy.  </li>
            <li> has made a huge difference for me - I do it on a weekly basis now and doing so much better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works great for smoothing skin by pulling dead stuff off.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it every once in a while to make my hands really soft.me to preheat it</li>
            <li> Messy to use,  Feels great on hands.</li>
            <li> This takes A LOT longer than it should to warm up, even when I break the wax into smaller pieces.  </li>
            <li> There is no off button; there is only warm to hot.&lt;br /&gt;2)  </li>
            <li> We had been very pleased with the first one, which was often used multiple times each day (</li>
            <li> What a fun way to pamper yourself.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s well worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> By the time it was warm enough the wax had started melting.</li>
            <li> The scent is a nice extra and it softens my hands, feet and elbows which as you move up the ladder seems to be a dire necessity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so its completely worth the effort.</li>
            <li> This is also nice for a treat for myself without having to leave home to pay the extra $$ to go to the spa.</li>
            <li> leaves your hands wonderfully soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> It helps with the pain but also makes his hand soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> NIce item to keep your hands really soft and doesn&#x27;t take up much room in the bath.  </li>
            <li> the more sensitive parts of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> warm setting only.  </li>
            <li> Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> now my star is quite off the chart it isn&#x27;t worth buying DON&#x27;T</li>
            <li> BUT,  the tub absorbed the smell of the scented wax packaged in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> came with the scented wax packaged in the wax bath tub, so that the tub absorbed  the scent of the scented wax.</li>
            <li> I love how really soft the Paraffin Spa Bath makes my hands feel.</li>
            <li> I have been experiencing some hand pain and it was recommended that I get a spa bath (I tried one at the physical therapist and liked it).  </li>
            <li> You can optionally use lotion on your hands before dipping (lotion is not included here) for extra moisturizing if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax that comes with it  has a very light clean scent to it.</li>
            <li> It is also extremely oily once you peel the wax off, but that just means more moisture for you hand :).</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping as well!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers noted, it takes a good 2 hours for the wax to melt.</li>
            <li> I sometimes dip my hands right before bed since I won&#x27;t be using them.  </li>
            <li> : I dip my right hand into the spa twice, wait 20 seconds then cover it in a plastic baggie.</li>
            <li> I like it because it comes with everything that you need to start right away since you buy it.</li>
            <li> price is right, quality is marginal.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that sometimes the was feels to hot when in the warm setting.</li>
            <li> I had to continue to turn it to high to get the heat light to come on.  </li>
            <li> This heat paraffin spa bath is just fine, once the wax is hot, but it takes 2 hours to heat it up, so you cannot use it spur of the moment unless you keep it on, so then you need to find a place to keep it, plugged in and hot and ready to use.  </li>
            <li> The first time, once the wax finally all melted, it was too hot, so I turned it to the keep warm setting, as instructed.  </li>
            <li> and I bought more through a different site where it is cheaper and was pleasantly surprised that it came with more plastic bags.  </li>
            <li> The benefits of this product are worth this reasonable price !</li>
            <li> That is quite long - otherwise it&#x27;s a nice unit.  </li>
            <li> I leave my paraffin bath thawed and warm on the counter all winter long.</li>
            <li> My foot is size 8 1/2 and felt like I could barely fit it in the tub unless I turned it a certain way, completely straight as it&#x27;s oval shaped.</li>
            <li> wax that comes with the spa smells nice to me and the thermal gloves (mittens sans the thumb) that came with it where large enough to cover my feet</li>
            <li> hot wax melted all right, all over my kidtchen</li>
            <li> I also found it to be very helpful after I had surgery on my thumb for arthritis and needed to warm my hand before doing my physical therapy exercises.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27; s easy to do and no messy at all.</li>
            <li> Between the skin burn, issues with heating the wax properly, and nauseating stench, I&#x27;d much rather spend a little more and get something I&#x27;ll be happy with.</li>
            <li> and she enjoys it very much.</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s very very</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to how the product works generally, as I think mine must have been defective, but what a pain to clean up!</li>
            <li> Followed directions exactly to use it the first time, went to check on it after about 45min</li>
            <li> I was dipping my hands in the hot bath.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more than enough for home use!!</li>
            <li> The plastic part that you put in the bottom should set up higher and not touch the heating element.</li>
            <li> Maybe a different brand of wax would be better</li>
            <li> As a sufferer of arhtritis in my fingers and hands, someone suggested I try hot wax and</li>
            <li> The hot is burning hot.</li>
            <li> Works well and leaves your skin hydrated, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice for rough hands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The hot is HOT.</li>
            <li> The unit leaks hot wax</li>
            <li> A friend recommended hot wax treatment - and this unit is just what I needed.  </li>
            <li> The first time it was plugged in, it leaked wax all over my counter.  </li>
            <li> But once it&#x27;s ready, the fun begins.  </li>
            <li> but then it is scalding hot when you put your hand or foot in.  </li>
            <li> (Note-my daughter said it was too hot for her.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first, the dial for the heater seemed to not be cycling at it</li>
            <li> She fractured her ankle and hot wax</li>
            <li> but I know not everyone can tolerate it that hot -</li>
            <li> , it is hot wax, afterall.  </li>
            <li> After the wax was melted it was too hot to use</li>
            <li> I knew it was just to hot</li>
            <li> It was just too hot.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased 2 more as gifts for my mother and mother im law.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance after reading the mixed reviews.  </li>
            <li> You have to grit your teeth the first time you use it, but once you dip your hand in, the paraffin insulates you from the heat when you dip again.</li>
            <li> It does heat up in exactly 2 hours just like it says.</li>
            <li> was the first of 2 paraffin baths that were defective.  </li>
            <li> After using it the first time, I shut it off, per instructions, however it took 5-6 hours to remelt the wax.  </li>
            <li> The wax was just too hot and the switch would not stay on.  </li>
            <li> It gets way to hot</li>
            <li> Absolute joke!</li>
            <li> Then the second one would never heat the top layer of wax.  </li>
            <li> I FIRST TRIED THE PARAFIN</li>
            <li> Wax was way too hot.  </li>
            <li> first thing every morning and have no pain the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> So make sure to plug in hours before you actually want to use.</li>
            <li> It is hot but not  burn your skin hot.  </li>
            <li> First time had a pool of wax under the bottom, and leaked around guage.</li>
            <li> Wax, even on the &amp;#34;keep warm&amp;#34; setting was too hot to be usable.  </li>
            <li> I had one that I bought at Sally&#x27;s (a different brand) that I love.  </li>
            <li> I needed something to help my eczema and it has really helped!</li>
            <li> Instructions were paraffin soaked and illegible,but using it is pretty intuitive.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try paraffin wax on a more regular, cost efficient basis as I&#x27;ve had it before during a mani pedi.</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not too hot when you use it.</li>
            <li> I gave away the first two.</li>
            <li> the first use.</li>
            <li> Thanks Dr. Scholl&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> The first unit was damaged in transit.</li>
            <li> They love the multiple temperature settings.</li>
            <li> However it works well and was a gift to someone with severe arthritis who absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> According to the directions the heating time until first use can take up to just over 2 hours.</li>
            <li> Dip 4-5 times in the wax and finally let it sit on my hands and provide heat and relaxation to my hand for about 10-15 minutes (I get restless not being able to move my hands).</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it every once in a while to make my hands really soft.</li>
            <li> It is either too hot or it goes off.  </li>
            <li> After several hours, the wax was mostly melted and I tried it out.</li>
            <li> I turned it up first thing this morning</li>
            <li> Its hot out in Texas</li>
            <li> After using the paraffin bath the first time, i&#x27;ve taken just one dose of medicine.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and exactly how it was described in the ad.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 2 more, one for my daughter and one for my daughter - in - law for Christmas presents along with extra wax.</li>
            <li> First time buyer of this type product.  </li>
            <li> EXACTLY</li>
            <li> Ive used it several times and I love it.</li>
            <li> It gets too hot to use even when you use the keep</li>
            <li> Melted wax is too hot.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for still selling it, though!</li>
            <li> Gets pretty got</li>
            <li> Fo leg, I have to do first for ties and then for heel.</li>
            <li> Yes, it takes two hours to heat up the wax the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> Thermostat works well to keep it from getting too hot.</li>
            <li> Paraffin will get too hot to apply it immediately.</li>
            <li> The hand one is so relaxing and makes your hands feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love this bath except I should have gone bigger....</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom to use and the few times that she has used it she has absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> Also does a nice job of moisturizing dry skin as well!!  </li>
            <li> If you get pedicures on a normal basis, you know that the cost of a &amp;#34;spa pedicure package&amp;#34; can add up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> You can easily use it everywhere, it&#x27;s not as heavy as the pro&#x27;s and still has their healthy effects with the warmness of your home.</li>
            <li> Maybe I wasn&#x27;t using this right, but it really burned my hands.</li>
            <li> Soak feet in very warm water for at least 5 minutes before using. )</li>
            <li> Other than that the machine worked well and the hot wax felt great on my super dry hands.</li>
            <li> At first the wax smell strange but after melted it smell better, I should say acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t believe something with such good reviews could be such a pain.</li>
            <li> I definitely advise to anyone who is sensitive to scents to purchase their own unscented wax because the &amp;#34;rain&amp;#34; scented wax  </li>
            <li> Feels so good since I had a car accident and extensive surgery on my left hand..</li>
            <li> Everything was positive except stated that it took 2 hours to heat up.</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying the nice results on my hands which need the moisture and heat due to dry skin and arthritis.  </li>
            <li> but it didnt get too hot and worked very well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, the product is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty much a crockpot sans the removable bowl.</li>
            <li> When it is ready, the wax is really hot even at the lowest level, but at the lowest level the wax is hardening again.</li>
            <li> Gently dip your hand in the melted wax over &amp; over until there is a good solid white covering on all the fingers &amp; the hand.</li>
            <li> The mitts that are included are a bit small, but that&#x27;s good for those who have clients/patients who are petite.</li>
            <li> If the tub is full, it takes about 2-3 hours to melt completely.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with a similar problem-it is easy to use and really works-i would also recommend purchasing extra parrafin at the same time to more easily cover the hands-love this product</li>
            <li> It works well for hands and smaller size feet, but the pain of having to clean it isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> I have been wanting one for a very long time and am completely satisfied with this machine.</li>
            <li> Once the warming light goes back on, I know the wax is not too hot to use.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and only takes two hours to heat up.  </li>
            <li> Really like &amp;#34;foot fixer&amp;#34; better for long heat and soak.</li>
            <li> I had to open windows to air the smell and couldn&#x27;t use it because of the strong odor.</li>
            <li> but it is amply large to do so.  </li>
            <li> I accidentally scalded a large section of my wrist when I was removing my hand from the tub.</li>
            <li> and  is not as large.</li>
            <li> Went back to the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s and love this new one.</li>
            <li> Worked fine once, then the next time I plugged it in the lights came one</li>
            <li> hands get very dry in the winter and my feet always are, so I&#x27;ve been wanting something that will work better than lotions or body</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it melted the paraffin a little faster.</li>
            <li> When the wax is no longer feels warm, leave it on for a little while longer.</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful when you have been out in the cold</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this</li>
            <li> I found it easier this way because I did it myself and how the heck can you do your whole foot at a time, you need some part of your foot to put on the ground when you take your foot out of the bath.</li>
            <li> Don’t know how I would have done my whole foot by myself.</li>
            <li> Very soothing.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact it has variable heat settings.  </li>
            <li> This paraffin spa bath works very well..</li>
            <li> and it really soothes my arthritic hand.</li>
            <li> Really eases the arthritis pain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too much.</li>
            <li> Even after getting as much of the wax as I could out of the machine &amp; refilling it with unscented wax, the smell still lingers.</li>
            <li> SOFTEN THE PALMS AND HELPS THE MOISTURIZER SOAK INTO THE SKIN MUCH QUICKER</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really find anything like this.</li>
            <li> More pain relieving than I expected.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s much easier to use</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to use this as a weekly routine to help my hand dryness and arthritis.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing  before my exercises for arthritis in my hand</li>
            <li> It did more than I expected.  </li>
            <li> The procedure went smoothly I am very grateful I forgot to ask a 220 volt machine</li>
            <li> but I succeed to find an adaptor quit fast.</li>
            <li> Also it is very flowery</li>
            <li> Really helps soothe my achy hands</li>
            <li> Very displeased with the machine and Amazon.</li>
            <li> It takes quite a while for the wax to melt so we don&#x27;t use it as often as we might if the whole process were quicker.</li>
            <li> So now I finally got the satin smooth one</li>
            <li> Wax melted fast.</li>
            <li> I have to turn it on when I leave for work and hope it&#x27;s ready by the time I get home.</li>
            <li> Parent was very please.</li>
            <li> Much to my shugrin</li>
            <li> Very helpful to ease tension and sensitivity form carpal tunnel syndrome.</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference</li>
            <li> It is very comforting.</li>
            <li> I use this for my hands that really hurt in winter.</li>
            <li> The shipping was so fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used more expensive ones and the only difference is that this one is not as deep and holds 3lbs of paraffin, but everything else about this warmer is excellent.</li>
            <li> I shall keep using it because it is very soothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> WORKS REALLY WELL.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend of mine who absolutely loves the way it has made her hands and feet feel.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I have use it often and it really helps with my circulation in my hands.</li>
            <li> it was much faster.</li>
            <li> It takes 2 hours for the wax to melt which is one reason why I am not using it as much as I&#x27;d like to.</li>
            <li> This paraffin bath is compact enough to fit any space.</li>
            <li> It is really helpful.</li>
            <li> I purchased primarily for my hands anyway, so not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> After unplugging it, and plugging it back in, the heater light no longer turns on at all and the wax sits there.</li>
            <li> This unit requires too much work before and after.</li>
            <li> It is really reasonably priced and works really well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for a Speddy delivery...</li>
            <li> Really helped my  hands.</li>
            <li> She really likes it.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> It really stunk up the bathroom</li>
            <li> It really does Help your hands.</li>
            <li> Very dissappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> The entire spa is sturdy yet light plastic.</li>
            <li> We will perfume the yard instead of the whole house.</li>
            <li> and i haven&#x27;t had as much relieve as i do now.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really help the reason I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> People with arthritis, such as husband, can no longer get a foot comfortably into the basin.  </li>
            <li> It really has helped him with the circulation and softening of  his hand.  </li>
            <li> If you have sore hands for whatever reason or even just cold achy hands, this product is superb.  </li>
            <li> It is VERY</li>
            <li> Takes hours to get the wax melted and ready for use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much easier to remove from your hands when you are done with the treatment.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much easier to remove from your hands when you are done with the treatment.  </li>
            <li> Very dodgy purchase.</li>
            <li> The wax that was provided with the system is very oily which I do not like</li>
            <li> It is a real blessing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ready when you need it.  </li>
            <li> Its excellant, took the aches and pain out of my hands and the oils left on my hands after taking wax off helped smooth my skin.</li>
            <li> Very affordable price too.</li>
            <li> but once it is ready each can be done in its turn.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Nice item, but a bit messy</li>
            <li> It has a pair of soft gloves and enough wax and liners to get you thru many paraffin sessions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this since Monday (almost every day) and so far I love it.  </li>
            <li> I DECIDED I MUST HAVE MY OWN, ESPECIALLY SINCE ONLY ONE HAND WAS BEING TREATED THERE.</li>
            <li> I soaked my hands every night for a few weeks and to be honest all the aches and pains have gone away.</li>
            <li> Slow to heat out, but feels good and lessens the arthritic pain in my hands.</li>
            <li> A good product but slow to melt the paraffin wax.</li>
            <li> Therefore the wax did not even get warm, much less melt!</li>
            <li> I have helped fellow musicians warm up sore stiff hands with this as well.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that there&#x27;s no off switch, other than that it works good.</li>
            <li> My physical therapist had me use his professional quality paraffin bath, and I decided I needed one at home, but I saw online that his model cost far more than I was willing to pay.</li>
            <li> Walmart and other stores sell this at some times for 10 dollars more.</li>
            <li> As per some other comments, unscented wax would be better, but if you order wax separately you&#x27;ll want to use the unscented stuff.</li>
            <li> now i use this every day or other day and it makes my hands so much better.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use it and bought extra wax, gloves, liners, etc.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a lot better than other brand names.</li>
            <li> The variable heat setting was the major reason I went with this specific unit, and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I was glad I listened to other reviews on the smell and bought wax (and bags) with no odor, just didn&#x27;t relized needed 3 lbs.</li>
            <li> but I just added a few more ounces of wax to cover a higher section on the wrist.</li>
            <li> Also, it is apparently a decent price for these types of things, I really can&#x27;t afford to spend hundreds of dollars on a thing to melt wax...</li>
            <li> Seems that the 3 lbs that comes with it is only good for about half a dozen applications.  </li>
            <li> Seemed to melt quickly the first time, but now it takes so long</li>
            <li> Regardless of this minor inconvenience, I&#x27;ll continue to use it and enjoy the benefits.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using my hand spa on a weekly basis to ease the arthritis in my hands and the aches after a long days work as well as with my hobbies.</li>
            <li> I have to unplug the unit and let it sit for about 15 minutes before it is cool enough to use.  </li>
            <li> Allow the hand to cool briefly before dipping it again.</li>
            <li> you hand, wash away the scrab then you can put your hand in the wax for 1-2 second take it up and dip back into the wax again, repeat it 3 times in and out to ensure your hand waxed with good enough ply then immediately placed your hand in the gloves sealed for 10 mins, remove the gloves and wax.</li>
            <li> I am not sure of MIL liked it, but I don&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like hand creams as they normally feel greasy and don&#x27;t like the slippery feeling when working on a computer...</li>
            <li> I have given it enough time to cool and it has burned me twice.  </li>
            <li> It is kind of small</li>
            <li> the was is too hot for my over sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Then you must unplug it and wait quite a while until it gets cool enough to use.  </li>
            <li> When I first received the product, naturally I plugged it immediately.  </li>
            <li> The wax smell very good but is a little messy when trying to get it off your hands.</li>
            <li> High setting is probably too hot for your hands, but melt wax at this temp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Unplug after using or it will draw electricity and wax will  still be soft.  </li>
            <li> The inside make of it makes it hard to clean, but for the price it can easily be replaced.</li>
            <li> I was even able to use it on my feet, putting half the foot in at a time.</li>
            <li> It would be better if the bath were of a piece and elements were completely hidden.  </li>
            <li> People just need to learn to complain less and problem solve more.</li>
            <li> I recently suffered a severe dog bite to the hand, and this product helped tremendously with pain and stiffness.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t particularly like the scent</li>
            <li> Of course I started giving treatments to my Mom and husband and more frequently to myself than I expected.</li>
            <li> Much better than the more expensive Homedics one I purchased and which stopped heating within a year.</li>
            <li> This wax bath was recommended to me by my physical therapist for relief from finger surgery and some mild arthritis.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t particularly like?</li>
            <li> More of a challenge is learning how to use it without creating a paraffin mess.</li>
            <li> Took way too long to heat up it, it was leaking from the bottom of the right side on first use called Amazon</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> You need to have it on high heat to melt the wax (or keep it liquid)</li>
            <li> I found it to be a high quality product that exceeds all that I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to those that have osteoarthritis and cannot tolerate pain killers.</li>
            <li> which is the reason I kept trying to get it on high heat.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Paraffin heats up high or medium or to whatever you like.</li>
            <li> You need to turn it on high when reheating the wax which takes around 2 hours to fully melt.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this with high hopes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for any one who has stiffness/pain in hands and a bonus....</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for arthritis in your hands.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> do not have to put on high when ,already</li>
            <li> Even though the temperature settings are adjustable, it takes forever for the wax to melt even on the high setting.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> important.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this unit to anyone looking for this type of machine.</li>
            <li> It tells you to turn it on high for 2 hours.  </li>
            <li> I am highly allergic to scents and the chemicals that carry them.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had no issues with mine after using it about 4 times, so I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The other reason for the lower rating is the wax - although it smells great, it is super thin.  </li>
            <li> The other reason for the lower rating is the wax - although it smells great, it is super thin.  </li>
            <li> The hand therapist warned me that the home units were much hotter than the professional one they use.  </li>
            <li> It really helps as well as making my hands soft.  </li>
            <li> great for the price, cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> I really wish it had a well marked \\&quot;fill line\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Use it every day and it really does keep your hands hydraed and soft.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is normal, but it takes about 90 minutes for the paraffin to melt.  </li>
            <li> sure if this product could last how long but comparing the price why not give it a try?</li>
            <li> After just a few uses, I needed more parafin.</li>
            <li> The parafin bath doesn&#x27;t really get hot enough.</li>
            <li> It does sometimes stick to your fingernails when trying to take it off, but this is normal for any wax.</li>
            <li> It does sometimes stick to your fingernails when trying to take it off, but this is normal for any wax.</li>
            <li> Even though I took out the scented wax and used the unscented wax that I bought at the same time, the unscented wax picked up the scent of the scented wax that had been absorbed into the tub..  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it does make my hands feel so much better.</li>
            <li> The wax that comes with this is thin, so you have to dip your hand about 3 times to get good coverage.  </li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s going right back.</li>
            <li> Hands definitely feel softer and moisturized right after.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this warmer to anyone that has a small business, limited space, or that just wants a exceptional warmer without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> You have to start on maximum temperature to melt the wax but remember to turn it down or you&#x27;ll easily give yourself a 1st degree burn.</li>
            <li> (but I&#x27;ll live with it:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There new slogans are about customer service?</li>
            <li> I would recomend to live with the pain.</li>
            <li> I thought I would have to buy new wax</li>
            <li> The red light wouldn&#x27;t stay on, as if there was an electrical short.  </li>
            <li> Makes skin very soft as well.</li>
            <li> and I was concerned since I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> The set up was easy, and I have established a part of my kitchen counter for this equipment, so it won&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for, a bit pricey, but compared to the other vendors I tried very reasonable considering everthing that came with it.</li>
            <li> I had bought one from Revlon and it was the exact same.</li>
            <li> Not too many choices when a small one is needed...</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get hot enough to even keep the parraffin melted.</li>
            <li> The newer unit came with a different wax though, much too heavily scented for our preference, and seems to contain more emollient.  </li>
            <li> Took 6 hours to melt the included wax on first try, then 6 hours on next day.</li>
            <li> i bought this product for my mother in law for the mother&#x27;s day, she is 85 years old with arthritis in her hands!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t really big enough to dip your feet, hence only four stars, but I love it for hands.  </li>
            <li> I found the temperature of the wax either too hot or not melted enough.  </li>
            <li> It was such a disaster that I threw the spa bath away after using it the first time.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> the wax does not melt properly and I left this gadget on all day and still the was was solid on top and melting on bottom.</li>
            <li> I was able to use it for both my hands and my feet, but I do have fairly small feet (Women&#x27;s size 6.5 US).</li>
            <li> I was excited by the prospect of getting relief from the pain and stiffness in my hands due to arthritis.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll go back to Tylenol and soaking my hands in hot water..  </li>
            <li> first one lasted 15 years of daily use!</li>
            <li> When I did use it the first time, it took over 3 hours and the wax was still not totally melted!  </li>
            <li> I usually take the lid off, switch the heat bottom to low and let it cool off 10-15 min, until the temp is comfortable for my skin.</li>
            <li> Melts the wax quickly (1hour and half) and it really helps my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> or I can just leave it on high all the time and have wax ready in an instant.</li>
            <li> The offers more in a starter kit than other similar products.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty messy procedure but worth it.  </li>
            <li> I had one like the picture for several years and this is no where near the quality of my first one.  </li>
            <li> should, I had to tap it a few times, but now it works fine.  </li>
            <li> Totally fine for everyday home use</li>
            <li> If the wax is scented, it&#x27;s very lightly because I am sensitive to perfumes and this hasn&#x27;t bothered me in the least.  </li>
            <li> Love dipping my hands in it at night after a hard day&#x27;s work as I use my hands a lot during the day.</li>
            <li> I also use my right hand along with half of a wooden clothes pin to remove the plastic piece that goes over the heating element before putting my right hand in the bag.  </li>
            <li> Works great, we use it for hands,would be small to use for feet unless your feet are small.</li>
            <li> it Talks nearly two hours to heat up.</li>
            <li> Returning second one for a refund, two duds in a row is too much.</li>
            <li> Really hoping my mom can get her money back.</li>
            <li> The machine works very well &amp; the temperature is totally adjustable.</li>
            <li> Ive left this one days straight</li>
            <li> With my old one, it didn&#x27;t matter what the temperature was, it was tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have no trouble dipping my hands into the spa.</li>
            <li> It took over 24 hours to melt the wax and it wasn&#x27;t completely melted.  </li>
            <li> This has completely taken the pain out of my hands.</li>
            <li> So far, I have not had any problems with leaks or spills.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that it&#x27; s taking a while for the wax to be ready ...</li>
            <li> reply to my email directly, so that I can figure out what to do.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now left it on but have real safety and energy cost concerns about doing that.  </li>
            <li> My hands are so soft.</li>
            <li> I am 59 yrs old and have used my hands alot in my life.</li>
            <li> Can buy directly from Walmart for 24.99 and avoid additional charges from this site.</li>
            <li> For a least an hour or two at a time, I&#x27;m pain free!</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions, but I have tried on three different occasions for hours at a time but can&#x27;t get the wax to melt as much as it should even on the highest setting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it because it hot too long</li>
            <li> This leaves your hands soooo soft.</li>
            <li> It is very basic but doesn&#x27;t hold much paraffin wax.</li>
            <li> Plus it makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> In fact the wax never did completely melt.  </li>
            <li> I have used this nearly every day since I got it.  </li>
            <li> I works grreat though and wouod recommend it to others who are not so sensitive.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, once the wax had melted the product worked as promised, but I will never have that much time to be present and wait until it can be used.</li>
            <li> Convenient for busy lifestyles.  </li>
            <li> I love to use this  heat my hands in the winter when it is so bitter cold that I feel like I will never feel warm again.</li>
            <li> I nearly seared all the flesh from my hands.  </li>
            <li> The wax takes two hours to completely melt.</li>
            <li> It requires 2 hours for the paraffin to completely heat up.</li>
            <li> Allow yourself extra time to melt the wax if you plan on using it soon unless you plan on leaving it on the whole time.</li>
            <li> and my hands are so soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I am just now getting ready to use it for the second time</li>
            <li> , my hands felt wonderfully soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love coming home after work and puting my hands in the wax, put use a thick coat to help with the pain in my hands and fingers from the work I do in the warehouse.  </li>
            <li> Works OK, only problem is slow to melt wax, other then that it has worked fine.</li>
            <li> The temperature knob stopped operating, and now I have to unplug it in order to cool it down...</li>
            <li> The wax takes FOREVER to fully melt and then you have to let it cool down a bit, takes attention but once dipped and wrapped my Rheumatoid Arthritis</li>
            <li> If I unplugged it to allow the wax to cool down, the wax just hardened up and was unusable.</li>
            <li> The wax takes abut 2 hours to melt and then it needs to cool down a bit before you can use it.</li>
            <li> a mess to clean up.</li>
            <li> Had previously used one at a friends house and loved it (not sure of the brand)</li>
            <li> One bit of advice - don&#x27;t eat finger food after removing your paraffin, it does leave your hands a bit perfumed and it makes anything you touch taste funny until your hands dry completely.</li>
            <li> only other thing of import is to mention that this unit shipped with a lightly scented wax (\\&quot;rain\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> It was recommended that I use a hot wax treatment on my hands for arthritus and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Made a huge mess!</li>
            <li> I have tried to use it while it is cooling down but that doesn&#x27;t work because the paraffin solidifies quickly.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a wax dip before, know that it comes off easily; you won&#x27;t be left with a mess.</li>
            <li> The hot wax treatment works better on my hand/finger arthritis than the expensive prescription pain creams and pills my doctor prescribes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that you could get anything larger than a size 7.5 in it comfortably or safely.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it didn&#x27;t heat the wax to such a high temperature.  </li>
            <li> but since then it takes over 6 HOURS!, which makes it not very convenient to use, which I regret as I like the sensation very much</li>
            <li> This product does not heat the paraffin to a high enough temperature.</li>
            <li> ; Not true, my Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Quick Heat Paraffin Spa Bath takes 2 hours to heat up.</li>
            <li> If I need to keep the unit off, I usually heat the wax on the stove and then put it in the unit, allowing a couple of hours for the wax temperature to reach the unit&#x27;s programmed temp as indicated by the light on the front.  </li>
            <li> I usually have the wax dip in the evening so that I have a comfortable nights sleep.</li>
            <li> The first time I heated the wax it took the expected 2 hours</li>
            <li> Be careful not to touch the sides or the bottom of the paraffin bath-those areas get hot.</li>
            <li> The high setting is a little too hot for the hands though.  </li>
            <li> It took a long time to first melt the wax, but not s much subsequent times.</li>
            <li> The wax also starts as a few massive blocks that you must tear apart to fit into the bath.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to be totally melted and ready for use within 2 hours of heating it back up.</li>
            <li> they do not even want it back too much hassle but gave me my money back so kudos to Amazon for their customer service</li>
            <li> My other unit is digital and only has a low, medium and hot setting which is too hot for some people.  </li>
            <li> No reason to throw out the wax and start with fresh if a little tweak will solve the problem....</li>
            <li> I am happy to pass this information on to others who also have painful joints.</li>
            <li> The only downside to the Paraffin Spa bath is how long it takes to heat up and be ready to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is lots smaller than my old one.</li>
            <li> Was surprised that this didn&#x27;t heat up enough to melt the wax?</li>
            <li> Hand barely fits &amp; not the wrist.  </li>
            <li> The wax on the initial melt had a perfume like smell and since I am sensitive to that</li>
            <li> It also leaves a tiny bit of the fragrance onto your skin which is soft and soothing.</li>
            <li> It also leaves a tiny bit of the fragrance onto your skin which is soft and soothing.</li>
            <li> I wear a females size 7 1/2 shoe &amp; my foot barely fits into this unit.  </li>
            <li> My foot barely fits into let alone</li>
            <li> Next time I will try another brand at a shop near home.</li>
            <li> you just cant go wrong with a parrafin spa...its a nice slice of heaven every time you use it...</li>
            <li> Kind of a silly thing to happen to a devie that needs to heat up in order to work.</li>
            <li> and then you have to turn it down to the low setting for it to be cool enough to submerge your hand or foot.</li>
            <li> I have gotten adept with using the mitten and it doesn&#x27;t slow me down.</li>
            <li> The Spa bath is almost exactly everything I wanted but not large enough for my foot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I knew it would take a while to get the wax melted down the first time</li>
            <li> It was so hot after being turned down it burned hand.</li>
            <li> I originally got anxious and went to a local Bed Bath and Beyond and purchased the Homedics brand.</li>
            <li> too cumbersome and hard to clean out - did not even use it - did not like the look of the inside - heated coil exposed..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for hand pains and also very dry skin.</li>
            <li> bath is barely big enough for adult hands.</li>
            <li> It keeps my achy cold hands warm and soft.</li>
            <li> Not worth returning it as I would pay just as much in shipping.  </li>
            <li> Wax takes far too long to melt AND from time to time leaks through the bottom of the warmer, regardless of instructions followed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take too long to heat up &amp; it makes my feet so soft.</li>
            <li> The set up the first time is a bit messy because you have to break the paraffin into 4 sections.</li>
            <li> wish it was a little heavier  or had a bigger platform i bumped it when i was picking my foot up and wore a bunch of hot wax</li>
            <li> /&gt;The heat quickly but melting 2 pkg of wax hard like</li>
            <li> After I do my dips, I&#x27;m ready to start my day with much less pain, and also oils add moisture loss in the winter months..</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what else to tell you other than she uses it and never complained to me about it.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product, not only for personal use, but at this price and comparison, this would be a good product for a salon, instead of buying those very expensive spa&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I usually dip my left hand about four times, put a bag on it and then do my right hand.  </li>
            <li> It has a temperature control setting-you can turn it up on high to heat the paraffin which can take a couple of hours, and then turn the temperature down</li>
            <li> THIS IS A VERY CHEAP PRODUCT AND THE WAX NEVER MELTS, TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY AND TOTAL WASTE OF TIME!!</li>
            <li> Not a bad product just not a good one for me.  </li>
            <li> You then dip your hands (or feet) into it a few times and it gets covered with this thin, warm coat of wax (it comes with enough wax to fill it intiially - you buy refills as needed).  </li>
            <li> It is hard to tell when the temp is just right unless you use a thermometer.&lt;br /&gt;**I</li>
            <li> She loves this, says it really loosens up her foot and makes it feel a lot less sore!</li>
            <li> This spa is very hard to get clean.  </li>
            <li> The plate is held in by screws which rust in a short period of time and the gap makes it extremely difficult to clean out the old wax.</li>
            <li> the item came as described and so far, haven&#x27;t had any of the problems like leaking wax or it being not hot enough to melt the wax...</li>
            <li> When there is less than optimal blood supply to your hands from arthritis or diabetes or other diseases, you may not realize how hot the wax is.</li>
            <li> My previous paraffin bath quit working after I just bought all new supplies for it. . .</li>
            <li> It is new and at the highest temperature, it took 3 hours to melt the paraffin wax half way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I am disappointed by the inclusion of scented wax, overall, I would say this is a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Pretty hard to screw up the design,</li>
            <li> but it seemed like even if I set my hand flat on the bottom (which they say to avoid and have a plastic thing there to avoid burns)</li>
            <li> However this unit will not heat up again properly with grey plastic plate on heat element.</li>
            <li> product is also good for warming up your toes after a cold day!  </li>
            <li> It is a little small, so if you wear a shoe size larger than a 7 you will have trouble fitting your foot in it.  </li>
            <li> heat does not last very long even with the use of the plastic hand bag and glove.</li>
            <li> It has the same design as several other look alike units.</li>
            <li> the wax melted, you dip your hand in a flat position with fingers open or closed (or foot) into the tub .  </li>
            <li> I have really dry hands and constantly pick at the dry skin.</li>
            <li> We live in the cold weather and are using it daily right now.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little bit to heat up the first time when you put your wax in, so allow a few hours.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really plan on treating your hands before you go out unless you allow at least 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> It worked once and then after that the wax never completely melted.  </li>
            <li> I recently had surgery on my hand, and used a paraffin bath at the Hand Therapy Center.  </li>
            <li> Smaller than expected.  </li>
            <li> Takes a long time to heat up (1.5 hours)</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to melt the wax</li>
            <li> It does take a long time to melt the wax</li>
            <li> This therapy was recommended for me, as I am experiencing some minor arthritic pain in my hands.  </li>
            <li> But I also can&#x27;t wait that long to reuse it every time.  </li>
            <li> is how long it takes to heat up.  </li>
            <li> Smaller than I had expected it to be.</li>
            <li> The melt time is long</li>
            <li> and it takes a long time to melt.</li>
            <li> Knock on wood, I haven&#x27;t had an issue with achy hands in a long time.</li>
            <li> We try and use it every few days and our hands feel so soft after using it.  </li>
            <li> No matter how long i keep it on on the highest setting, part of wax never melts.</li>
            <li> I wish i would have purchased one of these a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Does take a long time to heat up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, despite taking a long time to preheat it does what is intended</li>
            <li> It tells you to place grey plastic plate over heater element</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take as long as I thought to melt.  </li>
            <li> up time is too long.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;ve turned it off, it doesn&#x27;t take too long to heat.  </li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to use it, I would have returned it.</li>
            <li> When my arthritic hands are very painful, this supplies great relief.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after years of wanting something to help my hands warm up in the winter and also help with painful cracking during dry winter months.  </li>
            <li> It stunk horribly like strong cheap perfume and kept getting stronger.</li>
            <li> I previously owned similar product made by a different manufacturer.</li>
            <li> but buyers beware do not waste your time purchasing this item it is not worth the aggravation nor the money spent!</li>
            <li> I have to wash my hands frequently and use hand sanitizer with 70% alcohol at work everyday which has made my hands very dry.</li>
            <li> only con I have for this is that if you want to use this for your feet, it is a little short.  </li>
            <li> I am a standard size 7 ladies foot, though and there is just a little bit of extra room with my foot in there.  </li>
            <li> you should probably just get something a little nicer, a bit larger with digital temperature control.</li>
            <li> Due to R.A. I have a lot of pain in my left hand.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a solid product.</li>
            <li> They would not take it back foreign exchange.</li>
            <li> I have one unit for hands and the other for feet, I don&#x27;t cross contaminate.</li>
            <li> It would have been a 5 star except for the fact that the amount of paraffin wax that comes with the kit was a little short of being enough to cover my hand and wrist.</li>
            <li> Just like the other reviews said, the wax that comes with it is gross.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s standard, with nothing fancy--it just serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> We have size 8 hands in our family and long feet!</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish was different is that the cord be longer, but I simply added a small extension cord.</li>
            <li> I have to plan very long in advance to use.</li>
            <li> takes a very long time for the wax to heat up</li>
            <li> Once it gets hot, I found it to be sufficiently hot but the smell was so bad that I returned it.  </li>
            <li> effect is his skin is now soft and smooth and the heat takes the painful arthritis is soothed  a while.</li>
            <li> Today only the heater light come on and the wax remains cold as well as the container.</li>
            <li> We are a dry skin family</li>
            <li> I recommend for others to use this product if they have dry skin.</li>
            <li> but if I did it would cure my dry splitting cracking peeling heel problem I have had for over 30 yrs.</li>
            <li> It helps to ease the aches from arthritis and with dry cracked hands.</li>
            <li> I bought this for heat therapy for my sons hand injury and also to sooth my dry hands.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because my hands tend to start cracking and bleeding from severe dry skin around November</li>
            <li> Know that it only comes with enough paraffin for a few uses</li>
            <li> The system is also a little messy (to be expected) but the instructions do not give you any real tips.</li>
            <li> The wax that comes with it has a very perfumy smell and not good if you suffer from allergies.</li>
            <li> I also ordered extra wax, as you need at least 4 pounds of wax in order to dip your foot in deep enough to almost cover the arch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it a couple of times so far and just not sure how it will help arthritis of the fingers.  </li>
            <li> The first one I had was broken.</li>
            <li> and I use a pair of loose nite socks for my feet.</li>
            <li> Takes a couple of hours to melt the wax &amp; then you have to turn it down &amp; wait for it to be cooled enough to use.  </li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s fully heated, you have to turn it down prior to use</li>
            <li> So before you shut your unit down you MUST remove plate or wax will not melt next use.</li>
            <li> Because it is smaller it uses less wax at a time.</li>
            <li> The only slight problem is there is no OFF button, but to me that is a safety issue that I approve of.</li>
            <li> My feet are very dry.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a paraffin spa for my hands as I have a problem with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Difficult to get temp right and takes a long time for wax to melt.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it, particularly if you have cold hands.</li>
            <li> It melted the was during the last half of the Saturday football game and was ready to go when I needed it.  </li>
            <li> If this is the &amp;#34;quick heat&amp;#34;  model I&#x27;m curious to know how long the other models take to melt the wax.</li>
            <li> I became a little concerned when the lights didn&#x27;t work in the same sequence as described in the instructions but</li>
            <li> but i thought it would be just a little larger</li>
            <li> after reading reviews I bought this item anyway figuring most of the bad ones (reviews) wouldn&#x27;t have any affect on me.</li>
            <li> Plus, the heating element is exposed inside the basin so it will be nearly impossible to clean properly.</li>
            <li> Gave it for a Christmas gift to a person with terrible arthritic hands and was told it gave great relief</li>
            <li> I am personally a bit skeptical, but we have had this for a while now, and my wife absolutely adores this thing.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re careful, you can wrap everything up and pop into bed with the wax, liners, and booties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Nor was slipping on the warming mitts to help conserve the heat.</li>
            <li> I would give it a minus star if I could.  </li>
            <li> It is what I expected it would be.  </li>
            <li> About an hour longer than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> A+ seller came as expected</li>
            <li> I have had absolutely NO mechanical issues with this machine.  </li>
            <li> AS I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> It does take awhile for the wax to melt, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> At first a little confusing if you&#x27;re not familiar with wax bathing devices.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain if I&#x27;ll ever need it for my feet</li>
            <li> I assumed (my bad, I know) that \\&quot;quick heat\\&quot; meant something less than nearly 2-1/2 hours before use.  </li>
            <li> A little scent would have gone a long way when you consider it is being heated and fills the room.</li>
            <li> Again, a little oil would have gone a long way.</li>
            <li> She says her hands feel less painful and more movable when she uses!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course it will raise my power bill and being on a fixed income that is not good.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a hassle, having read other reviews, but there was no hassle in getting this working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d return it but, not like my other Amazon transactions, there is no return label or instructions for returning.  </li>
            <li> and it makes my inflammation decrease due to the heat of the wax dip.</li>
            <li> The product works but the thermostat is not consistent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried over the counter creams and lotions and plenty of other things prescribed by my dr.  </li>
            <li> The wax is also extremely greasy.</li>
            <li> I choose this brand because Dr. Scholl&#x27;s is a trusted name for other products, however this is not one I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I did not find a leaking problem like a see in other reviews though.</li>
            <li> Definetely would not recommend due to malfunctioning product which I had to return.</li>
            <li> I have had other paraffin baths in the past &amp; they were a lot bigger than this one is.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is built for those who are just going to do personal use and for anyone who may have a small Massage business.</li>
            <li> I never use anything other than unscented wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am just too lazy to use it regularly as I should.</li>
            <li> I think I will buy the crock pot and save money by trashing this other &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the first time I turned this on it leaked all of the wax out onto the counter.  </li>
            <li> I am a 42 year old female with arthritis in my hands, which has been getting worse over the past few years (and especially in the winter).  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I would recommend buying unscented wax--I bought &amp;#34;Mutual Beauty&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have read some other comments that the unit didn&#x27;t work either.  </li>
            <li> and I do not remember being the case with other spa baths.</li>
            <li> I have not tried other products</li>
            <li> :  With my other wax baths, I have heated the wax just long enough to remove the plug (coils were hidden under the wax reservoir); then I have used a dull kitchen knife to scrape off layer that has discolored skin cells.  </li>
            <li> You have to be very careful that you do not burn yourself with this product.</li>
            <li> In reading reviews I came across a few that mentioned leaking issues but took the chance only to find out after a few hours that mine leaked too.  </li>
            <li> I have had many hand waxers over the years and this product is by far the worst.</li>
            <li> The wax had clearly been left in a hot place because it had melted and hardened in the bag and was really difficult to open and impossible to break apart.</li>
            <li> The first one did last a few months untill it started leaking out the bottom like crazy.</li>
            <li> Beyond where I can return right to the store if I have another bad experience with a different paraffin bath.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product, it did not get hot enough to melt all the wax, therefore it was almost impossible to insert your hand or hands into it</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is the high price of replacement wax.  </li>
            <li> I called \\&quot;Helen of Troy\\&quot; (the parent company) who confirmed that the unit was bad.</li>
            <li> I usually keep the mittens on for 30-40 minutes (which is how long I feel the heat).&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the hassle to try and  return it at this time.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the time</li>
            <li> I moved and didn&#x27;t get this set up for several months and by that time it was too late.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle or the money.</li>
            <li> I have average women&#x27;s size hands</li>
            <li> The hassle of returning it to amazon seller was not worth it.</li>
            <li> Only 1 thing confusing about instructions.</li>
            <li> this is not worth your money.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it takes quite a while for this product to heat up and melt the paraffin.</li>
            <li> This is worth having in every household in cold climates.</li>
            <li> It is a bit small, but I don&#x27;t have a problem dunking my hand and wrist as long as I use four pounds of wax instead of the recommended three.</li>
            <li> I have had it for nearly a year and have not experienced the leaks some writers note with the HomeMedics units.</li>
            <li> so I turned down the heat</li>
            <li> however when the heat was turned down the wax hardened and solidified.</li>
            <li> Once the wax melted I moved it indoors and lower the heat way down, waited 5 minutes and got to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t mention ANYWHERE to turn it down before putting your hands in.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the mess or time to use this yourself.</li>
            <li> I turn the heat down about half way about a half hour before using it</li>
            <li> Needs to have less than 1 star for a review.</li>
            <li> If you unplug it and then heat it up when you want to use it, that takes allot of planning because it take a an hour and half to melt again.  </li>
            <li> but that seems typical with these type of wax baths.</li>
            <li> rocks take less than 2 hours.</li>
            <li> so this seems a bit odd to me.</li>
            <li> amount of wax that comes with the kit could also be increased slightly.</li>
            <li> the paraffin block in half</li>
            <li> If they were to make a product improvement, it would be to make it slightly longer.  </li>
            <li> I mad ethe mistake of buyign this and then not using it right away.  </li>
            <li> I am on a tight budget, but if this helps me holding on to items without</li>
            <li> I am on a tight budget, but I thought I would make I life</li>
            <li> It is really too small for using with feet (thus why my expensive unit is used for feet).</li>
            <li> Im a little worried that im going to touch the bottom and get burned.</li>
            <li> the first few times I was messy but cold wax scrapes up</li>
            <li> - it was quite helpful - soothing and relaxing and it helped the pain a little bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting a little arthritis in the hands and had bunion and hammertoe repair to one foot, one to go.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE AKWARD TO USE-</li>
            <li> virtually goes away for a little while</li>
            <li> The wax that it comes with does not come off as easily as other waxes that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> a little better.&lt;br /&gt;Set</li>
            <li> So I have been taking it out and the wax heats up a little faster.  </li>
            <li> (The instructions say to break each brick into several pieces---pretty near impossible for me to do that.)</li>
            <li> I have used a paraffin bath for years, when my old one wore out I got a less expensive option that did not have any temp control.</li>
            <li> We put a few drops of grapefruit seed extract in each time to prevent bacterial build up.</li>
            <li> The machine is dead and I still can&#x27;t figure out what happened.</li>
            <li> Messy</li>
            <li> Will leak from bottom and destroy whatever suface it leaks out on to.</li>
            <li> I have done both my hands and my feet a few times now.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses this regularly and it helps soothes her tired hands from working on an assembly line.</li>
            <li> This thing is messy,  You will be picking paraffin out from under your nails for hours.  </li>
            <li> She uses it everyday for relief.</li>
            <li> returned this after a few days.</li>
            <li> It comes with plastic bags and mitts that I used 1st few times</li>
            <li> Would not light up as on and would not heat up.</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit messy getting off the wax</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my hands and this cold weather is horrible on them, this kit is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Whenever my fingers are stiff and causing me pain</li>
            <li> I ordered some plain paraffin when I ordered this unit and just put in one pound of the fragrant wax along with three pounds of plain ones.</li>
            <li> get some plain paraffin before using unit and use 1 block of scented and 2 of unscented.  </li>
            <li> but it is not easy to get them into the wax.</li>
            <li> I got this to help with my hands that are all dried out from harsh weather and overworked by repetitive tasks at work.</li>
            <li> A little small.</li>
            <li> If you have a small foot or little hands....</li>
            <li> Little small for a size 9 ladies foot</li>
            <li> Painful hot.</li>
            <li> I have had a few in the past.</li>
            <li> I live where it is brutally cold during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> I worried about a previous complaint about the foul smelling wax-not the case with mine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason that I have reduced my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars is because although I have only had this product for less than a year and used it less than 20 times, it is taking longer and longer to heat up from a cold state.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason that I have reduced my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars is because although I have only had this product for less than a year and used it less than 20 times, it is taking longer and longer to heat up from a cold state.  </li>
            <li> Not sure but, with wax residue inside apparatus and around package looks like was used and repackaged?</li>
            <li> What a waste of money and excitement!  </li>
            <li> I use it almost every night, and I have no more hand pain.  </li>
            <li> small and has no noise.</li>
            <li> The size of the unit is a bit small.</li>
            <li> IF ONE NEEDS TO SUBMERGE PAST THE WRISTS.</li>
            <li> BUT.....it is SMALL.  </li>
            <li> If you want a small unit, buy this....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $!</li>
            <li> you have not used one of these, basically, it&#x27;s a small plastic tub that has a lid.</li>
            <li> If I forget to dip them for whatever reason my fingers are stiff and hard to use all day.</li>
            <li> The only thing a little disappointing is that the wax still sets up when it is on the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li> Upon opening the wax packets I noticed a horrible strong perfume smell.  </li>
            <li> The liners and mitts are hard to get on without cracking the wax.</li>
            <li> This makes it hard to remove the wax for &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; bcs</li>
            <li> After you peel the hard wax off, your skin looks like you had soaked it in oil</li>
            <li> but I imagine it would use up some to have to melt the wax from hard to liquid if it were turned off every day.</li>
            <li> its been plug on max temperature for over 8 hours and wax is still hard...</li>
            <li> Hard ridge around the edge won&#x27;t melt.  </li>
            <li> This unit works well, but it takes two hours to heat up, and I have a hard time remembering to get it plugged in two hours in advance of wanting to use it.</li>
            <li> Too late to return it.</li>
            <li> It takes at least 6 hours to melt the wax instead of 2.  </li>
            <li> It is so therapuetic and relieves the pain in my hands for at least 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li> I bought this with the intension of soaking my hand which lately has been hurting me.</li>
            <li> take a big hit from the cold ....</li>
            <li> Was not advertised as coming with scented wax so that was a big disappointment as the package value was considered in this purchase.</li>
            <li> it is slow to melt wax.  </li>
            <li> worked as advertised although it heats slowly</li>
            <li> This machine heated up slowly, took two hours to melt the three pounds of wax provided with the machne.  </li>
            <li> I really like Curel Hand and Cuticle cream as the base layer.</li>
            <li> It took two hours to melt paraffin and clean up was awful.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend not to buy this worthless product.</li>
            <li> Several reviewers have stated the wax has an unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> I cut up the wax very small so that it would melt faster.</li>
            <li> My previous feedback went to the wrong item.</li>
            <li> I have a bilateral hand injury and when my pain is bad, I use this daily.</li>
            <li> Not a good buy after all.</li>
            <li> A complete hassle, mess, and very dangerous!  </li>
            <li> I received &#x27;rain&#x27; scented wax and it was pretty awful, smelled like air freshener.</li>
            <li> 1h at least !</li>
            <li> Plate is very hard to remove once wax hardens.</li>
            <li> Her finger split and are painful in dry weather.  </li>
            <li> Freezing cold temps may have caused it to arrive slightly frozen.  </li>
            <li> Worst smelling scent ever, who would ever give such a STRONG HORRIBLE FLOWER SCENT with a product like this?  </li>
            <li> Refills are expensive and hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry I opened the second package and melted it.&lt;br /&gt;After one package was in the pot I figured I could use two and mix it with a pound of unscented and it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad and that would appease my frugal sense.  </li>
            <li> It was the least expensive of all of the wax heaters listed.  </li>
            <li> This has been a pain releaver for my broken wrist, and it makes the skin on my hands velvety.</li>
            <li> Broken</li>
            <li> Nope, it got worse.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for a gift to replace one that was broken.  </li>
            <li> Followed directions, put the broken wax in and it leaked out the bottom on the table.</li>
            <li> Alas.</li>
            <li> I received broken and I had to pay to ship back.i WILL NEVER ORDERED ANYTHING ELSE FROM</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, I took a chance and ordered this inexpensive one, and I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this for a nagging pain in his hand due to a fracture in the base of the thumb.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy, takes very long to melt, but the worst part is the artificial perfume smell of the enclosed paraffin.</li>
            <li> That makes it difficult to use for my business.</li>
            <li> Their return policy is terrible and we couldn&#x27;t send it back.  </li>
            <li> but i am not impressed with this one.</li>
            <li> and it was expensive.....</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does not.</li>
            <li> It may be something wrong with the one I got.  </li>
            <li> My wife is unable to use this thing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had to return this item.</li>
            <li> The wax is expensive to replace.  </li>
            <li> (But it hasn&#x27;t lessened any wrinkles, sadly.)</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Sorry for myself  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how difficult it will be.</li>
            <li> however it seems to slowly leak paraffin from under the base.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it because it is a bad product, I just hate it because my hand is too big for it.</li>
            <li> I am cold intolerant and my hands sometimes get swollen and sore.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid I was going to burn my hands.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I would burn my skin after paraffin melted but the temperature of this gadget is well regulated to suit skin tolerance.</li>
            <li> Cold.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom who suffers from athritis.</li>
            <li> Her hands ache from cutting the copper.  </li>
            <li> It made my eyes water and my allergies go crazy.  </li>
            <li> , she&#x27;s afraid the dog will knock it over or something.</li>
            <li> Instead I received disappointment and aggravation.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend who was in terrible pain with his hands from arthritis and also due to the winter weather his hands were cracked and so painful .</li>
            <li> Even with 5 coats, it is very difficult to remove from your skin.  </li>
            <li> Even with 5 coats, it is very difficult to remove from your skin.  </li>
            <li> It really it is a bad product...</li>
            <li> but thought I would risk it anyway because I wanted to use it so bad</li>

            <li> I have bad arthritis in both hands.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my mom who has a really bad ankle, so bad she can&#x27;t walk on it.</li>

            <li> I have bad hands with one being curled.  </li>
            <li> Does help painful joints eventually.</li>

            <li> I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in length of time to melt the wax.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product, but just a tad smaller than I like. The liners and mitts are hard to get on without cracking the wax. Otherwise, I love it.</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful when you have been out in the cold</li>
            <li> Great product; heats quickly.  Would benefit from including essential oils along w/paraffin so that temperature is modified.</li>
            <li> very good product, very good price.</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions to a  &#x27;T&#x27; but the unit never heated up enough to melt the 3 lbs of wax.  Really disappointed.  Not worth returning it as I would pay just as much in shipping.  Had previously used one at a friends house and loved it (not sure of the brand) but this one is a bust.</li>
            <li> This was a great addition to my ladies night out - at my house.&lt;br /&gt;It does take serveral hours to warm all the wax but it didnt get too hot and worked very well.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this it Talks nearly two hours to heat up. That makes it difficult to use for my business.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom to use and the few times that she has used it she has absolutely loved it. Its great in the winter for when her hands and feet start to dry out and crack, this really helps to moisturize and soothe the pain.</li>
            <li> This will leave your hands looking and feeling 10 years younger.  i do one hand at a time if you have no one to help you.  Works wonders on my arthritis and joint pain!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This paraffin bath worked great.  I had bought one from Revlon and it was the exact same. But the one from Revlon did not work at all it did not melt the wax at all and the lights did not work. This one works 100 %. I cut up the wax very small so that it would melt faster. It takes about 1 ½ - 2 hr’s to melt the wax. I use this a good 2 times a day and it works great. I was even able to use it on my feet, putting half the foot in at a time. I found it easier this way because I did it myself and how the heck can you do your whole foot at a time, you need some part of your foot to put on the ground when you take your foot out of the bath. I am very happy I went this way instead of going bigger. Don’t know how I would have done my whole foot by myself.</li>
            <li> Worked fine once, then the next time I plugged it in the lights came one but it didn&#x27;t heat up.  Sent back for a replacement - and the same thing happened.  Worked fine once, then several days later I plug it again again, power and heat lights come up, but no heat produced, leaving a solid pool of wax.  Returning second one for a refund, two duds in a row is too much.</li>
            <li> High setting is probably too hot for your hands, but melt wax at this temp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Unplug after using or it will draw electricity and wax will  still be soft.  (A problem if  children or pets nudge the lid off.  Lid does not snap on but lies on top of tub rim.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heating elements are &amp;#34;exposed&amp;#34; on the inside of the bath.  This makes it hard to remove the wax for &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; bcs it&#x27;s wrapped all around the coils.  It would be better if the bath were of a piece and elements were completely hidden.  Will try to get a pic up here to show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wax is unscented.  Mitts/booties are nice. Foot up to 9.5 shoe size.  Get refill wax at WalMart/etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is also good for warming up your toes after a cold day!  If you&#x27;re careful, you can wrap everything up and pop into bed with the wax, liners, and booties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  With my other wax baths, I have heated the wax just long enough to remove the plug (coils were hidden under the wax reservoir); then I have used a dull kitchen knife to scrape off layer that has discolored skin cells.  No reason to throw out the wax and start with fresh if a little tweak will solve the problem....provided it&#x27;s -your- skin cells and -your- feet that are going back in the wax!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mb</li>
            <li> I purchased the paraffin spa for myself because I&#x27;m having problems with my hands. I get paraffin treatments at work so I wanted one for home.</li>
            <li> My daughter has severe arthritis in her hands and she loves it! Gave it to her for Christmas and she&#x27;s used a bunch of times already! Very soothing.</li>
            <li> My wife and I used it once. I became a little concerned when the lights didn&#x27;t work in the same sequence as described in the instructions but the paraffin melted as described and I was pleased with the treatment on my fingers. I left it plugged up for my wife to use. By the time she got to it the wax had cooled. It seemed to have an automatic shutoff (which was not stated). The next day, my wife  plugged it up to use but there were no lights and it did not heat up. I&#x27;ve concluded that it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic shutoff. It just died.</li>
            <li> Was so excited to receive this as a Christmas gift. Followed directions exactly to use it the first time, went to check on it after about 45min and it had leaked through the bottom, all over my counter, on the floor, 2/3 of the wax ruined. Really hoping my mom can get her money back.</li>
            <li> I received this paraffin bath at 3:30 this afternoon, and by 6 p.m. I was dipping my hands in the hot bath. It was delightful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because my Orthopod recommended a paraffin bath for my aching hands. He said the heat would increase circulation in my hands, helping to heal the Carpel Tunnel Syndrome. The set up was easy, and I have established a part of my kitchen counter for this equipment, so it won&#x27;t make a mess. Although I thought that getting the plastic bags on my hands after dipping would be a problem, it was not. Nor was slipping on the warming mitts to help conserve the heat. Now my hands are nice and smooth with the waxy compound that remained after cracking off the cooled paraffin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other thing of import is to mention that this unit shipped with a lightly scented wax (\\&quot;rain\\&quot;). I also ordered a refill of unscented wax, which I used to dilute the scent, because because I do not care for scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I am disappointed by the inclusion of scented wax, overall, I would say this is a good purchase. I was expecting a hassle, having read other reviews, but there was no hassle in getting this working.</li>
            <li> Nice item, but a bit messy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is normal, but it takes about 90 minutes for the paraffin to melt.  That is quite long - otherwise it&#x27;s a nice unit.  Easy to handle, but I wish there was a timer on it.</li>
            <li> You will love this!!!!</li>
            <li> My previous paraffin bath quit working after I just bought all new supplies for it. . . imagine that!!  I bought this one a I really like the fact it has variable heat settings.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> I would give it a minus star if I could.  It worked once and then after that the wax never completely melted.  Their return policy is terrible and we couldn&#x27;t send it back.  I highly recommend not to buy this worthless product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for one of these for a while.  For some reason, they&#x27;re no longer in stores anywhere or even online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hands get very dry in the winter and my feet always are, so I&#x27;ve been wanting something that will work better than lotions or body butters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the way this makes my skin feel, though it seems to work better if you put lotion on before dipping in the wax.  It makes the wax come off easier and soaks into your skin.  Sometimes my hands are sore from keyboarding and the warmth from this really feels great, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have for this is that if you want to use this for your feet, it is a little short.  I wear women&#x27;s 6.5 shoes and that only leaves a couple inches of room left in the bath.  I suppose you could double-dip if your feet didn&#x27;t fit in one go, though.  The bath is very light, even while full of wax.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to first melt the wax, but not s much subsequent times. Feels very nice and helps my dry hands a lot.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item specifically because it was from Dr. Scholl.  In the instructions it says that it takes 120 minutes for the wax to heat up.  I attempted to use it twice but after waiting over 5 hours each time for the wax to melt I never got the chance to use it.  Returned.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for, a bit pricey, but compared to the other vendors I tried very reasonable considering everthing that came with it.</li>
            <li> Brought this for a neighbor to give to her daughter and she says she loves it. Neighbor says she was impressed with the cost and the time it took to receive it.</li>
            <li> This paraffin spa bath works very well.. It&#x27;s more than enough for home use!! I am in the beauty business, and for the price, it&#x27;s very nice!!</li>
            <li> I suffer from osteo arthritis of my hand and ordered this item for therapeutic reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I used to go the the salon specifically for the paraffin manicure and would feel such relief after treatment that I decided to buy one.  It&#x27;s been one of the best decisions for me as I get immediate relief.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This wax heating machine is great because it melts the 3 pounds of wax provided very quickly in about one half hour and it really soothes my arthritic hand.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend who was in terrible pain with his hands from arthritis and also due to the winter weather his hands were cracked and so painful . We got this and the end  effect is his skin is now soft and smooth and the heat takes the painful arthritis is soothed  a while.</li>
            <li> It truly is a fantastic product for a fantastic price! I did a thorough research before purchasing this one and as always Walmart delivered with the lowest price out there! Not only Dr.Scholl is visually appealing but it comes with everything you&#x27;d need to start your therapy or skin renewal. It has a pair of soft gloves and enough wax and liners to get you thru many paraffin sessions. It is big enough to accommodate hand/ elbow/foot. So easy to use and every time it leaves my skin wonderfully hydrated. Perfect for this winter season!!!</li>
            <li> This takes A LOT longer than it should to warm up, even when I break the wax into smaller pieces.  I have used it several times, and it has taken over 4 hours every time to melt the wax.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a birthday present for my mother with arthritis and she loves it.  Not only does it help with the stiffness, but her hands and feet have never been softer and she doesn&#x27;t have to visit the nail salon to have this done anymore.  Great gift, I looked at every brand on the market and this one got the best reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I have this at home.  I used to get spa pedicures with a paraffin bath included.  If you get pedicures on a normal basis, you know that the cost of a &amp;#34;spa pedicure package&amp;#34; can add up pretty quickly. Having this paraffin bath at home is cost effective and convenient. You can use it whenever you want and will not burn a hole in your pocket. I have to wash my hands frequently and use hand sanitizer with 70% alcohol at work everyday which has made my hands very dry. The paraffin bath takes care of the cracked skin around my fingernails and soothes my hands.</li>
            <li> did not buy this from amazon..but used it last winter and it worked fine. I does take forever to melt the wax, by the time the wax has melted I have forgotten all about it. Got it out last week and used it, but now this week it doesn&#x27;t work anymore. I plugged it in (and forgot about it while the wax was melting), and I guess it shut itself off or something and now it won&#x27;t come on. I will probably try another brand now and use unscented wax.</li>
            <li> The paraffin spa bath does work for me. It makes my skin softer, I have used it several times and i would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I recently had surgery on my hand, and used a paraffin bath at the Hand Therapy Center.  It was so helpful I decided to get one for home.  I&#x27;ve used it everyday since, and it is wonderful.  I will continue to use the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Paraffin Bath for years to come.  I just wish it didn&#x27;t heat the wax to such a high temperature.  I have to unplug the unit and let it sit for about 15 minutes before it is cool enough to use.  The hand therapist warned me that the home units were much hotter than the professional one they use.  Regardless of this minor inconvenience, I&#x27;ll continue to use it and enjoy the benefits.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use, works well and provides excellent results. It would be nice if it melted the paraffin a little faster.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this bath because the wax truly melts quickly.  This is a plus for me because  I have arthritis in my hands and have been awakened during the night with pain.  I get up plug in my spa and do a treatment shortly thereafter.  The only set back is that it must be unplugged; there isn&#x27;t an off switch.</li>
            <li> A physical therapist recommended I buy one for home use. The first time, once the wax finally all melted, it was too hot, so I turned it to the keep warm setting, as instructed.  Then the top layer of wax started to harden before I could use it.  Tried again the next night and the wax wouldn&#x27;t melt.  The red light wouldn&#x27;t stay on, as if there was an electrical short.  Never did get to use it. Too late to return it. Seems to be too cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a christmas present, started leaking just after the warranty expired 30 days, wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  Needs to have less than 1 star for a review.</li>
            <li> Just as described.... works well. Delivered on time.  Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I recently suffered a severe dog bite to the hand, and this product helped tremendously with pain and stiffness. The wax that comes with the package is strong smelling at first but you get used to it. It is also extremely oily once you peel the wax off, but that just means more moisture for you hand :). I have no complaints at all, this product was a life saver for me.</li>
            <li> The machine itself is fine. Im a little worried that im going to touch the bottom and get burned. The plastic part that you put in the bottom should set up higher and not touch the heating element. The wax is awful. It is so greasy. After you peel the hard wax off, your skin looks like you had soaked it in oil and you have to wash your hands 3 times to even begin to get it off. By that time your hands are not any softer. Maybe a different brand of wax would be better but i am not impressed with this one.</li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;m well pleased. I worried about a previous complaint about the foul smelling wax-not the case with mine.  Only perk would be a timer, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend the extra cash for one.</li>
            <li> This is what I wanted! I have had a few in the past. My last one did not have temp controls. It was always way too hot! Painful hot. I will never buy another without the temp controls. This is perfect size for me.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Really eases the arthritis pain.</li>
            <li> This is the best worth the money.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing but I don&#x27;t care for the strong rose smelling paraffin wax. It&#x27;s a bit too much.</li>
            <li> As a sufferer of arhtritis in my fingers and hands, someone suggested I try hot wax and another friend recomemnded Dro. Scholl&#x27;s Parafin Bath. It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> Gets way too hot!  Have to unplug and let set for 15 minutes before you can put your hands in it.  And that is when it is on low.  I mealted the the was and left it for a couple of days on low.  When I went to put my hands in it, it was really hot!  If you unplug it and then heat it up when you want to use it, that takes allot of planning because it take a an hour and half to melt again.  I had a paraffin spa years ago and it worked by just leaving it on low all the time.</li>
            <li> It is good but:&lt;br /&gt;1)  There is no off button; there is only warm to hot.&lt;br /&gt;2)  The hot is burning hot.</li>
            <li> The machine works very well &amp; the temperature is totally adjustable. I would have given it 5 stars if it hadn&#x27;t come with horrible smelling wax. Even after getting as much of the wax as I could out of the machine &amp; refilling it with unscented wax, the smell still lingers. If you are allergic to scents or just don&#x27;t like the smell, don&#x27;t use the wax that comes with it. Purchase unscented wax.</li>
            <li> Ive left this one days straight and it still works as good as the day I got it. I have a bilateral hand injury and when my pain is bad, I use this daily. I have helped fellow musicians warm up sore stiff hands with this as well.</li>
            <li> Takes a little bit to heat up the first time when you put your wax in, so allow a few hours. Works well and leaves your skin hydrated, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> DOES A GREAT JOB ON DRY CHAPPED HANDS.  SOFTEN THE PALMS AND HELPS THE MOISTURIZER SOAK INTO THE SKIN MUCH QUICKER</li>
            <li> Wife is happy with my purchase.  She used the paraffin baths during hand therapy and expressed an interest in doing it into the future, so it was a no brainer Christmas gift.  She loves what it does to here hands, it helps relief the pain and makes her hands feel softer.</li>
            <li> Luv this product! Makes my hands feel like a baby&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I have problems with hand and foot pain. Hot wax sounded wonderful. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. As other reviewers noted, it takes a good 2 hours for the wax to melt. You just have to know that and plan ahead. I also ordered extra wax, as you need at least 4 pounds of wax in order to dip your foot in deep enough to almost cover the arch. It does have room for a size 8 women&#x27;s foot, which is very nice.  Clean up is easy. The wax just peels off easily back into the pot. We put a few drops of grapefruit seed extract in each time to prevent bacterial build up. The wax that came with the unit is a bit smelly... just a bit perfumed. I ordered non-scented wax and mixed them.   The effect of the hot wax is wonderful, the oils in the wax really soften my hands and feet. Don&#x27;t expect miracles, just good old fashioned comfort.</li>
            <li> I returned this item because it was for a man and I didn&#x27;t realize it said &amp;#34;for her&amp;#34; on it! I&#x27;m sure this item is fine just wouldn&#x27;t do for a man! Too girlie!</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s really nice for rough hands.</li>
            <li> The description states a waiting time of 2-3 hours, meanwhile, I have to wait a FULL day for the wax to melt. What is the point?&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> Several reviewers have stated the wax has an unpleasant odor.  I didn&#x27;t notice such and am quite happy with the whole purchase.  It was the least expensive of all of the wax heaters listed.  I injured my hand and my PT lady said get one so I did and this was it.  It melted the was during the last half of the Saturday football game and was ready to go when I needed it.  It has a temp control that allows you to vary the wax&#x27;s temp so as to not boil your hand.  No complaints with this and its recommended.</li>
            <li> I have not used the product for more than one week and it stopped functioning... The temperature knob stopped operating, and now I have to unplug it in order to cool it down... It really it is a bad product... I guess I have to return it in order to get -I would like- a refund,I simply do not want this product. I will try to get another brand, but not this one...</li>
            <li> I am mixed about this item. I had another one that I loved however the heater stopped working. We really wanted one with a timer so it could shut off (or turn on) on its own but I didn&#x27;t really find anything like this. This one had good reviews so I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is lots smaller than my old one. I am size 10-11 (womens) and I have to crunch my foot a bit to get it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hot is HOT. The low takes a quite a while to heat the wax but if I turn it up to heat it more quickly, it is way too hot for me. With my old one, it didn&#x27;t matter what the temperature was, it was tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, and this is most important, there is no on/off dial or switch. Our set-up is we have a power strip under our couch and the spa is plugged into that. Now we need to plug/unplug for each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had I known all of this, I would have purchased another brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upside is, it works. If you have smaller feet than me and if you don&#x27;t mind plugging and unplugging, then you won&#x27;t have any problems with it. It isn&#x27;t faulty -- but I feel it could be a lot better.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected.  Gave as a gift and she enjoys it very much.</li>
            <li> DID NOT WORK! Would not heat up enough to melt wax!</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to heat up (1.5 hours) I received &#x27;rain&#x27; scented wax and it was pretty awful, smelled like air freshener. The wax had clearly been left in a hot place because it had melted and hardened in the bag and was really difficult to open and impossible to break apart.I think it would be nice if it came with another pound of wax. 3 pounds is just enough for dipping hands. Other than that the machine worked well and the hot wax felt great on my super dry hands.</li>
            <li> My daughter in law has a terrible case of eczema with psoriatic features on her hands.  Her finger split and are painful in dry weather.  This gift was ecstatically received at Christmas and the improvement in her skin condition is already noticeable!</li>
            <li> Works great, I would recommend getting extra wax because it goes fast and your suppose to have 3 pounds in it</li>
            <li> I love this machine.  I have been wanting one for a very long time and am completely satisfied with this machine.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful that you do not burn yourself with this product. When there is less than optimal blood supply to your hands from arthritis or diabetes or other diseases, you may not realize how hot the wax is. It takes a long time to melt the wax so I always leave it on low. It doesn&#x27;t seem to use a lot of electricity to stay melted but I imagine it would use up some to have to melt the wax from hard to liquid if it were turned off every day. Gently dip your hand in the melted wax over &amp; over until there is a good solid white covering on all the fingers &amp; the hand. If you keep your fingers apart it will build up wax between them as well as on the top and bottom. Allow the hand to cool briefly before dipping it again. When you are about through dipping, close the fingers together. Then stick your hand in a plastic bag. Wrap the bag snugly around your hand and put your hand in the blue mitts that are included. When the wax is no longer feels warm, leave it on for a little while longer. Your hand has just gotten used to the temperature &amp; it is probably still warm inside. When you do take the mitt off, peel the wax off inside the plastic bag and return to the warmer. It will melt again. This wax bath has been great for my arthritis.</li>
            <li> Not sure but, with wax residue inside apparatus and around package looks like was used and repackaged? Bought for wife since she has arthritis in hands and elbow so hope that works?</li>
            <li> Dr Scholl&#x27;s Spa is Great! I love it.  Melts the wax quickly (1hour and half) and it really helps my hands and feet. I keep it on warm setting and it&#x27;s always ready when I&#x27;m ready to use it. Always check that the wax temperature is comfortable  for you before using. Helps the stiffness in my hands from arthritis or when I&#x27;ve done a lot of manual work it soothes them. Everything I needed was included.</li>
            <li> The one time that the heater operated, I found the procedure helpful. Today only the heater light come on and the wax remains cold as well as the container. To the trash.&lt;br /&gt;Yes I purchased at Amazon as I do many items.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as stated.</li>
            <li> The unit leaks hot wax</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from pain in my hands until I can&#x27;t stand it -&lt;br /&gt;This has made a huge difference for me - I do it on a weekly basis now and doing so much better.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s top quality - absolutely worth the money</li>
            <li> Leaves my hands and feet feeling great</li>
            <li> you just cant go wrong with a parrafin spa...its a nice slice of heaven every time you use it...your feet/.hands feel better and softer</li>
            <li> More pain relieving than I expected.</li>
            <li> The Spa Bath works well.  The only thing a little disappointing is that the wax still sets up when it is on the lowest setting.  Other than that, it is working perfectly for our purposes.</li>
            <li> The spa bath was just as described. It does take a while to heat up but that seems typical with these type of wax baths. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended hot wax treatment - and this unit is just what I needed.  It does take a long time to melt the wax and I need to keep it on 24/7 if I want to do 3 or 4 treatments a day on my hands.  If I need to keep the unit off, I usually heat the wax on the stove and then put it in the unit, allowing a couple of hours for the wax temperature to reach the unit&#x27;s programmed temp as indicated by the light on the front.  Once the warming light goes back on, I know the wax is not too hot to use.  The hot wax treatment works better on my hand/finger arthritis than the expensive prescription pain creams and pills my doctor prescribes.</li>
            <li> The first time it was plugged in, it leaked wax all over my counter.  Returned it, but had to pay shipping... should have just went to bed bath and beyond</li>
            <li> I did not check the product because it was for a present out of state and the  paraffin spa never work and I called the company to return it and ups will charge me 21.00 to sent it back. I refuse to pay it. How I am going to pay more for something that does not work. It is your responsibility to check the merchandise before you send it</li>
            <li> Allergen warning, scented wax! I can&#x27;t even try the paraffin spa because as soon as I opened the supplied wax, it triggered my allergies. I have to buy unscented wax before I can even try it. The fact that the wax is scented needs to be in the product description! Once I get wax I can use, I will rate the appliance.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is it takes two hours to heat the wax.  But once it&#x27;s ready, the fun begins.  Know that it only comes with enough paraffin for a few uses--you have to use all of the wax it comes with to get things started, and it looks like you can get two uses (both hands and feet each time) before you need to add to your paraffin stash.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s much easier to use if you have a friend to help with the wrapping and unwrapping.  If you&#x27;ve never used a wax dip before, know that it comes off easily; you won&#x27;t be left with a mess.</li>
            <li> My daughter shared this with her sisters and mother.  All enjoyed their results.  Easy to set up, operate and store (after cooling)</li>
            <li> I bought this bath and I used it three consequtive days. My feet are very dry.  It did work well but when I plug it in to use it again it did not longer work. The power light came on but it did not produce any heat. The machine is dead and I still can&#x27;t figure out what happened. Did I suppose to remove the parafine left after each use? I only use it three times..</li>
            <li> I am cold intolerant and my hands sometimes get swollen and sore.  This bath is inexpensive and does a good job of melting the wax and keeping it at a constant temperature so you can dip in whenever you want.  If you choose, you can turn it on and off and wait for the wax to melt.    I wish I used it more often.  I sometimes dip my hands right before bed since I won&#x27;t be using them.  It makes my hands feel so much better.    The wax refills are also easy to use and come with the liners.    I have had it for nearly a year and have not experienced the leaks some writers note with the HomeMedics units.</li>
            <li> You need to have it on high heat to melt the wax (or keep it liquid) but then it is scalding hot when you put your hand or foot in.  Seems like a quirk to me. But it does get the job done.</li>
            <li> Mine refused to heat up enough to melt the wax all the way through. It was promptly returned for a different model/brand.</li>
            <li> Works OK, only problem is slow to melt wax, other then that it has worked fine.</li>
            <li> The spa bath arrived with 3 lbs of scented wax, mittens, and plastic baggies.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t particularly like the scent but it wasn&#x27;t horrible for me. Be sure to remove everything from inside the spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To melt the wax at start-up  I turned the knob to the highest heat setting and placed in a wax brick. After about 30-40 minutes I placed another brick in.The third brick when in after another 30-40 minutes. (The instructions say to break each brick into several pieces---pretty near impossible for me to do that.) After the was has all melted, I placed the plastic liner/tray inside. This liner is what keeps you from being burnt if you touch the bottom of the spa when dipping into the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my unit on all the time at the middle setting - at that temperature the wax stays melted and I have no trouble dipping my hands into the spa. (Note-my daughter said it was too hot for her.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it now for over a month without any problems. Since I am the only one using the spa I have been re-using the wax as others have suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My technique: I dip my right hand into the spa twice, wait 20 seconds then cover it in a plastic baggie. I  twist the baggie top around my wrist then place my hand into a mitten. I blow both baggies open before I start. I have gotten adept with using the mitten and it doesn&#x27;t slow me down. I then dip my left hand in, slip the baggie over it, and place it in a mitten. I usually keep the mittens on for 30-40 minutes (which is how long I feel the heat).&lt;br /&gt;For the first few times I was messy but cold wax scrapes up easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have given the spa a 5 star rating - I am happy with how it works. I am not sure if cleaning will be a problem as that would entail either taking out hot wax or scrapping off congealed wax. I will report back if any issues appear.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, the product is exactly as described.  I have rheumatoid arthritis and I bought this to&lt;br /&gt;Get any kind of relief as it claimed.  At the height of pain I do get moderate relief from this product</li>
            <li> At first, the dial for the heater seemed to not be cycling at it should, I had to tap it a few times, but now it works fine.  It is a very good spa for the money, the wax gets quite hot, and the mitts are really nice....&lt;br /&gt;This one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> This was a  pain to use.....wax every where.....and it was expensive.....the wax for it isn&#x27;t cheap....and the wax that came with it stunk...I couldn&#x27;t be in the same room with it. Although my husband liked the warmth, he said he got as much relief washing dishes in hot water.</li>
            <li> forgot how great these were</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my hands but I love doing needlework. Whenever my fingers are stiff and causing me pain I just use the spa. It is such a wonderful feeling. And I can continue to do my needlework with no pain.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once but I think that it will do what I expect it to do and that is to refresh my hands and feet and make them softer that they are now.</li>
            <li> At first a little confusing if you&#x27;re not familiar with wax bathing devices. You can easily use it everywhere, it&#x27;s not as heavy as the pro&#x27;s and still has their healthy effects with the warmness of your home.</li>
            <li> great for your feet and hands to soften the skin and the warm wax also help for people that have arthuritis</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my mom. She fractured her ankle and hot wax was the only thing that helped with the pain. This unit works great. Stays warm and is the perfect size, not too big and not too small. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love coming home after work and puting my hands in the wax, put use a thick coat to help with the pain in my hands and fingers from the work I do in the warehouse.  It really helps as well as making my hands soft.  the only thing is it takes a while for the wax to melt.</li>
            <li> works great for sore hands.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product. It took over 24 hours to melt the wax and it wasn&#x27;t completely melted.  I WOLD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. Luz.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY! It broke 2 hours after using. It suggest to put 3 lbs to start and it states it takes about 2 hours to melt. Well I followed as the instructions state and it broke. 2 hours into melting and only 1/4 of the wax melted then it broke.  Idk if the motor burned out but it never melted the wax and the system will not turn back on.  What a waste of money and excitement!  I was really hoping to use this as a weekly routine to help my hand dryness and arthritis.  My husband threw away the box and I can&#x27;t return :(</li>
            <li> It takes at least 6 hours to melt the wax instead of 2.  Not too many choices when a small one is needed...</li>
            <li> I bought the paraffin bath after hand surgery and for arthritis of my hands. It&#x27;s easy to use and feels so good. It does get very hot so you have to learn to adjust the temperature for your personal use.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. It didn&#x27;t get hot enough to even keep the parraffin melted.</li>
            <li> It is really good exact what I need and the price is wonderfull I bought this product again if I need it</li>
            <li> This is our second unit in 3+ years.  We had been very pleased with the first one, which was often used multiple times each day (my husband and I both have severe Carpal Tunnel and find the treatment soothing).  The newer unit came with a different wax though, much too heavily scented for our preference, and seems to contain more emollient.  We will be purchasing replacement unscented wax.  For the money, this is still a very nice unit that gets good reviews.</li>
            <li> Very soothing  before my exercises for arthritis in my hand</li>
            <li> One of the reviews indicated that this product had a smooth easy to clean interior. Based on this review I purchased this product. Unfortunately it does not. It has the same design as several other look alike units. It has a metal plate at the bottom with gaps around it. The plate is held in by screws which rust in a short period of time and the gap makes it extremely difficult to clean out the old wax. Be prepared to toss the unit in about a year.</li>
            <li> Helps with the pain in my hands for a while. Needs more than 3 pounds of paraffin though.</li>
            <li> I live where it is brutally cold during the winter months.  Love to come home and soak my hands in this spa bath.  Only wish it came with a bit more wax, but no complaints!</li>
            <li> it is slow to melt wax.  heat does not last very long even with the use of the plastic hand bag and glove.</li>
            <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought, makes your hands feel amazing. I work in a shipping department and by the end of the week my hands are pretty beat up, the spa bath helps a great deal.</li>
            <li> It did more than I expected.  I am telling all my friends about how good it is.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for medicinal reasons to help with wrist pain. I found it to be a high quality product that exceeds all that I had hoped. The gloves and thermal wraps are wonderful. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like that it melts ,the paraffin in 2 hours, but it is just a bit small!&lt;br /&gt;Other than than I love it!</li>
            <li> What a fun way to pamper yourself. I had a hand &amp;#34;bath&amp;#34; many years ago and remembered how fabulous it was. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> I give this Spa Bath 5 stars because it works great and is easy to use.  I have been enjoying the nice results on my hands which need the moisture and heat due to dry skin and arthritis.  I also found it to be very helpful after I had surgery on my thumb for arthritis and needed to warm my hand before doing my physical therapy exercises.  I would recommend this to anyone who could benefit from the wonderful warm moist heat provided by the paraffin.</li>
            <li> The procedure went smoothly I am very grateful I forgot to ask a 220 volt machine but I succeed to find an adaptor quit fast.</li>
            <li> love it.  My husband uses it all the time.  Small for the feet, but perfect if you want it for your hands.</li>
            <li> This has completely taken the pain out of my hands. I use it almost every night, and I have no more hand pain.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE mine! Colorado winters get very, very dry, so this has been wonderful. However, I didn&#x27;t personally like the scent of the paraffin that came with it, so I went to a beauty supply store and purchased some that I liked better. It also didn&#x27;t seem like enough paraffin to me. Other than that, I&#x27;m very happy with mine and am so glad I got it.</li>
            <li> It works great, my hands are much softer and healing. I would reccomend it for anyone with cracking or pealing hands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this since Monday (almost every day) and so far I love it.  It does take a good amount of time to heat all of the wax to its liquid form but it&#x27;s well worth the wait.  I have early stages of RA in my hands and the heat from the paraffin has provided excellent relief (and my hands are soft as a baby&#x27;s).  I also tried it for my feet - great, great...  I am a standard size 7 ladies foot, though and there is just a little bit of extra room with my foot in there.  I&#x27;m not sure that you could get anything larger than a size 7.5 in it comfortably or safely.  The variable temperature control is fantastic - I like it very hot but I know not everyone can tolerate it that hot - and it DOES get VERY hot so do use caution, it is hot wax, afterall.  So far, I have not had any problems with leaks or spills.  I haven&#x27;t used any of the mitts yet.  If the wax is scented, it&#x27;s very lightly because I am sensitive to perfumes and this hasn&#x27;t bothered me in the least.  I do recommend purchasing extra wax, though because this kit only comes with enough for one-time use unless you reuse it (and if so, you may want to disinfect per others&#x27; comments).</li>
            <li> Not for big feet a gimmick item. Messy</li>
            <li> The strong scent of the wax bothered my asthma.  Also it is very flowery and my husband will not use it</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this as a Christmas gift and thought it would be awesome. I knew it would take a while to get the wax melted down the first time and it did (about 6 hours.) After the wax was melted it was too hot to use so I turned down the heat however when the heat was turned down the wax hardened and solidified. I was so disappointed. I knew it was just to hot but thought I would risk it anyway because I wanted to use it so bad and I did ( and I ended upwishing I hadn&#x27;t). I ended up with burns on my hand. It was just too hot. It ended up getting throwing it away.  So disappointed.</li>
            <li> OMG this is amazing .  Heats quickly, plenty of room for hands or feet.  Feels wonderful.  Would reccommend to anyone who has arthritis in their hands or feet.  Takes away the pain and leaves you feeling soft and smooth!!!  What could be better!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of complications with carpel tunnel surgery.  I love it and my husband has used it for arthritis in his hands.</li>
            <li> Works great on my arthritic fingers, hands and feet.  Really glad I purchased it.  Makes skin very soft as well.</li>
            <li> Meets the needs I purchased it for and very easy to maintain and use.</li>
            <li> Love that the heat is adjustable!</li>
            <li> Love this hand spa I use it every day and and before bed great product would recommend this to you.</li>
            <li> If I could I would give 0 stars, the wax is HORRIBLE.  Worst smelling scent ever, who would ever give such a STRONG HORRIBLE FLOWER SCENT with a product like this?  I had such an allergic reaction to this scent I had to put it OUTSIDE of the house.  Given that now I have no wax I have no idea if the bath itself is great or not.  I will try and send it back, or will have to spend an additional $20 just to find out if I like it or not.  WORST purchase ever!</li>
            <li> I love this I am a shoe size 7 I can dip my feet one at a time. I actually purchased 2 more as gifts for my mother and mother im law. I suggest purchasing eucalyptus wax !!!</li>
            <li> I am surprised to receive this machine in a good size, nice looking and with all the accessory I needed to use it with just a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with 2 pack of 1.5 lbs wax each in white color but after melted it became transparent.  At first the wax smell strange but after melted it smell better, I should say acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat quickly but melting 2 pkg of wax hard like rocks take less than 2 hours. You could adjust the heat level to suit you needs, it includes 3 pounds of wax, 2 thermal mitts, and 30 glove liners.  And a plastic shell, remember to melt the wax first before putting the plastic shell, then you hand, the shell is to prevent you hands from touching the heat cores at the bottom of wax pot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best result is to first wash your hand with hand soap then use scrab to scrab you hand, wash away the scrab then you can put your hand in the wax for 1-2 second take it up and dip back into the wax again, repeat it 3 times in and out to ensure your hand waxed with good enough ply then immediately placed your hand in the gloves sealed for 10 mins, remove the gloves and wax. Keep your hand away from water at 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if this product could last how long but comparing the price why not give it a try?</li>
            <li> We are a dry skin family and I thought it could be a great buy for winter ! Everybody loves it, that&#x27; s easy to do and no messy at all. The only thing is that it&#x27; s taking a while for the wax to be ready ... 1h at least ! And it says \\&quot; quick heat\\&quot; ;0)</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoy my wax bath both for my hand and my feet. was wondering if I can order more wax. thankyou</li>
            <li> This therapy was recommended for me, as I am experiencing some minor arthritic pain in my hands.  Really helps soothe my achy hands</li>
            <li> This is a perfect set for me to use in my home for the arthritis pain/stiffness I have in my hands.  I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance after reading the mixed reviews.  Bonus, my manicure seems to stay nice longer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic hand covers and the insulated mitts are also a great part of the deal because it makes it mess free AND keeps in the warmth for the 15 minutes I leave the Paraffin on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li> I received my paraffin bath before it was suppose to arrive.  I use it every time I give myself a pedicure and works great.  This is one of the best buys I made for my hand and feet.</li>
            <li> I have plugged in my Spa bath for 28 hours now, and the paraffin wax is barely warm. What do I do?&lt;br /&gt;I hope someone is readin this.&lt;br /&gt;Please reply to my email directly, so that I can figure out what to do.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Joy Bitner.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re using it for hand arthritis and seems to help.  You have to grit your teeth the first time you use it, but once you dip your hand in, the paraffin insulates you from the heat when you dip again. Our doctor recommended it.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by the chiropractor for a wrist injury and works well.  The offers more in a starter kit than other similar products.</li>
            <li> I have had the product for about a week and used it 3 times. It does heat up in exactly 2 hours just like it says. I am using it for my arthritic hands and they do feel better when finished. (Of course it is only temporary relief). I also tried waxing  my elbows which are in pain but it is not easy to get them into the wax.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed that the paraffin bath was defective.  Wouldn&#x27;t work after 24 hours and in several different outlets in my house.&lt;br /&gt;This was the first of 2 paraffin baths that were defective.  I finally bought one off the shelf in a store.</li>
            <li> Slow to heat out, but feels good and lessens the arthritic pain in my hands.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, serves the purpose, alleviates my joint pains. Highly recommend to those that have osteoarthritis and cannot tolerate pain killers.</li>
            <li> best thing I could have done for my hand health! Use it daily.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in length of time to melt the wax.  Initial wax melt time  was 3+ hours.  After using it the first time, I shut it off, per instructions, however it took 5-6 hours to remelt the wax.  I&#x27;ve now left it on but have real safety and energy cost concerns about doing that.  But I also can&#x27;t wait that long to reuse it every time.  I&#x27;d return it but, not like my other Amazon transactions, there is no return label or instructions for returning.  I didn&#x27;t even receive an invoice with the machine.  It&#x27;s not worth the hassle to try and  return it at this time.  Very displeased with the machine and Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this. It is so easy to use and only takes two hours to heat up.  To get the wax off easily you need to put more than one coat of the wax on. That simple. Love, Love Love it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, only it takes almost two  hours to  melt the wax , good product, I like it. My hands feels soft and smells good.</li>
            <li> I love using this.  It easy to use and my hands and feet feel so good after using it.  The only drawback .... is how long it takes to heat up.  (but I&#x27;ll live with it:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is awesome.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone. My hands are so soft. Even my daughter loves it. She says it is the best thing ever</li>
            <li> heats up in 10 min or so love that it doesn&#x27;t create steam. small and has no noise.</li>
            <li> Hoping that this will improve pain in my hands caused by RA</li>
            <li> The product falls short on the heat adjustment switch.  I had to continue to turn it to high to get the heat light to come on.  It kept going off for some reason before the wax melted.  It may be something wrong with the one I got.  The high setting is a little too hot for the hands though.  I wanted to get the wax to melt faster which is the reason I kept trying to get it on high heat.  Once you get the wax melted and the temperature just right, the results are great.  I had surgery on my thumb for arthritis and using this machine helps get my thumb loosened up so that I can do my OT with not a lot of pain.  It is hard to tell when the temp is just right unless you use a thermometer.&lt;br /&gt;**I did return this item after about a week.  The wax was just too hot and the switch would not stay on.  I ordered a much more expensive one.</li>
            <li> This has been a pain releaver for my broken wrist, and it makes the skin on my hands velvety. Good value for money.</li>
            <li> I love it, very good heat!</li>
            <li> The Spa bath is almost exactly everything I wanted but not large enough for my foot.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to use it for both hands and feet.  Function is good.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend if only for hands or someone with perhaps a size 5-6 foot.</li>
            <li> My wife is unable to use this thing. It gets way to hot and if we turn it to a lower setting the wax starts hardening again. She doesn&#x27;t even use this thing anymore.</li>
            <li> What awomdeful trat for arthritis of the hand</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife&#x27;s birthday, as she had asked for one.&lt;br /&gt;Works great, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and is soothing for aching hands.  It takes quite a while for the wax to melt so we don&#x27;t use it as often as we might if the whole process were quicker.</li>
            <li> How they even continue to sell this product is beyond me. Destroyed my kitchen cabinets. Amazon customer service offered me 10 dollars for my troubles. Absolute joke! There new slogans are about customer service? They have a lot to learn.  DO NOT buy this item. Some units have a quality controll issue. Will leak from bottom and destroy whatever suface it leaks out on to.</li>
            <li> I purchased for a relative who has expressed to me that it was just what he needed. He was happy with the results and continues to use it for Arthritis therapy.</li>
            <li> I like it because it comes with everything that you need to start right away since you buy it. ploge it in and go a head</li>
            <li> Item works as described, cheap, efficient, smells great my wife loves it and didn&#x27;t bother having it done at the salon anymore...</li>
            <li> Great product, works as intended.  No idea why it&#x27;s labeled &amp;#34;for her&amp;#34;.  I did get my wife&#x27;s permission to use it!  lol</li>
            <li> Well, I went through 2 of these. I just couldn&#x27;t believe something with such good reviews could be such a pain. The first one did last a few months untill it started leaking out the bottom like crazy. Then the second one would never heat the top layer of wax.  So now I finally got the satin smooth one, it is hotter, but it heats evenly, quicker, and has been just fine. The Dr. Scholls is a hit and miss.</li>
            <li> I do not like the metal plate on the bottom of the unit.  Smaller than I had expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It does take quite a while to melt the wax but it is a great product for the money.</li>
            <li> Excellent instructions. The mitts are well made. Wax melted fast. Recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love it!! It feels great and helps if you have arthritic hands and also helps dry skin on hands and feet. I have gotten extra wax and it works great as well.</li>
            <li> I have done both my hands and my feet a few times now.  It&#x27;s so relaxing. And the paraffin wax that comes with the unit smells so nice!</li>
            <li> I FIRST TRIED THE PARAFIN AT MY PHYSICAL THERAPIST OFFICE. I ENJOYED SO MUCH I DECIDED I MUST HAVE MY OWN, ESPECIALLY SINCE ONLY ONE HAND WAS BEING TREATED THERE. NOW I CAN HAVE TWO BEAUTIFUL HANDS INSTEAD OF ONE.</li>
            <li> Was surprised that this didn&#x27;t heat up enough to melt the wax? Bought it for a friend with arthritis in her hands but never got to use it and returned.</li>
            <li> Took 6 hours to melt the included wax on first try, then 6 hours on next day. This thing is incredibly under powered.</li>
            <li> It is very good for both my hands and feet.  I recommend for others to use this product if they have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Wax was way too hot.  I was afraid I was going to burn my hands. By the time it was warm enough the wax had started melting.</li>
            <li> I love this and would absolutely buy again! I do wish it came with more wax, the 3lbs only lasts for a couple of waxes but for the price I would say that I got a great deal. Walmart and other stores sell this at some times for 10 dollars more.</li>
            <li> It is what I expected it would be.  Used it as well as my spouse and we both love it.</li>
            <li> This was a Xmas present for my roommate and she loves it! It heats fast and helps ease her arthritis in her hands!!</li>
            <li> It takes a good 6-8 hours to melt the wax.  I have to turn it on when I leave for work and hope it&#x27;s ready by the time I get home.</li>
            <li> The first time I heated the wax it took the expected 2 hours but since then it takes over 6 HOURS!, which makes it not very convenient to use, which I regret as I like the sensation very much - it was quite helpful - soothing and relaxing and it helped the pain a little bit.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember when I bought this but I use it every day.  I have a lot of stiffness in my hands.  I double dip my hands first thing every morning and have no pain the rest of the day.  If I forget to dip them for whatever reason my fingers are stiff and hard to use all day.</li>
            <li> Parent was very please.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this regularly and it helps soothes her tired hands from working on an assembly line. It has a was line level but I just added a few more ounces of wax to cover a higher section on the wrist. It takes about 3 to 4 hours to melt. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i bought this product for my mother in law for the mother&#x27;s day, she is 85 years old with arthritis in her hands! She is using this product since she got it and she likes it. She says her hands feel less painful and more movable when she uses!&lt;br /&gt;She is happy so thank you for your product!</li>
            <li> It work well and is very easy to use. The melt time is long but that is the fault of the Dr Scholl&#x27;s Co for stating Quick Heat. The product is other wise outstanding and highly easy to use and understand.</li>
            <li> Very nice size. Works well. Paraffin heats up high or medium or to whatever you like. Variable. A wonderful addition to my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I have missed not going to the salon for hand a foot wax treatment, so I finally treated myself to a parafin bath. OHHHHH what a feeling. Seller sent it tut sweet and well packaged for a good price. Of course I started giving treatments to my Mom and husband and more frequently to myself than I expected. I am 59 yrs old and have used my hands alot in my life. Much to my shugrin I&#x27;m getting a little arthritis in the hands and had bunion and hammertoe repair to one foot, one to go. The theraputic warm wax is very healing. The scent is a nice extra and it softens my hands, feet and elbows which as you move up the ladder seems to be a dire necessity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going thru gallons of hand lotion, it comes off. You do receive a set of mitts for your hands and I use a pair of loose nite socks for my feet. The effect of the warmed parafin lasts for a couple days. Its also a great excuse to sit unbothered for 30 minutes with the product on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t wait to get this, you will use it more often and get that great salon treatment more frequetly than you expect. It definatly pays for itself.</li>
            <li> A little small. Wax gets very hot. Can buy directly from Walmart for 24.99 and avoid additional charges from this site.</li>
            <li> Great for when my hands and feet are in pain with arthritis/fibromyalia.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought on of these sooner.  My hands look much better now.</li>
            <li> takes about 2 hours to melt wax. i like it a lot but wish there was more control of the temperature. the wax it comes with smells great!</li>
            <li> I only got the hand mitts didn&#x27;t realize I was suppose to get the ones for your feet or do they come separate.</li>
            <li> Recommend. Perfect for home use</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful relief to my hand which was operated on. It was part of my therapy for me.</li>
            <li> We followed the instructions to the letter and it melted the wax and quit! We tried everything within reason but the switch is defective and we are returning it for a unit of much better quality.</li>
            <li> My Mother used to melt her paraffin on the stove. This easy to use Paraffin Spa Bath is good for hands,feet and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;It is so good for  people with arthritis .</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad who has arthritis in his hands - he loves it and tells me that it eases a lot of the pain he experiences! I&#x27;d definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it because it is a bad product, I just hate it because my hand is too big for it.</li>
            <li> Initial thoughts are that it doesn&#x27;t come with enough paraffin wax (3lbs isn&#x27;t enough for the container) and it takes a long time to melt.</li>
            <li> It is a lot of work and I have never dedicated myself to doing this daily but if I did it would cure my dry splitting cracking peeling heel problem I have had for over 30 yrs.</li>
            <li> Customers were very satisfied as long as they are happy &amp; pleased I am also very pleased and confident in the product .</li>
            <li> price is right, quality is marginal.  temperature seems well controlled however it seems to slowly leak paraffin from under the base.  this is one of those things i think if you know you need it you should probably just get something a little nicer, a bit larger with digital temperature control.</li>
            <li> It takes almost 3 hours for the wax to melt.  About an hour longer than I had expected. Beyond that, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> This thing is messy,  You will be picking paraffin out from under your nails for hours.  It gets all over the house.In spite of the gloves, the heat is gone in no time.  Don&#x27;t buy this thing unless you have a separate &amp;#34;paraffin room&amp;#34; in your house.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after years of wanting something to help my hands warm up in the winter and also help with painful cracking during dry winter months.  I love this and use it all the time.  It isn&#x27;t really big enough to dip your feet, hence only four stars, but I love it for hands.  I love that it came with paraffin.</li>
            <li> Due to R.A. I have a lot of pain in my left hand.  This works great! For a least an hour or two at a time, I&#x27;m pain free!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product but I may need to return it.  I followed the instructions, but I have tried on three different occasions for hours at a time but can&#x27;t get the wax to melt as much as it should even on the highest setting.</li>
            <li> These must be going out of style. I love mine. Will say it takes forever to heat up. So make sure to plug in hours before you actually want to use. Other than that it&#x27;s a solid product. The wax is a bit pricy, but it lasts for months depending on how often you use it and what you dip. Not a bad price either.</li>
            <li> i have always wanted one of these i have already used it several times on me my mom and gonna do my friends when they get over here it is to die for to get ur feet looking and feeling great</li>
            <li> I was afraid I would burn my skin after paraffin melted but the temperature of this gadget is well regulated to suit skin tolerance. Love dipping my hands in it at night after a hard day&#x27;s work as I use my hands a lot during the day. Very helpful to ease tension and sensitivity form carpal tunnel syndrome. Easy to follow instructions. Wish I could use it for my feet but the size does not give me enough room for my feet. This is better for hands and wrists.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and does just what it says it will do...melt wax and keep it warm.  It does not leak!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. The wax seems to have some kind of oil in it that is very healing.  I would recommend for anyone with arthritis  in their hands. It really makes a difference</li>
            <li> I use it for tendonitis in my left hand.  Noticed a difference within a day or so.</li>
            <li> great for the price, cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if it could melt the paraffin wax quicker</li>
            <li> This product was for my mom. And she loved it!</li>
            <li> It just takes an age for the wax to melt &amp; come up to temperature. Does help painful joints eventually.</li>
            <li> I found the temperature of the wax either too hot or not melted enough.  The size of the unit is a bit small.</li>
            <li> I set everything up and turned on the heat...10 minutes later my floor was covered in wax. I can&#x27;t speak to how the product works generally, as I think mine must have been defective, but what a pain to clean up!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. I highly recommend this for hand pains and also very dry skin. It is very comforting.</li>
            <li> I love these spas.  I originally got anxious and went to a local Bed Bath and Beyond and purchased the Homedics brand. In reading reviews I came across a few that mentioned leaking issues but took the chance only to find out after a few hours that mine leaked too.  So after returning it, I did what I should have done in the first place and ordered this one off amazon and to this day have been extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> This heat paraffin spa bath is just fine, once the wax is hot, but it takes 2 hours to heat it up, so you cannot use it spur of the moment unless you keep it on, so then you need to find a place to keep it, plugged in and hot and ready to use.  Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I thought it would be.  Hand barely fits &amp; not the wrist.  Takes a couple of hours to melt the wax &amp; then you have to turn it down &amp; wait for it to be cooled enough to use.  Ok for the price.</li>
            <li> It works great. It needs quite some time to warm up the wax even on high but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I use this for my hands that really hurt in winter. It is great</li>
            <li> I love it so much . The shipping was so fast.</li>
            <li> I actually love this warmer. It does takes an hour or more to warm the paraffin, so keep that in mind. However it works perfectly and the paraffin that comes with the warmer smells heavenly! It also comes with bags and mitts for both hands. This is the best buy I think you could get for a paraffin warmer. I&#x27;ve used more expensive ones and the only difference is that this one is not as deep and holds 3lbs of paraffin, but everything else about this warmer is excellent. I highly recommend this warmer to anyone that has a small business, limited space, or that just wants a exceptional warmer without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> Great product, great value.</li>
            <li> Shipping was prompt but that was about it. Wax takes far too long to melt AND from time to time leaks through the bottom of the warmer, regardless of instructions followed. Not worth the time - I recommend finding a local beauty school and paying to use their warmer. Not worth the mess or time to use this yourself.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing this parrafin bath which my massage therapist recommended for my hands for pain.  You can tell a lot of people didn&#x27;t read all the directions before using it.  You need to turn it on high when reheating the wax which takes around 2 hours to fully melt.  That is not a concern for me since I turn it on to melt the wax way before I am going to actually use it.  The box includes enough wax to start out and I bought more through a different site where it is cheaper and was pleasantly surprised that it came with more plastic bags.  I turn the heat down about half way about a half hour before using it but I have used it with the full heat setting too.  It is hot but not  burn your skin hot.  I usually dip my left hand about four times, put a bag on it and then do my right hand.  It is a pretty messy procedure but worth it.  I also use my right hand along with half of a wooden clothes pin to remove the plastic piece that goes over the heating element before putting my right hand in the bag.  I don&#x27;t know if anyone else just leaves that piece in the unit but I figure it would take even longer for the wax to melt if you left it in for the next time.  This wax bath is a LIFESAVER for my hands!  It is so therapuetic and relieves the pain in my hands for at least 2-3 days.  When I told my massage therapist which one I bought she told me it was the same one she had!  Try it if you are on the fence about it.  It is the best thirty dollars I&#x27;ve spent in awhile!</li>
            <li> A great relief from the deep continuous ache of arthritic thumb joints. And it lasts for several days after the application.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my hand therapist after surgery.  Having used it every day for several weeks, I can truly say it has helped greatly.  It relaxes my hand so that I can do my part of the therapy at home and movement has definitely improved.  I shall keep using it because it is very soothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> WORKS REALLY WELL.  HEATS UP IN RECORD TIME. A LITTLE AKWARD TO USE-IF ONE NEEDS TO SUBMERGE PAST THE WRISTS.</li>
            <li> This is a delightful item.  I love putting my hands in the hot wax.  I have had no problems with it what so ever!!!</li>
            <li> Ours worked good at first, then started leaking. First time had a pool of wax under the bottom, and leaked around guage. It was so hot after being turned down it burned hand. It dumped most of wax on counter top. a mess to clean up. You&#x27;d need midget feet to get a size 9 into it!</li>
            <li> Okay but too time consuming.  I could not wait to use this and it does ease arthritis pain in my fingers. However, the disadvantage is that it takes a full two hours to heat the paraffin.</li>
            <li> My arthritic hands feel so much better since I have been using this paraffin bath. The price was surprisingly not bad and the wax can be reused</li>
            <li> Much better than the more expensive Homedics one I purchased and which stopped heating within a year. Because it is smaller it uses less wax at a time. It came with bags and gloves which extends the heat time of the wax on your hands. When my arthritic hands are very painful, this supplies great relief.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love it...</li>
            <li> Heaven on my arthritis. The wax takes FOREVER to fully melt and then you have to let it cool down a bit, takes attention but once dipped and wrapped my Rheumatoid Arthritis virtually goes away for a little while so its completely worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I rated it a 4 just because it&#x27;s not very big.  Otherwise it works great.  We live in the cold weather and are using it daily right now.  It helps to ease the aches from arthritis and with dry cracked hands.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend of mine who absolutely loves the way it has made her hands and feet feel.  The only drawback is that sometimes the was feels to hot when in the warm setting.</li>
            <li> This works well and is great for temporary relief of aching, arthritic hands. It takes quite awhile for the wax to melt, but I just plug it in ahead of when I want to use it. Reviewers who mentioned the strong odor of the wax that comes with this are right. I ordered some plain paraffin when I ordered this unit and just put in one pound of the fragrant wax along with three pounds of plain ones. This worked well. Good product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted this for a while I really enjoy using its great for my hands since I have carpal tunnel</li>
            <li> I ordered this spa for my daughter because she works in a factory and her hands hurt and crack sometimes.  She  is so happy with it.</li>
            <li> I chose this product based upon it being a brand name &amp;#34;Dr. Scholl&#x27;s&amp;#34; and because of the price.  For what the product offered and contained, it was a must-have purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work at two salons and I know what to expect and what is needed for the heated wax bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that I did not have to buy the (1) wax, (2) mitts (3) plastic covers for hands.  Also, the size can fit an 8 1/2 foot size for waxing my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product, not only for personal use, but at this price and comparison, this would be a good product for a salon, instead of buying those very expensive spa&#x27;s.  This has and does everything!!!!</li>
            <li> Wax, even on the &amp;#34;keep warm&amp;#34; setting was too hot to be usable.  I burned my hands several times trying.  If I unplugged it to allow the wax to cool down, the wax just hardened up and was unusable.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have use it often and it really helps with my circulation in my hands.</li>
            <li> Works great, we use it for hands,would be small to use for feet unless your feet are small. The paraffin that comes with this is too perfumy to use, so we threw it out and bought in scented from bed bath and beyond. Takes all day to heat up, about five hours . I&#x27;ve left it on for weeks at a time without a problem. I am a massage therapist and had ordered this for my achy arthritic hands. I soaked my hands every night for a few weeks and to be honest all the aches and pains have gone away. Knock on wood, I haven&#x27;t had an issue with achy hands in a long time. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Maybe I wasn&#x27;t using this right, but it really burned my hands. Did not like this product at all.</li>
            <li> Works great and at a great price</li>
            <li> It takes a log time to heat.  It took a day and night to melt the parifin  I had one before and it was much faster.</li>
            <li> i have seen no difference in using this product at all</li>
            <li> Does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> This is a great value set.  I had one that I bought at Sally&#x27;s (a different brand) that I love.  But this one seems to be a good value with lots of extras.  I am not sure of MIL liked it, but I don&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick. However the unit was covered with wax inside out and I had to clean it up before using it. The wax smell very good but is a little messy when trying to get it off your hands. It takes 2 hours for the wax to melt which is one reason why I am not using it as much as I&#x27;d like to.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t give this a lower score. Amazon won&#x27;t even let me return it!  I moved and didn&#x27;t get this set up for several months and by that time it was too late. The return window is VERY short.  Don&#x27;t wast your time.</li>
            <li> This paraffin bath is compact enough to fit any space. The benefits of this product are worth this reasonable price ! Quality mitts also !</li>
            <li> For the price it does a great job and definitely helping the arthritis in my hands and also my husbands.  We try and use it every few days and our hands feel so soft after using it.  Would definitely recommend it.  Am going to try it on my ankles also.</li>
            <li> takes forever (approx. 6hrs.) to melt the wax. Seemed to melt quickly the first time, but now it takes so long I have to plan very long in advance to use.</li>
            <li> When you plug it in It takes like a full day to melt the wax! I am NOT happy happy happy!</li>
            <li> its been plug on max temperature for over 8 hours and wax is still hard... so disappointed :(&lt;br /&gt;wish i could get my money back</li>
            <li> Item was given as a gift to a family member. Recipient of gift was very pleased with paraffin bath. Everything was positive except stated that it took 2 hours to heat up. Overall a good product for the money with good results.</li>
            <li> I get very dry hands in the Winter time, and this product is by far the best thing that I have used to fix that issue. This is also nice for a treat for myself without having to leave home to pay the extra $$ to go to the spa. I also love the fact that there are so many baggies that come with this, and the fact that it comes with a full set of wax. This was on an Amazon lightning deal, and I wish I had bought an extra. It was a great deal!</li>
            <li> I needed something to help my eczema and it has really helped! So glad I bought it! I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I ordered this with high hopes. Packaging was nice, wax smelled nice, so I followed the instructions and plugged it in. Came back to see if the wax was melted and it had leaked out EVERYWHERE from the bottom. Wax all over my floors, counters and cabinets. Now I have to return it... very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love it. It is easy to use. It is really helpful.</li>
            <li> Ahhhhh, is all I can say.  Great relief for aching parts whether hands or feet.  Wish I had this years ago.</li>
            <li> Got this for my Aunt&#x27;s daughter in law. A+ seller came as expected</li>
            <li> Best Buy! This is the best Bang for the buck when it comes to home-use paraffin. My doctor recommended paraffin dips for post surgical foot pain, and for the price, this works great, and feels so good. the wax that is included smells very nice too, and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> Had used a similar item before so I didn&#x27;t check dimensions. The description said hands and feet would fit. I wear a women&#x27;s size 8 and this is not the case. I purchased primarily for my hands anyway, so not that big of a deal. It came with two bags of parafin. Three would be better. After just a few uses, I needed more parafin.</li>
            <li> We were looking for a hand therapy solution without spending a fortune and this unit fits the bill.  I would recommend ordering additional glove liners and wax to combine the order and save shipping.  It does take a while (2 hours) to melt the wax so you have to schedule its use.  As per some other comments, unscented wax would be better, but if you order wax separately you&#x27;ll want to use the unscented stuff.</li>
            <li> A good product but slow to melt the paraffin wax.</li>
            <li> Instructions were paraffin soaked and illegible,but using it is pretty intuitive. Recommend including including unscented paraffin.am very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I wanted to try paraffin wax on a more regular, cost efficient basis as I&#x27;ve had it before during a mani pedi. For less than $30 this seemed great and it is. The wax takes abut 2 hours to melt and then it needs to cool down a bit before you can use it. I dipped about three or four times then stuck my feet in the plastic bags then put socks on. Then repeated for my hands and bagged and mitted them. 3 lbs is not enough wax for the bath it needs more to be more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a moisturizer before and after. I peeled off the wax and stuck it back in the bath to remelt. I removed the grate that covers the heating element and let it to reset and packed it away the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints and no leaks.</li>
            <li> Nice unit for the price. It does take 2 hours to heat-up and &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; to useable temperature.  It takes planning, but is awesome heat therapy for my injured hand. Plus great moisture...</li>
            <li> I have arthritis severely in my hands and wrists. I have used a paraffin bath for years, when my old one wore out I got a less expensive option that did not have any temp control. Did not like it and it only lasted a month or two. Went back to the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s and love this new one. Highly recommend for any one who has stiffness/pain in hands and a bonus....leaves your hands wonderfully soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> This paraffin bath worked. Once. Only. Once. After unplugging it, and plugging it back in, the heater light no longer turns on at all and the wax sits there. Cold. All day. This is not a Saturn V rocket or a sophisticated particle accelerator. It is a bowl with a heating element in it. Pretty hard to screw up the design, but somehow they managed to build a thirty dollar piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Great my wife likes it, it has help her hand alot.</li>
            <li> great product and price</li>
            <li> You have to start on maximum temperature to melt the wax but remember to turn it down or you&#x27;ll easily give yourself a 1st degree burn.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom who suffers from athritis. She uses it everyday for relief. So far so good. She&#x27;s happy</li>
            <li> I love love love my spa bath, I use it for my hands I have Osteo Arthritis and it makes my inflammation decrease due to the heat of the wax dip. The machine is so easy to use and I can use any paraffin wax in it.</li>
            <li> This product does not heat the paraffin to a high enough temperature. It may be fine for cosmetic use, but it is ineffective for applications requiring higher heat levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paraffin came scented \\&quot;pukey-lavender\\&quot; -- even though I ordered unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned this after a few days.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the intension of soaking my hand which lately has been hurting me. This unit requires too much work before and after. I would recomend to live with the pain.</li>
            <li> works great and makes my hands feel so much better from treatment</li>
            <li> The product works but the thermostat is not consistent</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it because it hot too long</li>
            <li> It felt good for about 5 minutes but it took over an hour to prepare and heat. Not worth the hassle or the money.</li>
            <li> takes a very long time for the wax to heat up</li>
            <li> This works great!  It is really reasonably priced and works really well.  It takes about 2 hours to completely warm up.  I have Lupus and have severe problems with my feet because of it and I have tried everything to help my skin.  I&#x27;ve tried over the counter creams and lotions and plenty of other things prescribed by my dr.  Nothing has working until now.  Well worth the price!!</li>
            <li> spa bath did not work at all did not heat at all. Broken</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my  daughter, purchased through Amazon. They always have great items for gifts. My daughte is an artist and makes copper jewelry.  Her hands ache from cutting the copper.  This helps relieve the aches and pains in her hands.  She loves it.  Thanks for a Speddy delivery...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wrist prior to my surgery. I didn&#x27;t try it out till after 2 months of my surgery. What a big mistake it didn&#x27;t even work. My bad I should have tried it out instead of waiting till after my surgery. They would not take it back foreign exchange.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother.  She loves it but had to replace the wax with unscented.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It was suggested that I buy one by a occupational therapist I worked with and I just got around to ordering it.  I have sever arthritis in my hands and wrists and it makes them feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have bad arthritis in both hands.  I don&#x27;t need this every day but when I do, it&#x27;s invaluable!  I&#x27;m not certain if I&#x27;ll ever need it for my feet but it is amply large to do so.  Be aware that it will take a good 2 hours for the paraffin blocks to melt.  I have bought a back-up supply of the paraffin &amp;#34;pearls&amp;#34; for when I need to add to the paraffin.</li>
            <li> The warm wax helps my arthritis but it takes forever to heat up so the wax is liquid. You can&#x27;t really plan on treating your hands before you go out unless you allow at least 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> Works really well! We use it to aliviate my daughter&#x27;s arthritis and she has reported that is feeling really good after her treatments with this machine!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had to return this item. After 5 hours on the high setting, the wax still had not melted into more than an inch of liquid. The wax also starts as a few massive blocks that you must tear apart to fit into the bath. Considering I bought this product to relieve arthritis pain in my hands.... this was not a task happily done.&lt;br /&gt;Although the wax has a pleasant aroma, it is far too strong.  A little scent would have gone a long way when you consider it is being heated and fills the room. The wax is also extremely greasy. Again, a little oil would have gone a long way.</li>
            <li> Really helped my  hands. The heat relieves the pain. Good foe anyone with joint pain.</li>
            <li> these were bought as a gift.</li>
            <li> I love this!  My hands and feet stay silky smooth for weeks after.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to heat up, but works ok.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Easy to operate.  Safety warnings and cautions about using hot wax very appropriate.</li>
            <li> A complete hassle, mess, and very dangerous!  The wax is expensive to replace.  It was such a disaster that I threw the spa bath away after using it the first time.</li>
            <li> No matter how long i keep it on on the highest setting, part of wax never melts. Now it just sits in our garage.</li>
            <li> It was one of my best investments! It worked great for feet pain after a full day up on my feet and decrease my elbow pain 0/10 pain scale!!</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s paraffin tub,. I previously owned similar product made by a different manufacturer. But this is so nice. The oils are so pleasant that are infused in the wax. It has multiple heat settings, and can fit up to a lady&#x27;s size 91/2 shoe in it.&lt;br /&gt;The mitts are nice and comfy. Would highly recommend for arthritis in your hands. I suffer from Fibromyalgia and addition arthritis. After I do my dips, I&#x27;m ready to start my day with much less pain, and also oils add moisture loss in the winter months..</li>
            <li> Purchased this item for a friend with arthritis.  She uses it almost daily.  She really likes it.  Makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for our massage room and within two days it had paid for itself.  I love amazon because they deliver on time every time and I can shop at night so I don&#x27;t have to leave work to shop for our Spa.  This is a basic machine and it&#x27;s all you ne to deliver paragon for hands and feet.  it&#x27;s not too costly so it can be replaced whenever we need to.</li>
            <li> It was awesome it did everything that it was supposed to do I am very happy with this product awesome</li>
            <li> orderd this for my girlfriend and she loves it.  wish it was a little heavier  or had a bigger platform i bumped it when i was picking my foot up and wore a bunch of hot wax</li>
            <li> I should have read more closely.  It takes a couple of hours to melt the wax and then another 20 minutes before you can actually use it.  I assumed (my bad, I know) that \\&quot;quick heat\\&quot; meant something less than nearly 2-1/2 hours before use.  But the effects are amazing and that is reason to use the product.  Dr. Scholl&#x27;s is a trusted brand for a reason - it works!</li>
            <li> I rated ths OK because the problem is with me. I am handicapped and it is just too bulky for me. It would be too difficult for me to handle it safely. I regret having to return it and it looked fine, wax smelled good, and I was dying to try it.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my hands and this cold weather is horrible on them, this kit is wonderful. It helps with my pain and softens my hands as well.</li>
            <li> 2nd one I have had.  Use all the time.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful.  Works very well.  I don&#x27;t go for pedicures anymore!  Savings tons of money.</li>
            <li> Well built, does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> worked as advertised although it heats slowly it works</li>
            <li> i didnt realize i couldnt leave it on all the time - it literally takes 2 hours to melt the wax each time i want to use it - which is twice a day - so a lot of planning has to take place in order to use it twice daily - would have preferred a unti that could remain continually on</li>
            <li> Not nearly as big inside as it was portrayed to be. I have a 10 1/2 foot and it does not come close to fitting. Plus, the heating element is exposed inside the basin so it will be nearly impossible to clean properly. But, it was inexpensive... I guess that is what I paid for. Next time I will get a bigger one that is sized for a man&#x27;s foot.</li>
            <li> HAVEN&#x27;T TRIED THIS YET BUT I KNOW IT WILL BE GOOD WHEN I DO.</li>
            <li> It has a temperature control setting-you can turn it up on high to heat the paraffin which can take a couple of hours, and then turn the temperature down so it&#x27;s not too hot when you use it. I have arthritis in my fingers and I have a lot of pain -The warm paraffin is very soothing. Be careful not to touch the sides or the bottom of the paraffin bath-those areas get hot. The quality of the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s paraffin bath appears to be very good.</li>
            <li> the item came as described and so far, haven&#x27;t had any of the problems like leaking wax or it being not hot enough to melt the wax...the dimensions are adequate for size 8 feet and medium sized hand...good product</li>
            <li> The only downside to the Paraffin Spa bath is how long it takes to heat up and be ready to use.</li>
            <li> Did not work properly.  After 3 hours, the wax still was not melted.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this so quickly, but after having it a week I can say this is no deal. The wax has only fully melted once and that was because I stood with a hairdryer to melt it all. Even if it is left plugged in all day the wax is not fully melted. I choose this brand because Dr. Scholl&#x27;s is a trusted name for other products, however this is not one I would recommend.</li>
            <li> The paraffin does not get very hot.  The tray that sits on the heating element needs to be taken out in order for it to heat up.  I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I got this to help with my hands that are all dried out from harsh weather and overworked by repetitive tasks at work. I figured it&#x27;d also feel nice after giving myself a pedicure. My foot is size 8 1/2 and felt like I could barely fit it in the tub unless I turned it a certain way, completely straight as it&#x27;s oval shaped. Dipping my hands in, I felt like there was just barely enough wax to coat about 1/2 of my hand. I kept dipping my hands in different positions each time to get an even coat but it seemed like even if I set my hand flat on the bottom (which they say to avoid and have a plastic thing there to avoid burns) I still could not cover my own hand completely. I have average women&#x27;s size hands so this seems a bit odd to me. I was  using the supplied 3 bars of wax per the instructions said to use, and there was a &amp;#34;Max&amp;#34; guideline level for the wax on the inside of the tub that it was filled up to&lt;br /&gt;The wax itself  that comes with it smells like horrible dollar store granny perfume. It really stunk up the bathroom and I could smell it everywhere in the house ever since. I definitely advise to anyone who is sensitive to scents to purchase their own unscented wax because the &amp;#34;rain&amp;#34; scented wax  they give you smells horrible.&lt;br /&gt; However, the wax did feel great for my aches and pains and did a great job of moisturizing my skin ..Also, it is apparently a decent price for these types of things, I really can&#x27;t afford to spend hundreds of dollars on a thing to melt wax... so both of these things influenced me enough to give 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much, that I also bought my Mom one for Mother&#x27;s Day and she loves it too!</li>
            <li> I wish i would have purchased one of these a long time ago. It really does Help your hands. I have really dry hands and constantly pick at the dry skin. now i use this every day or other day and it makes my hands so much better.</li>
            <li> I have owned the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Quick Heat Paraffin Spa Bath three times now. I gave away the first two. I have never had any problems with any of them,. They melted the paraffin well and promptly, they are balanbced well so tipping is not a issue. I love the lid as well. I have no problems with any of the ones I have owned! recommend 100%/</li>
            <li> Great purchase.  Not so quick to heat but once it does it feels great. I would definately recommend this product</li>
            <li> I bought this for heat therapy for my sons hand injury and also to sooth my dry hands.  It took over two hours to melt the wax even though I broke the pieces up pretty small.  Upon opening the wax packets I noticed a horrible strong perfume smell.  I was hoping that the smell would decrease after it was heated.  Nope, it got worse.  It stunk horribly like strong cheap perfume and kept getting stronger. It made my eyes water and my allergies go crazy.  I reread the description and couldn&#x27;t find anywhere that said the wax was scented.  One of the reviewers even mentioned it came with unscented wax.  I wish mine did.  I hate to have to spend $20 on replacement wax but I think that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll have to do.</li>
            <li> My fiance bought this for herself but it seems I have used it more. Lol I work with cleaning chemicals all day and to soak my hands in hot paraffin is wonderful. Unit works fine comes up to temp fairly quickly. She loves it.</li>
            <li> This product is great for dry hands and/or feet.&lt;br /&gt;My mom and I noticed a difference in our skin&lt;br /&gt;on the first use.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for price!!  Bought this for a gift to replace one that was broken.  Liked the scented wax that came with the product and also the warming mittens~ as person who has arthuritis uses!! highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i have Arthitis in my hand so every time the pain happend i use the quick heat paraffin spa bath.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom who has a really bad ankle, so bad she can&#x27;t walk on it. She loves this, says it really loosens up her foot and makes it feel a lot less sore! Thanks Dr. Scholl&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> The only downside is that there&#x27;s no off switch, other than that it works good.</li>
            <li> I would give it no stars.  It took two hours to melt paraffin and clean up was awful.</li>
            <li> everyone should owed on</li>
            <li> The first unit was damaged in transit. The replacement arrived two days later in perfect condition.  It was bought as a gift.  They love the multiple temperature settings. She also  likes the soothing feeling on her joints. And, her hands are so soft, smooth, and nice smelling.  They are so enjoyable to hold and kiss.  Great gift idea.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this for a nagging pain in his hand due to a fracture in the base of the thumb.  It helps with the pain but also makes his hand soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Bought it for therapeutic reasons and it did nothing.  Does make the skin smooth, but&lt;br /&gt;wonder how often it should be used since it is wax residue that stays on your skin.</li>
            <li> Works great for smoothing skin by pulling dead stuff off. Really like &amp;#34;foot fixer&amp;#34; better for long heat and soak. Great for diabetics.</li>
            <li> This apparatus works well and soothes pain in my hand.  However, it is not &amp;#34;Quick Heat&amp;#34;.  It takes 2 hours 25 minutes to get the temperature proper for use.</li>
            <li> This leaves your hands soooo soft. The set up the first time is a bit messy because you have to break the paraffin into 4 sections. I used a hammer! Freezing cold temps may have caused it to arrive slightly frozen.  This is actually better than doing the treatment at a spa. Not something you can say for all home beauty gadgets.</li>
            <li> Does take a long time to heat up. However it works well and was a gift to someone with severe arthritis who absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> This wax bath was recommended to me by my physical therapist for relief from finger surgery and some mild arthritis. He said not to buy the more expensive larger units and he was right! It is the perfect size for personal use and even for feet women&#x27;s 7. It heats up plenty fast and is very warm. The wax on the initial melt had a perfume like smell and since I am sensitive to that I thought I would have to buy new wax but it went away after several hours never to return. It comes with plastic bags and mitts that I used 1st few times but now I dip one hand till set and the next hand till set alternating Until I am finished and then peel off.</li>
            <li> We bought a paraffin wax machine based on our acupuncture doctor&#x27;s recommendation for improving my wife&#x27;s arthritis of the fingers.  We picked this one mostly based on price comparison on the day I did the research.  She used it daily and seemed to making progress on both the skin condition and finger curling problem.  I am not sure it would cure the problem, but making her happy is just as important!  This machine heated up slowly, took two hours to melt the three pounds of wax provided with the machne.  Once all the wax melted, it worked as advertised.  We got it at a great price, I think it was $10 less than it is advertised now.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my hands tend to start cracking and bleeding from severe dry skin around November and it tends to last until March. I don&#x27;t really like hand creams as they normally feel greasy and don&#x27;t like the slippery feeling when working on a computer... so I tend to use intensive treatments at night, which help. The wax dip process just takes that intenstive treatment one step farther.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This paraffin dip does work well once its heated up and you can finally use it. According to the directions the heating time until first use can take up to just over 2 hours. Breaking the block of wax into smaller cubes/ chunks seems to help the heating process, but it still takes a while. Once it&#x27;s fully heated, you have to turn it down prior to use or it&#x27;s very very hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax that comes with this starter kit does smell really good and it works great to soften the skin. Using a scrub on your hands and applying a generous layer of hand cream on the hands prior to dipping allows for a great experience when the wax comes off. I really like Curel Hand and Cuticle cream as the base layer. Dip 4-5 times in the wax and finally let it sit on my hands and provide heat and relaxation to my hand for about 10-15 minutes (I get restless not being able to move my hands). Sometimes I even go through the process a second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount of wax that comes with the kit could also be increased slightly. While it is enough I find myself having to move my hands around quite a bit to cover the entire hand. Now to be fair I do have longer fingers so smaller womans hand might work a lot better, but just a bit more wax would help. Also you have the option of reusing the wax that you&#x27;ve used by peeling it from your hands and putting it back into the bath to let it remelt. If you don&#x27;t reuse the wax it obviously would be recommended to buy the wax refills to ensure you have enough for the next time you use the kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, despite taking a long time to preheat it does what is intended and afterward it does feel great. It also leaves a tiny bit of the fragrance onto your skin which is soft and soothing. I enjoy using it every once in a while to make my hands really soft.me to preheat it does what is intended and afterward it does feel great.

            <li> The melted paraffin is much too hot and I wasn&#x27;t able to use it.</li>
            <li> help with my pain,thank you .</li>
            <li> NIce item to keep your hands really soft and doesn&#x27;t take up much room in the bath.  PERFECT for sitting on the counter and keep it plugged in as the thermostat keeps it at PERFECT temp for all day use.</li>
            <li> My feet have thanked me for this!</li>
            <li> Very dissappointed with this product. I was so excited to use it and bought extra wax, gloves, liners, etc. It takes a loooooong time to melt all the wax and then you have to turn it down to the low setting for it to be cool enough to submerge your hand or foot. This ends up being about 4-5 hours before you can use it. I loved the way it made my hands feel and the wax softness does seem to last about a day. I tried using the machine a second time and it just died. The wax did melt after 3 hours, but the machine turned off after that and never came back on. I assumed it burnt out. Kind of a silly thing to happen to a devie that needs to heat up in order to work. I did not find a leaking problem like a see in other reviews though. The hassle of returning it to amazon seller was not worth it. I will buy a different name brand from Bed Bath and Beyond where I can return right to the store if I have another bad experience with a different paraffin bath.</li>
            <li> Ordered the item and was excited about the temperature control feature.  Followed directions, put the broken wax in and it leaked out the bottom on the table.</li>
            <li> Do I need to write anymore?</li>
            <li> There is no way to control the heat.  It is either too hot or it goes off.  I have tried to use it while it is cooling down but that doesn&#x27;t work because the paraffin solidifies quickly.  I am very disappointed because I purchased it in order to relieve the arthritis in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to return it  since I no longer can use it but I can&#x27;t find the receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you help me solve this problem?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ruth Klein</li>
            <li> Great for home use. Only 1 thing confusing about instructions. It tells you to place grey plastic plate over heater element so you dont get burned. However this unit will not heat up again properly with grey plastic plate on heat element. It does not tell you that in booklet. Plate is very hard to remove once wax hardens. So before you shut your unit down you MUST remove plate or wax will not melt next use.</li>
            <li> The unit arrived and I set it up as directed. After several hours, the wax was mostly melted and I tried it out. Aside from the wax/unit smelling strongly of burnt diesel, it was ok. I can see why they have a warning about touching the sides of the unit, though- I accidentally scalded a large section of my wrist when I was removing my hand from the tub. I can understand the bottom of the unit being hot (thus the plastic plate) but the top should not be so hot as to harm the skin. As directed, I turned the dial back to \\&quot;keep warm\\&quot; once I was done. I turned it up first thing this morning so I could use it a short time later, but even 8 hours later it is still a solid mass of stinky wax. I called \\&quot;Helen of Troy\\&quot; (the parent company) who confirmed that the unit was bad. It is supposed to be totally melted and ready for use within 2 hours of heating it back up. Rather than replacing the item, I&#x27;ll be looking for a different brand altogether. Between the skin burn, issues with heating the wax properly, and nauseating stench, I&#x27;d much rather spend a little more and get something I&#x27;ll be happy with. This one&#x27;s going right back.</li>
            <li> Would not light up as on and would not heat up. Definetely would not recommend due to malfunctioning product which I had to return.</li>
            <li> I tried it once and don&#x27;t have a desire to use it again. It&#x27;s messy, takes very long to melt, but the worst part is the artificial perfume smell of the enclosed paraffin. I had to open windows to air the smell and couldn&#x27;t use it because of the strong odor. I will try to get unscented wax and use it again. Hope it will work.</li>
            <li> This is pretty much a crockpot sans the removable bowl. The entire spa is sturdy yet light plastic. There is a metal plate inside the basin that heats up to melt the paraffin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax melted within an hour. Its hot out in Texas so I plugged it into the wall of my patio and left it on the table. I&#x27;m sure that had I kept it indoors the melt time would have taken longer. Once the wax melted I moved it indoors and lower the heat way down, waited 5 minutes and got to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax that comes with the spa smells nice to me and the thermal gloves (mittens sans the thumb) that came with it where large enough to cover my feet (US size 7.5) so I used them for that purpose, but just in case you are wondering, no you can&#x27;t walk in them/ Well unless you are a size 6 or smaller, it may work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you will want to buy in addition to this spa:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Microplane 35002 Home Series Fine Grater (meant for food, I know.. but its just like what they use in a real spa and worked great on my feet. Soak feet in very warm water for at least 5 minutes before using. )&lt;br /&gt; - OPI Foot File Corn and Callus Remover Cushions (best foot file EVER)</li>
            <li> Like a miracle for my arthritis hand pain. I can now touch my fingers to my palm. Used it twice a day to begin with , now almost every day. Such relief!</li>
            <li> This wax heater seems to be fine in it;s operation and is as stated. Have no issues with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paraffin that came with it however is scented &amp;#34;Rain&amp;#34; and it is horrible. Like a bad off market perfume bottle was put in with a pound of wax. I am sorry I opened the second package and melted it.&lt;br /&gt;After one package was in the pot I figured I could use two and mix it with a pound of unscented and it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad and that would appease my frugal sense.  When that failed I put in some essential oil and that didn&#x27;t make it sorse but wasn&#x27;t able to mask it either. I am resigned find a way to soak it up with paper or cube it and then let my husband use the smelly paraffin wax for fire starters when he BBQ&#x27;s. We will perfume the yard instead of the whole house.</li>
            <li> This must work wonderful as I have never used it.  My daughter got to it before I did and took it as her own.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> Works good, keep on med. do not have to put on high when ,already melted.&lt;br /&gt;Buy extra paraffin. one pkg. comes with it is not enough to cover hand.&lt;br /&gt;Helps pain in hands, softens skins.</li>
            <li> At only twenty seven i found out i had arthritis........ I&#x27;ve been wearing compression gloves, using a heating pad and taking pain meds. After using the paraffin bath the first time, i&#x27;ve taken just one dose of medicine. It&#x27;s been about a month or more and i haven&#x27;t had as much relieve as i do now. The paraffin bath has been tremendous.....</li>
            <li> This product does work well.  It heats up &amp; distributes the wax as it says...BUT.....it is SMALL.  Smaller than it describes to be. I have had other paraffin baths in the past &amp; they were a lot bigger than this one is.  I wear a females size 7 1/2 shoe &amp; my foot barely fits into this unit.  If you want a small unit, buy this....but... I bought this one because of the size they said it was, so my husband would be able to use it as well......NOT!  My foot barely fits into let alone his......so we have to look &amp; hope to find the bigger unit that I had before.  If you have a small foot or little hands....this is for you....otherwise.....don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my brother last xmas cuz he works outside his hands take a big hit from the cold ....he loves it !!!! his whole family does so happy i found it!!!</li>
            <li> Some people complain about the time it takes to warm up the wax. It only took me an hour because I cut blocks into smaller than 4 pieces. For reheating, it will take longer, especially if you don&#x27;t remember to take out the plastic protector prior letting wax harden.  As for complaints about wax scent, it smells good to me, but if you know you are sensitive to scent get some plain paraffin before using unit and use 1 block of scented and 2 of unscented.  The wax gets pretty hot at highest melting setting, so I need to let it cool a bit WITH TOP ON or wax will get a skim on top.  Overall, I am happy with it.  People just need to learn to complain less and problem solve more.</li>
            <li> This is Ok but the temperature flustuates, you need to use more wax than what shipped with the bath itself. The parafin bath doesn&#x27;t really get hot enough.</li>
            <li> Good product at an affordable price.  Feels so good since I had a car accident and extensive surgery on my left hand..</li>
            <li> The spa is perfect for home use.  I received paraffin treatment during physical therapy.  Not only did this help my healing wrist, it also help arthritis in my hand.  A third bonus was softer hands.  I was thrilled to find the very reasonably priced Dr. Scholl&#x27;s paraffin spa bath.  The 3 temperatures help me to adjust quickly.  I love my spa bath kit and the fragrant paraffin that came with it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop using it. It works just like to product review said. I&#x27;ve used it so much I need to look for more wax:)</li>
            <li> This is a very easy machine to use.&lt;br /&gt;It is built for those who are just going to do personal use and for anyone who may have a small Massage business. It is very basic but doesn&#x27;t hold much paraffin wax. The inside make of it makes it hard to clean, but for the price it can easily be replaced. The mitts that are included are a bit small, but that&#x27;s good for those who have clients/patients who are petite. It is a good addition to my business. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> nice size.  allows for some real luxury at home for sure.  Melts pretty quickly and easy to store.  Nice at home treatment.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother as a birthday gift. She absolutely loves it and she says it helps her hands. She would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I replaced my old unit (Homedics) with this one, and it is wonderful. It cost more than the oldone, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a patient of mine who doesn&#x27;t shop online, but needed one. This is great for arthritis or rough skin. I have purchased these for my mom, grandma and wife as well.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and exactly how it was described in the ad.  Got one for myself and got 2 more for my sister and my friend! For a cheap parrafin spa bath, this is worth buying!</li>
            <li> Works well and is a helpful aid for arthritic hands.  I use it a few times a week.  Recommended this to others.</li>
            <li> After the first use, it never quite melted the wax any more.  Hard ridge around the edge won&#x27;t melt.  I left it sitting overnight.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend.  Would not purchase again. Cheaply made product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really help the reason I purchased it.  Not a bad product just not a good one for me.  It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I have tried this for two or more weeks. I have given it enough time to cool and it has burned me twice.  Back it goes!!!!!</li>
            <li> Use it all the time for sore fingers and to add softness for my hands.  Love it.</li>
            <li> It is kind of small and I think that it works but nothing like going to a profession place and getting this done.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Wow! I Love Love Love this item! It makes my feet feel sooooo good, especially in the winter. It doesn&#x27;t take too long to heat up &amp; it makes my feet so soft. If you want to pamper yourselves buy this. With a temperature control feature it&#x27;s a lot better than other brand names.</li>
            <li> I use this product in my chiropractic office along with another, more expensive model.  I have one unit for hands and the other for feet, I don&#x27;t cross contaminate. I use the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s for hands.  I love the dial feature that controls temperature.  My other unit is digital and only has a low, medium and hot setting which is too hot for some people.  I have had absolutely NO mechanical issues with this machine.  It performs well.  I&#x27;ve used it for over 4 years now.  It&#x27;s on continuously.  It&#x27;s a handy unit that I carry with me to all of my health fairs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI...the lid does NOT stay on well, it slips around if bumped.  It is really too small for using with feet (thus why my expensive unit is used for feet). I really wish it had a well marked \\&quot;fill line\\&quot;.  I never use anything other than unscented wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product.  I&#x27;m purchasing one for an arthritic patient for her home use.</li>
            <li> Very good appliance, you need to take care of it well</li>
            <li> Shipped promptly and works great.!</li>
            <li> I had one like the picture for several years and this is no where near the quality of my first one.  That burnt put after several years of use but this one is smaller, does not have the on off switch and  is not as large. People with arthritis, such as husband, can no longer get a foot comfortably into the basin.  Next time I will try another brand at a shop near home.</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and I liked it so  I ordered 2 more, one for my daughter and one for my daughter - in - law for Christmas presents along with extra wax.</li>
            <li> This has helped me quite a bit with the RA in my hands.</li>
            <li> Leaked out of the bottom on the very first use.  Made a huge mess!</li>
            <li> I had surgery in 2012 to repair two tendons in my pinky finger, and have endured more than a year of occupational therapy to get the hand working again. This at-home paraffin spa works wonders in helping along my progress, restoring muscle movement in my hand. Plus it makes my skin soft. (But it hasn&#x27;t lessened any wrinkles, sadly.) Unscented / therapeutic wax (buy in bulk) is a must -- plus there&#x27;s no sense in paying extra for scents when using this for muscle therapy. I would recommend this for anyone with arthritis or muscle issues in their hands or feet. The adjustable heat in the wax is soothing and penetrating, just as it is at my therapy sessions at the hospital, but without the medical bills.</li>
            <li> Arrived in time for Christmas, just wish I could find a way to get Mom to actually use it, she&#x27;s afraid the dog will knock it over or something.</li>
            <li> this is not worth your money. the wax does not melt properly and I left this gadget on all day and still the was was solid on top and melting on bottom. really disappointed about this purchase</li>
            <li> Great item. I am just too lazy to use it regularly as I should.</li>
            <li> Thanks - works good &amp; got it fast!  The wax doesn&#x27;t smell very good - like an old lady perfume. I replaced it with tea tree oil wax. Much better</li>
            <li> Takes too much time to heat the paraffin, but works fine. 4 stars for price per product outcome. Totally fine for everyday home use</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it takes quite a while for this product to heat up and melt the paraffin. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great item!</li>
            <li> It would have been a 5 star except for the fact that the amount of paraffin wax that comes with the kit was a little short of being enough to cover my hand and wrist. I think if the kit had at least 1 more brick of paraffin wax it would have been perfect.</li>
            <li> My previous feedback went to the wrong item. Very nice sturdy paraffin bath.</li>
            <li> It took hours to get the wax to melt.  In fact the wax never did completely melt.  So we sent the product back.</li>
            <li> I have used this nearly every day since I got it.  My only disappointment is the high price of replacement wax.  Seems that the 3 lbs that comes with it is only good for about half a dozen applications.  Already I am out.</li>
            <li> I bought this Parafin Bath for my husband , who injured his hand and had to have surgery.  The hand therapist recommended that he get one.  It really has helped him with the circulation and softening of  his hand.  it is a great product and the price was right!</li>
            <li> too cumbersome and hard to clean out - did not even use it - did not like the look of the inside - heated coil exposed..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this because the temperature it takes to melt the was is too hot for my over sensitive skin.  I works grreat though and wouod recommend it to others who are not so sensitive.</li>
            <li> I purchased a paraffin bath because my orthopedic doctor recommended one for my hands.  Even though the temperature settings are adjustable, it takes forever for the wax to melt even on the high setting. I&#x27;m talking hours.  Once melted, it does the job</li>
            <li> After reading instructions, I set the unit on my counter, added the wax and set it to heat. Was supposed to heat for 2 hours. After 45 minutes, I checked on it and the wax was running out of the bottom of the unit and all over my counter.</li>
            <li> A gift - she said she loves it for her arthritic hands</li>
            <li> Terribly disappointed with this item. I had to wait over TWO HOURS for the paraffin to melt to a point where I could put a hand in. Admittedly, once the wax had melted the product worked as promised, but I will never have that much time to be present and wait until it can be used. Going back.</li>
            <li> my husband went for therapy at the local hospital for his arthritic hands-one of the treatments was a paraffin bath-i saw this&lt;br /&gt;one for sale on Amazon and purchased it-works as good as the one at the hospital and really helps with the pain in his hands I would recommend this to anyone with a similar problem-it is easy to use and really works-i would also recommend purchasing extra parrafin at the same time to more easily cover the hands-love this product</li>
            <li> Acceptable, but room for improvement. It takes 2.5 hours to melt the parafin (wax). this is stated in the instructions and is not&lt;br /&gt;a fault of the Spa Bath.</li>
            <li> As reviews state it takes time to heat up.  Gave it for a Christmas gift to a person with terrible arthritic hands and was told it gave great relief</li>
            <li> This takes forever to heat up and the wax has a very strong odor of petroleum.  Once it gets hot, I found it to be sufficiently hot but the smell was so bad that I returned it.  Who knows what is in the wax to make it smell like that - can&#x27;t be good for you.</li>
            <li> This is sooo awesome! I have cracked heels in winter &amp; it feels so good on them.  It is a bit messy getting off the wax so put something underneath you.  Just like the other reviews said, the wax that comes with it is gross. I followed their instructions &amp; bought the Therabath Refill Paraffin Wax in Lavender. OMG!!! It smells so good.  I recommend this product &amp; AGAIN as others have said the lavender wax!</li>
            <li> Got this to help stave off muscle and tendon inflammation after taking up playing the viola.  I don&#x27;t know if this has done the trick, but so far so good -- and it is wonderfully comforting.  I kind of like the smell...</li>
            <li> I have had many hand waxers over the years and this product is by far the worst. It takes 2-3 hours to finally melt all the wax (4-6 lbs.).</li>
            <li> it has helped my hands  it does take time to heat but it feels wonderful when you put your hands in</li>
            <li> Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Quick Heat Paraffin Spa Bath says  it is a &amp;#34;quick heat[er].&amp;#34; Not true, my Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Quick Heat Paraffin Spa Bath takes 2 hours to heat up. I have Dupytren&#x27;s and multiple trigger fingers and thumbs so the heated paraffin helps relieve my pain.</li>
            <li> First time buyer of this type product.  Works great.  Need to have patients waiting for wax to melt, 2 hours.  Convenient for busy lifestyles.  Money saver as well.</li>
            <li> It came with everything that is needed for a paraffin dip. Takes about  1 1/2 hours to heat. I just plan on the heat time when I want to use it. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> If you have sore hands for whatever reason or even just cold achy hands, this product is superb.  Dip them in the nice warm paraffin once or twice and let it absorb.  Sooo nice and warm and takes away pain.  Also does a nice job of moisturizing dry skin as well!!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good home product and this worked perfectly! It was easy to use and did the job.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY AS I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> I have pain in one hand and fingers-think it may be osteoarthritis. That hand feels so-o much better after a wax dip I can sleep without pain in the hand. I usually have the wax dip in the evening so that I have a comfortable nights sleep. Haven&#x27;t used the&lt;br /&gt;lavender wax refill yet. Love the &amp;#34;rain&amp;#34; scented wax that came with the wax warmer.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I have tried for my arthritic hand joint. It reduces the swelling and pain quickly. The relief lasts for days. It is also better than any pill I have ever taken. I am happy to pass this information on to others who also have painful joints.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A VERY CHEAP PRODUCT AND THE WAX NEVER MELTS, TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY AND TOTAL WASTE OF TIME!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take as long as I thought to melt.  Maybe 30 - 35 minutes compared to the hour or so everyone writes.  Used as a supplement to physical therapy after hand surgery.  Works just like the commercial machine at clinic.  The variable heat setting was the major reason I went with this specific unit, and I am glad I did.  It is VERY important.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this unit to anyone looking for this type of machine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it a couple of times so far and just not sure how it will help arthritis of the fingers.  Will keep trying though.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Mother&#x27;s Day. She loves it! Great price, and a happy wife, can&#x27;t get any better than that!</li>
            <li> I love this paraffin bath, it&#x27;s basically a crock pot dedicated just to wax. I was able to use it for both my hands and my feet, but I do have fairly small feet (Women&#x27;s size 6.5 US). The wax that comes in the kit has a very lavender smell to it, but it&#x27;s nice. One bit of advice - don&#x27;t eat finger food after removing your paraffin, it does leave your hands a bit perfumed and it makes anything you touch taste funny until your hands dry completely.</li>
            <li> after reading reviews I bought this item anyway figuring most of the bad ones (reviews) wouldn&#x27;t have any affect on me. I was wrong. This &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; took 21 hours to melt the wax, initially. Now it only takes 7 hours or I can just leave it on high all the time and have wax ready in an instant. Of course it will raise my power bill and being on a fixed income that is not good. I can send it back as defective and pay $18 in freight, that I can never recover, or I can toss it in the trash, where it belongs, and buy me an oval crock pot with a candy thermometer for the same price. I think I will buy the crock pot and save money by trashing this other &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was excited by the prospect of getting relief from the pain and stiffness in my hands due to arthritis. I did not receive either. Instead I received disappointment and aggravation. The wax never melts. Whether it is left for 4hours, 6hours, 8hours. I resorted to melting the bulk (which is what is left in the Spa Bath) in the microwave in a Pyrex measuring cup. Don&#x27;t waste your $!</li>
            <li> Nothing quick about this. Takes hours to get the wax melted and ready for use. When it is ready, the wax is really hot even at the lowest level, but at the lowest level the wax is hardening again. I wouldn&#x27;t mind the heat of it wasn&#x27;t that it felt like it was burning (which it was mildly) the more sensitive parts of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bath is barely big enough for adult hands. Unless you have Size 7 ladies or smaller feet, don&#x27;t expect to be use this for feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowadays our paraffin bath is now being used to melt wax for our candle crafts. Works great for that.</li>
            <li> Works great. I can use any paraffin in it. I use it several times a week, so I keep it on, but keep in mind it will take a couple of hours to melt the wax.</li>
            <li> Got this for my sister for Christmas one year and she said it worked just fine.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what else to tell you other than she uses it and never complained to me about it.</li>
            <li> Been using it to help warm and moisturize my hands after working with soil and water during the day.  It also keeps my hands more limber.</li>
            <li> The  product was received as advertised.. No problem.  I am on a tight budget, but if this helps me holding on to items without I I&lt;br /&gt;I have osteoarthritis. I drop items that I used to be able to carry to the fridge.. yogurt etc. all over the floor..  or drop dishes and smash them into the sink when I rinse them for the diashwasher.. and I thought I should give it a try.I am on a tight budget, but I thought I would make I life better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on Dr&#x27;s recommendation.  I have pain in my hands, esp.  The directions say, &amp;#34;Cut the paraffin block in half The each piece again.&lt;br /&gt;How the devil can I do that with the condition I have?  They should  divide those blocks in pieces the size they want one to use.  This is worthless if I have to wait for someone to visit so I can get them in sections.&lt;br /&gt;Takes 2 hours to melt the pieces.  Maybe I&#x27;ll go back to Tylenol and soaking my hands in hot water..  Alas.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the first time I turned this on it leaked all of the wax out onto the counter.  Not a good buy after all.</li>
            <li> Use this two times a day for therapy its seem to be helping the pain.</li>
            <li> Work out reall good. My mom like it.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Couldn&#x27;t ask for better.</li>
            <li> The product is a good value for the price and I do quite well with it. Some features that you will miss out on include a timer/ alarm clock so that it turns on when you get home for school or work. Other than that it&#x27;s standard, with nothing fancy--it just serves its purpose. The heat doesn&#x27;t wrack up the electricity bill either. It&#x27;s easy to clean and comes with plenty of bags. The wax that it comes with does not come off as easily as other waxes that I&#x27;ve used in the past. Good for anyone, not salon material, though.</li>
            <li> The wax didn&#x27;t have a scent as another post had stated and I was concerned since I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances. Time to melt wax was as indicated. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> heated up just fine - wax included is very soapy.  had to wash hands a lot after using.</li>
            <li> I had tried this process at therapy and was told that having one at home could be beneficial as regular appointments are only 2 times a week.  It was easy to set up and easy to use and I love how the glove works on my hand, at therapy they just wrap my hand in a towel.</li>
            <li> I love to use this  heat my hands in the winter when it is so bitter cold that I feel like I will never feel warm again. This is the best way to thaw back out again. I leave my paraffin bath thawed and warm on the counter all winter long. It keeps my achy cold hands warm and soft. I get replacement wax from Sallys. This is worth having in every household in cold climates. It is wonderful. My Sons love to use it. My Daughter lin Law loves to use it. It is a family favorite.</li>
            <li> Works awesome! Does take almost 2 hours to heat up but thats what it says in the directions anyways. Ive used it several times and I love it. Super fast shipping as well! And the wax smells fantastic!!</li>
            <li> I am a 42 year old female with arthritis in my hands, which has been getting worse over the past few years (and especially in the winter).  I had used a Paraffin wax machine as part of manicures that I get and loved it so I decided to buy one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have not used one of these, basically, it&#x27;s a small plastic tub that has a lid. You put wax into it and it melts. You then dip your hands (or feet) into it a few times and it gets covered with this thin, warm coat of wax (it comes with enough wax to fill it intiially - you buy refills as needed).  You turn it on the highest heating mode to melt the wax.  If the tub is full, it takes about 2-3 hours to melt completely.  Once melted, you change the tempurature setting to the mode to keep it warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the wax melted, you dip your hand in a flat position with fingers open or closed (or foot) into the tub .  This is done quickly - just dip your hand into it (keeping your fingers still while you do it) and then pull it out.  The wax that comes with this is thin, so you have to dip your hand about 3 times to get good coverage.  Once your hand is dipped in the wax, you put your hand into a plastic bag and insert it into a mitt (both the bags and mitts come with this product) and you sit for about 10 minutes. If you are getting this done in a salon, they do both of your hands at the same time.  But, if you are doing this yourself at home, you should do only one hand at a time (for obvious reaosns).  The purpose of this is to moisturize your hands (or feet). I have arthritis in my hands, and use it to help with this pain, as well.  You can optionally use lotion on your hands before dipping (lotion is not included here) for extra moisturizing if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax that comes with it  has a very light clean scent to it. I wasn&#x27;t sure how to describe the scent, and when I saw that they called it &amp;#34;Rain scent&amp;#34;, I was a bit surprised as it smells a bit more like clean cotton to me. But, the scent is not overly strong at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 10 or 20 minutes (whatever duration you prefer), you simply pull the plastic bag off your hand and the wax comes with it. It does sometimes stick to your fingernails when trying to take it off, but this is normal for any wax. Since it&#x27;s very light, it is not greasy and leaves your hands feeling clean afterwards with no residue which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason that I have reduced my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars is because although I have only had this product for less than a year and used it less than 20 times, it is taking longer and longer to heat up from a cold state.  It used to take 1 1/2 hours to do that and now it takes between 2 - 3 hours.  The other reason for the lower rating is the wax - although it smells great, it is super thin.  Even with 5 coats, it is very difficult to remove from your skin.  Thicker wax is much more moisturizing and it&#x27;s much easier to remove from your hands when you are done with the treatment.  Once this wax is used up, I plan to order to different brand for the refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, in summary, this is a great product for arthritic hands and anyone in general as it makes you feel pampered and is a great way to relax and treat yourself at a great price.  I recommend it., the scent is not overly strong at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 10 or 20 minutes (whatever duration you prefer), you simply pull the plastic bag off your hand and the wax comes with it. It does sometimes stick to your fingernails when trying to take it off, but this is normal for any wax. Since it&#x27;s very light, it is not greasy and leaves your hands feeling clean afterwards with no residue which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason that I have reduced my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars is because although I have only had this product for less than a year and used it less than 20 times, it is taking longer and longer to heat up from a cold state.

I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wanted a paraffin spa for my hands as I have a problem with very dry skin. I read the reviews of several brands and Dr. Scholl&#x27;s seemed to be the best buy.  It melts the wax in about three hours, the instructions are easy and clear and it works great.  I have used it numerous  times and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The gift recipient seems to like it very much! It came very quickly and well packed for a safe arrival.</li>
            <li> using for carpal tunnel syndrome ... totally beneficial for the sore wrists and added benefit of soothing moisturing for the hands</li>
            <li> I purchased this paraffin bath because of the reviews I read and the price.  I use it for therapy for my hand.  Easy to use and melts the wax quickly.  It comes with wax which is a great savings.  I did purchase wintergreen wax to use with it.  I&#x27;ve used it for 3 months and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I injured my arm in an accident, and after surgery the pain extended into my wrist and hand. My physical therapist had me use his professional quality paraffin bath, and I decided I needed one at home, but I saw online that his model cost far more than I was willing to pay. Based on other reviews, I took a chance and ordered this inexpensive one, and I have not been disappointed. It is a bit small, but I don&#x27;t have a problem dunking my hand and wrist as long as I use four pounds of wax instead of the recommended three. A big plus is that the wax heats up in just a couple of hours. An on/off switch would have been nice, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a necessity.&lt;br /&gt;  Like other reviewers, I would recommend buying unscented wax--I bought &amp;#34;Mutual Beauty&amp;#34; Antibacterial Paraffin Wax-- and either using it alone or combining it with the scented wax that comes with this product.</li>
            <li> I have bad hands with one being curled.  Doesn&#x27;t work well on the curled hand because the pot isn&#x27;t deep enough.</li>
            <li> This unit works well, but it takes two hours to heat up, and I have a hard time remembering to get it plugged in two hours in advance of wanting to use it.</li>
            <li> I am personally a bit skeptical, but we have had this for a while now, and my wife absolutely adores this thing.  If you like the idea of dipping your hands in hot wax and having them come out smooth and supple when you are done, you will love it too.</li>
            <li> Works well, wife likes it, came on time and heats very good, price was reasonable but i thought it would be just a little larger</li>
            <li> I do NOT recommend buying this Spa Bath.  It gets too hot to use even when you use the keep warm setting only.  Then you must unplug it and wait quite a while until it gets cool enough to use.  I used a candy thermometer and it registered 144 degrees, again this was on the keep warm setting.  Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I nearly seared all the flesh from my hands.  It tells you to turn it on high for 2 hours.  It doesn&#x27;t mention ANYWHERE to turn it down before putting your hands in.  JEEPERS</li>
            <li> Melted wax is too hot.  When I select a lower setting the wax solidifies so I can&#x27;t submerge my hand..</li>
            <li> Everything appears to work fine. The only problem is that it is not deep enough to cover an entire fist.</li>
            <li> Difficult to get temp right and takes a long time for wax to melt. Can it be left on between uses?</li>
            <li> Heated up the thing to melt the wax... hot wax melted all right, all over my kidtchen... counter , cabinets, floor..&lt;br /&gt;My husband went on line to read about the problem...Yup I wasn&#x27;t the only person to notice this defect... and they call it an \\&quot;unresolved issue\\&quot;! Thanks for still selling it, though!</li>
            <li> I like it.  Little small for a size 9 ladies foot but it works.  Gets pretty got but I prefer it that way.  I crank it up all the way.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is the only paraffin bath that I could find that has adjustable heat. The wax that comes with it has a very perfumy smell and not good if you suffer from allergies. I was glad I listened to other reviews on the smell and bought wax (and bags) with no odor, just didn&#x27;t relized needed 3 lbs. to get started. also I can fit my size 8 foot in comfortably. I purchesed this for treatment of arthritis in hands and feet, very happy with my decision. Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I mad ethe mistake of buyign this and then not using it right away.  When I tried it, it didn&#x27;t work.  I have read some other comments that the unit didn&#x27;t work either.  I would not buy this product.</li>
            <li> This product has worked out well for me. I like the ability to do this at home at a cheaper cost than going to the salon it&#x27;s just nice to have others doing it for me. But, the product itself is great!</li>
            <li> O.k. Does the job. The first one I had was broken. But amazon is great for that. It does a good job on my hands</li>
            <li> This item an American type plug attached, you either chance changing the plug for an English one or you send it back. the cost for sending it back to America varies from £45-115. So you keep it and see what happens if you change the plug???  Very dodgy purchase.</li>
            <li> If quick heat is two hours then this is a perfect product. The wax takes two hours to completely melt. The system is also a little messy (to be expected) but the instructions do not give you any real tips. I am not going to get rid of it because my skin is smooth but I will choose a different wax. The wax that was provided with the system is very oily which I do not like and I do not remember being the case with other spa baths.</li>
            <li> This product has greatly helped my mother&#x27;s stroke stiffened hands regain their suppleness.  It is a real blessing.  If they were to make a product improvement, it would be to make it slightly longer.  We have size 8 hands in our family and long feet!</li>
            <li> Wife is happy with this gift, uses it every day... madame Tousard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this on my hands in hopes of softer skin. It feels great while I&#x27;m using it. Hands definitely feel softer and moisturized right after. THAT part is bliss. More of a challenge is learning how to use it without creating a paraffin mess. I&#x27;m getting there. The spa bath is great and does make the whole process easy. Need to plan ahead, though. It requires 2 hours for the paraffin to completely heat up. Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> It works fine; a bit of trouble to use the first time, but as time goes on it will be great.  Feels wonderful!</li>
            <li> I wish it was bigger.  It&#x27;s definitely more for hands than feet.</li>
            <li> I am impressed! This product looks and performs at the space the manufacturers said that it would.  My hands are youthful again at a very low cost.</li>
            <li> I use it for my hands and it does make my joints feel a little better.&lt;br /&gt;Set up time is too long.</li>
            <li> It is a fabulous product.  It is a Good value and well made.  Can recommend it to everyone.  Five stars!</li>
            <li> I love the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Quick Heat Paraffin Bath Spa because it relieves arthritis pain in my hands.  It takes at least an hour to heat up, but it feels wonderful once the wax is hot.  The temperature is perfect and the wax, gloves and hand-warmer mittens make the spa treatment complete.</li>
            <li> It does take awhile for the wax to melt, but that&#x27;s to be expected. This made a great gift for my parents because it helps them with chapped skin.</li>
            <li> This looks good so far but it is a lot smaller that I thought. Oh, well, that&#x27;s my fault for not checking. It is new and at the highest temperature, it took 3 hours to melt the paraffin wax half way. Allow yourself extra time to melt the wax if you plan on using it soon unless you plan on leaving it on the whole time. I just hope it works well.</li>
            <li> revisions on MAY 5, 2013&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the wax bath for five days now and it HAS QUIT HE3ATING!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;So now my star is quite off the chart it isn&#x27;t worth buying DON&#x27;T BUY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 30th 2013&lt;br /&gt;I bought unscented wax to go in the tub BUT,  the tub absorbed the smell of the scented wax packaged in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;It came with the scented wax packaged in the wax bath tub, so that the tub absorbed  the scent of the scented wax. Even though I took out the scented wax and used the unscented wax that I bought at the same time, the unscented wax picked up the scent of the scented wax that had been absorbed into the tub..  I am highly allergic to scents and the chemicals that carry them. I have already opened and tried to use the product so can&#x27;t return it.  I am highly disappointed that it came with the scented wax.&lt;br /&gt;WHY?  LET THE CUSOMER DECIDE IF THEY WANT A SCENT, and then let them add it! Could have been perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this paraffin spa.  It is a little small, so if you wear a shoe size larger than a 7 you will have trouble fitting your foot in it.  If you want it for your hands only it will be perfect.  Update:  This spa is very hard to get clean.  It works well for hands and smaller size feet, but the pain of having to clean it isn&#x27;t worth it.  Will buy another brand the next time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ready when you need it.  However, if you&#x27;ve turned it off, it doesn&#x27;t take too long to heat.  It brings amazing comfort to arthritic joints.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product, it did not get hot enough to melt all the wax, therefore it was almost impossible to insert your hand or hands into it , I would not purchase another one , I don&#x27;t know if I would even try buying one based on how this one works , I am very disappointed .I thought we found the answer to a problem, but it was not to be</li>
            <li> Great for hand. Wish it was slightly bigger for my foot. Fo leg, I have to do first for ties and then for heel.</li>
            <li> Probably just a matter of infortune.. I saw a lot of good reviews.. The bath has a good look..  After 2 treatments stopped warming.. OOPPS&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;  It is from Wal-Mart I think  &amp;#60;But it does not probably matter..  do not know what happened.. Sorry for myself  .. Came with plastic packs and a nice glove...</li>
            <li> I love how really soft the Paraffin Spa Bath makes my hands feel. The softness lasts for a really long time and the warmth is great for my arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> I am from South Africa and vottage here is 220V but I did not had an option to read the manual for the product before ordering.&lt;br /&gt;The bath above is for 120V electricity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Useless for me until now!!!</li>
            <li> Eventhough the heating light came on when plugged in, the heating element did not ever heat.Therefore the wax did not even get warm, much less melt! Because I didn&#x27;t try it until a while after I purchased it, I missed the return date, so I&#x27;m stuck with it and it doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Great product - 2nd one- first one lasted 15 years of daily use! Great for softening hands and great for arthritis/osteo arthritis!!</li>
            <li> It works just as promised. It took about 2 hours to melt the wax and it felt great after I was done. The only thing is that mine has a metal plate at the bottom and is open around that metal plate. I haven&#x27;t had to clean it yet so I don&#x27;t know how difficult it will be. I also saw the post from someone who said it had no exposed elements. This to me is an exposed element. The instructions even said not to touch this plate. I don&#x27;t know if they have changed the product since last year. Since it was only $43 I will keep it and enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I got this because the wax was included and it was also a very good price. I have been experiencing some hand pain and it was recommended that I get a spa bath (I tried one at the physical therapist and liked it).  Yes, it takes two hours to heat up the wax the first time you use it. I also recommend you break up the blocks into smaller pieces so it will melt easier. I love the scented smell and ordered more scented wax.  What I don&#x27;t particularly like? The fact that you have to take out the plastic plate after each use. I left it in the second time I used it, and it took over two hours to heat the wax up.  So I have been taking it out and the wax heats up a little faster.  The plate is there to protect you from burning yourself, but it also keeps the heat from reaching the wax. The wax does leave your hands a bit greasy, but it&#x27;s a good massage oil and your hands feel smooth. There aren&#x27;t too many of these spa baths on the market and I&#x27;ve had no issues with mine after using it about 4 times, so I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my paraffin warmer. I use it everyday and it does make my hands feel so much better. I recommend it to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my fingers and this product is what the doctor ordered.  The warm parafin wax helps in easing some of the discomfort and my hands are so soft afterwards.  It warms up within 2 hrs &amp; is larger than what I thought.  It came with the mittons, wax, &amp; plastic liners.  I have re-used the plastic liners, the wax peels off no problem &amp; then put it back in to melt &amp; use again.  I am glad I ordered this and am going to get one for my mom also. I have not tried other products so I have nothing to compare it to. The only slight problem is there is no OFF button, but to me that is a safety issue that I approve of.</li>
            <li> Its excellant, took the aches and pain out of my hands and the oils left on my hands after taking wax off helped smooth my skin. Also very nice fragrance. Very affordable price too.</li>
            <li> great, buy it you will like it</li>
            <li> Messy to use,  Feels great on hands.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy the hand spa! Highly recommend it, particularly if you have cold hands.</li>
            <li> works well for both hands and feet. takes a while to melt product but once it is ready each can be done in its turn. Since I walk 20+ miles a night and use my  hands at Amazon picking such products... The product has helped me medically&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you... have already bought booties and more parafin for this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Louisa</li>
            <li> Nice to have choice of temperature. Great deal!</li>
            <li> If this is the &amp;#34;quick heat&amp;#34;  model I&#x27;m curious to know how long the other models take to melt the wax. I received this for a gift a year ago and waited a couple months to use it. When I did use it the first time, it took over 3 hours and the wax was still not totally melted!  I used it with chunks of wax in the tub. If I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to use it, I would have returned it. I am just now getting ready to use it for the second time so maybe it will melt the wax faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, my hands felt wonderfully soft and moisturized. It was recommended that I use a hot wax treatment on my hands for arthritus and dry skin. I will try to use it more often to see if there is a real benefit.  I will just have to remember to turn it on in the afternoon for an evening treatment!</li>
            <li> Took way too long to heat up it, it was leaking from the bottom of the right side on first use called Amazon they do not even want it back too much hassle but gave me my money back so kudos to Amazon for their customer service but buyers beware do not waste your time purchasing this item it is not worth the aggravation nor the money spent!</li>
            <li> This is the second of this model that I&#x27;ve purchased.  It heats up in a short amount of time.  I&#x27;ve had no problems with either of the two.  When done dipping and sitting with the warm wax on your hands, it leaves hands soft and smooth.  The only thing I wish was different is that the cord be longer, but I simply added a small extension cord.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Thermostat works well to keep it from getting too hot.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using my hand spa on a weekly basis to ease the arthritis in my hands and the aches after a long days work as well as with my hobbies.</li>
            <li> Scented wax horrible. Was not advertised as coming with scented wax so that was a big disappointment as the package value was considered in this purchase. I would have purchased everything separate. Tried using it anyway and couldn&#x27;t get the stink out of the house for days. It melts wax but as yet have not used it until we can find unscented wax.</li>
            <li> I received broken and I had to pay to ship back.i WILL NEVER ORDERED ANYTHING ELSE FROM THIS COMPANY.i HAD TO pay 16.00</li>
            <li> Use it every day and it really does keep your hands hydraed and soft.  It is easy to use and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Very light weight.  Does a great job of softening hands.  Bath not big enough for everyone&#x27;s feet, not mine anyway (size 91/2).  Refills are expensive and hard to find.  Otherwise, great product.</li>
            <li> It does take time to melt paraffin.  I use a timer to remind me that the bath is on. Paraffin will get too hot to apply it immediately. I usually take the lid off, switch the heat bottom to low and let it cool off 10-15 min, until the temp is comfortable for my skin. Enjoy! ))&lt;br /&gt;October 2013. it still works, and I noticed some improvement in my hand skin look. I use it occasionally however, my hands look younger and smoother. I am still  using original wax pack!</li>
            <li> When I first received the product, naturally I plugged it immediately.  I worked for the that very first time, and that was it!!  It as hasn&#x27;t warmed and melted the wax since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Respectfully,&lt;br /&gt;Ms. Dissppointed</li>
            <li> Think I need to buy another for a foot message.  The hand one is so relaxing and makes your hands feel so soft and smooth.  If you have never bought one this one is totally wonderful.</li>
