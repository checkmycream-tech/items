            <li>but with this it does, i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>must-haves! :)</li>
            <li>I am glad that I purchased it.</li>
            <li>and I end up having to do a lot more passes through my hair.</li>
            <li>Does work ok,</li>
            <li>For girls with thicker hair it will take a bit longer to achieve but as long as you are patient you will be happy with the results!</li>
            <li>worth what i payed for and love the print!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and easy to use!</li>
            <li>I love it take you so much!!!</li>
            <li>She has fine hair and she loves the results she has gotten using it.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that these ceramic hair irons do smooth my hair like no others I have used.</li>
            <li>It takes five or more minutes to get hot and does not seem to reach 400 as promised.</li>
            <li>After all this, I realize that, if I can find it, I will have to pay a significantly higher price for a safe, quality product with a reliable warranty and responsive customer service.</li>
            <li>Your hair will come out straight and be very smooth.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other straighteners which worked good</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to someone looking for a good quality hair straightener.</li>
            <li>First of all this thing does a fantastic job straightening hair.  </li>
            <li>it only takes 20 minutes at the most with this product!</li>
            <li>Its great for everyday use, as it doesn&#x27;t burn your hair and leave that</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy and feels soft.</li>
            <li>The price was right from this seller.</li>
            <li>Since I wanted to test it right away</li>
            <li>Sure enough it did, ans I got it for $47 brand new!!!</li>
            <li>Seller wrote back that they do not have any more of these in stock (although they are still selling it on Amazon at a higher price).</li>
            <li>it dont get as hot idk ..</li>
            <li>it heats up fast and straqthens my hair quicker!</li>
            <li>Great item for much less the price than what they were charging in our local mall, my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li>This straightner worked fine for  few times after that we got some sound while using it and stopped working.</li>
            <li>They asked me to put it back in the post office mailing box, mark it \\&quot;return to sender\\&quot; and drop it into a mail box (it won&#x27;t fit) or an \\&quot;unattended\\&quot; mailing location.</li>
            <li>The straightener works really well.</li>
            <li>However the PYT straightener works fantastically for my friend who has much thinner hair then myself and she has had it for 2+ years</li>
            <li>It works fast and does not burn the hair.  </li>
            <li>---so much cheaper here.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>since it was a pretty good flat iron I decided to get one for myself, but since no dealer in Vancouver carry this brand, I decided to order it online from Cosmetic 4 less.</li>
            <li>This straightener does a great job of smoothing your hair but for people with thicker hair it can only handle a small piece at a time.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so straight, sleek and soft!!</li>
            <li>and when they have used it for so long they sell them for cheap online..</li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair and before I purchased this iron I tried many, I had to go over my hair many times but with this iron, I only have to go over it once!</li>
            <li>However, the more serious issues were: first, the unit does not have a GFI plug.</li>
            <li>so i need to purchase a new one..</li>
            <li>and it is still working fine even with everyday use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the mall near my house they sell this straightener for around 200 dollars.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my 16 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I have never had a straightening iron make my hair as straight as this one does and in a very short amount of time!</li>
            <li>But as far as straightening goes, I haven&#x27;t seen any difference between this to my Conair.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had hardly no luck finding a flat iron that actually gets my hair as straight as I wanted it, but this one!</li>
            <li>In the USPS box I found the unsealed (magnet closure) hair iron box and a \\&quot;free gift\\&quot; which may be a cardboard nail buffer, but I am not sure.</li>
            <li>I would surely prefer to have a safety plug on something so likely to be used near a sink, but this item has just a small traditional plug.</li>
            <li>There is a red light indicator on the unit that I am guessing should turn green once it reaches the temperature you set.</li>
            <li>The green light on mine flashed on but then went back to red and did not come back on.  </li>
            <li>the plates arent as dark black as hers are and the product just looks used there are fine scratches in the paint etc.</li>
            <li>I wrote the seller, sent them clear photos and explained the obvious problem and asked to exchange for the same item but with cover plates.</li>
            <li>This product works great and hasn&#x27;t disappointed me at all.</li>
            <li>its the very first straigtener that has left my hair soft and bouncy, and for all my african american sistas out there you know what I mean!</li>

            <li> A small slip of paper mentions this \\&quot;gift\\&quot; in the box and asks for positive feedback to be posted for this seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American female with long hair</li>
            <li> and I do believe curling my hair with this product is easier and quicker than my last flat iron.</li>
            <li> Instead there is a bare, white, rough material, with paint leaked on it, which is lower than the iron plates and so catches my hair and pulls.</li>
            <li> and I received the sane product in the same box, but the quality wasn&#x27;t the same and the box was ripped around the edges and had minor scratches around where the ceramic plates were.</li>
            <li> I purchased a PYT flat iron during Christmas from a dealer kiosk in TORONTO for my mother.</li>
            <li> It does not burn hair or leave a smell from the flat iron heat.</li>
            <li> When i revieved this i opened it up and to me it just looked smaller than what i expected</li>
            <li> Its a bit expensive but well worth it!</li>
            <li> The hair iron itself does work, but not nearly as well as expected.</li>
            <li> Second, my iron has missing parts, or tips, that should cover each outer end of the iron arms.</li>
            <li> Be careful with it though because she dropped it &amp; caused a piece of the plate to break off at the bottom.</li>
            <li> idk just not what i expected</li>
            <li> I am guessing that two small plastic covers were left off in manufacture.  </li>
            <li> I am wondering if this is a way to avoid paying for return postage for a defective item and thus Iam not confident that I would ever get my money back.   </li>
            <li> I have gotten with other straighteners.  </li>
            <li> but it seems just like any other straightener I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> So when I saw it on amazon for less than half the price I ended up getting myself, my friend and my cousins one.</li>
            <li> i can also curl my hair with it as well, &amp; my hair usually wont even curl with a curling iron</li>
            <li> so 15 mins is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair that tends to frizz</li>
            <li> recommend it to qirls with thick hair!</li>
            <li> Sadly, I cannot do so.  </li>
            <li> Im stuck with a terrible flat iron or paying the expensive shipping fees.  </li>
            <li> Could be dangerous</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s very unfair</li>
            <li> so disappointed for buying from them and trusting Amazon.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This hair tool is honestly the best I have owned yet. I&#x27;ve had hardly no luck finding a flat iron that actually gets my hair as straight as I wanted it, but this one! This flat iron takes one stroke through a piece of my hair and makes in pin straight, with my old flat iron it usually took me almost an hour to get my hair staight now it only takes 20 minutes at the most with this product! i can also curl my hair with it as well, &amp; my hair usually wont even curl with a curling iron but with this it does, i absolutely love it. it&#x27;s became one of my beauty must-haves! :)</li>
            <li> I saw this product at the mall and ever sense then I ask my Mom to get me it. But it was $400.. so I wondered if Amazon carried this product. Sure enough it did, ans I got it for $47 brand new!!! This product works great and hasn&#x27;t disappointed me at all.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that these ceramic hair irons do smooth my hair like no others I have used. I have thick, wavy hair that tends to frizz and once I tried this PYT iron at the mall, I had to have one.   The price was right from this seller. The iron arrived in a week. In the USPS box I found the unsealed (magnet closure) hair iron box and a \\&quot;free gift\\&quot; which may be a cardboard nail buffer, but I am not sure. A small slip of paper mentions this \\&quot;gift\\&quot; in the box and asks for positive feedback to be posted for this seller. Sadly, I cannot do so.  The hair iron itself does work, but not nearly as well as expected. It takes five or more minutes to get hot and does not seem to reach 400 as promised. There is a red light indicator on the unit that I am guessing should turn green once it reaches the temperature you set. The green light on mine flashed on but then went back to red and did not come back on.  However, the more serious issues were: first, the unit does not have a GFI plug. I would surely prefer to have a safety plug on something so likely to be used near a sink, but this item has just a small traditional plug. Buyer beware.  Second, my iron has missing parts, or tips, that should cover each outer end of the iron arms. Instead there is a bare, white, rough material, with paint leaked on it, which is lower than the iron plates and so catches my hair and pulls. I am guessing that two small plastic covers were left off in manufacture.  I wrote the seller, sent them clear photos and explained the obvious problem and asked to exchange for the same item but with cover plates. Seller wrote back that they do not have any more of these in stock (although they are still selling it on Amazon at a higher price). They asked me to put it back in the post office mailing box, mark it \\&quot;return to sender\\&quot; and drop it into a mail box (it won&#x27;t fit) or an \\&quot;unattended\\&quot; mailing location. I am wondering if this is a way to avoid paying for return postage for a defective item and thus Iam not confident that I would ever get my money back.   The mall seller claimed this iron retails for $200 but they sell it for $100. This Amazon seller listed it for $55. I have found another identical-looking iron on Amazon for $38, which may or may not be the same thing--meaning same manufacturer but different logo and packaging.   After all this, I realize that, if I can find it, I will have to pay a significantly higher price for a safe, quality product with a reliable warranty and responsive customer service.</li>
            <li> I purchased a PYT flat iron during Christmas from a dealer kiosk in TORONTO for my mother. since it was a pretty good flat iron I decided to get one for myself, but since no dealer in Vancouver carry this brand, I decided to order it online from Cosmetic 4 less. I trusted Amazon website to get what I was looking for and despite my husband&#x27;s disagreement to buy from internet, I decided to do so and I received the sane product in the same box, but the quality wasn&#x27;t the same and the box was ripped around the edges and had minor scratches around where the ceramic plates were. the plates weren&#x27;t the same quality as the one that I purchased for my mother. so I contacted the seller and after going back and forth for couple of weeks, they decided to refund my money but I had to pay the shipping fee to ship back to US. so not only I didn&#x27;t receive what I was expecting now Im stuck with a terrible flat iron or paying the expensive shipping fees.  That&#x27;s very unfair and Im so disappointed for buying from them and trusting Amazon.  will never buy from this website ever again.</li>
            <li> I LOOOOVE this product! its the very first straigtener that has left my hair soft and bouncy, and for all my african american sistas out there you know what I mean! Its great for everyday use, as it doesn&#x27;t burn your hair and leave that &#x27;i just straightened my hair&#x27; smell. Easy to clean and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I placed my order Friday night and I JUST received it in the mail about 20 mins ago. Since I wanted to test it right away I&#x27;ve already plugged it in and I&#x27;m done with my hair already truly an all time record. I&#x27;m an African American female with long hair so 15 mins is unbelievable. I love it take you so much!!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! I have tried many other straighteners which worked good but this one puts all the others to shame! It makes my hair so straight, sleek and soft!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11 y.o. for Christmas. It works great. It does take time to figure out how to do the curls but after watching several videos, we got it!  Be careful with it though because she dropped it &amp; caused a piece of the plate to break off at the bottom.</li>
            <li> The straightener works really well. My hair looks healthy and feels soft. I am glad that I purchased it. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great item for much less the price than what they were charging in our local mall, my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> In the mall near my house they sell this straightener for around 200 dollars. So when I saw it on amazon for less than half the price I ended up getting myself, my friend and my cousins one. This company has some of the cutest patterns and the shape and size of the straightener is a lot like a CHI. This straightener does a great job of smoothing your hair but for people with thicker hair it can only handle a small piece at a time. For somebody with thicker hair like myself it becomes very time consuming using such a narrow straightener and I end up having to do a lot more passes through my hair. However the PYT straightener works fantastically for my friend who has much thinner hair then myself and she has had it for 2+ years and it is still working fine even with everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this straightener hasn&#x27;t been great for me I would still recommend it for somebody with thinner hair. The prints are even cuter in person and it has been reliable after daily use. Your hair will come out straight and be very smooth. For girls with thicker hair it will take a bit longer to achieve but as long as you are patient you will be happy with the results!</li>
            <li> A good product that does wonders.</li>
            <li> Top quality product, great price</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 16 year old daughter.  It is a great straightener.  She has fine hair and she loves the results she has gotten using it. It works fast and does not burn the hair.  I have also used it and it does not give that burn&#x27;t hair smell I have gotten with other straighteners.  I would definitely recommend this product to someone looking for a good quality hair straightener.</li>
            <li> When i revieved this i opened it up and to me it just looked smaller than what i expected but it wasnt i measured it.. my sister in law must have the wider one.. anyways i proceeded to check it out the plates arent as dark black as hers are and the product just looks used there are fine scratches in the paint etc. it also doesnt seem to work as well as my sister in laws lik it dont get as hot idk .. but im not overly imppressed after i recived it and it looked so different i researched the brand itself and their website claims they dont sell them online so this must not bc the same product or something.. bc how it looked condition wise to me i figured after thinking bout it for a while that its lik its prolly one that they use on people at the malls and when they have used it for so long they sell them for cheap online.. idk just not what i expected</li>
            <li> I have never had a straightening iron make my hair as straight as this one does and in a very short amount of time! I received this very quickly and have been thrilled with it! Great experience all the way!!!</li>
            <li> worth what i payed for and love the print! it heats up fast and straqthens my hair quicker! recommend it to qirls with thick hair!</li>
            <li> This product works, but not to the extent that it&#x27;s said to. Supposed to be revolutionary and straighten hair faster while making it smoother but it seems just like any other straightener I&#x27;ve tried. I do like to use it for curling and I do believe curling my hair with this product is easier and quicker than my last flat iron. But as far as straightening goes, I haven&#x27;t seen any difference between this to my Conair.</li>
            <li> Best straightener ever! Only issue is there is not a timed shut off, so if you forget, it stays on all day. Could be dangerous</li>
            <li> My wife and I got this for my neice for Christmas. She loves it! Plus, it was way cheaper than the stores around here.</li>
            <li> amazing! amazing! amazing! amazing! amazing! amazing! amazing! amazing! amazing! amazing! amazing! amazing! my sister-in-law broke mine so i need to purchase a new one..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing my favorite straighter it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! i use it every day and just wish i knew how to actually curl my hair with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and I absolutely love it! Its a bit expensive but well worth it! Arrived in great conditions!</li>
            <li> I got it three days later than the estimate date.. and when I got it a peice of the plate was broke..</li>
            <li> First of all this thing does a fantastic job straightening hair.  Do Not buy from a mall kiosk ever again---so much cheaper here.&lt;br /&gt;One star off because ceramic is fragile and they do not offer to buy replacement blades. So don&#x27;t drop it!</li>
            <li> This straightner worked fine for  few times after that we got some sound while using it and stopped working. It says 1 year manufacture warranty on the box but when we contacted manufacturer they said this seller is not authorised dealer so they dont cover warranty.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend, not the same as the one you would buy at the mall.  Does work ok, just know the quality isnt the same.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and before I purchased this iron I tried many, I had to go over my hair many times but with this iron, I only have to go over it once! This one takes the cake. I can now style my own hair! Leaves hair soft and shiny. It does not burn hair or leave a smell from the flat iron heat.</li>
