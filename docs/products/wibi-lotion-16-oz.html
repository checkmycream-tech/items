            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to see it is available here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have used Wibi  Lotion for over 50 years, it is the best skin lotion for dry skin, particularly In the winter</li>
            <li>It was recommended by a dermatologist years ago and it was all I used and had to be a special order at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li>think that Wibi Lotion, while hard to get sometimes, is the best lotion you can buy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Wibi lotion  for many years as recommended by my Dermatologist and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my face; I use it as cleanser i.e. soap substitute, and moisturizer, pr instructions, and my skin looks very  good.&lt;br /&gt;JHS</li>
            <li>and it is well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>But it is worth $15 or $16.</li>
            <li>Excellent, I have used this product for approximately 30 years.</li>
            <li>many thanks and much appreciation to Amazon, Sam&#x27;s Club and Samantha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a refreshing lotion for my skin, and feels so much better than other creams.</li>
            <li>this is a lotion that goes right into your skin...</li>
            <li>Wibi Lotion, by Healthpoint Labs, is the best lotion for persons with eczema, dry skin, and any other conditions of the skin.  </li>
            <li>; now only available on-line or by special order.  </li>
            <li>i brought some back a couple of years ago and that is me just finished it...and was in a panic to find more, cant get it here.</li>
            <li>It is a surprise to me that this lotion is not more popular or more available locally.</li>
            <li>It is so different from most lotions in texture and feel on the skin.</li>
            <li>I hAVE BEEN USING WIBI FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS FOR DRY SKIN</li>
            <li>and this is the only lotion that really helps keep it smooth.</li>
            <li>I believe years ago it was available by prescription only.</li>
            <li>The whole family use it...</li>
            <li>In the spring and summer, this lotion works better than any other one I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>You can see dry, scaly skin plump up and smooth out.</li>
            <li>it is the best cream for dry hands that you can buy, plus it last for ever as you only need to use a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li>I live in Ayrshire in Scotland, my Aunt and Uncle stay in south carolina and brought this cream over to us years ago.....</li>
            <li>It contains no lanolin, wax, soy or other possible allergens for many people.</li>
            <li>It can be purchased over the counter, but is not usually carried because of its price.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Wibi Dry Skin Lotion for 40yrs every morning, it is an outstanding moisturizer that my Dermatologist in Arizona recommended for dry skin...</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay for shipping, but I&#x27;ll pay for shipping for the chance to have soft, non-itchy, skin.  </li>
            <li>This was originally recommended by a dermatologist for skin dried from swimming in a pool.  </li>
            <li>I found an older bottle of it in my cabinet and I am going back to it.</li>
            <li>I use it year-round, but it&#x27;s very helpful in the dry winter.</li>
            <li>a little pricey but worth every penny .</li>
            <li>My face developed red irritation patches.</li>
            <li>and it really helped my hands, especially when they were dry, cracked and bleeding.</li>

            <li> have recommended it to many people and some cannot get past the unusualness of it, but once you get used to it you will be a die hard fan.</li>
            <li> A bottle last a very long time and you actually waste it if you use more than a very small amount.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She says it is the only lotion that helps with her dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost every lotion you can think of, ranging from the downright cheap to the extraordinarily expensive.  </li>
            <li> After several tries on my body, I have decided that I will regrettably dispose of this lotion in the garbage.</li>
            <li> It sinks in almost immediately and is definitely not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used Wibi Lotion since my teenage years, it was recommended by a dermatologist, and I will not use any other lotion.</li>
            <li> This stickiness remains for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I had extremely dry skin and nothing was helping.  </li>
            <li> and it took care of my dry skin.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff during the winter for dry skin and it works like nothing else.</li>
            <li> I have severe dry skin</li>
            <li> I had suffered for years with psoriasis on my hip and one day I ran out of my usual lotion (which I use after showing because my skin is so dry) and found an old bottle of Wibi lotion that had been put away for some time.</li>
            <li> I put it in a small twist type bottle and use a strip that is barely an inch long.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> It has become harder and harder to find</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.  </li>
            <li> I continue to use this lotion on my body and now my face, and have noticed my skin seems smoother and less dry.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, just a dime size portion in my hands to rub over my just washed &amp; dried face.</li>
            <li> and I use very little of it.</li>
            <li> It seems expensive per bottle but actually costs very little per use.  </li>
            <li> I have just paid a small fortune to ship it over here</li>
            <li> I have no eye lines, and very few wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the plain, medicinal bottle fool you!</li>
            <li> It has been a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I find it to be uncomfortably sticky on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I tried all of the expensive lotions, etc.  </li>
            <li> Im addicted!</li>
            <li> IT IS INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO FIND</li>
            <li> I have horrible dry, flaky, cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> Through the years it has become difficult to find - Amazon found it!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed I reported the problem.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever!  It has been around for decades. Don&#x27;t let the plain, medicinal bottle fool you! I believe years ago it was available by prescription only. I have used many expensive body and face moisturizers.....nothing works as well. You can see dry, scaly skin plump up and smooth out. It only heals skin, but improves texture and firmness.  I am so pleased that Wibi is available on Amazon.  Ordering from the pharmacies is often a hassle.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry skin product ever.  I have been using it for over 30 years.  It has become harder and harder to find; now only available on-line or by special order.  I couldn&#x27;t go a day without it -- my face says \\&quot;thank you\\&quot; when I slather it on in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 25 years.  Fantastic moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Based on the rave reviews for this product and because I am not allergic to any of the ingredients listed, I ordered this lotion.  It has been a big disappointment. I find it to be uncomfortably sticky on the skin.  This stickiness remains for a very long time. The lotion does not feel at all soothing and leaves a shiny surface. My face developed red irritation patches. After several tries on my body, I have decided that I will regrettably dispose of this lotion in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I had suffered for years with psoriasis on my hip and one day I ran out of my usual lotion (which I use after showing because my skin is so dry) and found an old bottle of Wibi lotion that had been put away for some time. I decided to use it because I had nothing else. After using it for maybe five or so times, I noticed that the skin on my hip had almost cleared up and so I continued using the lotion and the patch of psoriasis that was on my hip is now gone.     I continue to use this lotion on my body and now my face, and have noticed my skin seems smoother and less dry.</li>
            <li> I love WiBi Lotion.  A friend told me about it a couple of years ago and Amazon is about the only place I can find it.  The price isn&#x27;t the lowest, but there&#x27;s no shipping since I have Amazon Prime.  I love this lotion after a shower and wouldn&#x27;t be without it..  I use it year-round, but it&#x27;s very helpful in the dry winter.</li>
            <li> Once a standard product in some pharmacies for healing sores and extra dry skin, this product works like non other for my dry skin in a very arid environment. Once recommended by a dermatologist as safer alternative to steroid creams (which cause skin thinning) I am happy to have it back! a little pricey but worth every penny .</li>
            <li> I live in Ayrshire in Scotland, my Aunt and Uncle stay in south carolina and brought this cream over to us years ago.....i brought some back a couple of years ago and that is me just finished it...and was in a panic to find more, cant get it here. I was so pleased when i found it on amazon. I have just paid a small fortune to ship it over here and it is well worth every penny. The whole family use it...it is the best cream for dry hands that you can buy, plus it last for ever as you only need to use a little bit at a time. Once you buy and try it once you will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> We have used Wibi for many years and it is an excellent lotion for dry, distressed skin. This was originally recommended by a dermatologist for skin dried from swimming in a pool.  It is a refreshing lotion for my skin, and feels so much better than other creams. It is a surprise to me that this lotion is not more popular or more available locally.Try it, you will be amazed.</li>
            <li> works great --I&#x27;ve been using it for years</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, and decided it was safe to try this for myself. I&#x27;m glad I did, because it&#x27;s every bit as good as the reviews said it was. I don&#x27;t see how this lotion could disappoint anyone.</li>
            <li> I began using this product on the advice of a doctor that I knew when I was in college.  I had extremely dry skin and nothing was helping.  I tried all of the expensive lotions, etc.  Then he told me to use this product twice a day and it took care of my dry skin.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think that Wibi Lotion, while hard to get sometimes, is the best lotion you can buy.  It seems expensive per bottle but actually costs very little per use.  I put it in a small twist type bottle and use a strip that is barely an inch long.  At the most, it is maybe an 1/8 of a teaspoon.  And I am now doing it only once a day.  A bottle like this lasts me more than a year.  That adds up to a bargain.  Many lotions have to be replaced once a month.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This product can be used under makeup but give the lotion a chance to sink into your skin before you apply makeup as it tends to mix with it otherwise.</li>
            <li> Wibi Lotion, by Healthpoint Labs, is the best lotion for persons with eczema, dry skin, and any other conditions of the skin.  I have been using it for over 30 years. It contains no lanolin, wax, soy or other possible allergens for many people. It can be purchased over the counter, but is not usually carried because of its price.  Your druggist will order it for you, but you may do better ordering it on the web.I paid %15 a bottle for a year and Walgreen&#x27;s just recently wanted to charge me $26 a bottle.  Puhleeze! But it is worth $15 or $16.</li>
            <li> Great Skin Lotion, I&#x27;m a retired dental hygienist and it really helped my hands, especially when they were dry, cracked and bleeding.</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years.</li>
            <li> This product has been around for many years and it is absolutely great for dry skin.  Everyone should buy it!!!!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my doctor a couple of years ago.  It&#x27;s a great product.  Wish I could find it in a local store.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 30 years and I can not find it in the stores. So I had to have the retailer order it for me. It was recommended to me by a dermatologist, back around 1985 and have told others about Wibi. Thank you for finding it for me.</li>
            <li> I have used Wibi Lotion since my teenage years, it was recommended by a dermatologist, and I will not use any other lotion.</li>
            <li> Im addicted! This stuff makes your skin feel wonderful. I have used it for 25 years and I am so glad amazon has it. I cant find it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff during the winter for dry skin and it works like nothing else. Which may explain why they can get away with charging $28 FOR 16 OZ OF LOTION!!  What&#x27;s in there?? Ground-up lamb glands?? The tears of infants? What???</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the service I received from the seller was superb.</li>
            <li> Excellent, I have used this product for approximately 30 years. I have very dry skin and this is the only lotion that really helps keep it smooth.</li>
            <li> I do love the product and have been using it since 1952 when my physician at that time suggested it. Through the years it has become difficult to find - Amazon found it! I ordered six (6) bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the package arrived there were only 5 bottles. Very disappointed I reported the problem. Immediately I received a notice that all would be corrected and it was. Two (2) days latter the 6th bottle was delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My many thanks and much appreciation to Amazon, Sam&#x27;s Club and Samantha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roberta</li>
            <li> My Grandmother has used this product for years.  I order Wibi for her.  She swears by it and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else if given the option.</li>
            <li> I have used Wibi  Lotion for over 50 years, it is the best skin lotion for dry skin, particularly In the winter</li>
            <li> I have used the Wibi Dry Skin Lotion for 40yrs every morning, it is an outstanding moisturizer that my Dermatologist in Arizona recommended for dry skin...this is a lotion that goes right into your skin...no greasiness..I use it under my makeup but just good for the skin with or without.</li>
            <li> I order this for my mother who swears by it. She says it is the only lotion that helps with her dry skin.</li>
            <li> Been using it for decades…..and I look decades younger than I am.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wibi for more years than I can recall. It is so different from most lotions in texture and feel on the skin. It sinks in almost immediately and is definitely not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I use it after showering as I find it applies much better and I use very little of it. A bottle last a very long time and you actually waste it if you use more than a very small amount.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended it to many people and some cannot get past the unusualness of it, but once you get used to it you will be a die hard fan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wibi lotion  for many years as recommended by my Dermatologist and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my face; I use it as cleanser i.e. soap substitute, and moisturizer, pr instructions, and my skin looks very  good.&lt;br /&gt;JHS</li>
            <li> Have used this very product for more than 50 years - honestly!  It is the best moisturizer on the market as far as I am concerned.  I have no eye lines, and very few wrinkles.  It has &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; one of my feet that was peeling.  I will be 72 next month so I have had time to verify my findings. LOL The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the prices keeps going up and up and up.</li>
            <li> I have recently gone back to using Wibi after several years of using various lotions. If you want fancy perfume type lotion, this isn&#x27;t it. It has a very pleasant menthol type scent that I love. It was recommended by a dermatologist years ago and it was all I used and had to be a special order at the pharmacy. I found an older bottle of it in my cabinet and I am going back to it. What was I thinking by not using it recently?! I&#x27;m so excited to see it is available here at Amazon. I will be ordering soon.</li>
            <li> The best and most effective moisturizer ever!  I have severe dry skin and it&#x27;s the only lotion that works.  Expensive but worth it.  A little goes a very long way. After bathing or showering, apply it all over and skin looks supple and feels great!</li>
            <li> I have been using wibi lotion since 1976 &amp; i wish i had discovered it earlier.  I use it everyday, just a dime size portion in my hands to rub over my just washed &amp; dried face. I avoid my nose.  Wibi is fabulous, people stop me all the time asking me what i use on my skin.  It used to be over the counter, now i buy on line or have the pharmacy order it.</li>
            <li> I hAVE BEEN USING WIBI FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS FOR DRY SKIN AND IT HAS MADE A GREAT DIFFERENCE.  IT IS INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO FIND SO I AM GRATEFUL TO AMAZON FOR MAKING IT AVAILABLE.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using this for over 6 years ever since my aunts dermatologist recommended it to prevent wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have horrible dry, flaky, cracked skin.  I have always had it.  I&#x27;ve used almost every lotion you can think of, ranging from the downright cheap to the extraordinarily expensive.  In the spring and summer, this lotion works better than any other one I&#x27;ve ever used.  In the winter, if I combine it with Amlactin, it also works.  I wish I could find it locally so I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay for shipping, but I&#x27;ll pay for shipping for the chance to have soft, non-itchy, skin.  We be loving Wibi.</li>
