            <li>Guess it&#x27;s true that amazon isn&#x27;t always the best way to go.</li>

            <li>This absolutely the best invention ever!</li>
            <li>Handy.</li>
            <li>But I will say that it is very strong.</li>
            <li>These are by far the best custom palettes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Pretty happy</li>
            <li>and I cleaned it up nicely and easily with a cotton ball and some rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>I really love this size of the z palette.</li>
            <li>I love the Z palette.</li>
            <li>It is sturdy and better</li>
            <li>and you get more space in these.</li>
            <li>Overall, these are the best priced for what you get.</li>
            <li>and i just checked the manufacturers website and the price this seller is charging is more than what they are on the z-palette website.  </li>
            <li>All testers and pans fit nicely.</li>
            <li>but i had so many pans buying this</li>
            <li>I love the Z-palette.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t been able to use it yet.</li>
            <li>Make sure you do that</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>saver!!&lt;br /&gt;Although from my research, when travelling abroad, I would use the MAC plastic palettes since they are more durable and the Z palette has more of a nylon see through cover</li>
            <li>cannot wait to receive the Z palette and save so much more</li>
            <li>Buy it if you have many eyeshadows and</li>
            <li>I WISH THAT THERE WAS MORE SPACE</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really kind of fun!</li>
            <li>But really, these are the best palette for anyone who wants to de-clutter and organise their makeup.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to order more from z pallete. :)</li>
            <li>love it, can fit all of my makeupgeek shadows in 2 of them versus buying 3.</li>
            <li>I can fit so many eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Now I need to find an easy way to depot everything, so I don&#x27;t spend hours depoting.</li>
            <li>it came very quick.  </li>
            <li>it works and makes it easy to store pans</li>
            <li>and it was fine.</li>
            <li>In the extra Large I can fit 35 Makeup Geek cosmetics or MAC ones perfectly.</li>
            <li>they will def all fit inside.</li>
            <li>The different colors are also great because it helps to distinguish between palettes.</li>
            <li>The magnetic closure is amazingly secure.</li>
            <li>I have some I still haven&#x27;t filled because the hardest part about using these is getting the products out of their containers.</li>
            <li>and I can fit in those what I use to have to fit in a bunch of drawers.</li>
            <li>Also, I like that there are no holes or dividers in them so that you can fit any size or shape pan in them.  </li>
            <li>Yaby palettes are good as far as the closure, mirror and durability.</li>
            <li>I guess I thought it would hold more, but the measurements are right there.</li>
            <li>so I can easily and quickly see where my shadows are</li>
            <li>I think the z-palette is worth the money!</li>
            <li>My favorite part about the z palettes though are that the top cover is clear</li>
            <li>But other than that I think it will work out great.</li>
            <li>It comfortable fit my UD Deluxe shadow box, UD Ammo palette, UD Vice palette, and a PF shimmer strip with still having a good amount of room left for the loose pigment samples I am about to press and add to the palette.</li>
            <li>Luckily it was in a metal container that is magnetic.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend these more highly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read all the reviews and everything seems pretty accurate.</li>
            <li>The magnet is strong but not too much to where I can&#x27;t pull the pan out.</li>
            <li>palette.&lt;br /&gt;It seems much lighter and easier to travel with on jobs and ofcourse a HUGE space</li>
            <li>depotted my first blush last night and it was very easy to pry it out of the container.</li>
            <li>worth it, its big but its more square than the large version.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different kinds, MAC, SMH, no brand on Ebay, Yaby.</li>
            <li>have many different zpalettes in my collection.</li>
            <li>I have many pro palettes (from MAC, Stila, etc), but these are definitely my favourite.  </li>
            <li>I was able to condense all of my  eyeshadows from multiple cases to one convenient spot</li>
            <li>or you will have a mess to clean up inside of your nice new Z Palette</li>
            <li>You can fit many different shapes and sizes of all different products.</li>
            <li>I find that when my makeup is organised well I tend to make better use of it because I can actually see what I have instead of having to rummage through drawers to try and find a particular product.  </li>
            <li>I broke a few powders while depotting them from their original containers, but you can easily fix them with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>These save me so much storage space for my makeup.</li>
            <li>They are very durable and can with stand daily/work use.</li>
            <li>This is very time consuming.</li>
            <li>and I have saves so much space on my makeup table.</li>
            <li>it makes things so much easier.  </li>
            <li>I wish they made an even bigger size than this, because I like to group my collections by brand and sometimes a colour collection won&#x27;t fit in one palette.  </li>
            <li>I read in the reviews that the magnets don&#x27;t stick very well,</li>
            <li>I love that there is a clear window so that you can see what is inside without having to open them up.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited to transfer all Naked 3 pallets into this one..</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy again and multiple more.</li>
            <li>This is a PRO size, not Extra Large, and not the Large.</li>
            <li>It holds 32-33 MAC size shadows while Large holds 28 and Extra Large holds 35.</li>
            <li>I did enjoy consolidating my other palettes into this one.</li>
            <li>The zpalette only needs to be filled, nothing extra.</li>
            <li>The clear cover helps to see what you have</li>
            <li>Most other palettes have dividers all ready in them that you need to remove if you want to use all the space or add pans that aren&#x27;t round.</li>
            <li>The lid is also very sturdy and won&#x27;t just open without you actually trying to or under a lot of pressure.</li>
            <li>but it was more expensive and did not hold as much.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at these for a long time and finally got one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not indestructible, but it will last me a very long time because I&#x27;m just going to use it at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using zpalettes for a long time</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what took me so long!</li>
            <li> It has allowed me to put all my fav single eyeshadows in one place.</li>
            <li> But, just like the reviews said, all I did was pat it back down</li>
            <li> I actually used a manicuring tool that I usually use to push back my cuticles.</li>
            <li> I ordered two, and they are holding (with a lot of room to spare) 3 Urban Decay book of Shadows plus several other small palettes.</li>
            <li> It fits 35 standard round eye shadows or 12 Mac sized blushes.</li>
            <li> Enough to hold four to five blush pans and a few shadow pans.</li>
            <li> then other palettes I have used</li>
            <li> Being a makeup artist myself, I find it really hard to take along all my different eyeshadow palettes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> AND A BIT LESS PRICY.</li>
            <li> This has helped narrow down my makeup by putting everything all in one place.</li>
            <li> This was the same size as the regular ones I ordered... :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and not too thick of materiel</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still too expensive for a cardboard box with a magnet.</li>
            <li> The magnets are useless!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really love this size of the z palette. It comfortable fit my UD Deluxe shadow box, UD Ammo palette, UD Vice palette, and a PF shimmer strip with still having a good amount of room left for the loose pigment samples I am about to press and add to the palette. It&#x27;s sturdy and not too thick of materiel so it isn&#x27;t bulky in my makeup storage area.  My favorite part about the z palettes though are that the top cover is clear so I can easily and quickly see where my shadows are and if I want to use them.</li>
            <li> The palette was very nice but when I ordered the &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; size they will hold up to 33 MAC shadows. This was the same size as the regular ones I ordered... :(</li>
            <li> I am so excited to transfer all Naked 3 pallets into this one.. they will def all fit inside.</li>
            <li> Genius idea for keeping all of your eyeshadows in one convenient package. I like that they include the sticker magnets with the palette.  Will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Awesome palette at a great price. These save me so much storage space for my makeup. It fits 35 standard round eye shadows or 12 Mac sized blushes.</li>
            <li> I love the Z palette. It is sturdy and better then other palettes I have used and you get more space in these. In the extra Large I can fit 35 Makeup Geek cosmetics or MAC ones perfectly. I especially if you travel a lot these are life savers. Protects your investment.</li>
            <li> This is a PRO size, not Extra Large, and not the Large. People pls don&#x27;t confuse it. Pro size is now discontinued by Z Palette. It holds 32-33 MAC size shadows while Large holds 28 and Extra Large holds 35.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best custom palettes I&#x27;ve used. I have tried many different kinds, MAC, SMH, no brand on Ebay, Yaby. Most other palettes have dividers all ready in them that you need to remove if you want to use all the space or add pans that aren&#x27;t round. The zpalette only needs to be filled, nothing extra. Yaby palettes are good as far as the closure, mirror and durability. You get the big mirror, but then you can&#x27;t see what you have in the palette until you open it. Overall, these are the best priced for what you get. They are very durable and can with stand daily/work use. They keep everything nice and snug. You can fit many different shapes and sizes of all different products. If it&#x27;s in a pan, you can add it to the zpalette. The different colors are also great because it helps to distinguish between palettes. The magnetic closure is amazingly secure. The clear cover helps to see what you have inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have many different zpalettes in my collection. I have some I still haven&#x27;t filled because the hardest part about using these is getting the products out of their containers. This is very time consuming. Now I need to find an easy way to depot everything, so I don&#x27;t spend hours depoting.</li>
            <li> it came very quick.  It also came with the magnetics.  I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to use it yet though.  It seems like a great pallet fir the price</li>
            <li> love it, can fit all of my makeupgeek shadows in 2 of them versus buying 3. worth it, its big but its more square than the large version. it works and makes it easy to store pans</li>
            <li> This absolutely the best invention ever! I&#x27;ve been using zpalettes for a long time and I have saves so much space on my makeup table. I can take blushes, eye shadows, powders, lipsticks, cream products with me without taking up a lot of space. I have all sizes but the one I like the best is the pro. I can fit so many eyeshadow. I have 10 of these and I can fit in those what I use to have to fit in a bunch of drawers. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have a z palette and i just checked the manufacturers website and the price this seller is charging is more than what they are on the z-palette website.  Guess it&#x27;s true that amazon isn&#x27;t always the best way to go.</li>
            <li> I guess I thought it would hold more, but the measurements are right there. I did enjoy consolidating my other palettes into this one. Handy.</li>
            <li> All testers and pans fit nicely. Wish they came bigger not the sellers fault. Enough to hold four to five blush pans and a few shadow pans.</li>
            <li> I was going to make a dupe but i had so many pans buying this made it a cheaper investment. But I will say that it is very strong. The magnet is strong but not too much to where I can&#x27;t pull the pan out. The lid is also very sturdy and won&#x27;t just open without you actually trying to or under a lot of pressure. It also came with extra adhesive magnets in different shapes. Pretty happy but it&#x27;s still too expensive for a cardboard box with a magnet. It&#x27;s just convenient if you don&#x27;t want to do the extra labor to make a dupe.</li>
            <li> The magnets are useless!</li>
            <li> this product works great. holds all of my shadows and more! I&#x27;m excited to order more from z pallete. :)</li>
            <li> I love the Z-palette. I do not use it for travel so it works well for me. It has allowed me to put all my fav single eyeshadows in one place. I was considering the Uni but it was more expensive and did not hold as much. I think the z-palette is worth the money!</li>
            <li> perfect for keeping pressed powders in one place. Side note: I broke a few powders while depotting them from their original containers, but you can easily fix them with rubbing alcohol. I ordered two, and they are holding (with a lot of room to spare) 3 Urban Decay book of Shadows plus several other small palettes.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that it came with a variety of sized magnet stickers. The stickers that are included are too big for the eye shadows I&#x27;m am putting in so I haven&#x27;t been able to use it yet. But other than that I think it will work out great.</li>
            <li> I love these palettes!  I have many pro palettes (from MAC, Stila, etc), but these are definitely my favourite.  I love that there is a clear window so that you can see what is inside without having to open them up.  With a big make up collection like mine it makes things so much easier.  Also, I like that there are no holes or dividers in them so that you can fit any size or shape pan in them.  And they come with a set of magnet stickers so that if the pans you have aren&#x27;t magnetic you can still put them in the palette.  I wish they made an even bigger size than this, because I like to group my collections by brand and sometimes a colour collection won&#x27;t fit in one palette.  But really, these are the best palette for anyone who wants to de-clutter and organise their makeup.  I find that when my makeup is organised well I tend to make better use of it because I can actually see what I have instead of having to rummage through drawers to try and find a particular product.  I can&#x27;t recommend these more highly.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my purchase. I&#x27;ve been looking at these for a long time and finally got one. Don&#x27;t know what took me so long! I&#x27;ve read all the reviews and everything seems pretty accurate. It&#x27;s not indestructible, but it will last me a very long time because I&#x27;m just going to use it at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I depotted my first blush last night and it was very easy to pry it out of the container. I actually used a manicuring tool that I usually use to push back my cuticles. It worked perfectly. Luckily it was in a metal container that is magnetic. I then did the same thing with an eye shadow, but even though it&#x27;s in a metal container, it wasn&#x27;t magnetic. I have no idea how magnetization works. I thought that all metal containers would stick to the Z Palette. But, they don&#x27;t. So, I&#x27;ll have to glue one of the magnets onto the back of this one. I read in the reviews that the magnets don&#x27;t stick very well, so I&#x27;m going to get some superglue. There was a lot of goo on the back of my blush and I cleaned it up nicely and easily with a cotton ball and some rubbing alcohol. Make sure you do that or you will have a mess to clean up inside of your nice new Z Palette case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had a bit of a problem when I accidentally pushed some of the blush itself out of the container with my cuticle pusher tool. But, just like the reviews said, all I did was pat it back down and it was fine. I always though makeup was ruined if it broke, but it&#x27;s not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get one of these! You will love it. Happy depotting! it&#x27;s really kind of fun!</li>
            <li> Being a makeup artist myself, I find it really hard to take along all my different eyeshadow palettes.&lt;br /&gt;I have the MAC palettes for blush and eye shadow as well, but think I will transfer everything over to this Z palette.&lt;br /&gt;It seems much lighter and easier to travel with on jobs and ofcourse a HUGE space saver!!&lt;br /&gt;Although from my research, when travelling abroad, I would use the MAC plastic palettes since they are more durable and the Z palette has more of a nylon see through cover which cracks easily!&lt;br /&gt;I cannot wait to receive the Z palette and save so much more space!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe I haven&#x27;t heard about the Z pallete until now &lt;3 &lt;3</li>
            <li> Best invention for makeup artists like myself. Great organizing tool. Buy it if you have many eyeshadows and no where to organize them.</li>
            <li> This z palette is wonderful  for all eyeshadows drugstore and mac.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I was able to condense all of my  eyeshadows from multiple cases to one convenient spot</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS PALETTE TO TRANSFER MY URBAN DECAY AND MAC POTS. I WISH THAT THERE WAS MORE SPACE THOUGH AND A BIT LESS PRICY.</li>
            <li> This has helped narrow down my makeup by putting everything all in one place. I would definitely buy again and multiple more.</li>
