            <li>Quickly received and fair priced!</li>
            <li>i gladly put up with the burning hair smell than have to TWEEZE</li>
            <li>I only use my Nono on my face, so these are perfect!</li>
            <li>I am Satisfied with the refills and buffer.......</li>
            <li>I love my No</li>
            <li>Love my No No! just need a quick replacement thermicon tip, this more than fit the bill.</li>
            <li>The refill tips are working just fine.  </li>
            <li>Seller shipped it to me quickly and the tips work better than the ones I got from no no.</li>
            <li>does a great job, especially when there is a problem with an order.</li>
            <li>Transaction went smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I have too much soft, downy, fair hair on face and neck.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it works and it is very easy to use</li>
            <li>Replacement shipped quickly</li>
            <li>I have purchased tip refills before without a problem, but these would not get hot enough to do any good.</li>
            <li>Refills are exactly like the original that came with the No No product.</li>
            <li>it would be nice if they made an even smaller (shorter) tip.</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about the no no.  </li>
            <li>I got the face right</li>
            <li>Face pad was a bit too small otherwise great</li>
            <li>product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This is my first need of replacement tips.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>it certainly makes a difference</li>
            <li>(grew up on very high sugar diet, shows in this overgrowth).</li>
            <li>really doesn&#x27;t do the job as well as I had hoped it would.&lt;br /&gt;amazon</li>
            <li>After going over face/neck with the no-no, I gently wipe face, circular motions, with 600mm sandpaper</li>
            <li>I have my reservations about this product and if it really works at all.</li>
            <li>I think it just burns existing hair but really doesn&#x27;t discourage hair growth.</li>
            <li>I real like the NoNo product.</li>
            <li>Many negative reviews on this product leads me to believe is it may be more specific than advertised.</li>
            <li>I believe a new machine is probably what I will need.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient to be able to order replacements for small parts!  </li>
            <li>The downy hair isn&#x27;t easily noticed by others because it is so thin and light, but when removed, my skin looks much younger.</li>
            <li>Found this to be most practical and affordable for myself since I only use the small tips.</li>
            <li>I feel I wasted money buying it in the first place and only replaced the thermicon tips in a last ditch effort to really see if I could make it work.</li>
            <li>i have the no no for a long while but needed new tips  </li>
            <li>It covers such a small area that you would spend too much time trying to eliminate hair in large areas.  </li>
            <li>First one broke after first use:(  The second was is still going strong.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> First one broke after first use:(  The second was is still going strong.</li>
            <li> I got the face right no no thermiconâ€‹ tips to refill my no no device.  I just didn&#x27;t like the buffer being as small as it is.  I thought I would receive a larger buffer.  That is the only thing about the purchase I didn&#x27;t like so I didn&#x27;t give five stars.</li>
            <li> product is exactly as described. it would be nice if they made an even smaller (shorter) tip. no!no! works great.  i gladly put up with the burning hair smell than have to TWEEZE</li>
            <li> the tips work well, but the no! no! really doesn&#x27;t do the job as well as I had hoped it would.&lt;br /&gt;amazon does a great job, especially when there is a problem with an order. I will definatley shop there again!</li>
            <li> Face pad was a bit too small otherwise great</li>
            <li> Good product.  Works well. Replacement shipped quickly</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about the no no.  It covers such a small area that you would spend too much time trying to eliminate hair in large areas.  I use it because I bought it.  It does get rid of hair though.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time, product works and fits like it should.</li>
            <li> I only use my Nono on my face, so these are perfect!</li>
            <li> I have purchased tip refills before without a problem, but these would not get hot enough to do any good.</li>
            <li> I am Satisfied with the refills and buffer.......I didn&#x27;t know I needed refills when I bought the no no...&lt;br /&gt;I think they are expensive though.</li>

            <li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good shape and as advertised.</li>
            <li> If you use a NO NO you&#x27;ll need these eventually ... and you might-as-well get it where you got it.</li>
            <li> It does work, it does!! There is just a learning curve on the proper way to hold it and roll it. Once you figure out the correct speed it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> This refill &amp;#34;Fit perfectly&amp;#34;  I love my No No!</li>
            <li> Refills are exactly like the original that came with the No No product. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Have had an 8800 no-no for 2 years. Works great for me. Many negative reviews on this product leads me to believe is it may be more specific than advertised. I have too much soft, downy, fair hair on face and neck. If you&#x27;ve ever seen someone with polycystic ovarian syndrome, you might know what I mean. (grew up on very high sugar diet, shows in this overgrowth). The no-no has been a perfect solution. I use it weekly. This is my first need of replacement tips. The small tip is the one I use. After going over face/neck with the no-no, I gently wipe face, circular motions, with 600mm sandpaper and I&#x27;m good for another week. The downy hair isn&#x27;t easily noticed by others because it is so thin and light, but when removed, my skin looks much younger. So, I am a big no-no fan and would actually buy another unit if the 2 year old one I presently use fails.</li>
            <li> These work great withmy nono hair remover.</li>
            <li> I go over and over and over the hair and it never gets ALL of it. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the machine or the Thermicon tips, but the system does not work as advertised.</li>
            <li> i have the no no for a long while but needed new tips  it certainly makes a difference</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> Found this to be most practical and affordable for myself since I only use the small tips.</li>
            <li> I have my reservations about this product and if it really works at all. I think it just burns existing hair but really doesn&#x27;t discourage hair growth. I feel I wasted money buying it in the first place and only replaced the thermicon tips in a last ditch effort to really see if I could make it work. Dumb me!</li>
            <li> It was promised on Aug. 11, 2015 and received on Aug. 14, 2015.</li>
            <li> I real like the NoNo product.</li>
            <li> Transaction went smoothly.  Received what I expected.</li>
            <li> Love my No No! just need a quick replacement thermicon tip, this more than fit the bill. Quickly received and fair priced!</li>

            <li> I really like the way it works and it is very easy to use</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make a difference in the effectiveness. I believe a new machine is probably what I will need.</li>
