            <li>Delivery was fast and in perfect condition, too.</li>
            <li>I found this to be a wonderfully moisturizing product - perfect for day and night (magically - everything else was either too heavy or too light!).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light cream</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this eye cream.</li>
            <li>Love this eye cream.  </li>
            <li>It has done amazing things under my eyes like lighten, smooth, and although I don&#x27;t have many eye wrinkles, it has diminished</li>
            <li>It would be better to use a store bought cream without these ingredients.</li>
            <li>Love the product and would recommend.</li>
            <li>Best results when uses daily.</li>
            <li>( I know you&#x27;re not supposed to with most eye</li>
            <li>so I cant go into too many details about my experience with this eye cream like I can about the face cream</li>
            <li>Item arrived timely and I am pleased.  </li>
            <li>I felt so much better.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks so much better without it.  </li>
            <li>but this was in package and looked exactly like the bottles you buy in the store, the box was in good condition and it came quickly.</li>
            <li>I gave this a three star because it does a wonderful job with the dark circles however it does not hydrate the eye skin at all.  </li>
            <li>I have received a sample and at first liked it</li>
            <li>you can never be cheap when it comes to purchasing products for your face.</li>
            <li>I didnt see her for 3-4 months and when I saw her again her eyes looked so refreshed and smooth, I didn&#x27;t notice lines or puffiness</li>
            <li>They are no longer cruelty free</li>
            <li>so I no longer stand by my review until they are cruelty free again</li>
            <li>What bothered me most about this product was the lack of sunscreen-so although this product absorbed quickly I had to apply a sunscreen over it.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this without trying it first for sure...</li>
            <li>I believe I have developed some kind of allergy to an ingredient in this eye cream.  </li>
            <li>product does absorb quickly leaving the eye area prime for make up-and does not leave skin greasy.</li>
            <li>, No skincare item or lipstick is worth animal torture</li>
            <li>but then when I have ordered the item and was using it for about a week I noticed that it left my skin drier and kind of tout.  </li>
            <li>It is very smooth and you only need the teeniest amount!</li>
            <li>For years I have I tried to get rid of the fine lines that I have had around my eyes since I was 12 years old, and this product did nothing to combat them.</li>
            <li>As for that Oil of Olay commercial that says theirs works better than $100 eye cream, they evidently didn&#x27;t compare it to this.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous eye cream that uses natural ingredients and really works.</li>
            <li>Becoming a BIG fan of this brand!</li>
            <li>This cream helped clear my eye up, so I purchased a full size bottle-but clearing my allergy stricken eye up was where the benefits stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy and soaks in quickly, the grape enzymes are magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and go into the under eye area quickly.</li>
            <li>For some reason it made my skin feel dry and more wrinkly.  </li>
            <li>but from now on this particular line i will order and restock up from amazon!</li>
            <li>I used this for about 2 months , it made a huge change to my eye lids , I wanted to order a second one, but some how the bottle does not look like the one I got .</li>
            <li>I am kind of glad because this would have been an expensive habit to have.</li>
            <li>-this may be the product for you, but this is not a miracle product and I expected more for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really can even explain it</li>
            <li>I can say it illuminates and gives you pretty much what a primer does, a very natural glow around your eyes.</li>
            <li>I have tried many eye creams for dark circles and puffiness under the eyes, but none of them have ever worked very well if at all, no matter how much they promise to address this problem.</li>
            <li>As soon as I stopped using it, the bags have now significantly decreased - and I purchased a new product that works great - glo-therapeutics eye restore.</li>
            <li>If I had to chose only one special product this would be it.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without this one!</li>
            <li>It sinks into your skin very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Less is more in this case -</li>
            <li>/&gt;Grape seed extract is a new darling in the skincare world, and a signature ingredient in many Caudalie products, but there is not much solid research out there to back up the benefits</li>
            <li>The cream is rich but non greasy and obviously sensitive enough to not sting my eyes...  </li>
            <li>While products work differently on everyone, for my skin this eye cream is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but lucked out in them seeming a bit better... but believe me, I still rely (heavily!)</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Because it helped clear up the allergic reaction I was having-I do think this product deserves some credit.</li>
            <li>This is the only eye cream I have found that really does work.</li>
            <li>but like I said I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an expensive cream, so I am glad I tried it out first before purchasing it.</li>
            <li>few fine lines, slightly pigmented, acne prone, semi sensitive (very sensitive in eye area), very oily</li>
            <li>This product caused me to have purple swollen bags under and above my eyes with new dryness and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t battle acne anymore from excessive oil production because of dry skin. :)</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way-the sample I received lasted about two weeks and the bottle I ordered will most likely last the year.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and eyes, and with a lot of products, I get an instant burn or teary eyed from the product or fragrance.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re curious what others I had used before this one, I tried Mary Kay (two types - one tube, one pump), several drugstore brands, Burt&#x27;s Bees (I love a few of their products, but eyes wasn&#x27;t one).</li>
            <li>Works well below eyes and on lids, especially for those with sensitive skin prone to skin allergies.</li>
            <li>let me start this review by saying I have sensitive eyes and a lot of eye creams make my eyes red and burn, this one dosent!</li>
            <li>the lines are less noticeable due to the light reflectors in the cream.</li>

            <li> Works well below eyes and on lids, especially for those with sensitive skin prone to skin allergies.</li>
            <li> let me start this review by saying I have sensitive eyes and a lot of eye creams make my eyes red and burn, this one dosent!</li>
            <li> the lines are less noticeable due to the light reflectors in the cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They were so dry that I always looked tired and could see the damage of fine lines starting to take its toll around my creases.</li>
            <li> With the Mary Kay stuff I had previously used, I needed a new tube every 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> but I really needed to let people know this is not a good eye cream for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This line is an amazing product but very expensive</li>
            <li> I tried full pumps, and my eye area wouldn&#x27;t absorb it all, so why waste product?), and again at night, and I have quite a bit left, so I think it&#x27;ll definitely last at least twice as long</li>
            <li> Apart from the KaplanMd products, I would say this is the only other skin care product I would purchase and recommend.</li>
            <li> Takes the redness and the dark circles away enough to notice the difference.</li>
            <li> so it lasts longer than regular eye creams do since you don&#x27;t have to slather half the jar on to feel like its working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I could notice a difference the icing on the cake came a few months ago when a colleague asked how old I was (evidently this guy doesn&#x27;t know the rule to not ask that), and after I told him he stood there astonished and said, that it was impossible because I didn&#x27;t have a single blemish, and he was less than a foot from my face looking directly at my eyes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my eye area red, and in just a few minutes, absorbs in so I can put on my stick concealer.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for ladies, and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this eye cream.  </li>
            <li> I dont know how it is in other kinds off skin</li>
            <li> I agree with the other 1 Star user.</li>
            <li> * based on my experience with this product and what I have seen on other people</li>
            <li> Dark circles are not a huge concern for me-but I tend to get minor ones from time to time.</li>
            <li> lucky me (easier to justify the expensive purchase!).</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because you don&#x27;t know if products can be fooled with and that would be a waste of money</li>
            <li> This stuff I use just half of a pump in the morning (yes, seriously - half a pump.</li>
            <li> so you need less concealer</li>
            <li> I have dark, dark circles (thank you genetics!)</li>
            <li> I got a little tester</li>
            <li> It goes on a little heavier</li>
            <li> was little there was there.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes, they water and react poorly to minor allergents which makes finding an eye cream that works for me very difficult.</li>
            <li> Under my eyes always look dried out no matter what time of year it was, after using this my eyes are hydrated and the emergence of crows feet has diminished.</li>
            <li> now it&#x27;s one of my few beauty essentials</li>
            <li> have dark circles and small lines.  </li>
            <li> I wear contacts, and have horrible seasonal (ok, year-round) allergies here in Texas.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this during a particularly bad reaction that made my eye area red, wrinkly and dry.</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for the last few years for an eye cream that does what it&#x27;s supposed to, after a lot of expense and disappointment I received a sample of this in a cosmetic order from another retailer.</li>
            <li> I happened to use this cream during an unfortunate week where I was suffering from lack of sleep-and I saw little to no improvement in my dark circles even as I continued use of this product over time.</li>
            <li> I purchased from amazon because it was less expensive.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t like this cream.  </li>
            <li> but after applying it I felt a weird sensation in my face until I took it off at night</li>
            <li> This product, although very expensive, does what it says it will do.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This product, although very expensive, does what it says it will do.  It reduces any wrinkles under the eye and also puffiness. Very good product!</li>
            <li> I got a little tester and I love it.  The cream is rich but non greasy and obviously sensitive enough to not sting my eyes...  It sinks into your skin very quickly.  The skin around my eyes look great after I used the cream at night.  It&#x27;s an expensive cream, so I am glad I tried it out first before purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Becoming a BIG fan of this brand!</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom for her birthday last February and she still has it. I was a little skeptical at first because you don&#x27;t know if products can be fooled with and that would be a waste of money but this was in package and looked exactly like the bottles you buy in the store, the box was in good condition and it came quickly. This line is an amazing product but very expensive im a big fan of sephora and they sell it there but from now on this particular line i will order and restock up from amazon! what a steel!</li>
            <li> I gave this a three star because it does a wonderful job with the dark circles however it does not hydrate the eye skin at all.  Does nothing for crows feets, puffiness, or lines. Takes the redness and the dark circles away enough to notice the difference.</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for the last few years for an eye cream that does what it&#x27;s supposed to, after a lot of expense and disappointment I received a sample of this in a cosmetic order from another retailer. I was immediately hooked! Under my eyes always look dried out no matter what time of year it was, after using this my eyes are hydrated and the emergence of crows feet has diminished. It&#x27;s not heavy and soaks in quickly, the grape enzymes are magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were so dry that I always looked tired and could see the damage of fine lines starting to take its toll around my creases. While products work differently on everyone, for my skin this eye cream is worth every penny. As for that Oil of Olay commercial that says theirs works better than $100 eye cream, they evidently didn&#x27;t compare it to this. You get what you pay for ladies, and a little goes a long way so it lasts longer than regular eye creams do since you don&#x27;t have to slather half the jar on to feel like its working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I could notice a difference the icing on the cake came a few months ago when a colleague asked how old I was (evidently this guy doesn&#x27;t know the rule to not ask that), and after I told him he stood there astonished and said, that it was impossible because I didn&#x27;t have a single blemish, and he was less than a foot from my face looking directly at my eyes. Ahhhhhh, YES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the face cream and it&#x27;s just as amazing. It goes on a little heavier but it&#x27;s not greasy and I don&#x27;t battle acne anymore from excessive oil production because of dry skin. :)</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream. I can say it illuminates and gives you pretty much what a primer does, a very natural glow around your eyes. Apart from the KaplanMd products, I would say this is the only other skin care product I would purchase and recommend. you can never be cheap when it comes to purchasing products for your face.</li>
            <li> until now i didn&#x27;t see difference in my eye skin usin this product, and i use every day, as my dermatologist recommended. I use also a retinol, and no difference in my skin. I dont know how it is in other kinds off skin</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream.  It has done amazing things under my eyes like lighten, smooth, and although I don&#x27;t have many eye wrinkles, it has diminished was little there was there.  It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and go into the under eye area quickly.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams for dark circles and puffiness under the eyes, but none of them have ever worked very well if at all, no matter how much they promise to address this problem. This is the only eye cream I have found that really does work.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this eye cream.  Additionally, the eye area absorbs it so well that it makes putting on makeup a breeze and eyeliner does not smudge or smear after applied.  Love the product!</li>
            <li> I agree with the other 1 Star user. I am 46 and have very good skin. This product caused me to have purple swollen bags under and above my eyes with new dryness and wrinkles. I thought I started aging at an accelerated rate from stress. As soon as I stopped using it, the bags have now significantly decreased - and I purchased a new product that works great - glo-therapeutics eye restore. I have never written a review on Amazon but I really needed to let people know this is not a good eye cream for those with sensitive skin. It would be better to use a store bought cream without these ingredients.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this one!</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous eye cream that uses natural ingredients and really works. Delivery was fast and in perfect condition, too.</li>
            <li> If I had to chose only one special product this would be it. Only need 1/2 squirt for both eyes.  Lasts six momths</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that works to lighten the redness around my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different items but the results were negligible.  I&#x27;m so happy to have found this.</li>
            <li> I had problems with purchasing it which were successfully solved. The Eye Cream is really good and my advise to women is to use it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and eyes, and with a lot of products, I get an instant burn or teary eyed from the product or fragrance. Not with this one! I was at one of the Beauty Stores with a friend and asked for a recommendation, and took home a sample. That tiny sample lasted two weeks! I immediately had to buy but checked Amazon pricing compared to the retail store and found signficant savings... lucky me (easier to justify the expensive purchase!). With the Mary Kay stuff I had previously used, I needed a new tube every 4-6 weeks. This stuff I use just half of a pump in the morning (yes, seriously - half a pump. Less is more in this case - I tried full pumps, and my eye area wouldn&#x27;t absorb it all, so why waste product?), and again at night, and I have quite a bit left, so I think it&#x27;ll definitely last at least twice as long (it&#x27;s already been almost two months!). I wear contacts, and have horrible seasonal (ok, year-round) allergies here in Texas. I found this to be a wonderfully moisturizing product - perfect for day and night (magically - everything else was either too heavy or too light!). It doesn&#x27;t make my eye area red, and in just a few minutes, absorbs in so I can put on my stick concealer. I have dark, dark circles (thank you genetics!) but lucked out in them seeming a bit better... but believe me, I still rely (heavily!) on my concealer. If you&#x27;re curious what others I had used before this one, I tried Mary Kay (two types - one tube, one pump), several drugstore brands, Burt&#x27;s Bees (I love a few of their products, but eyes wasn&#x27;t one). This is pricey, so if you&#x27;re in doubt, check out your nearby retail shops and see if you can sample in person... I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this without trying it first for sure... now it&#x27;s one of my few beauty essentials and I WILL be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this in a store and knew that I was hooked. It&#x27;s a very light cream so you only need a tiny bit to use around the eyes. After about 1 week of using it, I noticed that the coloring under my eyes is lighter when I wake up. Love the product and would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes, they water and react poorly to minor allergents which makes finding an eye cream that works for me very difficult. I received a sample of this during a particularly bad reaction that made my eye area red, wrinkly and dry. This cream helped clear my eye up, so I purchased a full size bottle-but clearing my allergy stricken eye up was where the benefits stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does absorb quickly leaving the eye area prime for make up-and does not leave skin greasy. However, it did not make my eye area any lighter or brighter. Dark circles are not a huge concern for me-but I tend to get minor ones from time to time. I happened to use this cream during an unfortunate week where I was suffering from lack of sleep-and I saw little to no improvement in my dark circles even as I continued use of this product over time. For years I have I tried to get rid of the fine lines that I have had around my eyes since I was 12 years old, and this product did nothing to combat them. What bothered me most about this product was the lack of sunscreen-so although this product absorbed quickly I had to apply a sunscreen over it.Because it helped clear up the allergic reaction I was having-I do think this product deserves some credit. A little goes a long way-the sample I received lasted about two weeks and the bottle I ordered will most likely last the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grape seed extract is a new darling in the skincare world, and a signature ingredient in many Caudalie products, but there is not much solid research out there to back up the benefits so I would not jump on the band wagon just yet if that is the reason you want to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a luxurious splurge, have sensitive eyes or need to be careful with the eye cream you purchase-this may be the product for you, but this is not a miracle product and I expected more for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: 20-something, few fine lines, slightly pigmented, acne prone, semi sensitive (very sensitive in eye area), very oily</li>
            <li> Works well below eyes and on lids, especially for those with sensitive skin prone to skin allergies. Best results when uses daily.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! I am actually using this on my entire face. 1 pump is perfect. Changed skin immediately. Apply @ night after my 14% glycolic acid application and in the morning under makeup. WOW!</li>
            <li> let me start this review by saying I have sensitive eyes and a lot of eye creams make my eyes red and burn, this one dosent! and I even use it on my eyelid! ( I know you&#x27;re not supposed to with most eye creams)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;scent* I dont notice a scent when I use this which is good but I do think it does have added fragrance but like I said I have sensitive eyes and this dosent bother them at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;consistency* It is very smooth and you only need the teeniest amount! This will last you forever even with using it twice a day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;results* I must say this brightens your under eyes instantly when you put it on so you need less concealer and it reflects light which is a great bonus!  I use this as a preventative so I cant go into too many details about my experience with this eye cream like I can about the face cream but my friends mother also uses the caudalie eye cream and I thought she got botox after we bought this I didnt see her for 3-4 months and when I saw her again her eyes looked so refreshed and smooth, I didn&#x27;t notice lines or puffiness and she swears its all this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall* based on my experience with this product and what I have seen on other people I would say this is a great eye cream for everyone. If you want to prevent this is great and if you need more intensive treatment this is great! I hope my review was helpful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Update* They are no longer cruelty free so I no longer stand by my review until they are cruelty free again, No skincare item or lipstick is worth animal torture*</li>
            <li> I used this for about 2 months , it made a huge change to my eye lids , I wanted to order a second one, but some how the bottle does not look like the one I got .</li>
            <li> I sampled this at sephora before purchasing.  I purchased from amazon because it was less expensive.  Item arrived timely and I am pleased.  Only thing I question is the bottle.  The bottle I received is different from what is pictured but the material inside is the same as sephora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark circles and small lines.  This cream brightens up my darkness and the lines are less noticeable due to the light reflectors in the cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this in conjuction with the eye cream and I absolutely LOVE IT! It cleared up my skin and people noticed a difference within weeks. Awesome product and cheaper online than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t like this cream.  I have received a sample and at first liked it but then when I have ordered the item and was using it for about a week I noticed that it left my skin drier and kind of tout.  I believe I have developed some kind of allergy to an ingredient in this eye cream.  I really can even explain it but after applying it I felt a weird sensation in my face until I took it off at night I felt so much better.  For some reason it made my skin feel dry and more wrinkly.  My skin looks so much better without it.  I am kind of glad because this would have been an expensive habit to have.</li>
