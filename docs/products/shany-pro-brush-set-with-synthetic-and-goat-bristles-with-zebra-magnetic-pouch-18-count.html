            <li>SO SAFE</li>
            <li>I will invest in a better set of brushes..</li>
            <li>i love anything zebra print</li>
            <li>Also the case is adorable and everything you see is what you get.</li>
            <li>I do not regret it :)</li>
            <li>and I am so satisfied.  </li>
            <li>and they are so worth the price!!</li>
            <li>I would spend more to get a set that wasn&#x27;t so strong in smell.</li>
            <li>The brushes are individually wrapped in a nice pouch and come in a very nice Shany Box...</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and a great value for the amount.</li>

            <li>They came wonderfully packaged with no odors like I had read in other reviews.</li>
            <li>I may have liked this so much that I bought another one just because :)</li>
            <li>Really, these are too adorable not to have them!</li>
            <li>Feels cheap.</li>
            <li>The price is fantastic and so is the quality.</li>
            <li>I have only used them once and they seem to work great.</li>
            <li>They feel cheap.  </li>
            <li>Everything feels like cheap plastic, no metal, no wood, just plastic.&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li>Such a cute quality set of brushes!!</li>
            <li>Exactly the type of brush set I wanted!!</li>
            <li>I am so excited to use these brushes.</li>
            <li>Before being able to even use the brushes the brush head came off of the first brush I took out</li>
            <li>i bought these as a cheap quick replacement for my mac brushes which were lost along with my baggage at the airport.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will say that the smell of kerosene is quite intense when you first open the packaging, but the quality of the brushes are excellent.</li>
            <li>Not a bad collection.</li>
            <li>If the same bristle type were used on the eye brushes as well, this product would be much more usable and enjoyable.</li>
            <li>More recently I purchased a Sedona Lace set which is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>However, as soon as she took the brushes out of the case (for the very first time)</li>
            <li>Gives you a wild personality! :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;i was initially so overwhelmed by how nice they were that i overlooked some quality details.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>So I would suggest these to anyone who has a particular look who wants to make sure it&#x27;s met.</li>
            <li>you found them right now.</li>
            <li>you found them right now.</li>
            <li>and that made me want to jump right into trying them out.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I have every makeup brush that I might need to do the more intricate makeup for formal and everyday.</li>
            <li>Arrived VERY fast.</li>
            <li>The brushes are long, sturdy and the hairs are fine and precisely cut for perfection.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THE URBAN GAL COLLECTION!!</li>
            <li>The zebra really offsets a chic look!</li>
            <li>The only thing I would have love was that each brush would have its number and type of brushe engraved on it</li>
            <li>exactly the way you want it.</li>
            <li>Smaller eyeshadow brushes are softer and better made.</li>
            <li>First impression&lt;br</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>They have a few bristles that come out, but I think after a good wash they&#x27;ll stop shedding all together.</li>
            <li>THIS PRETTY BIG KIT FOR $17.99, I THOUGHT WAS A GREAT DEAL, AND I READ ALL THE OTHER REVIEWS,</li>
            <li>I immediately opened it, the package and all and the zebra print really cute and adorable, but the Brushes are way to stiff!!</li>
            <li>, the face brushes are ok just like ELF brushes, the Fan brush looks cheap and it useless to me, Overall good set of brushes for beginners</li>
            <li>You could see that they were not glued on very well at all; super glue fixed that.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re like 15 and just starting to use makeup, then these would probably be fine for you, but for someone looking for quality, quantity and longevity.</li>
            <li>The first was a Kirkland set which was decent</li>
            <li>so extremely fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t see MUCH shedding from any of them just on my fan brush.</li>
            <li>and she lovessss this so much.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore the zebra print.</li>
            <li>I completely enjoy them, their not only made well</li>
            <li>I actually really like this set alot.</li>
            <li>Very well put together pieces.</li>
            <li>, WELL, LET ME TELL YOU, THEY SHED, SHED, AND SHED SO MUCH,</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR NOTHING~</li>
            <li>/&gt;the shipping and delivery was fast, once i got the Package</li>
            <li>but I cannot accept that the brushes heads fall off and that they shed as much as they do.  </li>
            <li>These brushes have a very sleek and stylish look to them with the black handles and the shade of the handles making them each look very modern.</li>
            <li>These are great for beginners or anyone who wants professional quality brushes without having to drop a small fortune!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty basic brush set but enough for most looks.</li>
            <li>WELL, THE FIRST MONTH, OR SO, THEY SEEMED GREAT, BUT AFTER THAT, FORGET IT, WHEN I AM APPLYING MAKEUP ON MY FACE, THE BRUSHES ARE SO ROUGH, AND AFTER WASHING THEM JUST A FEW TIMES,</li>
            <li>This was for a gift, but they came earlier than expected and looked really nice</li>
            <li>the cost its too high for not so usable brushes.</li>
            <li>(18 Piece Pro Brushes with Zebra Magnetic Pouch), 13 Ounce]] take a walk on the wild side and get yours today!!</li>
            <li>THIS WAS MY FIRST ACTUAL WHOLE MAKEUP KIT BRUSH SET, I&#x27;VE EVER ORDERED.</li>
            <li>the metal/bristel tops popped right off of the wooden shafts/handles on 2 of the brushes.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for just the right brush set that included all the brushes that I needed without having a hodge podge of brush sets and no where to store them, especially when travelling.  </li>
            <li>It has a professional look while the pouch gives your brushes a touch of personality!</li>
            <li>It has a professional look while the pouch gives your brushes a touch of personality!</li>
            <li>The only I dont like is that the brushes are not labeled as to what they should be used for, other than that I really love these.</li>
            <li>So PROFESSIONAL!  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product hoping to broaden my current brush collection and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and fast delivery of the product.</li>
            <li>Professional</li>
            <li>after 3 or 4 washes they nearly started disintegrating.</li>
            <li>i unwrapped the case and brushes, and it smelled almost like gasoline, but it went away after i washed the brushes, the brushes are SOOOO soft.</li>
            <li>The case is sleek and the brushes look professional as well as perform.  </li>
            <li>A little super glue fixed the issue but I should not have to fix a product that I buy within a week of purchase.</li>
            <li>When ordering these I only ordered them for the design of zebra, but once I actually got them and tried them I could tell they we&#x27;re made very well</li>
            <li>brushes are an absolute mess.</li>

            <li> Arrived VERY fast.</li>
            <li> The brushes are long, sturdy and the hairs are fine and precisely cut for perfection.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THE URBAN GAL COLLECTION!!</li>
            <li> The zebra really offsets a chic look!</li>
            <li> The only thing I would have love was that each brush would have its number and type of brushe engraved on it</li>
            <li> exactly the way you want it.</li>
            <li> Smaller eyeshadow brushes are softer and better made.</li>
            <li> First impression&lt;br</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> They have a few bristles that come out, but I think after a good wash they&#x27;ll stop shedding all together.</li>
            <li> THIS PRETTY BIG KIT FOR $17.99, I THOUGHT WAS A GREAT DEAL, AND I READ ALL THE OTHER REVIEWS,</li>
            <li> I immediately opened it, the package and all and the zebra print really cute and adorable, but the Brushes are way to stiff!!</li>
            <li> , the face brushes are ok just like ELF brushes, the Fan brush looks cheap and it useless to me, Overall good set of brushes for beginners</li>
            <li> You could see that they were not glued on very well at all; super glue fixed that.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re like 15 and just starting to use makeup, then these would probably be fine for you, but for someone looking for quality, quantity and longevity.</li>
            <li> The first was a Kirkland set which was decent</li>
            <li> so extremely fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see MUCH shedding from any of them just on my fan brush.</li>
            <li> and she lovessss this so much.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore the zebra print.</li>
            <li> I completely enjoy them, their not only made well</li>
            <li> I actually really like this set alot.</li>
            <li> Very well put together pieces.</li>
            <li> , WELL, LET ME TELL YOU, THEY SHED, SHED, AND SHED SO MUCH,</li>
            <li> THANKS FOR NOTHING~</li>
            <li> /&gt;the shipping and delivery was fast, once i got the Package</li>
            <li> but I cannot accept that the brushes heads fall off and that they shed as much as they do.  </li>
            <li> These brushes have a very sleek and stylish look to them with the black handles and the shade of the handles making them each look very modern.</li>
            <li> These are great for beginners or anyone who wants professional quality brushes without having to drop a small fortune!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty basic brush set but enough for most looks.</li>
            <li> WELL, THE FIRST MONTH, OR SO, THEY SEEMED GREAT, BUT AFTER THAT, FORGET IT, WHEN I AM APPLYING MAKEUP ON MY FACE, THE BRUSHES ARE SO ROUGH, AND AFTER WASHING THEM JUST A FEW TIMES,</li>
            <li> This was for a gift, but they came earlier than expected and looked really nice</li>
            <li> the cost its too high for not so usable brushes.</li>
            <li> (18 Piece Pro Brushes with Zebra Magnetic Pouch), 13 Ounce]] take a walk on the wild side and get yours today!!</li>
            <li> THIS WAS MY FIRST ACTUAL WHOLE MAKEUP KIT BRUSH SET, I&#x27;VE EVER ORDERED.</li>
            <li> the metal/bristel tops popped right off of the wooden shafts/handles on 2 of the brushes.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for just the right brush set that included all the brushes that I needed without having a hodge podge of brush sets and no where to store them, especially when travelling.  </li>
            <li> It has a professional look while the pouch gives your brushes a touch of personality!</li>
            <li> It has a professional look while the pouch gives your brushes a touch of personality!</li>
            <li> The only I dont like is that the brushes are not labeled as to what they should be used for, other than that I really love these.</li>
            <li> So PROFESSIONAL!  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product hoping to broaden my current brush collection and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and fast delivery of the product.</li>
            <li> Professional</li>
            <li> after 3 or 4 washes they nearly started disintegrating.</li>
            <li> i unwrapped the case and brushes, and it smelled almost like gasoline, but it went away after i washed the brushes, the brushes are SOOOO soft.</li>
            <li> The case is sleek and the brushes look professional as well as perform.  </li>
            <li> A little super glue fixed the issue but I should not have to fix a product that I buy within a week of purchase.</li>
            <li> When ordering these I only ordered them for the design of zebra, but once I actually got them and tried them I could tell they we&#x27;re made very well</li>
            <li> brushes are an absolute mess.</li>
            <li> half the brushes are nearly identical to others in the set.</li>
            <li> t know why I was hearing so much about Shany brushes lately</li>
            <li> The brushes are not soft.  </li>
            <li> THAT&#x27;S PRETTY GROSS, I WOULD SAY, BUT WHO KNOWS, MAYBE I GOT A DEFECTIVE SET???, BUT WORSE $18.00</li>
            <li> I was also kind of disappointed to realize a lot of the brushes are the same size.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what half of the brushes are even used for but the main 4 brushes i wanted were the same price as this!</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes are very similar to each other, and some of the tips have popped off.</li>
            <li> I paid $17.99 for this set of brushes and I didn&#x27;t see a single crease brush?</li>
            <li> minus</li>
            <li> The blush and powder brushes are harder and hairs to do fall out a lot.</li>
            <li> SPENT,</li>
            <li> but I was curious</li>
            <li> after the second wash the brushes were no longer soft, but they were rough and very irritating to use, *think of using stiff think hair synthetic extensions to put on your blush*&lt;br</li>
            <li> That is her only complaint about this product.</li>
            <li> EVEN IF I JUST SPRAY THEM DOWN WITH AN ANTIBACTERIAL SPRAY, I LIKE TO USE AFTER USING MY BRUSHES, WHEN I USE THEM, BUT DON&#x27;T FULLY WAS THEM</li>
            <li> They were hard and not very soft and all.</li>
            <li> the handles are matte black and in silver they say SHANY cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this again, unless half the price.</li>
            <li> the fan brush is useless, there are like 3 flat brushes that are extremely similar.</li>
            <li> i noticed that this brush set is redundant.</li>
            <li> but i like makeup and for my everyday use</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> A little stiff</li>
            <li> If you have quality brushes such as Sedona Lace, you will be very unhappy with these bristles, they&#x27;re SO FAR from being soft.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money, these brushes are so stiff, that you cannot even apply make up to your eyes, they do not bend or give at all (the bristles), making it impossible to keep make up on your lid, it flies all over the place and is incredibly messy.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not impressed and next time  </li>
            <li> Hard bristles, not great quality</li>
            <li> all the small brushes are useless except the rounded smudging brush.</li>
            <li> And seriously?!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> the blush and small powder brush are thin and useless if you can use these brushes to contour, please tell me all about your witchcraft.&lt;br /&gt;the fallout is HORRIFYING.</li>
            <li> I found the brushes to be very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Not only did they smell awful, the quality of the bristles on the brushes are awful.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when I opened my box and was greeted by the smell of kerosene.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am highly disappointed and will never purchase anything from Shany again.  </li>
            <li> THESE BRUSHES HAVE A SLEEK AND EXPENSIVE LOOK AND FEEL TO THEM!!</li>
            <li> WORST BRUSHES I EVER BOUGHT</li>

            <li> **1 YEAR UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these brushes are an absolute mess. after 3 or 4 washes they nearly started disintegrating. and i can promise you its not user error. i bought these as a cheap quick replacement for my mac brushes which were lost along with my baggage at the airport.&lt;br /&gt;so lets get into this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was initially so overwhelmed by how nice they were that i overlooked some quality details. after the second wash the brushes were no longer soft, but they were rough and very irritating to use, *think of using stiff think hair synthetic extensions to put on your blush*&lt;br /&gt;then i noticed that this brush set is redundant. half the brushes are nearly identical to others in the set. the fan brush is useless, there are like 3 flat brushes that are extremely similar. all the small brushes are useless except the rounded smudging brush. the blush and small powder brush are thin and useless if you can use these brushes to contour, please tell me all about your witchcraft.&lt;br /&gt;the fallout is HORRIFYING. every time i use the powder brush, it leaves hairs on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re like 15 and just starting to use makeup, then these would probably be fine for you, but for someone looking for quality, quantity and longevity. look somewhere else. because these aren&#x27;t going to suit your needs.&lt;br /&gt;_________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Org. Review--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so lets start off with shipping, i bought 50 dollars in super saver shipping elidgeable cosmetics, and then these wonderful brushes. they were in Washington the next day, and then at my doorstep today so all together it took about 4 days to ship. so extremely fast shipping. when i opened up the shany box, (which i love to death) i unwrapped the case and brushes, and it smelled almost like gasoline, but it went away after i washed the brushes, the brushes are SOOOO soft. i had no shedding AT ALL after i washed them. SO WASH WASH WASH to get all they dye and odor out of them. the handles are matte black and in silver they say SHANY cosmetics. absolutely beautiful. i could not be happier. if your looking for tip top quality cosmetic brushes. you found them right now. dont hesitate buy them!!! im just so so amazed and i hope you will be too!and in silver they say SHANY cosmetics. absolutely beautiful. i could not be happier. if your looking for tip top quality cosmetic brushes. you found them right now. dont hesitate buy them!!! im just so so amazed and i hope you will be too!</li>
            <li> You are basically paying a dollar a brush!! All these brushes work perfectly and I didn&#x27;t see MUCH shedding from any of them just on my fan brush. It has a professional look while the pouch gives your brushes a touch of personality! It works great when apply your makeup.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when I opened my box and was greeted by the smell of kerosene. Why would you want to put something on your face that smells of chemicals? Not only did they smell awful, the quality of the bristles on the brushes are awful. If you are looking for good make up brushes, these are not it. Do not waste your money, these brushes are so stiff, that you cannot even apply make up to your eyes, they do not bend or give at all (the bristles), making it impossible to keep make up on your lid, it flies all over the place and is incredibly messy. The travel roll that the brushes come in, however is nice and of good quality, as are the face brushes. If the same bristle type were used on the eye brushes as well, this product would be much more usable and enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Really, these are too adorable not to have them! And seriously?! 18 brushes for 17.99?! Are you kidding? You&#x27;re still here reading this and not purchasing these because?! These are great for beginners or anyone who wants professional quality brushes without having to drop a small fortune!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my sister-in-law, because she loves Zebra anything and she lovessss this so much. She said there wonderful and the best gift ever!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and a great value for the amount. Every brushes is well crafted and there is no bristles loss. The only thing I would have love was that each brush would have its number and type of brushe engraved on it so it would help beginners.</li>
            <li> This would be a great gift for those budding, teenage, makeup artists who love to have style and great functality with their brushes. I absolutely adore the zebra print.</li>
            <li> Zebra print, yey! I truly love animal prints. These brushes have a very sleek and stylish look to them with the black handles and the shade of the handles making them each look very modern. Seems like a great set for teens because of the magnetic pouch it would teach them how to learn to take care of there brushes. With this kit comes included a stylish brush pouch making it the perfect set for a little fashionista.What seals the deal here for me is how sleek the brush handles are I can just picture them on my dresser top.</li>
            <li> Had an issue with some of the brush heads loosening up and coming off. A little super glue fixed the issue but I should not have to fix a product that I buy within a week of purchase. Low quality material used</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I have every makeup brush that I might need to do the more intricate makeup for formal and everyday. I never knew that I needed some of these until I had them now I&#x27;m doing my makeup like a pro</li>
            <li> one of the heads came off the brush stick as soon as i took them out... minus that i love it</li>
            <li> Exactly the type of brush set I wanted!! It has everything I need to put myself together, great gift idea &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as advertised</li>
            <li> Not a bad collection. Some of the brushes are very similar to each other, and some of the tips have popped off.</li>
            <li> I loved all the brushes except the 3 biggest. Hairs fall out of them all over my face. Arrived VERY fast.</li>
            <li> This was for a gift, but they came earlier than expected and looked really nice</li>
            <li> Cute, well priced and good quality.  The case is sleek and the brushes look professional as well as perform.  This is a pretty basic brush set but enough for most looks.</li>
            <li> I love the brush&#x27;s, great quality and a good price. I would recomend to anyone looking for a good set of makeup brush&#x27;s. Packaging was very nice and looks like you would go to the mall and get them. I purchased 2 sets, one for me and 1 for my mom, I am glad I did because my mom would have took mine.</li>
            <li> I will say that the smell of kerosene is quite intense when you first open the packaging, but the quality of the brushes are excellent. I would recommend airing them out and maybe even washing them with make-up brush cleaner before using them on your face.</li>
            <li> This brush set is compact and convenient. The brushes are of great quality and the cases are very stylish. I will be purchasing more from Shany!</li>
            <li> When ordering these I only ordered them for the design of zebra, but once I actually got them and tried them I could tell they we&#x27;re made very well and that made me want to jump right into trying them out. So this evening I attempted my make up look with these and their wonderful. I completely enjoy them, their not only made well but they allow you to get the make up exactly the way you want it. So I would suggest these to anyone who has a particular look who wants to make sure it&#x27;s met. These are great and always wonderful in adding the right about of make up.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this set alot. It has alot of brushes and I have not had any bristles come undone on my face. Very well put together pieces.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of brushes. Smaller eyeshadow brushes are softer and better made. The blush and powder brushes are harder and hairs to do fall out a lot. I would not buy this again, unless half the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product hoping to broaden my current brush collection and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and fast delivery of the product. Will definitely recommend to friends/family!</li>
            <li> GREAT brushes, really soft too. They have a few bristles that come out, but I think after a good wash they&#x27;ll stop shedding all together. Really love them though!</li>
            <li> Cute case-brushes are nice.  A little stiff but it works-its almost been a year of using and they hold up great!</li>
            <li> I found the brushes to be very poor quality. They were hard and not very soft and all. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> WELL, WHEN I FIRST SAW THEM, THE APPEARANCE I FELL IN LOVE WITH, BECAUSE I LOVE THE ZEBRA PRINT PACKAGING!!!! ZEBRA IS ALL ME!  AND I SAW ALL THE BRUSHES, THIS PRETTY BIG KIT FOR $17.99, I THOUGHT WAS A GREAT DEAL, AND I READ ALL THE OTHER REVIEWS, SO SAFE TO SAY THIS WAS MY FIRST ACTUAL WHOLE MAKEUP KIT BRUSH SET, I&#x27;VE EVER ORDERED. WELL, THE FIRST MONTH, OR SO, THEY SEEMED GREAT, BUT AFTER THAT, FORGET IT, WHEN I AM APPLYING MAKEUP ON MY FACE, THE BRUSHES ARE SO ROUGH, AND AFTER WASHING THEM JUST A FEW TIMES, EVEN IF I JUST SPRAY THEM DOWN WITH AN ANTIBACTERIAL SPRAY, I LIKE TO USE AFTER USING MY BRUSHES, WHEN I USE THEM, BUT DON&#x27;T FULLY WAS THEM, WELL, LET ME TELL YOU, THEY SHED, SHED, AND SHED SO MUCH, THAT NOW, THERE IS LIKE NO HAIR LEFT ON THE BRUSHES, WHEN I TRY USING THE LARGER ONES TO APPLY FACE POWDER, I EVEN GET BRISTLES ALL OVER MY FACE THAT I HAVE TO WIPE OFF, THAT&#x27;S PRETTY GROSS, I WOULD SAY, BUT WHO KNOWS, MAYBE I GOT A DEFECTIVE SET???, BUT WORSE $18.00 I HAVE EVER SPENT, THANKS FOR NOTHING~</li>
            <li> First impression&lt;br /&gt;the shipping and delivery was fast, once i got the Package I immediately opened it, the package and all and the zebra print really cute and adorable, but the Brushes are way to stiff!! I paid $17.99 for this set of brushes and I didn&#x27;t see a single crease brush? 8 out of the 18 brushes are basically the same so i wasn&#x27;t happy About that, the face brushes are ok just like ELF brushes, the Fan brush looks cheap and it useless to me, Overall good set of brushes for beginners, I&#x27;m not impressed and next time  I will invest in a better set of brushes..the cost its too high for not so usable brushes.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, but are functional</li>
            <li> the brushes came today and i&#x27;m really happy with them! I have felt softest brushes but for their prize they are the best! And for me anyway they&#x27;re awesome cause they&#x27;re doing their job! I&#x27;m not a profecional or anything but i like makeup and for my everyday use are perfect like their prize! ;) For me is an extra plus that it&#x27;s zebra print cause i love anything zebra print and it gives it charecter! I would totally buy this again for a gift or something! They came very nice packed and nothing was destoyed or anything. I haven&#x27;t actually used them yet but i don&#x27;t think it will change anything in my review cause as i wrote earlier they&#x27;re pretty good!</li>
            <li> The set is gorgeous, they are very well packaged and protected. I have only used them once and they seem to work great. I would spend more to get a set that wasn&#x27;t so strong in smell.</li>
            <li> Works great. Worth the money. Great variety of brushes. After about a month of use I started to notice the brush coming off of the wooden handle. I was also kind of disappointed to realize a lot of the brushes are the same size. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I am so excited to use these brushes. They came wonderfully packaged with no odors like I had read in other reviews. The only I dont like is that the brushes are not labeled as to what they should be used for, other than that I really love these. They will be getting a lot of use!</li>
            <li> I may have liked this so much that I bought another one just because :)</li>
            <li> I am not sure what half of the brushes are even used for but the main 4 brushes i wanted were the same price as this! Also the case is adorable and everything you see is what you get. I do not regret it :)</li>
            <li> This is my third brush set.  The first was a Kirkland set which was decent and I would recommend that set for beginners.  More recently I purchased a Sedona Lace set which is phenomenal.  Very good quality and extremely soft.  I don &#x27;t know why I was hearing so much about Shany brushes lately but I was curious so I bought it.  These brushes are VERY cheap/poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I&#x27;ve found:&lt;br /&gt;1. Before being able to even use the brushes the brush head came off of the first brush I took out (I didn&#x27;t PULL it out, I was gentle).&lt;br /&gt;2. I&#x27;ve never seen brushes shed so much.&lt;br /&gt;3. The brushes are not soft.  If you have quality brushes such as Sedona Lace, you will be very unhappy with these bristles, they&#x27;re SO FAR from being soft.&lt;br /&gt;4.  They feel cheap.  Everything feels like cheap plastic, no metal, no wood, just plastic.&lt;br /&gt;5.  The brushes aren&#x27;t numbered and don&#x27;t have any description of what they are used for so for a beginner who doesn&#x27;t know what a foundation brush looks like, you might end up using a contour brush and you&#x27;ll never know what all the smaller brushes are used for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am highly disappointed and will never purchase anything from Shany again.  I didn&#x27;t expect amazing brushes for the price but I cannot accept that the brushes heads fall off and that they shed as much as they do.  Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend &amp; she loves it. However, as soon as she took the brushes out of the case (for the very first time) the metal/bristel tops popped right off of the wooden shafts/handles on 2 of the brushes. You could see that they were not glued on very well at all; super glue fixed that. That is her only complaint about this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 32 brush set for my daughter for Christmas and was amazed by the quality!  The brushes are long, sturdy and the hairs are fine and precisely cut for perfection.  The brushes are individually wrapped in a nice pouch and come in a very nice Shany Box...the pouch is perfect for travel.  So PROFESSIONAL!  After she opened her present of brushes and I saw them for the first time and was so impressed I ordered the smaller 18 Brush Set for myself and I am so satisfied.  I LOVE IT! You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for just the right brush set that included all the brushes that I needed without having a hodge podge of brush sets and no where to store them, especially when travelling.  This set fit the bill for everything I was looking for and it is very stylish!</li>
            <li> WORST BRUSHES I EVER BOUGHT</li>
            <li> These are great brushes I love them</li>
