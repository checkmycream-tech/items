    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>So i browsed through this site, comapring razors and reviews and found this one to be the best for price and performance.  </li>
            <li>I must say i am very happy with this razor</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 7 months since I bought it and without a doubt the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>Product works great!</li>
            <li>was impressed by the reviews.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s quite impressive and proved to me that you&#x27;d get a close shave with no nicks.</li>
            <li>The best thing for me is you don&#x27;t have to shave when you&#x27;re in the water.</li>
            <li>In sum, this Linear-powered razor is awesome.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an excellent electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Although you can still get a closer shave that is nearly perfect when using the Mach 3, you pay for it because it takes a lot of time.  </li>
            <li>Excellent build quality and ergonomics.  </li>
            <li>i am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great service.  </li>
            <li>with the fact that this Panasonic gives you a great shave, it appears to be well built.</li>
            <li>If that shaver is every bit as good as the ES8018SC, and adds the ability to wet-shave, it should be incredible.</li>
            <li>This razor works great.</li>
            <li>It looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li>It is also very stylish and fits the hand very nicely.</li>
            <li>Ergonomics are superior.  </li>
            <li>I was researching womens razors and kept coming across reviews that said mens razors are still superior to womens.</li>
            <li>Also, trimmer doesn&#x27;t have good fixation point</li>
            <li>. . . this is a good razor.  </li>
            <li>It is damn good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m so happy and love this razor.</li>
            <li>can take the twenty to thirty minutes to shave my face &amp;quot;baby smooth&amp;quot; with this razor and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>* Nice trimmer.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not a knock on the razor; it is a reality about my beard that is reflected no matter what kind of shaving system</li>
            <li>The ability to rinse the shaver clean under running water is a great benefit.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews, I decided to give it a try and was very pleased.</li>
            <li>I do not think any electric will ever be able to shave as perfectly close as a high quality manual razor.  </li>
            <li>So far it works great!  </li>
            <li>Upon recieving the shaver, i was glad i purchased it.  </li>
            <li>It has nice, flowing curves, and fits comfortably in a medium-sized hand.  </li>
            <li>More on that below.</li>
            <li>but I could use it in corded more.  </li>
            <li>I was glad I made the purchase since I think it cuts better, faster.  </li>
            <li>(it seems to work better).</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it shaves any better for me with foam.  </li>
            <li>Just keep the old manual razor around for special occasions when that shave just has to be perfect!</li>
            <li>It may be good for those hot and humid days</li>
            <li>razor gives a nice smooth clean shave without any nicks or hair pulling.</li>
            <li>but it provides a closer, more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>My first electric shaver buy is ES7006, and this time its ES8017 which is really nice.</li>
            <li>just fine.</li>
            <li>The Linear motor is a technological marvel that is light years ahead of the competition.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a great shaver.</li>
            <li>After seeing his results, several of his friends are ordering this great shaver.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I have to run this razor over my face for a minimum of twenty minutes to get a very close, consistent good shave</li>
            <li>clean this one with any liquid handsoap and water.</li>
            <li>You may be led to think so, since it has the feature that you can rinse it clean, but it&#x27;s not so.  </li>
            <li>This panosonic catches most of the hair - a lot better than my old braun.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, even though this one is not a &amp;quot;wet&amp;quot; shaver, you can still clean it under water.  </li>
            <li>Forget buying those auto cleaning shavers that require you to buy a special cleaner/lubricant,</li>
            <li>However, neither of these are true wet/dry shavers.  </li>
            <li>But the trade-off is this, as noted above:  if you can get close enough to get a reasonably good shave, and if you save a lot of time and cuts by using a good electric, it may well be worth it.  </li>
            <li>I found myself having to shave twice a day and still experienced very rough stubble and growth.  </li>
            <li>This is much better than a razor, and the main reason I bought the thing.</li>
            <li>The item I ordered arrived quickly and just as described.</li>
            <li>Some users note that the batteries wear out quickly.  </li>
            <li>You may ask whats the point of having a shaver if your going to lather up but let me tell you that its very comfortable (like shaving with a brand new Mach 3 every day).  </li>
            <li>All my other shavers were great right after a charge, but lost their zip and closeness after a day or two.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning is fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>Also, the full length trimmer allows much accuracy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic&#x27;s Wet/Dry models for more than 20 years, and I&#x27;m wild about them--the ability to work with foam makes them much more comfortable to use than other electric shavers or a blade.</li>
            <li>This was why, even though I liked the ES8018SC for all the reasons given above, I ended up returning it, because I wanted a REAL wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li>It takes only a good minute with liquid soap to fully cleanse the system- a convinience that makes cleaning it regularly less a chore and more a part of your routine.  </li>
            <li>The build quality seems pretty good; the plastic parts all fit tightly together, switches operate smoothly, and attachable parts like the foil snap easily but firmly into place.</li>
            <li>The pivoting head is great as well, it allows me to rub hard without any pain.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s pretty loud.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using a basic electric shaver for a couple weeks and was meerly satisfied with the performance.  </li>
            <li>The closeness of such razors is phenemonal but there are many drawbacks.  </li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver I have ever used</li>
            <li>After my first shave with this my face was burning and my chin was somewhat cut up -</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think any electric shaver can cut as close as a razor, but this model comes pretty close.</li>
            <li>One of the first things that the doctor&#x27;s told him was that he had to switch to an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far cheaper, and works every bit as well, to have a razor that you rinse clean with tap water.</li>
            <li>As noted above, the shaves are very good, nearly equal to using a blade such as Mach 3, but there&#x27;s still a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>This ultra fast Panasonic provides a consistent close shave for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>and it so much more convenient to use a dry shaver.  </li>
            <li>Design features, Speed, and clean shave with less sound compared to ES7006.</li>
            <li>shaver has really changed the way I have viewed shaving</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s a must buy, it makes mornings much easier!&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>so I can shave my neck like a real bladed razor</li>
            <li>If you need to upgrade, I&#x27;d suggest this shaver and if you really need the bring it in the shower with</li>
            <li>Its a nice razor but its not a wet dry razor.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic traps the cut hair inside the shaving head better than the other brands.  </li>
            <li>If you are changing from standard to electric, the shaver will burn your skin a bit the first few shaves, but other than that the experience is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>You can clean it by simply rinsing out the foil and blades under tap water.  </li>
            <li>The feature I enjoy most is the ability to use this shaver wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>Its popup trimmer pops open  so that it is basically perpendicular (at nearly a 90-degree angle) to the body of the razor, which gives you plenty of clearance and makes trimming jobs easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a great design, far better than the gimmicky and expensive new approach adopted by Norelco, Braun, and Remington, where their high-end razors soak in special cleaning units, and you have to keep buying the solutions.  </li>
            <li>It is quiet, cuts even my tough beard smoothly and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Closeness of shave wet or dry, battery life (7+days), easy to clean, appearance&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with Gillette blades for many years, and the few times I&#x27;ve tried electric razors</li>
            <li>This Panasonic shaver cuts very close, nearly as close as the new Mach 3 Power razors.  </li>
            <li>The powerful motor makes quick work of my heavy beard.</li>
            <li>I was a bit undecided on purchasing a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>Very fast, quiet and gives a close shave, even the stubborn neck hairs.  </li>
            <li>Recently I bought a Panasonic ES8018SC shaver, which except for the model number, is exactly like the ES8017SC.  </li>
            <li>it gives a very, very close shave and each charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Compared to Philips: Panasonic ES8017SC looks nice, produces less noise and shake, it is better for flat parts (cheeks), but much much worse for the neck</li>
            <li>problem with razors is I have sensitive skin and severe folliculitis (however it&#x27;s spelled).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not a messy problem with shaving cream or hair removal products</li>
            <li>I had an old Philips Philishave 282 with 2 rotary blades and decided to order this one as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li>Boy was he pleasantly surprised with the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li>Razor blades have become extremely expensive (the Gilette Mach 3 are nearly $1.50 each)so I think this is a good investment.</li>
            <li>However, when I use the Panasonic, I can get a shave that is probably 90% to 95% as close as the Mach 3, but I can finish shaving in about 3 minutes with no cream, no mess, and no cuts.   </li>
            <li>There were some rough spots that the Panasonic just could not knock down any lower, no matter how many times I went over them, went against the grain, or whatever.  </li>
            <li>it had both a high customer rating and a low price point.</li>
            <li>The angle of the cutting head relative to where you hold it in your hand is just about perfect; you don&#x27;t have to twist it around at strange angles to get an optimum cutting angle.  </li>
            <li>Mainly, the blood pouring from your face after using it...even while being careful and sensitive to your skin.  </li>
            <li>Apparently there has been some confusion about this model, and the ES8016SC, because Amazon says both are \\&quot;Wet/Dry\\&quot; shavers in the features lists on the Amazon site.  </li>
            <li>for the neck for me, compared to total of 5 minutes using old Philishave).</li>
            <li>My old Braun Flex Integral worked well enough</li>
            <li>and I recently put a new inner blade cutter in it.  </li>
            <li>The three blades do a precision job on facial hair, and the result is very near the closeness of a standard razor.  </li>
            <li>It has a few issues to be aware of.</li>
            <li>I read recently that many users complained about the popup hair trimmer on the new Remingtons, because the trimmer is flat and slides out parallel with the foil so that it is just barely extended beyond the shaving foil, and is hard to cut with.  </li>

            <li> You can clean it by simply rinsing out the foil and blades under tap water.  </li>
            <li> The feature I enjoy most is the ability to use this shaver wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> Its popup trimmer pops open  so that it is basically perpendicular (at nearly a 90-degree angle) to the body of the razor, which gives you plenty of clearance and makes trimming jobs easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a great design, far better than the gimmicky and expensive new approach adopted by Norelco, Braun, and Remington, where their high-end razors soak in special cleaning units, and you have to keep buying the solutions.  </li>
            <li> It is quiet, cuts even my tough beard smoothly and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Closeness of shave wet or dry, battery life (7+days), easy to clean, appearance&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with Gillette blades for many years, and the few times I&#x27;ve tried electric razors</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver cuts very close, nearly as close as the new Mach 3 Power razors.  </li>
            <li> The powerful motor makes quick work of my heavy beard.</li>
            <li> I was a bit undecided on purchasing a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> Very fast, quiet and gives a close shave, even the stubborn neck hairs.  </li>
            <li> Recently I bought a Panasonic ES8018SC shaver, which except for the model number, is exactly like the ES8017SC.  </li>
            <li> it gives a very, very close shave and each charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Compared to Philips: Panasonic ES8017SC looks nice, produces less noise and shake, it is better for flat parts (cheeks), but much much worse for the neck</li>
            <li> problem with razors is I have sensitive skin and severe folliculitis (however it&#x27;s spelled).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a messy problem with shaving cream or hair removal products</li>
            <li> I had an old Philips Philishave 282 with 2 rotary blades and decided to order this one as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Boy was he pleasantly surprised with the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> Razor blades have become extremely expensive (the Gilette Mach 3 are nearly $1.50 each)so I think this is a good investment.</li>
            <li> However, when I use the Panasonic, I can get a shave that is probably 90% to 95% as close as the Mach 3, but I can finish shaving in about 3 minutes with no cream, no mess, and no cuts.   </li>
            <li> There were some rough spots that the Panasonic just could not knock down any lower, no matter how many times I went over them, went against the grain, or whatever.  </li>
            <li> it had both a high customer rating and a low price point.</li>
            <li> The angle of the cutting head relative to where you hold it in your hand is just about perfect; you don&#x27;t have to twist it around at strange angles to get an optimum cutting angle.  </li>
            <li> Mainly, the blood pouring from your face after using it...even while being careful and sensitive to your skin.  </li>
            <li> Apparently there has been some confusion about this model, and the ES8016SC, because Amazon says both are \\&quot;Wet/Dry\\&quot; shavers in the features lists on the Amazon site.  </li>
            <li> for the neck for me, compared to total of 5 minutes using old Philishave).</li>
            <li> My old Braun Flex Integral worked well enough</li>
            <li> and I recently put a new inner blade cutter in it.  </li>
            <li> The three blades do a precision job on facial hair, and the result is very near the closeness of a standard razor.  </li>
            <li> It has a few issues to be aware of.</li>
            <li> I read recently that many users complained about the popup hair trimmer on the new Remingtons, because the trimmer is flat and slides out parallel with the foil so that it is just barely extended beyond the shaving foil, and is hard to cut with.  </li>
            <li> I did not experience that, but I didn&#x27;t have it long enough to find out.  </li>
            <li> I would bleed if I took extra time to try to even out the rough spots with a hand-held razor.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as the Norelco</li>
            <li> (Plus, it&#x27;s wet-clean feature might make it possible to do wet</li>
            <li> Yes, if you refuse to use the trimmer included for long hairs on your neck, it will not cut them.  </li>
            <li> When my razor recently broke I decided to try this one as I have always been curious about the wet/dry feature (even though this model has just the washable feature).  </li>
            <li> The instructions say you can not shave &amp;quot;wet&amp;quot; but their web site says you can with this shaver - but you can&#x27;t get the entire shaver wet e.g. go in the shower with it.  </li>
            <li> For years I would pre-shave with an over-praised Braun model and then had to subject myself to nicks and cuts using a regular razor.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> and I was sceptical of the switch from wet to dry shaving.  </li>
            <li> * Panasonics go through foils quickly, and the foils are a bit expensive.  </li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re done shaving with this unit, unlike a Braun shaver, nearly all the debris is trapped inside the shaving head, and you just rinse it down the sink.  </li>
            <li> You cannot use this shaver with shaving cream, or with a wet face, nor can you take it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> So be careful, don&#x27;t be misled by Amazon&#x27;s mistake in their features list.</li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave is comparable with a wet shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just splash some water on my face and shave wet.    </li>
            <li> First, once you&#x27;re accustomed to it, it&#x27;s less irritating to your skin.  </li>
            <li> Due to the sharpness of razor blades and the constant risk of cuts, you have to shave slowly and methodically,  changing angles, and working against the grain at some points, to get the ultimate shave.  </li>
            <li> Single blade shavers do a good job, but the longevity of the shave is pathetic.  </li>
            <li> cleaning is a breeze, due to the shavers washable feature.  </li>
            <li> Here are some additional reasons to consider buying it, as compared with other electric razor brands: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;</li>
            <li> the head under the tap, but you can&#x27;t immerse the shaver or use it in the shower as you can with some other Panasonic models.</li>
            <li> I looked at the reviews of the new Brauns and agreed that the sideburn cutter seemed poorly designed and reviews said it did not work well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also owned a womens electric razor in the past that was a wet dry</li>
            <li> you want a true Panasonic wet/dry shaver that you can take in a shower or use with shaving cream, the least expensive model that has all the features of the ES8016/17/18/19 models plus the ability to use it wet/dry, is the ES8152NC model, carried by  Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Its high-RPM motor gives off a high-pitched whine, but is not so loud as to be irritating.  </li>
            <li> but when I am through I can feel a few rough spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> Previously I was a life-long braun user.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, this isn&#x27;t technically a review, but if you&#x27;re considering purchasing this model, you need to know that this isn&#x27;t one of Panasonic&#x27;s Wet/Dry shavers (despite Amazon&#x27;s listing it as such on this page).</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get the little nicks, or the raw scraped areas, like you get with the Mach 3 or other manual razors.  </li>
            <li> Much less mess!</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, though it has trouble with neck hairs/any hairs longer than stubble.</li>
            <li> Well after a few shaves</li>
            <li> My beard is rough, tough and grows every which way.  </li>
            <li> are a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> I replaced my Norelco cordless/corded shaver--it failed after a brief two years--with this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> For a shave as close as a blade I usually use shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> Also, since I am a teenager acne can be a problem, and a standard razor opens your pores and exposes them to shaving cream and tons of other nasty things, which can lead to truly repulsive pimples (its gross, but i had to say it).  </li>
            <li> I had never liked the way electric razors shaved until I bought this Panasonic model.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m running late</li>
            <li> Unless it fails soon, consider me a customer converted to Panasonic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Panasonic is not perfect.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I won&#x27;t settle for merely \\&quot;rinsable.\\&quot;     </li>
            <li> You just shave and go, no messing with shaving cream and running water and no worries about cutting</li>
            <li> Another difference is that my braun would not catch a lot of the hair and it just dropped into the sink or where I was cutting.  </li>
            <li> He was very skeptical that he would get as close a shave.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8017SC shaves almost as close as a blade but without the bloody aftermath.</li>
            <li> I used to hate cleaning, so the washable feature is neat, just stick it under the sink.  </li>

            <li> Gets the job done, though it has trouble with neck hairs/any hairs longer than stubble. And it&#x27;s pretty loud.&lt;br /&gt;Still, it doesn&#x27;t nick. At all. This is much better than a razor, and the main reason I bought the thing.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this shaver and got it in the mail a couple days after.  I have been using a basic electric shaver for a couple weeks and was meerly satisfied with the performance.  Single blade shavers do a good job, but the longevity of the shave is pathetic.  I found myself having to shave twice a day and still experienced very rough stubble and growth.  I flirted with the idea of returnnig to a 3 blade standard razor.  The closeness of such razors is phenemonal but there are many drawbacks.  Mainly, the blood pouring from your face after using it...even while being careful and sensitive to your skin.  Also, since I am a teenager acne can be a problem, and a standard razor opens your pores and exposes them to shaving cream and tons of other nasty things, which can lead to truly repulsive pimples (its gross, but i had to say it).  So i browsed through this site, comapring razors and reviews and found this one to be the best for price and performance.  Upon recieving the shaver, i was glad i purchased it.  The three blades do a precision job on facial hair, and the result is very near the closeness of a standard razor.  Also, the full length trimmer allows much accuracy. cleaning is a breeze, due to the shavers washable feature.  It takes only a good minute with liquid soap to fully cleanse the system- a convinience that makes cleaning it regularly less a chore and more a part of your routine.  If you are changing from standard to electric, the shaver will burn your skin a bit the first few shaves, but other than that the experience is wonderful.  And since the pro curve doesnt interfere with your pores or clog them up, problems with zits or blemishes are a thing of the past.  I must say i am very happy with this razor and i plan on using it for quite a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 7 months since I bought it and without a doubt the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  Ergonomics are superior.  This ultra fast Panasonic provides a consistent close shave for 2 weeks.  All my other shavers were great right after a charge, but lost their zip and closeness after a day or two.  Charging takes just an hour. Cleaning is fast and easy.  Forget buying those auto cleaning shavers that require you to buy a special cleaner/lubricant, clean this one with any liquid handsoap and water.</li>
            <li> The item I ordered arrived quickly and just as described. Great service.  Product works great!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8017SC shaves almost as close as a blade but without the bloody aftermath. I replaced my Norelco cordless/corded shaver--it failed after a brief two years--with this Panasonic. The Panasonic doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as the Norelco but it provides a closer, more comfortable shave. Unless it fails soon, consider me a customer converted to Panasonic. (Plus, it&#x27;s wet-clean feature might make it possible to do wet shaves though I haven&#x27;t tried yet.)</li>
            <li> I was researching womens razors and kept coming across reviews that said mens razors are still superior to womens. With that said I decided to take a look for myself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was impressed by the reviews. One man uses the razor to shave his head bald. That&#x27;s quite impressive and proved to me that you&#x27;d get a close shave with no nicks. And, if it works to shave a guys head it should work for my legs just fine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My problem with razors is I have sensitive skin and severe folliculitis (however it&#x27;s spelled). Every razor I use infects  my hair follicles. If I use products like Veet I get chemical burns and infected follicles. It&#x27;s been a constant battle. I&#x27;ve also owned a womens electric razor in the past that was a wet dry but it nicked me and pulled on my hair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This razor gives a nice smooth clean shave without any nicks or hair pulling. The best thing for me is you don&#x27;t have to shave when you&#x27;re in the water. You can use it anywhere at anytime. If I want to just touch up a spot it&#x27;s not a messy problem with shaving cream or hair removal products that just make my skin torn up anyway. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy and love this razor. I think anyone would agree.</li>
            <li> My first electric shaver buy is ES7006, and this time its ES8017 which is really nice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros: Design features, Speed, and clean shave with less sound compared to ES7006. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: There is no mount features (i.e., We have to plug out every time we charge and then use it.) ES7006 came with a wall mounter that can hold the shaver after its done and can be charged with ease.</li>
            <li> I was very sceptical about using an electric razor, because I had tried Braun and Norelco, and they did nothing for my heavy beard.  For years I would pre-shave with an over-praised Braun model and then had to subject myself to nicks and cuts using a regular razor.&lt;BR&gt;Once I bought this Panasonic model, I found I not only got a closer, nick-free shave than I was getting with a regular razor, but I also got to avoid the time-consuming ritual of shaving cream, etc.  In sum, this Linear-powered razor is awesome.  I will never shave with anything else.&lt;BR&gt;Yes, if you refuse to use the trimmer included for long hairs on your neck, it will not cut them.  But why not use the trimmer? That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun, Norelco and Panasonic razors.  The Panasonic Linear is the only one that comes close to duplicating the closeness of a blade shave.  The Linear motor is a technological marvel that is light years ahead of the competition.  The powerful motor makes quick work of my heavy beard.</li>
            <li> Recently I bought a Panasonic ES8018SC shaver, which except for the model number, is exactly like the ES8017SC.  In fact, after a lot of research, I learned that Panasonic has a series in which there are 4 models that are essentially identical:  the ES8016SC, the ES8017SC, the ES8018SC, and the ES8019SC.  You can find all of them for sale at various sites, but I have yet to find a feature or price difference between them.  In fact, the instruction manual that came with mine said it applied to all these models.  So in short, it doesn&#x27;t matter which model number you buy, you should get the same price and features. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent electric shaver.  I&#x27;ve been shaving with Gillette blades for many years, and the few times I&#x27;ve tried electric razors, the result has been unsatisfactory compared with wet/blade shaving, so I&#x27;ve always returned the electrics.  But this time was different.  This Panasonic shaver cuts very close, nearly as close as the new Mach 3 Power razors.  And along with the close shave, there are several advantages of using the Panasonic over wet/blade shaving.  First, once you&#x27;re accustomed to it, it&#x27;s less irritating to your skin.  You don&#x27;t get the little nicks, or the raw scraped areas, like you get with the Mach 3 or other manual razors.  A second advantage is time.  Although you can still get a closer shave that is nearly perfect when using the Mach 3, you pay for it because it takes a lot of time.  Due to the sharpness of razor blades and the constant risk of cuts, you have to shave slowly and methodically,  changing angles, and working against the grain at some points, to get the ultimate shave.  But that can take me from 7 to 10 minutes.  However, when I use the Panasonic, I can get a shave that is probably 90% to 95% as close as the Mach 3, but I can finish shaving in about 3 minutes with no cream, no mess, and no cuts.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Along with the fact that this Panasonic gives you a great shave, it appears to be well built.Here are some additional reasons to consider buying it, as compared with other electric razor brands: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* You can clean it by simply rinsing out the foil and blades under tap water.  Several brands have begun to add this feature.   It&#x27;s really a great design, far better than the gimmicky and expensive new approach adopted by Norelco, Braun, and Remington, where their high-end razors soak in special cleaning units, and you have to keep buying the solutions.  It&#x27;s far cheaper, and works every bit as well, to have a razor that you rinse clean with tap water. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* The Panasonic traps the cut hair inside the shaving head better than the other brands.  When you&#x27;re done shaving with this unit, unlike a Braun shaver, nearly all the debris is trapped inside the shaving head, and you just rinse it down the sink.  Much less mess! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* Excellent build quality and ergonomics.  The Panasonic is a well designed unit.  It has nice, flowing curves, and fits comfortably in a medium-sized hand.  The angle of the cutting head relative to where you hold it in your hand is just about perfect; you don&#x27;t have to twist it around at strange angles to get an optimum cutting angle.  Its high-RPM motor gives off a high-pitched whine, but is not so loud as to be irritating.  The build quality seems pretty good; the plastic parts all fit tightly together, switches operate smoothly, and attachable parts like the foil snap easily but firmly into place. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* Nice trimmer.  I read recently that many users complained about the popup hair trimmer on the new Remingtons, because the trimmer is flat and slides out parallel with the foil so that it is just barely extended beyond the shaving foil, and is hard to cut with.  No such problems with the Panasonic.  Its popup trimmer pops open  so that it is basically perpendicular (at nearly a 90-degree angle) to the body of the razor, which gives you plenty of clearance and makes trimming jobs easy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is not perfect.  It has a few issues to be aware of. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* Some users note that the batteries wear out quickly.  I did not experience that, but I didn&#x27;t have it long enough to find out.  More on that below. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* Panasonics go through foils quickly, and the foils are a bit expensive.  Panasonic recommends replacing the foil once a year, and they cost about $20.  The blades should be replaced every 2 years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* As noted above, the shaves are very good, nearly equal to using a blade such as Mach 3, but there&#x27;s still a noticeable difference.  There were some rough spots that the Panasonic just could not knock down any lower, no matter how many times I went over them, went against the grain, or whatever.  I do not think any electric will ever be able to shave as perfectly close as a high quality manual razor.  But the trade-off is this, as noted above:  if you can get close enough to get a reasonably good shave, and if you save a lot of time and cuts by using a good electric, it may well be worth it.  Just keep the old manual razor around for special occasions when that shave just has to be perfect! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* Please note, this model is NOT a wet/dry shaver.  You may be led to think so, since it has the feature that you can rinse it clean, but it&#x27;s not so.  You cannot use this shaver with shaving cream, or with a wet face, nor can you take it in the shower.  It specifically says so in the instruction manual.  Apparently there has been some confusion about this model, and the ES8016SC, because Amazon says both are \\&quot;Wet/Dry\\&quot; shavers in the features lists on the Amazon site.  However, neither of these are true wet/dry shavers.  This was why, even though I liked the ES8018SC for all the reasons given above, I ended up returning it, because I wanted a REAL wet/dry shaver.  So be careful, don&#x27;t be misled by Amazon&#x27;s mistake in their features list. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you want a true Panasonic wet/dry shaver that you can take in a shower or use with shaving cream, the least expensive model that has all the features of the ES8016/17/18/19 models plus the ability to use it wet/dry, is the ES8152NC model, carried by  Amazon.  This is the model that I ordered after returning my ES8018SC.  The ES8152NC also adds an adjustable head that you can pivot to different angles.  If that shaver is every bit as good as the ES8018SC, and adds the ability to wet-shave, it should be incredible.</li>
            <li> Previously I was a life-long braun user.  When my razor recently broke I decided to try this one as I have always been curious about the wet/dry feature (even though this model has just the washable feature).  So far it works great!  Very fast, quiet and gives a close shave, even the stubborn neck hairs.  I used to hate cleaning, so the washable feature is neat, just stick it under the sink.  The pivoting head is great as well, it allows me to rub hard without any pain.  I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> This razor works great. I read all the reviews here and decided to buy it b/c it had both a high customer rating and a low price point. the razor works as well as advertised. it gives a very, very close shave and each charge lasts a long time. i am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Its a nice razor but its not a wet dry razor.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I have ever used and I was sceptical of the switch from wet to dry shaving.  After my first shave with this my face was burning and my chin was somewhat cut up - but the next day when I used it there was no pain or bleeding anywhere.  The closeness of the shave is comparable with a wet shave and it so much more convenient to use a dry shaver.  You just shave and go, no messing with shaving cream and running water and no worries about cutting you&#x27;re face.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver has really changed the way I have viewed shaving, It&#x27;s a must buy, it makes mornings much easier!&lt;br /&gt;4 Stars</li>
            <li> I had never liked the way electric razors shaved until I bought this Panasonic model. After reading many reviews, I decided to give it a try and was very pleased. It is quiet, cuts even my tough beard smoothly and it is easy to clean. I don&#x27;t think any electric shaver can cut as close as a razor, but this model comes pretty close. There is no pulling and it can handle a three day growth with no problem. It is also very stylish and fits the hand very nicely. Razor blades have become extremely expensive (the Gilette Mach 3 are nearly $1.50 each)so I think this is a good investment. Plus there are no razor burns or cuts nicks. Overall this is a great shaver.</li>
            <li> Sorry, this isn&#x27;t technically a review, but if you&#x27;re considering purchasing this model, you need to know that this isn&#x27;t one of Panasonic&#x27;s Wet/Dry shavers (despite Amazon&#x27;s listing it as such on this page). Yes, you can *rinse* the head under the tap, but you can&#x27;t immerse the shaver or use it in the shower as you can with some other Panasonic models. I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic&#x27;s Wet/Dry models for more than 20 years, and I&#x27;m wild about them--the ability to work with foam makes them much more comfortable to use than other electric shavers or a blade. That&#x27;s why I won&#x27;t settle for merely \\&quot;rinsable.\\&quot;     I bought this model, scissored open the plastic retail package, and only when I read the manual did I find a warning that it&#x27;s not waterproof. The retail package seems designed to thwart returning the product, but I did anyway, citing the incorrect product information listed on this page.</li>
            <li> I had an old Philips Philishave 282 with 2 rotary blades and decided to order this one as a Christmas gift. Compared to Philips: Panasonic ES8017SC looks nice, produces less noise and shake, it is better for flat parts (cheeks), but much much worse for the neck (it takes 2 minutes to shave cheeks and ~10-15 (!) for the neck for me, compared to total of 5 minutes using old Philishave). Also, trimmer doesn&#x27;t have good fixation point (I have to hold lever all of the time, otherwise it closes when you try to trim).</li>
            <li> The feature I enjoy most is the ability to use this shaver wet or dry.  The ability to rinse the shaver clean under running water is a great benefit. For a shave as close as a blade I usually use shaving cream.  You may ask whats the point of having a shaver if your going to lather up but let me tell you that its very comfortable (like shaving with a brand new Mach 3 every day).  Plus you can go against the grain on the 1st pass with equal comfort and for speed. If I&#x27;m running late I&#x27;ll just splash some water on my face and shave wet.    &lt;BR&gt;Pros: Closeness of shave wet or dry, battery life (7+days), easy to clean, appearance&lt;BR&gt;Cons: No stand, it will take some razor users time to let their beards adjust to the foil shaver.</li>
            <li> I was a bit undecided on purchasing a new shaver.  My old Braun Flex Integral worked well enough and I recently put a new inner blade cutter in it.  The battery did not work but I could use it in corded more.  I looked at the reviews of the new Brauns and agreed that the sideburn cutter seemed poorly designed and reviews said it did not work well.  So I bucked-up and purchaced this Panosonic ... &lt;br /&gt; Well after a few shaves I was glad I made the purchase since I think it cuts better, faster.  Also it feels smoother when I am shaving and it&#x27;s lighter and it&#x27;s curved shape helps so I can shave my neck like a real bladed razor (it seems to work better). Another difference is that my braun would not catch a lot of the hair and it just dropped into the sink or where I was cutting.  This panosonic catches most of the hair - a lot better than my old braun.&lt;br /&gt;  Also, even though this one is not a &amp;quot;wet&amp;quot; shaver, you can still clean it under water.  The instructions say you can not shave &amp;quot;wet&amp;quot; but their web site says you can with this shaver - but you can&#x27;t get the entire shaver wet e.g. go in the shower with it.  I tried it with shaving cream (foam) and it works but I don&#x27;t think it shaves any better for me with foam.  It may be good for those hot and humid days though.&lt;br /&gt;  If you need to upgrade, I&#x27;d suggest this shaver and if you really need the bring it in the shower with you buy the more expensive &amp;quot;wet&amp;quot; version.</li>
            <li> . . . this is a good razor.  BUT IT IS NOT A TRIPLE HEAD SHAVER.  It has ONLY TWO shaving heads.  I guess the third head is the trimmer on the side of the unit.  The presentation is misleading and I have alerted Amazon.com to the &amp;quot;mistake.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this razor for about three weeks.  My beard is rough, tough and grows every which way.  Therefore, I have to run this razor over my face for a minimum of twenty minutes to get a very close, consistent good shave (though I haven&#x27;t shaved every day since I got it).  That&#x27;s not a knock on the razor; it is a reality about my beard that is reflected no matter what kind of shaving system I use.&lt;br /&gt;The advantage of this razor is that I can do it without any blood.  I can shave with a hand-held razor in a shorter time but when I am through I can feel a few rough spots on my face.  I would bleed if I took extra time to try to even out the rough spots with a hand-held razor.  Keep in mind, I am talking about spots that I can feel when running my hand over my face; not spots that would show up to anyone looking at my face.&lt;br /&gt;I can take the twenty to thirty minutes to shave my face &amp;quot;baby smooth&amp;quot; with this razor and am very pleased.  It is damn good.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using the regular disposable razors for years.  He shaves not only his face but his head as well.  A couple weeks ago, he had a health scare and was put on blood thinners.  One of the first things that the doctor&#x27;s told him was that he had to switch to an electric razor.  Could not take the chance of a cut with the blade.  I immediately went online and ordered the Panasonic Triple Blade Pro Curve Shaver.  He was very skeptical that he would get as close a shave.  Boy was he pleasantly surprised with the closeness of the shave.  It looks and feels great.  After seeing his results, several of his friends are ordering this great shaver.</li>
