            <li>And it smells good too!</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s a great product to style your hair in any shape or for you like.</li>
            <li>this a great product, been using it for years already .now</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Simply amazing!</li>
            <li>This is the most perfect hair wax I can think of.</li>
            <li>This product is great for men who have medium length hair that you can easily pull your hands through.</li>
            <li>did I mention that it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>Best for shorter spiky hair with the nice matte natural</li>
            <li>so far ,  this is the best. !</li>
            <li>I have very fine and thinning (aka balding) hair.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve used so many product.  </li>
            <li>If you have shorter hair you will need something rougher, more defining.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used over a dozen different types of wax, and this one works best for me.</li>
            <li>i love everything about this wax.&lt;br /&gt;the texture, the scent, the water soluble ingredients, and finally, authentic container.&lt;br /&gt;i wis</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say if this is better or gatsby which i&#x27;ve been using for a while now is better.</li>
            <li>Now I always buy one more and store at home just in case</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many gels, mousse, hairsprays, wax, pastes--you name it.  </li>
            <li>but it works great for my soft, fine caucasian hair.</li>
            <li>easy to work with&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>of all, the wax feels extremely light and my hair never looks like it was hair-waxed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use hair wax almost daily and this product by far is the best out of the 10+</li>
            <li>In sum, hair nirvana, with a Goldilocks feel, a scent of the sweet life--</li>
            <li>Some don&#x27;t allow time for you to ply or sculpt, drying too quickly.  </li>
            <li>though it is pricey, it is still way worth it.</li>
            <li>Hesitant right away for its price tag, it was hair nirvana.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy but easy to mange your hair</li>
            <li>You get a better bargain by ordering this online as opposed to making a purchase at your local salon.  </li>
            <li>Spice Sisters Freeze was first recommended to me by my stylist.  </li>
            <li>but it is pleasant and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I have been using this pudding for a long time now and have found it to work better then anything else.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for that dry look and hold which gives your hair that natural messy look and feel.  </li>
            <li>reason why this wax feels so light is that you only need to use trace amounts to hold and style your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This wax just made my hair sticky and flat and it did not have a pleasant smell like other waxes I have tried.</li>
            <li>They both do a decent job of forming certain hair styles, it would&#x27;ve been nicer if it was easier to form/shape the hair from the beginning.</li>
            <li>It has a fragrance that reminds me of a newly opened hello kitty eraser or a mobile phone straight out of its packaging,</li>
            <li>Provides a decent hold without having to coat my hair in product.</li>
            <li>but mixed with some fruit--not overwhelming, but if you&#x27;ve had Japanese products before (candy, car deodorizer, etc.)</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Not heavy and holds very well.</li>
            <li>More like a stiff wax.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It holds well, but I&#x27;d suggest always finishing off with a strong hair spray after wax unless you have super thick hair that naturally stands up or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>its also not super sticky and easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>only one things is a litter expanse haha</li>
            <li>the old one is used up..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m over 40 years old, have been using hair products since teens, and by far, this freeze was by Spice Sisters</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not a typical gel which requires a handful amount to work</li>
            <li>Highly recommend especially for shorter hair.</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding a good product for thin straight hair but this gets the job done!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a extreme user of hair products, but quality, ease, and effectiveness is a must.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not a extreme user of hair products, but quality, ease, and effectiveness is a must.  </li>
            <li> It is not too thick or watery, just right like Goldilocks.  </li>
            <li> the only difference is that this product is like a paste not a wax, so its like liquidy but to my surprised after rubbing it to my hair the product instantly dried off and gave the same matte effect like the american fiber crew.</li>
            <li> If I was a teen all again, by hair would be the bomb, but as a middle aged, it makes my styling easier to do and makes me feel younger.  </li>
            <li> Some products hold well but turn your hair into a hard shell Constantine wire; others flake; some fall apart after some time; some seal your hair too much that your head is in a sauna.</li>
            <li> i been looking for this wax for long time.</li>
            <li> The only negative may be that the hold disappears when your hair is exposed directly to the sun for a long time or humid.</li>
            <li> Not much sticks to my hair, and Freeze Wax is almost there.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I was a tad skeptical about this product at first.</li>
            <li> pricey compared to other brands</li>
            <li> Others weigh down as if you have a helmet.  </li>
            <li> I put a little in my hand and comb it through my damp hair.  </li>
            <li> The wax I&#x27;d been using (D:Fi heavy wax) seems to have been discontinued.</li>
            <li> container is small.</li>
            <li> It gives the longer hair a defined shape while not making it hard, and stiff looking.  </li>
            <li> wow the container looks sick.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and it helps to give my hair body.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I got the 1.24 oz instaed of 6.76 oz, which probably doesn&#x27;t exist.  If you order 3.5 oz, you&#x27;ll probably get 1.24 oz as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been using this product to style my hair.  This product is perfect for that dry look and hold which gives your hair that natural messy look and feel.  You get a better bargain by ordering this online as opposed to making a purchase at your local salon.  The only downsize is the size of this container it&#x27;s pretty small, if you&#x27;re a person who does his/her hair on a daily basis then invest in a couple of containers.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing! I was a tad skeptical about this product at first. However it&#x27;s a great product to style your hair in any shape or for you like. I have a hard time finding a good product for thin straight hair but this gets the job done! No hairspray needed anymore and hold last all day. Matte finish and no crunch. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> if u want to style ur hair !! this is one i recommand ..&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve used so many product.  so far ,  this is the best. !</li>
            <li> This product is great for men who have medium length hair that you can easily pull your hands through. It gives the longer hair a defined shape while not making it hard, and stiff looking.  If you have shorter hair you will need something rougher, more defining.</li>
            <li> i been looking for this wax for long time. i found out it in here. i m so happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i not going to anymore a shop to get a wax. this is  so quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> I like it.  I have asian short hair.  I put a little in my hand and comb it through my damp hair.  Reminds me of how my hair is after the beach.  This is not a gel. More like a stiff wax.</li>
            <li> i like this item, u can just use a litter it work a day. only one things is a litter expanse haha</li>
            <li> I have been using this pudding for a long time now and have found it to work better then anything else. It&#x27;s not heavy but easy to mange your hair</li>
            <li> this a great product, been using it for years already .now i found it here is cheaper than store.</li>
            <li> This wax just made my hair sticky and flat and it did not have a pleasant smell like other waxes I have tried. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect. Thank you!</li>
            <li> wow the container looks sick. the prodct is smaller than the american fiber crew tube but definately works the same. the only difference is that this product is like a paste not a wax, so its like liquidy but to my surprised after rubbing it to my hair the product instantly dried off and gave the same matte effect like the american fiber crew. its also not super sticky and easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Great price!</li>
            <li> Perfect texture and level of girth</li>
            <li> My Asian friend gave me a can but it works great for my soft, fine caucasian hair. Highly recommend especially for shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  I have thin hair and it helps to give my hair body.  Try it and you will like it!</li>
            <li> I use hair wax almost daily and this product by far is the best out of the 10+ that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to work with&lt;br /&gt;Once applied, it will last you all day. If your hair gets messed up, just &amp;#34;re-mold&amp;#34; it&lt;br /&gt;Matte finish so it doesn&#x27;t look like you haven&#x27;t washed your hair in days.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;Smells awesome&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Bit pricey compared to other brands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it is pricey, it is still way worth it.</li>
            <li> Best for shorter spiky hair with the nice matte natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds well, but I&#x27;d suggest always finishing off with a strong hair spray after wax unless you have super thick hair that naturally stands up or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used over a dozen different types of wax, and this one works best for me.</li>
            <li> i love everything about this wax.&lt;br /&gt;the texture, the scent, the water soluble ingredients, and finally, authentic container.&lt;br /&gt;i wis i had hundreds of these to stack em on my shelf.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if this is better or gatsby which i&#x27;ve been using for a while now is better. They both do a decent job of forming certain hair styles, it would&#x27;ve been nicer if it was easier to form/shape the hair from the beginning. It seems to get easier sometime after the wax has been applied to the hair.</li>
            <li> This is the most perfect hair wax I can think of. It holds well, it doesn&#x27;t smell, and it is almost undetectable when applied, it doesn&#x27;t attract dust as one of my hairgel did, and it lasts for days (not just hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, the wax feels extremely light and my hair never looks like it was hair-waxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reason why this wax feels so light is that you only need to use trace amounts to hold and style your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a typical gel which requires a handful amount to work proerly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is small. But it can last for couple of months for short-haired men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is made in Japan, and it was recommended to me by my hair stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have very fine and thinning (aka balding) hair. The wax I&#x27;d been using (D:Fi heavy wax) seems to have been discontinued. Thought I&#x27;d give this a try. Not much sticks to my hair, and Freeze Wax is almost there. Provides a decent hold without having to coat my hair in product. And it smells good too!</li>
            <li> Gr8 product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and only recently found it on Amazon. The best thing is its cheaper than the salon.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 4years . It&#x27;s great. Now I always buy one more and store at home just in case the old one is used up..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a extreme user of hair products, but quality, ease, and effectiveness is a must.  I&#x27;ve tried many gels, mousse, hairsprays, wax, pastes--you name it.  Some products hold well but turn your hair into a hard shell Constantine wire; others flake; some fall apart after some time; some seal your hair too much that your head is in a sauna. Some don&#x27;t allow time for you to ply or sculpt, drying too quickly.  Others weigh down as if you have a helmet.  You get the idea...Spice Sisters Freeze was first recommended to me by my stylist.  Hesitant right away for its price tag, it was hair nirvana.  It is not too thick or watery, just right like Goldilocks.  I&#x27;m over 40 years old, have been using hair products since teens, and by far, this freeze was by Spice Sisters is the BEST All-Time!  If I was a teen all again, by hair would be the bomb, but as a middle aged, it makes my styling easier to do and makes me feel younger.  It has a fragrance that reminds me of a newly opened hello kitty eraser or a mobile phone straight out of its packaging, yeah, but mixed with some fruit--not overwhelming, but if you&#x27;ve had Japanese products before (candy, car deodorizer, etc.) this wax definitely has that provenance in its scent...which I find as alluring as its efficacy.  In sum, hair nirvana, with a Goldilocks feel, a scent of the sweet life--did I mention that it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over 10 years. Not heavy and holds very well. There is an apple-esque scent to the product but it is pleasant and not overwhelming. The only negative may be that the hold disappears when your hair is exposed directly to the sun for a long time or humid.</li>
            <li> The best wax i have ever used</li>
