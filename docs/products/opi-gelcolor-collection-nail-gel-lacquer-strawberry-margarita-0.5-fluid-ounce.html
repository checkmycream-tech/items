            <li>It&#x27;s a good summer color for everyday yet not so bright it is inappropriate for work...</li>

            <li>This color is a great pink cream color.</li>
            <li>This polish is true to its color shown.</li>
            <li>I found this to be easy to apply and easy to remove, and most importantly--long lasting!!!</li>

            <li>Very pretty color.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color.</li>
            <li>Service was easy to use and was very timely.</li>
            <li>Still a pretty shade though!</li>
            <li>but this was a fun shade to wear during hot July days!  </li>
            <li>I use this for my gel manicure along with the complimentary color for my pedicure.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money to keep a quality product</li>
            <li>It is the same size bottle which is nice</li>
            <li>I am wearing this right now.</li>
            <li>Summer is right around the corner</li>
            <li>very tropical!  </li>
            <li>The color and consistency is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The brush makes it easy to apply smooth and even, and I was surprised by how big the bottle was.</li>
            <li>These polishes are very runny and difficult to apply, but practice makes perfect.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t say you need a special light to dry..........</li>
            <li>It has a bit of an orange undertone in certain lights.  </li>
            <li>The price was quite reasonable and the package was well protected in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>Holds up really well</li>
            <li>The color is a whole lot lighter than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>Goes with so much.</li>
            <li>It goes on very nicely and is opaque in 2 thin coats.</li>
            <li>Unless you have the special light, this doesn&#x27;t last as long as the ads say.</li>
            <li>However, this color pink is not as bright as I had expected.  </li>
            <li>I was unable to locate this color locally and was very happy to find it o Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like this shade.  </li>
            <li>Have to have the alcohol to clean the sticky off after they dry though</li>
            <li>I love the concept but it just doesn&#x27;t last as long doing it at home.</li>
            <li>Good but not great.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for, but because of the heat when I tried to open the package it was stuck and the paper had it all over it.</li>
            <li>I received exactly what I ordered, the only downfall was that the bottle had already been opened and used.</li>
            <li>mine never dried ............</li>
            <li>and it is a very close match to the regular polish.  </li>
            <li>The other reveiws were right on the money.  </li>
            <li>Most of the other brands have half of the sized bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be interested to see if the other opi soak off gels</li>
            <li>I have a regular salon light dryer and the polish lasts only a week or less before it peels (and I am using it according to salon instructions).</li>
            <li>Such a fun pink!</li>
            <li>However, it is a deep rosy pink--not candy or hot pink.</li>
            <li>I like wearing bright colors in the winter when it&#x27;s so cold and gross outside.  </li>
            <li>Not hot pink not light pink, but a good in the middle pink.</li>

            <li> I tried this gel color for first time and I bought the lamp and the base and top coat</li>
            <li> Long wearing and shine.  </li>
            <li> complete waste of money</li>
            <li> plus it took forever to dry even with a lamp.</li>

            <li> too expensive and very</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this color stains the nail once soaked off.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t apply too thickly...</li>
            <li> I may have done something wrong but followed instructions, read reviews and did research on other sites and the 2 colors I tried peeled off within hours.  </li>
            <li> Buying nail polish is tough on the computer.  </li>
            <li> are this thin too.  </li>
            <li> Was disappointed since OPI usually sets the bar.  </li>
            <li> It is very thin and does not \\&quot;self level\\&quot; well.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the color, it&#x27;s an OPI classic of course. I am wearing this right now.</li>
            <li> However, this color pink is not as bright as I had expected.  It has a bit of an orange undertone in certain lights.  Still a pretty shade though!</li>
            <li> Great color, last well and best price on Amazon, make sure to cure it well under UV lamp and enjoy</li>
            <li> I use this for my gel manicure along with the complimentary color for my pedicure.  This is the best summer match set for fingers and toes.  You will get tons of compliments.</li>
            <li> I was going to the salon to have gel nail polish applied every 2 weeks. I&lt;br /&gt;like that I can apply the polish in my own home and save $30 too. The color&lt;br /&gt;is fabulous and I have received many, many complements.</li>
            <li> This is the second OPI Gelcolor that I have purchased. OPI applies easily and wears well. I love this color. It is a bright, opaque pink--not red as the name &amp;#34;strawberry&amp;#34; might imply. However, it is a deep rosy pink--not candy or hot pink. I think the color works well in any season.</li>
            <li> Unless you have the special light, this doesn&#x27;t last as long as the ads say. I have a regular salon light dryer and the polish lasts only a week or less before it peels (and I am using it according to salon instructions). I love the concept but it just doesn&#x27;t last as long doing it at home.</li>
            <li> I love OPI and the color is just what I wanted for spring and summer -- especially Easter.  I was unable to locate this color locally and was very happy to find it o Amazon.  The price was quite reasonable and the package was well protected in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> Nice color. Color lasts pretty good.</li>
            <li> This polish goes on very nice, is a very pretty vibrant color and comes of easy too.  I love OPI products!</li>
            <li> Great color and staying quality.  Adheres well and lasts a very long time!  Worth the money to keep a quality product</li>
            <li> I tried this gel color for first time and I bought the lamp and the base and top coat and it didnt work for me.&lt;br /&gt;This is not like the kind you would get at the salon. plus it took forever to dry even with a lamp. I def dont recommend</li>
            <li> This matches identically to the regular strawberry margarita so it&#x27;s perfect for my hands when my toes have the regular version.  Holds up really well and I&#x27;ve had it for months and it hasn&#x27;t thickened up or changed consistency like regular polished do.  Always get tons of compliments when I wear this shade!</li>
            <li> Great gel nail polish!  My favorite color and it works great!</li>
            <li> Gel polishes are great.  This is a bright pink and looks very nice.  These polishes are very runny and difficult to apply, but practice makes perfect.  Don&#x27;t quit without giving it a chance.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not big on pinks but this was a fun shade to wear during hot July days!  OPI is my favorite shellac!</li>
            <li> very tropical!  I like wearing bright colors in the winter when it&#x27;s so cold and gross outside.  I found this to be easy to apply and easy to remove, and most importantly--long lasting!!!</li>
            <li> I use a lot of different brands of gel polish and this is one of my favorites. The brush makes it easy to apply smooth and even, and I was surprised by how big the bottle was. Most of the other brands have half of the sized bottle. Very great summer color. I will be buying more of this brand in many different colors.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and great price to boot!  Easier to apply than I expected, too.  Just don&#x27;t apply too thickly...</li>
            <li> Such a fun pink! I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s just shy of hot pink. It&#x27;s a good summer color for everyday yet not so bright it is inappropriate for work...</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t say you need a special light to dry..........mine never dried ............a salon told me I could bring it in ,and they will polish my nails was trying to skip that expense</li>
            <li> Service was easy to use and was very timely. Good selection of products choice and colors. For those of you who have not tried the OPI Gel-polish, it is a lifesaver for those of you who use your hands alot. It last 2 - 3 weeks without a chip</li>
            <li> OPI gel polish is a great product regardless of the color. I particularly like this shade.  Long wearing and shine.  Helps nails grow.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color. The other reveiws were right on the money.  I recomend this ansd I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Good polish. Good color. Not hot pink not light pink, but a good in the middle pink. Got several compliments. Held up for about 10-12 days.</li>
            <li> I have been using RCM and very happy except the &amp;#34;pooling&amp;#34;.  I love OPI polish and was happy to see them doing gel now.  I may have done something wrong but followed instructions, read reviews and did research on other sites and the 2 colors I tried peeled off within hours.  too expensive and very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stores were great and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Opi soak off gel is ok...but gelish is better.  It is very thin and does not \\&quot;self level\\&quot; well.  The color faded after about a week...which has never happened with Gelish.  It is the same size bottle which is nice and we bought strawberry margarita and it is a very close match to the regular polish.  I&#x27;ll be interested to see if the other opi soak off gels are this thin too.  Was disappointed since OPI usually sets the bar.  Just not this time.  Good but not great.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for, but because of the heat when I tried to open the package it was stuck and the paper had it all over it. But once I wiped it with warm water it was fine!</li>
            <li> The color is a whole lot lighter than I thought it would be.  It reminds me more of a coral color.  Boo!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color. I&#x27;m giving it a four because the reddish color in the photo is inaccurate - in actuality the color is very pink.</li>
            <li> Buying nail polish is tough on the computer.  The color it appears on the screen is a lot lighter in person.  Not a fan of this color.</li>
            <li> Summer is right around the corner and this is a must have color to go with your wardrobe.  I have used this product / color for two summers and now will continue to use it in the gel.  Its a bright happy color without being too flashy and the great thing is it&#x27;s OPI .</li>
            <li> The color and consistency is exactly what I wanted. It&#x27;s a true OPI product and would def recommend this seller!</li>
            <li> This polish is true to its color shown. OPI Gelish polish is great to work with. If you have not had a lot of experience working with Gelish polish I would recommend OPI it&#x27;s very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color. Goes with so much. Doesn&#x27;t stay on as well as I&#x27;d like for it to. I have to fix a nail or two each day between manicures.</li>
            <li> complete waste of money</li>
            <li> I Love this color, a beautiful pink, a great summer color! Truly lasts weeks after cured with uv light! Enjoy</li>
            <li> Love the color of this polish. Great summer polish that is bright and makes your nails look great. Would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I love soak off gels. I&#x27;m so glad to find this as now I can enjoy my manicures for over a week! This color is a great pink cream color. It goes on very nicely and is opaque in 2 thin coats. My only complaint is that this color stains the nail once soaked off. Nothing a light buffing can&#x27;t fix but still an annoyance.</li>
            <li> Way better than sensational nails kit and the light with that kit works with these. LOVE!</li>
            <li> Arrived in good time for Christmas gifting. Person receiving was thrilled.</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I ordered, the only downfall was that the bottle had already been opened and used. There was enough to give myself a manicure I just hope it lasts as what I paid for it to!</li>
            <li> Just like in the salon. Works great with the thermal spa nail dryer. Have to have the alcohol to clean the sticky off after they dry though</li>
