            <li> This is a spectacular bubble bath. The bubbles came out to just the right amount. My legs felt so silky smooth after. The scent is delicious and not overpowering.

            <li> You know the smell of cheap eggnog?  That medicinal/alcohol scent?  That&#x27;s what this smells of.  Medicinal/alcohol with a very slight hint of vanilla.  Fantastic bubbles though.</li>
            <li> Makes good bubbles, smell of play-doh is overpowering.</li>
            <li> This bubble bath liquid gives me bubbles. The kind I had bought from Bath and Bodyworks (for about the same cost) did not bubble. I use this as a shower gel/soap and I enjoy the feeling of being cleaned with lots of bubbles. The vanilla scent is an added plus.</li>
            <li> This is a great bubble bath. I&#x27;ve used two bottles of this already and will continue to use it. A little goes a long way, the smell is a soft vanilla, and it&#x27;s moisturizing. I can soak in my bubble bath for over 40 minutes and still have bubbles.</li>
            <li> I use this bubble bath all the time and love it. This one was a gift for my mom and she loves it too! Vanilla and Strawberries and Cream are my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s challenging to find this product in stores that are reasonably price.  Also weary of purchasing an item like this online.  Very satisfied with the fragrance.

            <li> Wife loves the product.</li>
            <li> Only takes a little to get lots of bubble&#x27;s, nice fragrance. I would purchase this again.</li>
