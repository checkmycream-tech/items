            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>They fit my hands nicely and don&#x27;t come off in my sleep</li>
            <li>Love the gloves I have been using them at night for almost a year.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more when I need them again.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Much better than the ones I bought at Walgreens.</li>
            <li>They are ok, I guess.</li>
            <li>I wear gloves for the most part of 24 hours a day.</li>
            <li>These have proven to be better made, fit better, and feel like the material used is softer and more robust.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for dry hand nightly treatment.</li>
            <li>My wife has a need for these types of gloves and has bought them at different retail locations, this was a convenient way to buy and a more economical purchase then retail, she said these were the best gloves she has ever had as for fit, quality as well as value, we will be ordering more as needed.</li>
            <li>Good quality at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Very nice, feel soft and fitvwell</li>
            <li>These are perfect because they&#x27;re soft and snug with no irritating seams anywhere.</li>
            <li>But they are just fine - maybe even a bit generous in length.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed - light weight protection for craft work &#x3D; glue and paint.  </li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t for the issues with the fit of the gloves</li>
            <li>These are great if you have hand issues such as eczema.</li>
            <li>Fingers look and feel great the next day.</li>
            <li>They are cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I found these gloves to be comfortable day or night.  </li>
            <li>Great product, would like to see a bigger size.</li>
            <li>Gloves fit snugly but comfortably.  </li>
            <li>Love these gloves, easy to put on and washed really well even with lotion on it.</li>
            <li>They also protect my hands and keep them clean.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have real large hands, but these fit me like Mickey Mouse gloves.  </li>
            <li>Not too loose so the fit is fairly snug</li>
            <li>I found that moisturizing with an ointment type skin treatment and then wearing these gloves overnight helps tremendously.  </li>
            <li>super cotton Gloves for anyone who cares for your hands.</li>
            <li>My only concern is if this seller runs out and they are no longer available then I will have a real problem with replacements with a product as good as this is.</li>
            <li>These are really good gloves to use to moisturize your dry hands.</li>
            <li>But they might want to find a different kind of moisturizing/protective glove to sell.  </li>
            <li>But they&#x27;re snug, they fit (except the extra length at the top), and they keep the lotion on its skin.</li>
            <li>I would definitely order more if they were available in XL</li>
            <li>They wear well, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>I am surprised how nice these gloves are at such a  cheap price,.</li>
            <li>The Spandex in them prevents them from stretching/loosening up and coming off your hands at night, so it&#x27;s a nice fit but not too tight and they KEEP their shape.</li>
            <li>Super fast ship.  </li>
            <li>They are very soft and comfortable and do not lose their shape.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>These gloves were exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I received these promptly and opened my first pair....</li>
            <li>One tore when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>They are not tight, which I do not like, and are light weight (100% cotton).</li>
            <li>I had bought some white gloves at Walgreens and these are much, much nicer and because they have a touch of spandex they hold their shape much better.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have large hands (glove size medium).  </li>
            <li>I put them in a mesh bag and do them with a gentle load in the washing machine.  </li>
            <li>If this really is one size fits all....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>i am a flight attendant and use these gloves when I work in the galley on the airplane.  </li>
            <li>Product works very well.  </li>
            <li>Mine have been washed numerous times and they do shrink slightly in the dryer but still fit me fine.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;ve needed to buy more is that after time they get stained and even after bleaching they don&#x27;t have that white, new look after a while, but they are still wearable.  </li>
            <li>I have worn many types of spa gloves due to sensitive hands.</li>
            <li>I love them but they don&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li>I purchased this 3 glove set because I wanted more than 1 pair of gloves that I could wear at night after putting on a heavy duty hand cream.  </li>
            <li>I am chemically sensitive, so this kind of stuff is NOT okay in my home.</li>
            <li>These will do the trick, but I am sure they won&#x27;t last too long!</li>
            <li>These gloves fit EXTREMELY snugly</li>
            <li>These gloves have a strong chemical odor that doesn&#x27;t wash out even after a long wash cycle and several rinsings.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely rate them higher.  </li>
            <li>I was in need of some cotton gloves to protect my hands from a severe eczema flare-up and first purchased 2 pair through my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>I hope they stretch a little with use because at the moment when I put them on they fit so snugly that I feel like they remove some of the lotion that I had just put on.</li>
            <li>I needed replacements for some old moisturizing gloves and thought I would give these a try.  </li>
            <li>They feel soft and luxurious and do not irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>My one real actual complaint is the smell - there is some gross, chemical smell, possibly some kind of perfume, that is POWERFUL coming off of these.</li>
            <li>These glove are thin enough to be able to count bills and are pretty durable.  </li>
            <li>Some of these types of gloves are too short but this brand are a little longer and go further over the wrist than most.</li>
            <li>I have small hands and they fit me well and seem durable.</li>
            <li>Very soft, white.</li>
            <li>I have naturally dry skin, and as a bonus I work in an environment that is hell on skin and hands in particular.  </li>
            <li>I wear two gloves on the same hand, and this way they are thick enough to enable me to take meals out of the ovens without burning my hand, with better dexterity than bulky potholders.  </li>
            <li>I was a little worried that they wouldn&#x27;t fit after reading some of the reviews because I have VERY long fingers.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them for anyone with dry skin on their hands.  </li>
            <li>The material is pretty thin and the seams were not very stable, but it is cheap and is what it says it is.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t matter how much lotion or other moisturizing potions I used, they would crack and bleed every day.  </li>
            <li>Because  one glove fits either hand, and has spandex with the cotton, they are very flexible and do not conduct the heat, unless they get wet!  </li>
            <li>I would say I have medium sized hands (not long fingers though)</li>

            <li> I would highly recommend them for anyone with dry skin on their hands.  </li>
            <li> The material is pretty thin and the seams were not very stable, but it is cheap and is what it says it is.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t matter how much lotion or other moisturizing potions I used, they would crack and bleed every day.  </li>
            <li> Because  one glove fits either hand, and has spandex with the cotton, they are very flexible and do not conduct the heat, unless they get wet!  </li>

            <li> Too short at the wrist and too loose in the fingers.  </li>
            <li> These are definitely made to allow for either very long fingernails or very long fingers - neither of which I have.</li>
            <li> several of the other reviews here, my one real complaint is the fit.  </li>
            <li> I am hard on the gloves I wear, and these are holding up very well.</li>

            <li> These do not fit my average male hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of cotton gloves in the past which didn&#x27;t stand up well to wear and laundering, even in a rotation with several other pairs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, they keep falling off during the night, so are pretty useless for what I need.</li>
            <li> A bit too small, and I don&#x27;t have very big hands, so I would not recommend them.</li>
            <li> They are really tight on the knuckles and are loose everywhere else.</li>

            <li> (I use them to super moisturize my hands at night with the O&#x27;Keeffes working hands cream in the winter because my hands always crack and are painful as soon as the temperature drops).</li>
            <li> I would have given them 5 stars, but there is a little chemical odor that I imagine will dissipate in the air or after washing.</li>
            <li> A little hand lotion and these gloves</li>
            <li> after wearing them for a few hours, I took them off and noticed a seam began to split .  </li>
            <li> Waste of time and money for males.</li>
            <li> Just leave the perfume off - they&#x27;re plain cotton gloves, for goodness sake.</li>
            <li> They are thin, the fingers are excessively long for a medium.  </li>
            <li> and I woke up without them on and had scratched my hands raw during the night.</li>
            <li> Usually I dont have time to write these reviews anymore</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The material is pretty thin and the seams were not very stable, but it is cheap and is what it says it is.</li>
            <li> Usually I dont have time to write these reviews anymore but i use these gloves with med on hands at night and for anyone with eczema these are the best I&#x27;ve ever purchased. The Spandex in them prevents them from stretching/loosening up and coming off your hands at night, so it&#x27;s a nice fit but not too tight and they KEEP their shape. If you have small to medium size hands; you do have to pull the extra material at the fingertips down but once you do that it stays down and not a big deal. Some of these types of gloves are too short but this brand are a little longer and go further over the wrist than most. Plus you can work with them on without all that extra material and looseness.</li>
            <li> These work well. I bought 2 three-packs so I don&#x27;t have to wash them every day.  I put them in a mesh bag and do them with a gentle load in the washing machine.  I have small hands and they fit me well and seem durable. There is enough fabric to cover the wrists so they don&#x27;t come off by themselves.  One had a tiny rip in a seam but it didn&#x27;t affect the function.</li>
            <li> These are great for moisturizing</li>
            <li> Good cotton gloves, great shipping++</li>
            <li> Just what I needed - light weight protection for craft work &#x3D; glue and paint.  Also I keep some by my bed to use to apply capsacian  cream to arthritic joints - that stuff can burn if left on hands.  This big box should last for years.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dry skin, and as a bonus I work in an environment that is hell on skin and hands in particular.  Chemicals, dust, nasty water...the works.  Anyway my hands were wrecked.  It didn&#x27;t matter how much lotion or other moisturizing potions I used, they would crack and bleed every day.  My wife recommended I try one of these overnight glove sets.  And they do work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like several of the other reviews here, my one real complaint is the fit.  I don&#x27;t have real large hands, but these fit me like Mickey Mouse gloves.  Too short at the wrist and too loose in the fingers.  More than once I&#x27;ve woken up with them riding halfway up my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that they do work as advertised.  The condition of my hands has improved to the point of roughly 220 grit sandpaper compared to the 80 grit they used to be.  My hands also are not constantly in pain any more either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it wasn&#x27;t for the issues with the fit of the gloves I would definitely rate them higher.  If you have medium to small hands this probably won&#x27;t be an issue.</li>
            <li> These are great if you have hand issues such as eczema. I sleep with them on with no problem. I put on my favorite shea butter and cover my hands with the gloves and sleep all night without any problems. Fingers look and feel great the next day. Continue to moisturize throughout the day for comfort and use these gloves to help minimize the pain from eczema &amp; psoriasis. Its a routine with me and use them every night. Also use them at work while typing after applying the shea butter to help the pain of tender skin. The product is greasy and I don&#x27;t want to get my keyboard or mouse icky.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price, quality is good enough. Not too loose so the fit is fairly snug, I&#x27;ve used them many times and still have two spare pairs for when I need them.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these gloves. I was in need of some cotton gloves to protect my hands from a severe eczema flare-up and first purchased 2 pair through my local pharmacy. They were awful- stretched terribly and literally fell off my hands. They definitely did not stay at night and I woke up without them on and had scratched my hands raw during the night. Then I ordered these. They are very soft and comfortable and do not lose their shape. I would say I have medium sized hands (not long fingers though) and they fit wonderfully. I only wish they made them in other colors so I don&#x27;t always have to be in white (I have to wear them during the day as well). Plus, since I am constantly putting different creams and lotions on (and wearing them all day!) the dirt shows up very easily on the gloves. They are thin, but not cheap. I have not have any problems with wholes developing yet (I&#x27;ve had them about 3 weeks and have washed them several times). I can still mostly use my cell phone while wearing them. Overall very happy and am thinking about purchasing another 3 pairs.</li>
            <li> The gloves fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when my eczema is flaring, I need gloves over the medicine &amp; lotion. These are perfect because they&#x27;re soft and snug with no irritating seams anywhere.</li>
            <li> These gloves are tonight and too thin.</li>
            <li> I love them but they don&#x27;t last that long.I get one winter out of a pair. That&#x27;s about all I want. It&#x27;s hard to wash out petroleum jelly. I discard them in the spring.</li>
            <li> These gloves were exactly as advertised. I needed some help for dry cuticles, and after a few nights, my cuticles were softer and healthier.</li>
            <li> Product review: Product sucks.  Fingers way too short and tight, body of glove way too loose and floppy.  Seams irritated me.  Seller Review: 3 stars.  Super fast ship.  I like that.  But they might want to find a different kind of moisturizing/protective glove to sell.  Cuz these are awful.  If this really is one size fits all.... they must be talking about a race of gnomes or something.</li>
            <li> I purchased this 3 glove set because I wanted more than 1 pair of gloves that I could wear at night after putting on a heavy duty hand cream.  These gloves fit EXTREMELY snugly and I don&#x27;t have large hands (glove size medium).  I hope they stretch a little with use because at the moment when I put them on they fit so snugly that I feel like they remove some of the lotion that I had just put on.</li>
            <li> Use them every night!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my dad w/o had rough cracked fingers and hands. He uses them every night and tells me that the gloves are amazing.</li>
            <li> My son has a very bad problem with dry skin on his hands, which if left untreated results in bad skin splits.  I found that moisturizing with an ointment type skin treatment and then wearing these gloves overnight helps tremendously.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands of cotton gloves in the past which didn&#x27;t stand up well to wear and laundering, even in a rotation with several other pairs.  These have proven to be better made, fit better, and feel like the material used is softer and more robust.  I would highly recommend them for anyone with dry skin on their hands.  The price from the seller was also very fair.  My only concern is if this seller runs out and they are no longer available then I will have a real problem with replacements with a product as good as this is.</li>
            <li> These gloves are so soothing to your hands. I have eczema and I wear these every night.  When I wake up in the morning my hands dont burn or itch anymore.</li>
            <li> Love these.  Good quality at a reasonable price.  I have a skin condition on my hands so have to wear gloves a lot &amp; every night wear them over a greasy salve.  Needless to say I need a number of pairs.  This will be my go to order.</li>
            <li> I received these promptly and opened my first pair....after wearing them for a few hours, I took them off and noticed a seam began to split .  They are thin, the fingers are excessively long for a medium.  These will do the trick, but I am sure they won&#x27;t last too long!</li>
            <li> These do not fit my average male hands. Guess im back to using socks. Waste of time and money for males.</li>
            <li> I needed replacements for some old moisturizing gloves and thought I would give these a try.  I was a little worried that they wouldn&#x27;t fit after reading some of the reviews because I have VERY long fingers.  But they are just fine - maybe even a bit generous in length. I would have given them 5 stars, but there is a little chemical odor that I imagine will dissipate in the air or after washing.</li>
            <li> Theses work well for what they are intended to do. I also use them to line rubber gloves as I have a latex allergy.</li>
            <li> Keep their shape very good fit</li>
            <li> Very comfortable gloves; sturdy and washable.  Very fast shipping.  Hold moisturizer all night.  I have large hands, and these fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry hand nightly treatment. A little hand lotion and these gloves and you are set for the night.</li>
            <li> These are really good gloves to use to moisturize your dry hands. I have really bad eczema on both of my hands and was desperate for affordable gloves to use since I use them every single day. I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> I would buy these again! They fit my hands nicely and don&#x27;t come off in my sleep (I use them to super moisturize my hands at night with the O&#x27;Keeffes working hands cream in the winter because my hands always crack and are painful as soon as the temperature drops). They also wash nicely &amp; retain their shape. No cracks yet! I am very happy.</li>
            <li> Gloves good value, they fit my need for helping keep moisturizing lotion on my hand overnite. I have machine washed several times and no shrinking.</li>
            <li> They are cheaply made. I would not recommend to anyone. One tore when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> These are definitely made to allow for either very long fingernails or very long fingers - neither of which I have. But they&#x27;re snug, they fit (except the extra length at the top), and they keep the lotion on its skin. My one real actual complaint is the smell - there is some gross, chemical smell, possibly some kind of perfume, that is POWERFUL coming off of these. I had to wash them in vinegar before I could even touch them. I am chemically sensitive, so this kind of stuff is NOT okay in my home. Just leave the perfume off - they&#x27;re plain cotton gloves, for goodness sake. They don;t need to smell like they were soaked in fake disgusting chemicals.</li>
            <li> Love the gloves I have been using them at night for almost a year. They are not tight, which I do not like, and are light weight (100% cotton). I will be ordering more when I need them again.</li>
            <li> Love these. Much better than the ones I bought at Walgreens. The addition of spandex helps keep the gloves on at night.</li>
            <li> Love these gloves, easy to put on and washed really well even with lotion on it. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to purchase these gloves to sleep in, to keep my hands soft.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, they keep falling off during the night, so are pretty useless for what I need.</li>
            <li> They are ok, I guess. A bit too small, and I don&#x27;t have very big hands, so I would not recommend them.</li>
            <li> My mom loves these for her very dry hands! She puts on lotion then these at night. She says they are the best she has had!</li>
            <li> These gloves have a strong chemical odor that doesn&#x27;t wash out even after a long wash cycle and several rinsings.  I don&#x27;t know what is in the fabric, however I&#x27;m afraid to breathe the fumes or have the chemical leech into my skin along with my lotion. Too bad, as they fit well!</li>
            <li> I work as a bank teller and I am allergic to the ink in the bills. These glove are thin enough to be able to count bills and are pretty durable.  Wish they came in black because money is so dirty and after a month I have to toss them. They can be washed but not bleached otherwise the will start fall apart.</li>
            <li> These fit great and feel good.</li>
            <li> I bought this pack for my husband and I because our poor hands were so cracked. They are really tight on the knuckles and are loose everywhere else. I have tiny fingers (size 4.5 wedding ring). Really disappointed and ended up throwing them away.</li>
            <li> Not perfect but did protect my creamed hands at night when I slept.</li>
            <li> exellent!!! super cotton Gloves for anyone who cares for your hands. Very soft, white. I recommend. Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought it for my mom. she has problems with skin, so she has to keep them dry all the time. Mom uses it under rubber gloves while household duties and they are very comfortable...</li>
            <li> I have worn many types of spa gloves due to sensitive hands. I wear gloves for the most part of 24 hours a day. I found these gloves to be comfortable day or night.  They breath, and though a bit snug the first time, they fit my hands perfectly after washing and wearing again.  They did not become loose or fall apart like other gloves I have had.  I am hard on the gloves I wear, and these are holding up very well. They even have room for you gals that have long finger nails! lol</li>
            <li> Works great, feels great and washes well. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> The items came quickly and the gloves work great for my wife. Her hands have been helped tremendously by using gloves and these are a good quality at a good price.</li>
            <li> I have bought quite a few of these to wear when my hands are chapped due to psoriasis.  They feel soft and luxurious and do not irritate my skin at all.  Although they say that they are moisturizing, there is no lotion or oil in these.  The moisturizing comes from the gloves holding in whatever cream or lotion you put on your hands.  The fabric is breathable and holds up well.  Mine have been washed numerous times and they do shrink slightly in the dryer but still fit me fine.  The only reason I&#x27;ve needed to buy more is that after time they get stained and even after bleaching they don&#x27;t have that white, new look after a while, but they are still wearable.  I had bought some white gloves at Walgreens and these are much, much nicer and because they have a touch of spandex they hold their shape much better.</li>
            <li> Fair for the price. Was a stocking stuffer for my girls&#x27; dey hands</li>
            <li> Their great, just what I needed</li>
            <li> i am a flight attendant and use these gloves when I work in the galley on the airplane.  I wear two gloves on the same hand, and this way they are thick enough to enable me to take meals out of the ovens without burning my hand, with better dexterity than bulky potholders.  Because  one glove fits either hand, and has spandex with the cotton, they are very flexible and do not conduct the heat, unless they get wet!  They also protect my hands and keep them clean.  They wear well, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Arrived as scheduled. Great product, would like to see a bigger size. I would definitely order more if they were available in XL</li>
            <li> great deal and very nice fitting gloves</li>
            <li> Gloves fit snugly but comfortably.  Great for those trying to heal dermatitis of hands where lotions might otherwise get onto bedding.</li>
            <li> I am surprised how nice these gloves are at such a  cheap price,.</li>
            <li> Perfect length and fit. These contour to my hands perfectly. Stretchy without being loose. Would buy these again without hesitation!</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I was looking for.  I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere.  They were what I wanted at the perfect price.</li>
            <li> My wife has a need for these types of gloves and has bought them at different retail locations, this was a convenient way to buy and a more economical purchase then retail, she said these were the best gloves she has ever had as for fit, quality as well as value, we will be ordering more as needed.</li>
            <li> Very nice, feel soft and fitvwell</li>
            <li> Prefect for why I need them. Eczema on my hands. I can cut out the finger tips, and the fingers are long enough for my eczema on my fingers. I can still feel and grab things. Hand or machine wash. good item.</li>
            <li> Product works very well.  Is exactly what I wanted.  The gloves are holding up well.  I would order them again.</li>
            <li> Use these at night with psoriasis medication.</li>
