            <li>So believe all the good reviews.</li>

            <li>I accidentally stumbled over this when I was searching for ingredients to make my own soap here on amazon.  </li>
            <li>I chose this size because it fits nicely into my travel soap container which I use when we RV and camp.  </li>
            <li>If that’s not an option try sealing it in a plastic bag and then warm it up in warm water or with a heating pad.  </li>
            <li>If that’s not an option try sealing it in a plastic bag and then warm it up in warm water or with a heating pad.  </li>
            <li>soap is just as I have come to expect for this kind.  </li>
            <li>I must use a wash cloth because if I try to use the soap on its own I get scratches on my body.  </li>
            <li>The smell is kind of neutral and looks handmade.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and packing excellent.</li>
            <li>I wish you guys carried the kind with hemp seed oil.</li>
            <li>I like being able to get the bulk amount because it is cheaper than what I paid at the flea market a good deal.</li>
            <li>It looked like a chunk of brown marble or a block of some exotic kind of wood.  </li>
            <li>Natural and perfect for makeup removal.</li>
            <li>raw soap produces a wonderful lather, cleans the skin squeeky clean, but leaves the skin &#x27;feeling&#x27;  wonderful.  </li>
            <li>The best product you can use on your skin to keep it healthy and clear of blemishes.</li>
            <li>The first time I purchased 1lb from the seller Nature and Herbs, and this time 5lbs from Plant Guru - both of which have been great products.  </li>
            <li>I love ABS.</li>
            <li>I love this soap because of its purity.  </li>

            <li>Mostly hormonal breakouts.</li>
            <li>Great for the whole body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>The price was better than the store in the mall</li>
            <li>I went here and the price-product ratio is so much better than the mom &#x27;n pop store or the online beauty store.  </li>

            <li>This is pretty good soap.</li>

            <li>This soap is excellent for acne and other skin problems.  </li>
            <li>, it’s an infrequent nuisance, easily removed, by scratching it off while using the soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it arrived sealed well and made it easy to</li>

            <li>It lathers easily.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and you can&#x27;t smell anything once you rinse it.  </li>
            <li>Everything about the soap was fine.</li>
            <li>if there was slightly less with be wonderful...</li>
            <li>He had this huge 50Lb cube of soap on a table.  </li>
            <li>but they charged a huge shipping and handling rate.  </li>
            <li>it comes in a huge 5 lbs.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t come across either lye or mold, but it may happen from time to time, as the people who make it don&#x27;t have all the measuring tools, thermometers, and chemical preservatives available to us.  </li>
            <li>Every time we take a bath it is filled with sand and we are throwing away rocks.</li>
            <li>i love it this soap is powerful for the skin</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth when my shower is done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural, it feels so good.</li>
            <li>Some of the other reviews I read seems to indicate it didn&#x27;t smell very good.  </li>
            <li>I received a very fresh batch.  </li>
            <li>I bought it originally thinking I would use it just for washing my oily face, but have ended up using it all over.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>After learning about this soap I was excited to get.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that iron screws are NOT part of the formula for this product.</li>
            <li>It gets me squeaky clean</li>
            <li>A cut bar of this goes very quickly, but worth it on the skin.</li>
            <li>It makes you feel so clean.  </li>
            <li>Leaves you r skin feeling really clean without drying out.</li>
            <li>It leaves your body feeling clean without drying your skin out.</li>
            <li>when you use soap it leaves you clean no residue.</li>
            <li>It smells clean, yet is not scented.  </li>
            <li>I use it on all of my body and feel thoroughly clean.  </li>
            <li>I feel so clean.</li>
            <li>; that is molded into a perfect bar that is literally tar black, but a soft, marbled&lt;br /&gt;dark and light brown soap that lathers beautifully and takes well to essential oils being added,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>There is no other soap like this soap, it&#x27;s more than just another soap, it also has many medicinal purposes.</li>
            <li>She was a part time artisan soap maker and a full time professor of Chemistry at Virginia Tech.  </li>
            <li>I just love this soap too much for that.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really attest to the &amp;#34;curing&amp;#34; properties, but we do love using it.</li>
            <li>and I was buying this soap from a lady that was selling sandwhich bags full for 20 dollars,</li>
            <li>Okay so I thought I went through soap quickly, but 5 lbs is a lot of soap, haha.  </li>
            <li>also it didn&#x27;t dissolve as easily as the first one too.</li>
            <li>The 5lbs was PLENTY to last us maybe 6 months, easily!!</li>
            <li>It helps keep your skin moisturized and helps tremendously with acne and scarring&lt;</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve started using it just once a day and using a mild cleanser during the night.</li>
            <li>It was shipped out quickly.</li>
            <li>Love the 5 pound size to make soaps with our favorite essential oils and still have some for bathing also</li>
            <li>It was soft and very easy to cut.  </li>
            <li>It was soft and very easy to cut.  </li>
            <li>I found that this seller seems to be very consistent with the product.</li>
            <li>I find black soap to be a great soap for my skin</li>
            <li>From daily use my skin is healing and becoming a more even tone</li>
            <li>This soap is absolutely worth getting clears your skin quickly</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I enjoy working with this company they stand by their word in fact, I&#x27;m getting ready to order 5 pounds for my mother.</li>
            <li>It is a fresh bar</li>
            <li>There was a piece of glass in mine, it cuts my thigh, I am glad it wasn&#x27;t my 2 years old daughter that I cut because I use it on her also.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it is the most natural soap you&#x27;ll find even when compared to castille soap.  </li>
            <li>but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Having used different manufacturer&#x27;s , I noted a nice texture and result while using this product.</li>
            <li>I love using natural products and it cleaned my hair thoroughly without drying it.</li>
            <li>Other than everyone commenting that it looks like something else in the bathroom when it&#x27;s sitting in the soap dish, everyone who has tried it has loved it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I planned to switch away from Dove soap, which I loved, but didn&#x27;t want to continue using (due to toxic chemicals in Dove</li>
            <li>Then I found it at a very large on-line beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li>Great for the price and should be used everyday!</li>
            <li>(someone mentioned a screw), but those impurities are easily eliminated by melting the soap in convenient quantities (in an old pot no longer used for food) and straining it.  </li>
            <li>Here in Los Angeles near the beach, it ain&#x27;t exactly easy to find this soap unless&lt;br /&gt;you go to the street vendors on Venice</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and clean, lathers well and rinses completely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s NOT hair, it&#x27;s incompletely burned plant fiber, most likely from coconut husks.</li>
            <li>First, why I like it:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>he first rubbed his hand on it</li>
            <li>From this last 5 pound block I just purchased, I was able to get 18 bars.  </li>
            <li>but unfortunately I never received it</li>
            <li>When I first heard of product I did not believe.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>My husband states this is the first soap he has ever used that works for his face.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more before we run out.</li>
            <li>This soap seems a bit more &amp;#34;grainy&amp;#34; than the last one I purchased.  </li>
            <li>so lather onto hand first.</li>
            <li>, this lathers WAAAY better than any commercial shampoo I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my skin, and it lathers like no soap I ever used to wash my body!</li>
            <li>There is so much sand in our batch and ROCKS!</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>i wash my face with it, my skin feels so smooth and soft</li>
            <li>;)&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>The first time i tried this soap i got it in the one pound size.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this soap from this buyer before and never had an issue, but for some reason this time it has a funny smell to it.</li>
            <li>I still love it, but it is definitely going to take me forever to finish it.  </li>
            <li>It was pretty broke up from shipping and handling but it made packaging the soap in zip lock bags easier.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s finer than the first one.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the first thing i noticed.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT, HOWEVER I ORDERED ENOUGH TO BATHE UR HOMELESS!!!  </li>
            <li>Lathers amazingly but beware if you have sensitive skin as it will dry you out quick.</li>
            <li>This is like comparing wonderful raw unprocess sea salt with the bitter refined commercial salt most people use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True</li>
            <li>Great, I only expected 1 lb of it</li>
            <li>my hair is clean but not dried out.  </li>
            <li>My face feels clean, soft &amp; my scars on my face are clearing up. .</li>
            <li>This is nice and soft, You can cut off a big bar</li>
            <li>It was a big block nicely wrapped in clear wrap when it was delivered.</li>
            <li>and I have had positive results.</li>
            <li>This black soap has been some of the best quality black soap we&#x27;ve received.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered from this seller before and was satisfied with my purchase; however, this time my soap came really dry and brittle and crumbled to prices -  </li>
            <li>It does not lather good and it has something in it that keeps scratching me leaving long red scratches.</li>
            <li>I knew it would be large, but not quite as large as it was.  </li>
            <li>I certainly did not expect it  this from what my friend had or from the pictures and reviews here on Amazon are.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really different from typical soaps but it is great.  </li>
            <li>That small effort is very worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to try this soap since I had heard so much about it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just more careful when I can see a piece that is about to surface and just pull it off.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Use this soap with caution as too much will strip too much oil from your skin.</li>
            <li>i like it very much.i</li>
            <li>This soap is the real deal.</li>
            <li>thanks for the bulk.</li>
            <li>and it really does work</li>
            <li>Summer&#x27;s coming gotta get my hair &amp; skin ready to be seen.</li>
            <li>Thanks, SmellGood..</li>
            <li>when I found out that I could buy this online for so much cheaper, that is what I have been doing.</li>
            <li>Too much charcole...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used real shampoo for months.</li>
            <li>I have been switching all of my products to as natural as possible and I absolutely love how my skin feels from using this soap.</li>
            <li>Raw African Soap, especially that imported from Ghana, is incredibly wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I just recently ordered this product and tried the Black Soap for the very first time, and I see amazing results just in within 1 day.</li>
            <li>i choose 4 stars because I love Pure  Black Soap</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have any special needs such as skin conditions.  </li>
            <li>If you have bumps around your elbows that you have been struggling to get rid of or any rough patches on your skin you will see amazing results if you use this soap religiously.  </li>
            <li>I love black soap.</li>
            <li>my husband and I both love Black Soap....</li>
            <li>I am much older.  </li>
            <li>Delivery service was really quick  plus a coupon for your next purchase was included with the product!!!</li>
            <li>That said, compare what you spend on chemically-laden soaps made in First World countries to the awesome goodness of this natural product, and even a bad batch here</li>
            <li>Very professional group!</li>
            <li>We highly recommend this company and this soap.</li>
            <li>no debris, dirt or shells...soft and high quality.</li>
            <li>I can never go back to any other kind of soap.</li>
            <li>had more air pockets throughout and was a little firmer.  </li>
            <li>I give this 2 stars because this is the second time I purchased this soap and the first batch was absolutely pure and this one is not.</li>
            <li>It is EXTREMELY drying to my skin but as long as I moisturize right after using this my face feels a lot better.</li>
            <li>It leaves me feeling really clean and my skin does not feel dry.  </li>
            <li>is squeaky clean without being too dry</li>
            <li>its black soap what more could you ask for also its exactly 5lbs as well so in short everything is as it shows now i haven&#x27;t tried it on my skin</li>
            <li>I have been using African Black Soap for many years and this is the first time I have ever had it burn my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m only using this on my face but may start using it in the shower too.</li>
            <li>Because it contains plantain peels and other organic matter, it may also mold, because no preservatives are available where it&#x27;s made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so smooth and does not have a lot of rocks like some of the other brands we&#x27;ve used have.</li>
            <li>also easily melts in a bottle to make liquid black soap.</li>
            <li>but i liked it and was glad that this time it was not all broken up  in pieces like my previous order</li>
            <li>In my desire for full disclosure, I did experience about four or five days within the first or second week of use where the skin on my hands got dry, but that ended and never happened again.  </li>
            <li>secret for making it last is that I do my best to let it dry in between uses.  </li>
            <li>I just take an old kitchen knife and cut off a block the size of my choosing and presto!  </li>
            <li>it was very sandy and it can hurt your skin if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>but I like to use a natural lotion I made myself and my skin is in heaven!</li>
            <li>Exactly what you would expect, a giant slab of soap.</li>
            <li>It leaves me clean without any  soapy residue or annoying fragrances and perfumes which is great since I wear perfume .</li>
            <li>This is purer black soap as a huge brick.</li>
            <li>If you like chemical free products, try the black soap.</li>
            <li>If you live in a very humid climate then even this may not be enough and it may remain very soft and melt somewhat between uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also my order arrived earlier then I expected don&#x27;t think order from this company right now!!</li>
            <li>Its what I use as a face wash and what I use to wash my 1.5 year old son who has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love African Black soap for shampoo and body wash.  </li>
            <li>&gt; 4 out of 5 starts because there are a large amount of tiny pebble size bits of cocoa pod or rocks..</li>
            <li>still have a large amount of this left, which I might start using for washing dishes just to get rid of it.  </li>
            <li>and it seems like the soap is helping my skin clear up.  </li>
            <li>I GET RAZOR BURN UNDER MY ARMS AND SEEMS TO HELP CLEAR IT UP.</li>
            <li>plus just a F.Y.I barely half a pinky  size is all you need to clean both your face and neck</li>
            <li>It has begun to clear my complexion and even the skin tone.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>So when he heard this was all natural and what it does he tried it as a shampoo too.</li>
            <li>I find it gets very malleable at even in the low 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  </li>
            <li>I find it gets very malleable at even in the low 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  </li>
            <li>Natural soap</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the block.  </li>
            <li>I was told that I looked 30 years old.</li>
            <li>Too much coal, residue left in tub, and irritates skin .</li>
            <li>Cleanses well and no harsh odors or perfumes like store bought soaps.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my 15yr old for his acne and it works well.</li>
            <li>I have a mixture of 4 A/B/C hair, and this product exceeds all of the natural hair</li>
            <li>br /&gt;because of the natural emollients, vitamins, and minerals</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s it, complete transformation within 2 months of using those 3 products.</li>
            <li>My face adjusted and was no longer sensitive to it after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend this if your skin is at all sensitive.</li>
            <li>II don&#x27;t like it because it is too soft</li>
            <li>And as for the pebbles, I suggest using a wash cloth or sponge and not rub the soap directly onto your skin.</li>
            <li>This is completely unacceptable.</li>
            <li>and it lacks many of the harsh dyes/fragrances/chemicals found in traditional body washes these days.</li>
            <li>I LOVE African Black Soap!</li>
            <li>(Not sure what the substance is, looks like burnt wood mostly, and then some parts have a gritty sort of sand in it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i think this will last around 2 weeks longer than the first one (i use it daily)</li>
            <li>I truly love this soap my little girl gets so dry in the winter</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that daily use, twice a day can be a little strong for my skin</li>
            <li>This soap did take some getting used to, at first it burned and made my face very dry (cellular turn-over)</li>
            <li>I only use it for my face, minor acne (clogged pores) and it&#x27;s better than any other soap or medication I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>African black soap is fantastic stuff both for hair and skin.  </li>
            <li>I now make my own handmade soaps and now relised the black soap is really harsh and drying to the skin....</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and hair and this soap really cleans my hair, skin and keeps the oil away for a long time.</li>
            <li>Have been using this black soap since noticing my African co-workers clear, clean skin years ago.</li>
            <li>I can tell because of how soft it is and it does not last me as long as the first batch.</li>
            <li>Not very &amp;#34;black&amp;#34;  This is my first experience in buying so</li>
            <li>Not broken or dry at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure its the soap that&#x27;s clearing it up yet because I had been using some other products for 2 weeks before purchasing this soap and would also alternate between this and the other products even after receiving this soap.</li>
            <li>Its looks pricey at first but it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>I will update this review after using it for a few more weeks to see if I have noticed any other changes.</li>
            <li>and there doesn&#x27;t add up to nearly the same cost.</li>
            <li>He has it on his back and shoulders so far it is clearing up.</li>
            <li>and I have not gone back to my old soap.  </li>
            <li>really tried to like the African Black Soap, but unfortunately it seemed to be fairly &amp;#34;uncured&amp;#34;, or there was still lye in parts of the soap, because it burned my skin when I used it.  </li>
            <li>I wash my face twice a day with this, apply PCA acne cream to my typical trouble spots in the morning and PCA rejuvenating serum on top of that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Black Soap for over 4 years since December of 2010, when I purchased it for the first time from an artisan soap maker in Charleston, SC.  </li>
            <li>This is also the first time I have ever received this product sealed in a plastic bag, it has always been wrapped in paper previously.</li>
            <li>It was the first time I ordered black soap.</li>
            <li>This is authentic raw black soap.</li>
            <li>Keep it as dry as possible when not in use and it will last much longer.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry the skin out and it works for every skin condition.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>I have used African Black soap before and this is the first time this has happened.</li>
            <li>I find it almost like working with stiff clay, not difficult, in my experience.</li>
            <li>It is very soft, melts too fast, not a good quality soap and it grew a scary kind of mold.</li>

            <li> So believe all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> A soap maker I met at a crafts fair told me this was probably just a process of the soap cleaning out toxins and residues from my pores.  </li>

            <li> I accidentally stumbled over this when I was searching for ingredients to make my own soap here on amazon.  </li>
            <li> I chose this size because it fits nicely into my travel soap container which I use when we RV and camp.  </li>
            <li> If that’s not an option try sealing it in a plastic bag and then warm it up in warm water or with a heating pad.  </li>
            <li> If that’s not an option try sealing it in a plastic bag and then warm it up in warm water or with a heating pad.  </li>
            <li> soap is just as I have come to expect for this kind.  </li>
            <li> I must use a wash cloth because if I try to use the soap on its own I get scratches on my body.  </li>
            <li> The smell is kind of neutral and looks handmade.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and packing excellent.</li>
            <li> I wish you guys carried the kind with hemp seed oil.</li>
            <li> I like being able to get the bulk amount because it is cheaper than what I paid at the flea market a good deal.</li>
            <li> It looked like a chunk of brown marble or a block of some exotic kind of wood.  </li>
            <li> Natural and perfect for makeup removal.</li>
            <li> raw soap produces a wonderful lather, cleans the skin squeeky clean, but leaves the skin &#x27;feeling&#x27;  wonderful.  </li>
            <li> The best product you can use on your skin to keep it healthy and clear of blemishes.</li>
            <li> The first time I purchased 1lb from the seller Nature and Herbs, and this time 5lbs from Plant Guru - both of which have been great products.  </li>
            <li> I love ABS.</li>

            <li> Mostly hormonal breakouts.</li>
            <li> Great for the whole body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> The price was better than the store in the mall</li>
            <li> I went here and the price-product ratio is so much better than the mom &#x27;n pop store or the online beauty store.  </li>

            <li> if there was slightly less with be wonderful...</li>
            <li> He had this huge 50Lb cube of soap on a table.  </li>
            <li> but they charged a huge shipping and handling rate.  </li>
            <li> it comes in a huge 5 lbs.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t come across either lye or mold, but it may happen from time to time, as the people who make it don&#x27;t have all the measuring tools, thermometers, and chemical preservatives available to us.  </li>
            <li> Every time we take a bath it is filled with sand and we are throwing away rocks.</li>
            <li> i love it this soap is powerful for the skin</li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth when my shower is done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural, it feels so good.</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviews I read seems to indicate it didn&#x27;t smell very good.  </li>
            <li> I received a very fresh batch.  </li>
            <li> I bought it originally thinking I would use it just for washing my oily face, but have ended up using it all over.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> After learning about this soap I was excited to get.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that iron screws are NOT part of the formula for this product.</li>
            <li> It gets me squeaky clean</li>
            <li> A cut bar of this goes very quickly, but worth it on the skin.</li>
            <li> It makes you feel so clean.  </li>
            <li> Leaves you r skin feeling really clean without drying out.</li>
            <li> It leaves your body feeling clean without drying your skin out.</li>
            <li> when you use soap it leaves you clean no residue.</li>
            <li> It smells clean, yet is not scented.  </li>
            <li> I use it on all of my body and feel thoroughly clean.  </li>
            <li> I feel so clean.</li>
            <li> ; that is molded into a perfect bar that is literally tar black, but a soft, marbled&lt;br /&gt;dark and light brown soap that lathers beautifully and takes well to essential oils being added,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> There is no other soap like this soap, it&#x27;s more than just another soap, it also has many medicinal purposes.</li>
            <li> She was a part time artisan soap maker and a full time professor of Chemistry at Virginia Tech.  </li>
            <li> I just love this soap too much for that.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really attest to the &amp;#34;curing&amp;#34; properties, but we do love using it.</li>
            <li> and I was buying this soap from a lady that was selling sandwhich bags full for 20 dollars,</li>
            <li> Okay so I thought I went through soap quickly, but 5 lbs is a lot of soap, haha.  </li>
            <li> also it didn&#x27;t dissolve as easily as the first one too.</li>
            <li> The 5lbs was PLENTY to last us maybe 6 months, easily!!</li>
            <li> It helps keep your skin moisturized and helps tremendously with acne and scarring&lt;</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve started using it just once a day and using a mild cleanser during the night.</li>
            <li> It was shipped out quickly.</li>
            <li> Love the 5 pound size to make soaps with our favorite essential oils and still have some for bathing also</li>
            <li> It was soft and very easy to cut.  </li>
            <li> It was soft and very easy to cut.  </li>
            <li> I found that this seller seems to be very consistent with the product.</li>
            <li> I find black soap to be a great soap for my skin</li>
            <li> From daily use my skin is healing and becoming a more even tone</li>
            <li> This soap is absolutely worth getting clears your skin quickly</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I enjoy working with this company they stand by their word in fact, I&#x27;m getting ready to order 5 pounds for my mother.</li>
            <li> It is a fresh bar</li>
            <li> There was a piece of glass in mine, it cuts my thigh, I am glad it wasn&#x27;t my 2 years old daughter that I cut because I use it on her also.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it is the most natural soap you&#x27;ll find even when compared to castille soap.  </li>
            <li> but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Having used different manufacturer&#x27;s , I noted a nice texture and result while using this product.</li>
            <li> I love using natural products and it cleaned my hair thoroughly without drying it.</li>
            <li> Other than everyone commenting that it looks like something else in the bathroom when it&#x27;s sitting in the soap dish, everyone who has tried it has loved it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I planned to switch away from Dove soap, which I loved, but didn&#x27;t want to continue using (due to toxic chemicals in Dove</li>
            <li> Then I found it at a very large on-line beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li> Great for the price and should be used everyday!</li>
            <li> (someone mentioned a screw), but those impurities are easily eliminated by melting the soap in convenient quantities (in an old pot no longer used for food) and straining it.  </li>
            <li> Here in Los Angeles near the beach, it ain&#x27;t exactly easy to find this soap unless&lt;br /&gt;you go to the street vendors on Venice</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and clean, lathers well and rinses completely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s NOT hair, it&#x27;s incompletely burned plant fiber, most likely from coconut husks.</li>
            <li> First, why I like it:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> he first rubbed his hand on it</li>
            <li> From this last 5 pound block I just purchased, I was able to get 18 bars.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately I never received it</li>
            <li> When I first heard of product I did not believe.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> My husband states this is the first soap he has ever used that works for his face.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more before we run out.</li>
            <li> This soap seems a bit more &amp;#34;grainy&amp;#34; than the last one I purchased.  </li>
            <li> so lather onto hand first.</li>
            <li> , this lathers WAAAY better than any commercial shampoo I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my skin, and it lathers like no soap I ever used to wash my body!</li>
            <li> There is so much sand in our batch and ROCKS!</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> i wash my face with it, my skin feels so smooth and soft</li>
            <li> ;)&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> The first time i tried this soap i got it in the one pound size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this soap from this buyer before and never had an issue, but for some reason this time it has a funny smell to it.</li>
            <li> I still love it, but it is definitely going to take me forever to finish it.  </li>
            <li> It was pretty broke up from shipping and handling but it made packaging the soap in zip lock bags easier.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s finer than the first one.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the first thing i noticed.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT, HOWEVER I ORDERED ENOUGH TO BATHE UR HOMELESS!!!  </li>
            <li> Lathers amazingly but beware if you have sensitive skin as it will dry you out quick.</li>
            <li> This is like comparing wonderful raw unprocess sea salt with the bitter refined commercial salt most people use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True</li>
            <li> Great, I only expected 1 lb of it</li>
            <li> my hair is clean but not dried out.  </li>
            <li> My face feels clean, soft &amp; my scars on my face are clearing up. .</li>
            <li> This is nice and soft, You can cut off a big bar</li>
            <li> It was a big block nicely wrapped in clear wrap when it was delivered.</li>
            <li> and I have had positive results.</li>
            <li> This black soap has been some of the best quality black soap we&#x27;ve received.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered from this seller before and was satisfied with my purchase; however, this time my soap came really dry and brittle and crumbled to prices -  </li>
            <li> It does not lather good and it has something in it that keeps scratching me leaving long red scratches.</li>
            <li> I knew it would be large, but not quite as large as it was.  </li>
            <li> I certainly did not expect it  this from what my friend had or from the pictures and reviews here on Amazon are.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really different from typical soaps but it is great.  </li>
            <li> That small effort is very worthwhile.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to try this soap since I had heard so much about it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just more careful when I can see a piece that is about to surface and just pull it off.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Use this soap with caution as too much will strip too much oil from your skin.</li>
            <li> i like it very much.i</li>
            <li> This soap is the real deal.</li>
            <li> thanks for the bulk.</li>
            <li> and it really does work</li>
            <li> Summer&#x27;s coming gotta get my hair &amp; skin ready to be seen.</li>
            <li> Thanks, SmellGood..</li>
            <li> when I found out that I could buy this online for so much cheaper, that is what I have been doing.</li>
            <li> Too much charcole...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used real shampoo for months.</li>
            <li> I have been switching all of my products to as natural as possible and I absolutely love how my skin feels from using this soap.</li>
            <li> Raw African Soap, especially that imported from Ghana, is incredibly wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I just recently ordered this product and tried the Black Soap for the very first time, and I see amazing results just in within 1 day.</li>
            <li> i choose 4 stars because I love Pure  Black Soap</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have any special needs such as skin conditions.  </li>
            <li> If you have bumps around your elbows that you have been struggling to get rid of or any rough patches on your skin you will see amazing results if you use this soap religiously.  </li>
            <li> I love black soap.</li>
            <li> my husband and I both love Black Soap....</li>
            <li> I am much older.  </li>
            <li> Delivery service was really quick  plus a coupon for your next purchase was included with the product!!!</li>
            <li> That said, compare what you spend on chemically-laden soaps made in First World countries to the awesome goodness of this natural product, and even a bad batch here</li>
            <li> Very professional group!</li>
            <li> We highly recommend this company and this soap.</li>
            <li> no debris, dirt or shells...soft and high quality.</li>
            <li> I can never go back to any other kind of soap.</li>
            <li> had more air pockets throughout and was a little firmer.  </li>
            <li> I give this 2 stars because this is the second time I purchased this soap and the first batch was absolutely pure and this one is not.</li>
            <li> It is EXTREMELY drying to my skin but as long as I moisturize right after using this my face feels a lot better.</li>
            <li> It leaves me feeling really clean and my skin does not feel dry.  </li>
            <li> is squeaky clean without being too dry</li>
            <li> its black soap what more could you ask for also its exactly 5lbs as well so in short everything is as it shows now i haven&#x27;t tried it on my skin</li>
            <li> I have been using African Black Soap for many years and this is the first time I have ever had it burn my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m only using this on my face but may start using it in the shower too.</li>
            <li> Because it contains plantain peels and other organic matter, it may also mold, because no preservatives are available where it&#x27;s made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so smooth and does not have a lot of rocks like some of the other brands we&#x27;ve used have.</li>
            <li> also easily melts in a bottle to make liquid black soap.</li>
            <li> but i liked it and was glad that this time it was not all broken up  in pieces like my previous order</li>
            <li> In my desire for full disclosure, I did experience about four or five days within the first or second week of use where the skin on my hands got dry, but that ended and never happened again.  </li>
            <li> secret for making it last is that I do my best to let it dry in between uses.  </li>
            <li> I just take an old kitchen knife and cut off a block the size of my choosing and presto!  </li>
            <li> it was very sandy and it can hurt your skin if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> but I like to use a natural lotion I made myself and my skin is in heaven!</li>
            <li> Exactly what you would expect, a giant slab of soap.</li>
            <li> It leaves me clean without any  soapy residue or annoying fragrances and perfumes which is great since I wear perfume .</li>
            <li> This is purer black soap as a huge brick.</li>
            <li> If you like chemical free products, try the black soap.</li>
            <li> If you live in a very humid climate then even this may not be enough and it may remain very soft and melt somewhat between uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also my order arrived earlier then I expected don&#x27;t think order from this company right now!!</li>
            <li> Its what I use as a face wash and what I use to wash my 1.5 year old son who has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love African Black soap for shampoo and body wash.  </li>
            <li> &gt; 4 out of 5 starts because there are a large amount of tiny pebble size bits of cocoa pod or rocks..</li>
            <li> still have a large amount of this left, which I might start using for washing dishes just to get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> and it seems like the soap is helping my skin clear up.  </li>
            <li> I GET RAZOR BURN UNDER MY ARMS AND SEEMS TO HELP CLEAR IT UP.</li>
            <li> plus just a F.Y.I barely half a pinky  size is all you need to clean both your face and neck</li>
            <li> It has begun to clear my complexion and even the skin tone.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> So when he heard this was all natural and what it does he tried it as a shampoo too.</li>
            <li> I find it gets very malleable at even in the low 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  </li>
            <li> I find it gets very malleable at even in the low 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  </li>
            <li> Natural soap</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the block.  </li>
            <li> I was told that I looked 30 years old.</li>
            <li> Too much coal, residue left in tub, and irritates skin .</li>
            <li> Cleanses well and no harsh odors or perfumes like store bought soaps.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my 15yr old for his acne and it works well.</li>
            <li> I have a mixture of 4 A/B/C hair, and this product exceeds all of the natural hair</li>
            <li> br /&gt;because of the natural emollients, vitamins, and minerals</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s it, complete transformation within 2 months of using those 3 products.</li>
            <li> My face adjusted and was no longer sensitive to it after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend this if your skin is at all sensitive.</li>
            <li> II don&#x27;t like it because it is too soft</li>
            <li> And as for the pebbles, I suggest using a wash cloth or sponge and not rub the soap directly onto your skin.</li>
            <li> This is completely unacceptable.</li>
            <li> and it lacks many of the harsh dyes/fragrances/chemicals found in traditional body washes these days.</li>
            <li> I LOVE African Black Soap!</li>
            <li> (Not sure what the substance is, looks like burnt wood mostly, and then some parts have a gritty sort of sand in it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i think this will last around 2 weeks longer than the first one (i use it daily)</li>
            <li> I truly love this soap my little girl gets so dry in the winter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that daily use, twice a day can be a little strong for my skin</li>
            <li> This soap did take some getting used to, at first it burned and made my face very dry (cellular turn-over)</li>
            <li> I only use it for my face, minor acne (clogged pores) and it&#x27;s better than any other soap or medication I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> African black soap is fantastic stuff both for hair and skin.  </li>
            <li> I now make my own handmade soaps and now relised the black soap is really harsh and drying to the skin....</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and hair and this soap really cleans my hair, skin and keeps the oil away for a long time.</li>
            <li> Have been using this black soap since noticing my African co-workers clear, clean skin years ago.</li>
            <li> I can tell because of how soft it is and it does not last me as long as the first batch.</li>
            <li> Not very &amp;#34;black&amp;#34;  This is my first experience in buying so</li>
            <li> Not broken or dry at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sure its the soap that&#x27;s clearing it up yet because I had been using some other products for 2 weeks before purchasing this soap and would also alternate between this and the other products even after receiving this soap.</li>
            <li> Its looks pricey at first but it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I will update this review after using it for a few more weeks to see if I have noticed any other changes.</li>
            <li> and there doesn&#x27;t add up to nearly the same cost.</li>
            <li> He has it on his back and shoulders so far it is clearing up.</li>
            <li> and I have not gone back to my old soap.  </li>
            <li> really tried to like the African Black Soap, but unfortunately it seemed to be fairly &amp;#34;uncured&amp;#34;, or there was still lye in parts of the soap, because it burned my skin when I used it.  </li>
            <li> I wash my face twice a day with this, apply PCA acne cream to my typical trouble spots in the morning and PCA rejuvenating serum on top of that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Black Soap for over 4 years since December of 2010, when I purchased it for the first time from an artisan soap maker in Charleston, SC.  </li>
            <li> This is also the first time I have ever received this product sealed in a plastic bag, it has always been wrapped in paper previously.</li>
            <li> It was the first time I ordered black soap.</li>
            <li> This is authentic raw black soap.</li>
            <li> Keep it as dry as possible when not in use and it will last much longer.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry the skin out and it works for every skin condition.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I have used African Black soap before and this is the first time this has happened.</li>
            <li> I find it almost like working with stiff clay, not difficult, in my experience.</li>
            <li> It is very soft, melts too fast, not a good quality soap and it grew a scary kind of mold.</li>
            <li> Cleans like no other soap, all natural African Black soap</li>
            <li> A little of this soap goes a long way, so if used properly it works very well.</li>
            <li> a wash cloth or lighly rub the raw soap on your skin directly and &#x27;feel&#x27; the natural ingredients at work.  </li>
            <li> Now, with a bigger portion, this will last long enough for me to reach my cleansing goals for my face, arms, legs and buttocks.  </li>
            <li> My skin is not incredibly sensitive but I continued to get stinging, red, burned skin in different patches after using this product.  </li>
            <li> This sort of just reiterates that this soap is RAW -- i.e. unrefined, unfiltered, unprocessed, and doesn&#x27;t exactly bother me as it was just one piece</li>
            <li> If you would like to use this soap directly on your face and body, you may want to melt it down and filter it to have a smoother consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This, by the way, is used by both me and my wife daily and it has still lasted this long!  </li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing African Black Soap after looking at multiple different brands I chose this one</li>
            <li> The soap contains the raw unprocessed oils of numberous plants and seeds and seed pods that provide your skin with natural cleansers and moisturizers with none of the stickiness left by soaps such as Dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but, this brand has irritated my skin and left it feeling so dry which is unusual for black soap; usually its use has had the opposite effects.</li>
            <li> but lately it seems to very oily.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday to keep my skin clear with out drying it out.</li>
            <li> All I had to do was wet them and stick them back together.  </li>
            <li> We have been using to wash face for a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought some of this soap last year from another seller and it was rough and abrasive.</li>
            <li> I find it almost like working with stiff clay, not difficult, in my experience.s in a poor condition when it arrives either return it and a get a new block.  </li>
            <li> The only draw back for me was the little pieces of tar that are in the soap.  </li>
            <li> However, once i used it, i no longer buy any other soup but the black soap, it makes my skin so soft and this time around i ordered the five pound size</li>
            <li> Pull what looks like hair from this product, put it in a tea strainer and pour boiling water over it to eliminate the shea butter and coconut oil, and dry it in a toaster oven.  </li>
            <li> I find setting it on a bumpy soap pad it allows it to dry out between uses.  </li>
            <li> The dry brittleness has not been a permanent condition in my case.  </li>
            <li> Our soap dish suspends it from the bottom to let it dry between uses.  </li>
            <li> Not at all dry...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry it out but cleans and takes away the oil on his face.</li>
            <li> WHEN NOT KEPT DRY.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of dry and oily skin</li>
            <li> My niece has dry skin problems and this has helped her out a lot.</li>
            <li> winter dry skin didnt show up this year.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Burn a snippet of your hair; that odor is characteristic of burned protein.  </li>
            <li> other thing is that I slice it into bars and wrap them with shrink wrap or vacuum</li>
            <li> Yes, there is grit in this soap so if your skin is thin I recommend applying it very gently</li>
            <li> I used some of the crumbles and thin slices to fill in missing areas on the block I was slicing to fill in gaps and uneven places to make my bars more evenly shaped.  </li>
            <li> I used some of the crumbles and thin slices to fill in missing areas on the block I was slicing to fill in gaps and uneven places to make my bars more evenly shaped.  </li>
            <li> Originally, we left it in a shallow dish and it never dried out but instead melted away.  </li>
            <li> My wife had a similar experience, but did not wait it out and has not used black soap since.  </li>
            <li> her skin cracks I have been using this soap for a year and a half now and cant get enough</li>
            <li> We make soap, and had some people asking for soap as they ingredients for African Black Soap cannot be duplicated in the U.S.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone looking for the real African black soap</li>
            <li> It may sting or seem to burn or dry initially if you skin has anything on it that shouldn&#x27;t be there, including dead skin.  </li>
            <li> It does tighten the skin a bit so you will need to moisturize as soon as possible if tight skin bothers you.  </li>
            <li> This is partly responsible because the soap contains small particles of the raw ingredents.  </li>
            <li> You can buy &#x27;Black African Soap&#x27; from Target and other retail stores.  </li>
            <li> Also ordered 5lbs raw black soap...super soft &amp; moist.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s allowed to sit in a wet dish it will melt away.  </li>
            <li> They are miniscule and have never really bothered me.  </li>
            <li> Would never dream of going to back to harsh shampoos with chemicals,&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product was everything I expected it to be.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> be careful not to get it into your eyes...</li>
            <li> The bubbles from this soap are soft and thick.</li>
            <li> BUT by this pick it is not pure, but adds shea butter mix..</li>
            <li> It can be drying, but if you have a teen with acne due to oily skin this works as well as all those harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> This was explained to me, by a couple of soap makers, to be residue left over from the soap making process and because we’re buying it in its raw form it has not filtered out.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended raw African soap to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good experience with black soap from this seller in the past, so I was rather disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had crappy skin due to stress and eating dairy.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using the other product except for a the spot treatment</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t discolor your bath cloth like the other &amp;#34;black soap&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether they are purchasing from a different supplier or</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first but since a friend twisted my arm to get this &amp; swore by it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like any other soap.</li>
            <li> not sure what it should actually look or be like.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER DUE</li>
            <li> I just think next time, I&#x27;ll stick with my usual carrier.</li>
            <li> Also, my advice is that if it&#x27;s in a poor condition when it arrives either return it and a get a new block.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this Raw African Black Soap.</li>
            <li> I started using Raw African Black Soap some months ago by &amp;#34;accident&amp;#34; (just happened to see it on Amazon while looking for something else).  </li>
            <li> I have ordered black soap several times in the past year and order for friends too.</li>
            <li> this product is a little rough on the skin</li>
            <li> The block I purchased from Plant Guru was a little softer but was very solid (very few air pockets), but it also contained a piece of wood (see picture).  </li>
            <li> I read some reviews of people saying it cleared their acne and some claimed it even erased dark spots.  </li>
            <li> one will probably will occasionally notice very small bits of charred bark and fibers within the soap.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this soap in very small bars at a mom &#x27;n pop shop in the mall which charged $6 for a tiny bar!</li>
            <li> Some reviews here have referred to &amp;#34;straight black hair&amp;#34; in this product.  </li>
            <li> She also thought highly of Black Soap.  </li>
            <li> , it was my dermatologist who suggested black soap.</li>
            <li> it will get worst shortly then better.</li>
            <li> stopped using shampoo and started to wash with black soap.</li>
            <li> This black soap does not melt well for rebatch.</li>
            <li> My face was a mess when I started using this.</li>
            <li> It is 5 lbs of whitish  crumbley mess.  </li>
            <li> Soap was packaged tightly in plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had the bars I’m using dry out and get quite hard and brittle.  </li>
            <li> it has helped my little girl as well as my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has little rocks that will scratch you though</li>
            <li> it was ship in little pieces not as picture on the site</li>
            <li> It is a little bit drying</li>
            <li> Ignite the dried fibers and you&#x27;ll see they do not smell like burning hair at all.  </li>
            <li> made my skin a bit firm and cleared some spots.</li>
            <li> I chopped it up into blocks and have used them for the past few weeks, but this morning I found half of a screw baked into one of the pieces.</li>
            <li> Not sure why but its been breaking my face out in little pimples.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never experienced it arriving dry and crumbly</li>
            <li> skin feeling tight and there isn&#x27;t that icky residue feeling of something still being on your&lt;br /&gt;skin</li>
            <li> (Very little goes along way).</li>
            <li> then he put a small amount of water on his palm and rubbed his hands together.  </li>
            <li> Its not the fake &amp;#34;black African</li>
            <li> This is the only soap we use, no more expensive soap that dries out our skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anybody with any trouble of the skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is just this brand of soap</li>
            <li> Do NOT rub hard with the raw bar.  </li>
            <li> For instance it was only 72 degrees Fahrenheit when I was cutting mine up.  </li>
            <li> For instance it was only 72 degrees Fahrenheit when I was cutting mine up.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S UGLINESS ( POOP)  </li>
            <li> I would recommend cutting it into bar sizes and individually wrapping them.</li>
            <li> It has those&lt;br /&gt;natural chunky bits of plantain leaves and coco pods that seriously exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li> but not good for bathing.</li>
            <li> then what I was use to having in the soap , not good.</li>
            <li> And I mean everyone!</li>
            <li> I cut them into a size approximately 3-1/2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> The pores on my face have decreased in size after a *lifetime* of over the counter chemicals that have never done anything.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy ill have to buy again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bad acne, but usually once a month I get one or two stubborn pimples that seem like they never want to go away.</li>
            <li> It lathers like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I have been cutting off bars to give to my friends as presents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lathers like crazy.  </li>
            <li> From shampoo to acne to a friends cold sore.&lt;br /&gt;Remember when using for acne...it pulls all of the bad out</li>
            <li> I had extremely bad eczema break out on my hands, that I didn&#x27;t realize but using the soap got rid of.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was just a bad batch, but I would be leery about purchasing from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> horrible, just horrible</li>
            <li> what but the soap was horrible.</li>
            <li> I have not found and nasty impurities in it,</li>
            <li> It looks horrible, but you are not going to eat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I found that this seller seems to be very consistent with the product. I love ABS. This is the only soap I use and I found that I feel cleaner with this product opposed to regular soap.</li>
            <li> Some reviews here have referred to &amp;#34;straight black hair&amp;#34; in this product.  It&#x27;s NOT hair, it&#x27;s incompletely burned plant fiber, most likely from coconut husks. Burn a snippet of your hair; that odor is characteristic of burned protein.  Pull what looks like hair from this product, put it in a tea strainer and pour boiling water over it to eliminate the shea butter and coconut oil, and dry it in a toaster oven.  Ignite the dried fibers and you&#x27;ll see they do not smell like burning hair at all.  However, buyers should know this product is made in primitive conditions and may include extraneous materials or sand (someone mentioned a screw), but those impurities are easily eliminated by melting the soap in convenient quantities (in an old pot no longer used for food) and straining it.  That small effort is very worthwhile.  African black soap is fantastic stuff both for hair and skin.  It is often sold crumbly and that does not affect its use.  If it seems to burn, put your tongue to it--if it &amp;#34;bites back,&amp;#34; it still has lye in it and should be discarded.  Because it contains plantain peels and other organic matter, it may also mold, because no preservatives are available where it&#x27;s made. I haven&#x27;t come across either lye or mold, but it may happen from time to time, as the people who make it don&#x27;t have all the measuring tools, thermometers, and chemical preservatives available to us.  That said, compare what you spend on chemically-laden soaps made in First World countries to the awesome goodness of this natural product, and even a bad batch here and there doesn&#x27;t add up to nearly the same cost.</li>
            <li> It does not lather good and it has something in it that keeps scratching me leaving long red scratches. Would not order again.</li>
            <li> The best product you can use on your skin to keep it healthy and clear of blemishes. You feel refreshed after every use. Great for the price and should be used everyday!</li>
            <li> I use this soap to wash my face and my body. It gets me squeaky clean and it&#x27;s all natural. It has also improved my acne scars</li>
            <li> My family and I absolutely love it! I accidentally stumbled over this when I was searching for ingredients to make my own soap here on amazon.  I read some reviews of people saying it cleared their acne and some claimed it even erased dark spots.  It does that and more! My dad is bald and he has tried everything for hair growth. So when he heard this was all natural and what it does he tried it as a shampoo too. He know has a lot of hair growth.  It is a lot of baby hair but there was nothing there before!!! So believe all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> First, why I like it:&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any special needs such as skin conditions.  I love this soap because of its purity.  No added scents or harshness.  It leaves me feeling really clean and my skin does not feel dry.  In my desire for full disclosure, I did experience about four or five days within the first or second week of use where the skin on my hands got dry, but that ended and never happened again.  My wife had a similar experience, but did not wait it out and has not used black soap since.  A soap maker I met at a crafts fair told me this was probably just a process of the soap cleaning out toxins and residues from my pores.  I&#x27;d used Dial soap almost exclusively for years.  She was a part time artisan soap maker and a full time professor of Chemistry at Virginia Tech.  She also thought highly of Black Soap.  I did some research and discovered that others had similar experiences and found like I did it was a one-time occurrence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Black Soap for over 4 years since December of 2010, when I purchased it for the first time from an artisan soap maker in Charleston, SC.  As I said, he made soap, but he was raving about this soap which he had imported from Ghana.  He had this huge 50Lb cube of soap on a table.  It looked like a chunk of brown marble or a block of some exotic kind of wood.  To demonstrate that it was soap he first rubbed his hand on it then he put a small amount of water on his palm and rubbed his hands together.  I was intrigued, by the lather that formed.  He explained to me that this was one of the gentlest and purest soaps he had ever encountered and that he personally used it.  He said he even used it to wash his hair.  He explained it should be used sparingly because that&#x27;s all that was needed to make a great lather, as he had just demonstrated to me.  So, I purchased a pound.  It lasted me until July of 2012.  I bought another pound.  That lasted until February of 2013 when I purchased a 5 pound block.  That lasted me until this month, April 2015, (2 years) when I purchased another 5 pound block.  I made each purchase from a different vendor, but I intend to stick with Plant Guru through Amazon, they honor Prime members and I like their price and the quality of their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My secret for making it last is that I do my best to let it dry in between uses.  If it&#x27;s allowed to sit in a wet dish it will melt away.  I find setting it on a bumpy soap pad it allows it to dry out between uses.  If you live in a very humid climate then even this may not be enough and it may remain very soft and melt somewhat between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing is that I slice it into bars and wrap them with shrink wrap or vacuum seal the bars with a food saver until I need to begin using them.  From this last 5 pound block I just purchased, I was able to get 18 bars.  I cut them into a size approximately 3-1/2&amp;#34; x 2-1/2&amp;#34; x 1&amp;#34;.  I chose this size because it fits nicely into my travel soap container which I use when we RV and camp.  See my pictures below.&lt;br /&gt;Some possible Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;Because of how it&#x27;s made one will probably will occasionally notice very small bits of charred bark and fibers within the soap. They are miniscule and have never really bothered me.  I never found any of my soap to be gritty, but I do find tiny bits of charred wood in it.  This was explained to me, by a couple of soap makers, to be residue left over from the soap making process and because we’re buying it in its raw form it has not filtered out.  Like I said it doesn’t bother me, it’s an infrequent nuisance, easily removed, by scratching it off while using the soap.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never experienced it arriving dry and crumbly as some have according to their reviews, but I&#x27;ve had the bars I’m using dry out and get quite hard and brittle.  All I had to do was wet them and stick them back together.  The dry brittleness has not been a permanent condition in my case.  Also, my advice is that if it&#x27;s in a poor condition when it arrives either return it and a get a new block.  If that’s not an option try sealing it in a plastic bag and then warm it up in warm water or with a heating pad.  I find it gets very malleable at even in the low 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  For instance it was only 72 degrees Fahrenheit when I was cutting mine up.  It was soft and very easy to cut.  I used some of the crumbles and thin slices to fill in missing areas on the block I was slicing to fill in gaps and uneven places to make my bars more evenly shaped.  I find it almost like working with stiff clay, not difficult, in my experience.s in a poor condition when it arrives either return it and a get a new block.

            <li> It grew mold. Had human hair in it, which wasn&#x27;t mine.</li>
            <li> This is good product if you have any skin problems.  Natural soap so no side effects.  We have been using to wash face for a long time.</li>
            <li> My blacksoap was all in pieces I wanted my 5lbs in one solid piece I&#x27;m not happy ill have to buy again</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve moved away from the chemical laden, skin drying &#x27;soap&#x27; we were both brought up using and turned to this product about 3 years ago.  Other than everyone commenting that it looks like something else in the bathroom when it&#x27;s sitting in the soap dish, everyone who has tried it has loved it.  The only caveat is that it wears fairly quickly especially in the shower.  Keep it as dry as possible when not in use and it will last much longer.  Our soap dish suspends it from the bottom to let it dry between uses.  Originally, we left it in a shallow dish and it never dried out but instead melted away.  Great product and the best price I&#x27;ve found anywhere.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try this soap since I had heard so much about it but unfortunately I never received it i ordered it on the 25th of July and I was told that i would be refunded on the 22nd of August horrible, just horrible I will not be using Amazon again. Good day!</li>
            <li> I was pleased that it arrived as quick as it did and it was great quality soap! This is a great product</li>
            <li> There is no other soap like this soap, it&#x27;s more than just another soap, it also has many medicinal purposes.The best thing ever for your skin!!!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. A cut bar of this goes very quickly, but worth it on the skin. I recommend.</li>
            <li> It lathers like crazy.  I bought it originally thinking I would use it just for washing my oily face, but have ended up using it all over.  It makes you feel so clean.  My husband asked to try it and now he is using it.  Some of the other reviews I read seems to indicate it didn&#x27;t smell very good.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and you can&#x27;t smell anything once you rinse it.  You&#x27;re just clean!  We love it and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  I make a liquid out of it by adding water and pouring into a soap dispenser. Leaves you r skin feeling really clean without drying out.</li>
            <li> its black soap what more could you ask for also its exactly 5lbs as well so in short everything is as it shows now i haven&#x27;t tried it on my skin thats why i give 4 stars untill i see what the product work likes</li>
            <li> The soap is great ,I love it. I started using it when a friend brought me some to use, because I have skin problems and this is the only soap I can use that doesn&#x27;t burn my skin</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the block.  I knew it would be large, but not quite as large as it was.  I have been cutting off bars to give to my friends as presents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is just as I have come to expect for this kind.  Soft and working up great lather.  It is a fresh bar and it arrived sealed well and made it easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great soap and great value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had crappy skin due to stress and eating dairy. Ive used it for about three days morning and night and it seems like the soap is helping my skin clear up.  I see fewer blemishes and kite bing of scars.  I read from another user that she used it on her hair, so I had to try.  surprisingly, it came out amazing!  Not at all dry...in fact it was silky smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fyi, it was my dermatologist who suggested black soap. She&#x27;s had patients who swear by it. So I figured I should give it a try.  I&#x27;m hoping I can swear by this product also!</li>
            <li> I LOVE African Black Soap! Its what I use as a face wash and what I use to wash my 1.5 year old son who has very sensitive skin. This is authentic raw black soap. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about a week. It is EXTREMELY drying to my skin but as long as I moisturize right after using this my face feels a lot better. It does seem like its clearing my face up some. I have combination skin but lately it seems to very oily. Not sure why but its been breaking my face out in little pimples. I don&#x27;t have bad acne, but usually once a month I get one or two stubborn pimples that seem like they never want to go away. I&#x27;m not 100% sure its the soap that&#x27;s clearing it up yet because I had been using some other products for 2 weeks before purchasing this soap and would also alternate between this and the other products even after receiving this soap. It could be a combination of the two that&#x27;s clearing up my skin.  I will update this review after using it for a few more weeks to see if I have noticed any other changes. I have stopped using the other product except for a the spot treatment so I should be able to tell if the soap is doing anything for me. Right now I&#x27;m only using this on my face but may start using it in the shower too. Hoping for the best! :-)</li>
            <li> really, really love this soap.  It is soft, no scent which is great for me.  I have oily skin and hair and this soap really cleans my hair, skin and keeps the oil away for a long time.</li>
            <li> I will never use store bought products again. When I first heard of product I did not believe.  I have used it as well as y family and we are very pleased.</li>
            <li> There was a piece of glass in mine, it cuts my thigh, I am glad it wasn&#x27;t my 2 years old daughter that I cut because I use it on her also.</li>
            <li> when the soap arrived I was amazed at how simple the packaging is.  No fancy wrapping smell good scents. Just a wonderful product! I have six children and everyone has benefited from this product.  I had extremely bad eczema break out on my hands, that I didn&#x27;t realize but using the soap got rid of. Now that Im out it is coming back.  I am  a believer in this product.</li>
            <li> I received a very fresh batch.  It was delivered in days and wrapped neatly.  From daily use my skin is healing and becoming a more even tone all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 4 out of 5 starts because there are a large amount of tiny pebble size bits of cocoa pod or rocks..idk.  I must use a wash cloth because if I try to use the soap on its own I get scratches on my body.  Also, wish it came with a jumbo zip-lock bag so I could seal it up.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this product.  This is my second time purchasing African Black Soap after looking at multiple different brands I chose this one and I am very happy with the product I received.  The first time I purchased 1lb from the seller Nature and Herbs, and this time 5lbs from Plant Guru - both of which have been great products.  Overall the differences I noticed between the batches was the one from Nature and Herbs had more air pockets throughout and was a little firmer.  The block I purchased from Plant Guru was a little softer but was very solid (very few air pockets), but it also contained a piece of wood (see picture).  This sort of just reiterates that this soap is RAW -- i.e. unrefined, unfiltered, unprocessed, and doesn&#x27;t exactly bother me as it was just one piece and it wasn&#x27;t big.  If you would like to use this soap directly on your face and body, you may want to melt it down and filter it to have a smoother consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with the quality of the product and the consistency. I would recommend this Raw African Black Soap. Will definitely be purchasing this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;________________&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: Plant Guru&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 6 days after order date&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: Soap was packaged tightly in plastic wrap. Well packaged, well protected.</li>
            <li> Beat stuff on the market</li>
            <li> I have recommended raw African soap to everyone I know. I was told that I looked 30 years old. I am much older.  This soap tightens the face and decreases the pores.  It does not dry the skin out and it works for every skin condition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really different from typical soaps but it is great.  I started out using it on my face then I said what the heck, I now use it all over and I&#x27;m not disappointed.  It does tighten the skin a bit so you will need to moisturize as soon as possible if tight skin bothers you.  It doesn&#x27;t discolor your bath cloth like the other &amp;#34;black soap&amp;#34;.  The only draw back for me was the little pieces of tar that are in the soap.  It scratches my skin here and there but not enough to stop me from using it.  I&#x27;m just more careful when I can see a piece that is about to surface and just pull it off.  This is my soap product of choice!  Oh &amp; the price is OUTSTANDING for the amount of product that you get.  Delivery service was really quick  plus a coupon for your next purchase was included with the product!!! Keep producing great products and you will keep customers like me very happy!</li>
            <li> Too much coal, residue left in tub, and irritates skin .</li>
            <li> Love this soap. It was a lot. But the more the merry. Arrived when I needed it . Thanks</li>
            <li> Very nice soap.  Cleanses well and no harsh odors or perfumes like store bought soaps.  A good find on here.</li>
            <li> Good value and price.  This is my favorite soap and I am, as a friend described me a soap person.  Excellent skin healer, cleaner and conditioner.  It may sting or seem to burn or dry initially if you skin has anything on it that shouldn&#x27;t be there, including dead skin.  Using this soap daily will remove all of that and leave glowing, soft, clear firm skin.</li>
            <li> We love this soap, it takes off all of my make up and your face feels so clean. My husband states this is the first soap he has ever used that works for his face. It doesn&#x27;t dry it out but cleans and takes away the oil on his face. Love it</li>
            <li> I have been using African Black Soap for many years and this is the first time I have ever had it burn my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I feel that it has not been fully cured. This is also the first time I have ever received this product sealed in a plastic bag, it has always been wrapped in paper previously. If it was wrapped in plastic before it was fully cured, that would stop the curing process as it needs air circulation to cure. Paper breaths, plastic does not. I will leave the block out of the plastic bag it came in for a month or so and then revisit it to see if I have the same reaction.</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever made my face look for radiant.  I never get break outs anymore and my skin is so even-toned.  It IS drying, but I use coconut oil on my face as a moisturizer at night so it counteracts the dryness.  My husband loves it too!</li>
            <li> It pulls the dirt out of your pores...Your skin will end up being prettier then it ever has been.It makes you skin glow</li>
            <li> Got this for my 15yr old for his acne and it works well. He has it on his back and shoulders so far it is clearing up. I did some reading online and found that it can be liquefied. So I now use it as a shampoo for my hair. I will definitely be ordering more before we run out.</li>
            <li> I truly love this soap my little girl gets so dry in the winter her skin cracks I have been using this soap for a year and a half now and cant get enough it has helped my little girl as well as my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL NOTE THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY OPEN AREA ON YOUR SKIN IT DOES BURN BUT NO PAIN NO GAIN I GET RAZOR BURN UNDER MY ARMS AND SEEMS TO HELP CLEAR IT UP. ALSO YOU ARE BETTER OFF GETTING A CONTAINER TO PUT IT IN IT IS A SPFTER SOAP AND DOES SEEM TO GO A LOT FASTER THAN STORE SOAP WHEN NOT KEPT DRY.</li>
            <li> I use this soap for everything. From shampoo to acne to a friends cold sore.&lt;br /&gt;Remember when using for acne...it pulls all of the bad out so  it will get worst shortly then better.</li>
            <li> I love African Black soap for shampoo and body wash.  It cleans without stripping the moisture or body from the hair.  I have a mixture of 4 A/B/C hair, and this product exceeds all of the natural hair shampoo amd no poo products that I have found on the market.  I also like the fact that it is the most natural soap you&#x27;ll find even when compared to castille soap.  I am a very pleased customer.....</li>
            <li> if it were not for this soap, i would not have gotten rid of my chronic acne. but beware - once your acne is gone, there may be no need for this soap because it can burn.</li>
            <li> This black soap has been some of the best quality black soap we&#x27;ve received. we break off a piece at a time and use it to wash our face, body, and hair. It&#x27;s so smooth and does not have a lot of rocks like some of the other brands we&#x27;ve used have. I will order from MADINA again - if we ever run out!! The 5lbs was PLENTY to last us maybe 6 months, easily!! shukran!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered from this seller before and was satisfied with my purchase; however, this time my soap came really dry and brittle and crumbled to prices -  the consistency just wasn&#x27;t the same and it didn&#x27;t have the same effects on our skin.  I&#x27;m not sure whether they are purchasing from a different supplier or what but the soap was horrible. I would&#x27;ve sent it back, but didn&#x27;t feel like going through all of that. Maybe it was just a bad batch, but I would be leery about purchasing from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This soap seems a bit more &amp;#34;grainy&amp;#34; than the last one I purchased.  It does a wonderful job on clearing up acne issues.</li>
            <li> Works well on my hair. my hair is clean but not dried out.  but not good for bathing. caused me  skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Works well and cleanses like a beast. Lathers amazingly but beware if you have sensitive skin as it will dry you out quick. Use this soap with caution as too much will strip too much oil from your skin. Often for me it is my back that dries out and becomes itchy. A little of this soap goes a long way, so if used properly it works very well. Also as a face wash this soap is the best it strips all the oils on your face quickly. I use it after I exfoliate my face with an apricot salcylic acid scrub.</li>
            <li> Great soap for a great deal! Has little rocks that will scratch you though so lather onto hand first.</li>
            <li> I received this product on time. it works quite well. i like it very much.i recommend it for most people every day use.</li>
            <li> We make soap, and had some people asking for soap as they ingredients for African Black Soap cannot be duplicated in the U.S. It is very soft, melts too fast, not a good quality soap and it grew a scary kind of mold. I threw it all away- I have never ever seen soap MOLD before.</li>
            <li> Here in Los Angeles near the beach, it ain&#x27;t exactly easy to find this soap unless&lt;br /&gt;you go to the street vendors on Venice and they don&#x27;t have enough for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to have to keep buying every month, and I needed some bulk.&lt;br /&gt;This was the perfect product and the perfect price. Its not the fake &amp;#34;black African&lt;br /&gt;soap&amp;#34; that is molded into a perfect bar that is literally tar black, but a soft, marbled&lt;br /&gt;dark and light brown soap that lathers beautifully and takes well to essential oils being added,&lt;br /&gt;and also easily melts in a bottle to make liquid black soap. This soap is the real deal. It has those&lt;br /&gt;natural chunky bits of plantain leaves and coco pods that seriously exfoliate your skin. IT doesn&#x27;t leave&lt;br /&gt;your skin feeling tight and there isn&#x27;t that icky residue feeling of something still being on your&lt;br /&gt;skin after you shower. It helps keep your skin moisturized and helps tremendously with acne and scarring&lt;br /&gt;because of the natural emollients, vitamins, and minerals present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using shampoo and started to wash with black soap. Hair loves it!&lt;br /&gt;Hair is squeaky clean without being too dry (I have kinky afro textured hair) and&lt;br /&gt;super shiny. Would never dream of going to back to harsh shampoos with chemicals,&lt;br /&gt;plus, this lathers WAAAY better than any commercial shampoo I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got enough to give to family, which is just what I wanted and you can&#x27;t beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and time from shopping trips and order bulk from this vendor. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> The best soap in the world! It&#x27;s natural, it feels so good. It&#x27;s gentle on my skin, and it lathers like no soap I ever used to wash my body! I recommend it to everyone! And I mean everyone!</li>
            <li> Love it! My face was a mess when I started using this. Mostly hormonal breakouts. I wash my face twice a day with this, apply PCA acne cream to my typical trouble spots in the morning and PCA rejuvenating serum on top of that. That&#x27;s it, complete transformation within 2 months of using those 3 products. This soap did take some getting used to, at first it burned and made my face very dry (cellular turn-over) but I stuck with it and it paid off! My face adjusted and was no longer sensitive to it after a couple of weeks. So pleased, thank you!</li>
            <li> I received my 5lbs and I love it!  I was already using the African soap but I only had a pound and it was gone within a month.  Now, with a bigger portion, this will last long enough for me to reach my cleansing goals for my face, arms, legs and buttocks.  The scars I have are already beginning to disappear, and because of the bigger amount I have, I don&#x27;t have to alternate between this and regular soap.  I&#x27;ll be back in a bathing suit by the time summer starts!</li>
            <li> This soap is Awesome!! Great for the whole body. A great shampoo.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of dry and oily skin</li>
            <li> If you like chemical free products, try the black soap. It squeaky cleanses. I always use it and would very much recommend it for the good quality and price</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first but since a friend twisted my arm to get this &amp; swore by it. I&#x27;m glad I did. My face feels clean, soft &amp; my scars on my face are clearing up. .</li>
            <li> The soap is good. It leaves your body feeling clean without drying your skin out. I would have gave it 5 stars but when I washed my face with this soap burned me. I have used African Black soap before and this is the first time this has happened.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday to keep my skin clear with out drying it out. I can never go back to any other kind of soap.</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference on my skin.  It&#x27;s just like any other soap. It lathers easily.  I&#x27;ve been using this for over 3 months every day and I&#x27;m not happy with the results.  It comes on big chunks wrapped with plastic. The smell is kind of neutral and looks handmade. I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> it was ship in little pieces not as picture on the site</li>
            <li> This soap is awsome! I used to buy this soap in very small bars at a mom &#x27;n pop shop in the mall which charged $6 for a tiny bar! Way over priced.  Then I found it at a very large on-line beauty supply store.  The price was better than the store in the mall but they charged a huge shipping and handling rate.  I went here and the price-product ratio is so much better than the mom &#x27;n pop store or the online beauty store.  it comes in a huge 5 lbs. block so you will have to set aside some space under your bathroom sink but it is worth it.  I just take an old kitchen knife and cut off a block the size of my choosing and presto!  I bought this block well over a year ago and I probably have about 2-3 bars left that I can cut off and use.  This, by the way, is used by both me and my wife daily and it has still lasted this long!  Its looks pricey at first but it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> The product was everything I expected it to be.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like it, I love it. I would recommend it to family or friends.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase.  Is as advertised.  I recommend this to anyone looking for the real African black soap</li>
            <li> I give this 2 stars because this is the second time I purchased this soap and the first batch was absolutely pure and this one is not. I can tell because of how soft it is and it does not last me as long as the first batch. I think there is some Shea butter in it.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! Use it head to toe, very clean feeling, very good for skin. This is the only soap we use, no more expensive soap that dries out our skin. We highly recommend this company and this soap.</li>
            <li> Have been using this black soap since noticing my African co-workers clear, clean skin years ago. Having used different manufacturer&#x27;s , I noted a nice texture and result while using this product. The bulk aspect allows a longer supply and quality. thanks for the bulk.</li>
            <li> was a big piece of soap; 5lbs. but i liked it and was glad that this time it was not all broken up  in pieces like my previous order</li>
            <li> Lathers up well, feels creamy and good. I have not found and nasty impurities in it, which is something that I worried about when I ordered it. I also worried about what it would smell like and I can honestly say that it just has a rich earthy smell.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  I only use it for my face, minor acne (clogged pores) and it&#x27;s better than any other soap or medication I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;ve found that daily use, twice a day can be a little strong for my skin so I&#x27;ve started using it just once a day and using a mild cleanser during the night.</li>
            <li> I started using Raw African Black Soap some months ago by &amp;#34;accident&amp;#34; (just happened to see it on Amazon while looking for something else).  My skin is completely different.  The pores on my face have decreased in size after a *lifetime* of over the counter chemicals that have never done anything.  Yes, there is grit in this soap so if your skin is thin I recommend applying it very gently so you will not scratch yourself.  Your skin will rinse cleaner than ever before!  If you have bumps around your elbows that you have been struggling to get rid of or any rough patches on your skin you will see amazing results if you use this soap religiously.  I don&#x27;t use anything else now.  This is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I planned to switch away from Dove soap, which I loved, but didn&#x27;t want to continue using (due to toxic chemicals in Dove products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really tried to like the African Black Soap, but unfortunately it seemed to be fairly &amp;#34;uncured&amp;#34;, or there was still lye in parts of the soap, because it burned my skin when I used it.  My skin is not incredibly sensitive but I continued to get stinging, red, burned skin in different patches after using this product.  It is also quite gritty and has chunks of charcoal/ wood/ ash/ dirt in it.  (Not sure what the substance is, looks like burnt wood mostly, and then some parts have a gritty sort of sand in it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have a large amount of this left, which I might start using for washing dishes just to get rid of it.  Would not recommend this if your skin is at all sensitive.</li>
            <li> After learning about this soap I was excited to get.  Very disappointed when it arrived.  It is 5 lbs of whitish  crumbley mess.  There will be no &amp;#34;slicing off&amp;#34; bars.  Had to take a pile of crumbs and hand form it into a ball.  Not very &amp;#34;black&amp;#34;  This is my first experience in buying so not sure what it should actually look or be like.,,but I certainly did not expect it  this from what my friend had or from the pictures and reviews here on Amazon are.  Have not yet used so can&#x27;t rate actual performance.</li>
            <li> it had more sand then what I was use to having in the soap , not good. I needed it so I used it ..... not from this company again</li>
            <li> I bought some of this soap last year from another seller and it was rough and abrasive. This is nice and soft, You can cut off a big bar and it just feels good right away. I love using it for my face. My niece has dry skin problems and this has helped her out a lot. I will be buying more from this seller. It was a big block nicely wrapped in clear wrap when it was delivered. Very professional group!</li>
            <li> II don&#x27;t like it because it is too soft</li>
            <li> I just recently ordered this product and tried the Black Soap for the very first time, and I see amazing results just in within 1 day. Me personalty I&#x27;ll never go back to my daily skin care routine this one makes my skin feel/and looks cleaner,calmer,and brighter etc. plus just a F.Y.I barely half a pinky  size is all you need to clean both your face and neck (Very little goes along way). I would recommend this product for anybody with any trouble of the skin!</li>
            <li> very good product my husband winter dry skin didnt show up this year.&lt;br /&gt;my daughter who cannot use most soap products can use this soap with&lt;br /&gt;no problems</li>
            <li> You can buy &#x27;Black African Soap&#x27; from Target and other retail stores.  This is like comparing wonderful raw unprocess sea salt with the bitter refined commercial salt most people use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True Raw African Soap, especially that imported from Ghana, is incredibly wonderful.  It looks horrible, but you are not going to eat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This raw soap produces a wonderful lather, cleans the skin squeeky clean, but leaves the skin &#x27;feeling&#x27;  wonderful.  This is partly responsible because the soap contains small particles of the raw ingredents.  The soap contains the raw unprocessed oils of numberous plants and seeds and seed pods that provide your skin with natural cleansers and moisturizers with none of the stickiness left by soaps such as Dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a wash cloth or lighly rub the raw soap on your skin directly and &#x27;feel&#x27; the natural ingredients at work.  Do NOT rub hard with the raw bar.  And, DO NOT leave this soap in standing water in a soap dish for example.  The soap will literally melt away.  You Have Been Warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.</li>
            <li> i choose 4 stars because I love Pure  Black Soap and it really does work BUT by this pick it is not pure, but adds shea butter mix..</li>
            <li> when you use soap it leaves you clean no residue.Love It meet my expectation and more&lt;br /&gt;only been using it a couple of times.</li>
            <li> There is so much sand in our batch and ROCKS! Every time we take a bath it is filled with sand and we are throwing away rocks.</li>
            <li> I have been using African blaxck soap for several months now and I notice my skin has a beautiful glow and tone. It leaves me clean without any  soapy residue or annoying fragrances and perfumes which is great since I wear perfume . It is a great natural product which has benefitted my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST soap ever.  My sister laughed when she saw it...now she loves it too...so does my husband.  It does not dry out your skin. It lathers like crazy.  It smells clean, yet is not scented.  I recommend this wholeheartedly!  I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> awesome soap. made my skin a bit firm and cleared some spots. it doesn&#x27;t work miracles but it&#x27;s a good investment. will be ordering more soon. it is also a GREAT shampoo. I love using natural products and it cleaned my hair thoroughly without drying it. I did not use conditioner so it also saves time</li>
            <li> This soap is absolutely worth getting clears your skin quickly</li>
            <li> I will forever be buying this product because it is amazing. I can use this anywhere for anything! . .</li>
            <li> I Absolutley Love This Soap, just got it and i use it 2x a day morning when i wake up and night before bed i wash my face with it, my skin feels so smooth and soft i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great for every day use.</li>
            <li> This black soap does not melt well for rebatch. I will not order again.</li>
            <li> i love it this soap is powerful for the skin</li>
            <li> It was the first time I ordered black soap. I tried making liquid soap yesterday and noticed that when the soap dissolved in the glass container it had lots of sand at the bottom. Besides from that it is ok.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is because I did find a couple of human hairs in chunks of the soap and pebbles. The hair grossed me out a bit, but not enough to throw the soap away. I just love this soap too much for that. And as for the pebbles, I suggest using a wash cloth or sponge and not rub the soap directly onto your skin. Ouch!!!! ;)&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion: Use hair nets when making this soap!!!!! Otherwise, this soap is excellent. I was having skin issues. I had some skin irritation and itching and after a week of using this soap it went away!! I am making my husband, who has eczema and kids, who are teens with blemishes and acne scars, use this soap as well.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love the lather of this soap. I can&#x27;t really attest to the &amp;#34;curing&amp;#34; properties, but we do love using it.</li>
            <li> Ordered 5lbs ivory shea butter..no debris, dirt or shells...soft and high quality. Also ordered 5lbs raw black soap...super soft &amp; moist. Shipping was fast and packing excellent. Great customer service and will be ordering more soon. Summer&#x27;s coming gotta get my hair &amp; skin ready to be seen. Thanks, SmellGood..y&#x27;all ROCK!</li>
            <li> The first time i tried this soap i got it in the one pound size. However, once i used it, i no longer buy any other soup but the black soap, it makes my skin so soft and this time around i ordered the five pound size it&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;yes, it met my expectations&amp;#34;. I love black soap.I enjoy working with this company they stand by their word in fact, I&#x27;m getting ready to order 5 pounds for my mother.Also my order arrived earlier then I expected don&#x27;t think order from this company right now!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted! Great quality!</li>
            <li> Great, I only expected 1 lb of it and I got a lb of about 15. It was shipped out quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the best buy for the money.  This soap is excellent for acne and other skin problems.  It can be drying, but if you have a teen with acne due to oily skin this works as well as all those harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> The bubbles from this soap are soft and thick. I don&#x27;t need many swipes from the bar the make a lather. My skin feels so smooth when my shower is done.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used regular soap in years and I was buying this soap from a lady that was selling sandwhich bags full for 20 dollars, when I found out that I could buy this online for so much cheaper, that is what I have been doing. Great soap!! Makes my skin feel so good!&lt;br /&gt;6/8/2017 I&#x27;ve bought this soap from this buyer before and never had an issue, but for some reason this time it has a funny smell to it. The last time I bought it the soap never has a smell. And the wrapping is also different. I will be returning it and ordering from someone else.</li>
            <li> Okay so I thought I went through soap quickly, but 5 lbs is a lot of soap, haha.  I still love it, but it is definitely going to take me forever to finish it.  I find black soap to be a great soap for my skin and it lacks many of the harsh dyes/fragrances/chemicals found in traditional body washes these days.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for about two years and I have not gone back to my old soap.  It smells fresh and clean, lathers well and rinses completely.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good soap. It was pretty broke up from shipping and handling but it made packaging the soap in zip lock bags easier. Will order this soap again!</li>
            <li> This is probably one of those items in Amazon where the quality of the product depends on the seller. i didn&#x27;t even know this was sold by different sellers. i just noticed the difference between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st one i bought was sold by &amp;#34;Nature and Herbs&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;it didn&#x27;t come with one block of soap, but 5 pieces. it was very sandy and it can hurt your skin if you&#x27;re not careful. i probably seen tiny rocks in there too. but that didn&#x27;t stop me from buying a second one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd was sold by &amp;#34;Plant Guru&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;it did come as pictured. one block. it&#x27;s finer than the first one. that&#x27;s the first thing i noticed. also it didn&#x27;t dissolve as easily as the first one too. i think this will last around 2 weeks longer than the first one (i use it daily)</li>
            <li> Love the 5 pound size to make soaps with our favorite essential oils and still have some for bathing also</li>
            <li> Natural and perfect for makeup removal. It also helps with breakouts and acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful not to get it into your eyes... it is quite potent!</li>
            <li> Will never use regular soap again!!</li>
            <li> I have been switching all of my products to as natural as possible and I absolutely love how my skin feels from using this soap. I also have noticed help with how my skin looks as well. It is a little bit drying but I like to use a natural lotion I made myself and my skin is in heaven!</li>
            <li> When I received my order, the soap was in perfect shape.  Not broken or dry at all. I will reorder this again. Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT, HOWEVER I ORDERED ENOUGH TO BATHE UR HOMELESS!!!  I TRIED INTRODUCING TO FAMILY &amp; FRIENDS, HOWEVER DUE IT&#x27;S UGLINESS ( POOP)  I COULD NOT CONVINCE ANYONE OF IT&#x27;S WONDERFUL LUSTER IT GIVES TO UR BODIES!!!  I REFUSE, TO USE ANYTHING ELSE!!</li>
            <li> My soap contained rocks and pieces of plastic. I&#x27;ve had good experience with black soap from this seller in the past, so I was rather disappointed.</li>
            <li> Everything about the soap was fine. I chopped it up into blocks and have used them for the past few weeks, but this morning I found half of a screw baked into one of the pieces. I&#x27;m pretty sure that iron screws are NOT part of the formula for this product. This is completely unacceptable.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! It is a lot cheaper to purchase in a bulk then by bar at a local medicine shop. I use it for my acne and I have had positive results.</li>
            <li> all i ever use love the product and the price.</li>
            <li> Just a great product !!</li>
            <li> Made my face red and itchy.  I also broke out with zits.  Not for me.</li>
            <li> Too much charcole...if there was slightly less with be wonderful...great exfoliation...my husband and I both love Black Soap....Also, received it as the eta.</li>
            <li> My skin loves this soap.</li>
            <li> Big, smelled like the earth, melts in water. This is purer black soap as a huge brick. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I wish you guys carried the kind with hemp seed oil. It is more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you would expect, a giant slab of soap. I would recommend cutting it into bar sizes and individually wrapping them.</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful!  It has begun to clear my complexion and even the skin tone.  I use it on all of my body and feel thoroughly clean.  Will probably never use another soap. I will be purchasing it again after the 5lbs is gone.  I&#x27;ve shared it with others and they love it too!</li>
            <li> I store mine in a Tupperware container. The part that&#x27;s liquefied makes great shampoo. I haven&#x27;t used real shampoo for months. My hair looks amazing!  Update: Still using this as a shampoo and bath soap. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is great soap. You just need to try it. Face feel great. I feel so clean. Skin has improved</li>
            <li> Best soap ever used.  Will purchase again and again once I have used it all.</li>
            <li> wish I knew about this soap earlier</li>
            <li> Great product, makes my body feel cleaner than ever before!</li>
            <li> Too Drying for the skin. I now make my own handmade soaps and now relised the black soap is really harsh and drying to the skin....</li>
            <li> this product is a little rough on the skin I recommend using it only once a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is just this brand of soap but, this brand has irritated my skin and left it feeling so dry which is unusual for black soap; usually its use has had the opposite effects. The price is great for the amount of soap you&#x27;re getting. I just think next time, I&#x27;ll stick with my usual carrier.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb.</li>
            <li> Great for eczema and pimples. It will not work for everyone. Just keep looking until you find one that works for you.</li>
            <li> Cleans like no other soap, all natural African Black soap</li>
            <li> I like being able to get the bulk amount because it is cheaper than what I paid at the flea market a good deal.</li>
            <li> I have ordered black soap several times in the past year and order for friends too. Love the way it cleans your skin and makes you feel better than any soap that I have every used. will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
