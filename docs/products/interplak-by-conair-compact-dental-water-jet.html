    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>perfect for when I travel</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very intelligently designed with excellent compartments to hold the hose and tips inside the cover for travel.  </li>
            <li>if you are going to travel, this is the best water pick because it runs on 3 AA batteries.</li>
            <li>Great price and deal!</li>
            <li>Best if you by rechargeable batteries and a charger.</li>
            <li>In addition to being perfect for travel, its compact size and battery operation makes it perfect for home use too.</li>
            <li>and this is awesome.</li>
            <li>These grooves help ensure that the reservoir lines up perfectly with the seal.</li>
            <li>works well and the travel size is perfect.</li>
            <li>but I got lithium batteries and works great for me.!  </li>
            <li>Works great and is the perfect size to store away when not in use.</li>
            <li>He loved it!</li>
            <li>Everything is perfect in time and the price is good.</li>
            <li>For kids, it might be great</li>
            <li>Kept hoping that I could get one that worked because portability would be great.</li>
            <li>The convenience of having replaceable batteries is great.</li>
            <li>Great seller.  </li>
            <li>GREAT SHIPPING TIME.</li>
            <li>Great travel accessory</li>
            <li>so I was happy in the end.  </li>
            <li>great price.  </li>
            <li>this size is great and no electric cord is another plus</li>
            <li>the features are very nice; however i can&#x27;t keep it from pumping water out the bottom as well as from the nozzle.</li>
            <li>In fact this one thing alone, considering the price, I think impressed me the most.</li>
            <li>Item works fairly well, but the tip has to  be held in while using it and the &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button isn&#x27;t always very effective.</li>
            <li>No question in my mind that this should be given 5 brightly glistening stars.</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s a good thing for your situation, you will like this unit</li>
            <li>Works Great &amp; packs nicely for travel</li>
            <li>Good for travelers with dental issues.  </li>
            <li>IT IS A TOY GOOD FOR NOTHING</li>
            <li>Price wise</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon is a good company to use.</li>
            <li>this is a good thing to have when you travel.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic price for an awesome product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s surprising.</li>
            <li>Good value for the price.</li>
            <li>But not so good for every day use.</li>
            <li>Good pick for battery operated</li>
            <li>This was a gift for a child, I am happy because it is very easy to use, plus its easy movement between the restrooms and the results in oral hygiene are excellent.</li>
            <li>I would rather spend more money and get a good one!</li>
            <li>The price is right and perfect for traveling!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>With the exception of 3 AA batteries rather than electricity for power, I love it!  </li>
            <li>AND WHEN IT WENT OUT I WAS SO HAPPY TO FINE ONE AGAIN.</li>
            <li>not purchase these kind of items from conair again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Awesome product fast shipping recommend</li>
            <li>You will need your own AA batteries.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>I used to own a Waterpik and this in my opinion is comparable.</li>
            <li>Its not quite as strong as the highest setting on a Waterpic, but that strength makes my gums bleed, so for me this is a very good fit.</li>
            <li>I love it and am confident you will too, plus you cannot beat the price!</li>
            <li>Good news is that I got a credit immediately, and a free shipping label to return it.</li>
            <li>this unit is Very light.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t as powerful or strong as the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; waterpik, but it&#x27;s great to take with you when you are away from home.......</li>
            <li>It has a propensity to tip over and the battery cover will not close, so, water + electricity - need I say more?</li>
            <li>a toothbrush does a much better job.</li>
            <li>that was much better.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s Ok</li>
            <li>, not if you go on cruises as most ships do not have electricity in the bathrooms and trying to use one of these out of the bathroom</li>
            <li>it does work ok .</li>
            <li>Like I said, its better than nothing, but  its power doesn&#x27;t compare  to the power of electrical jets.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i shld have saved and bought a better product</li>
            <li>recommend using the Rechargable AA since they are more durable.</li>
            <li>The most egregious is that it is &amp;</li>
            <li>WJ3CSR in order to save some bathroom counter space and have something more convenient to travel with.</li>
            <li>I have been using water pick products for 40 years, but this one is my all-time favorite.</li>
            <li>Seems kind of cheap</li>
            <li>This proved a much better choice.  </li>
            <li>Love that it has 2 adapters that are color coded so we can tell whose is whose.</li>
            <li>The more I use it, the better my gums feel, so for me, it works well.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did as you may need to refill a time or two...</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints and have had no problems after 3 years, or maybe more.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than nothing.  </li>
            <li>This product uses 2 AA batteries, the batteries need replacing often, but the overall operation of this appliance is great to good.</li>
            <li>Have had on of these for years and love it.</li>
            <li>This product works as it was intended and is okay to have around.</li>
            <li>Sent a better model than the one in the ad.</li>
            <li>Best price for the larger model</li>
            <li>Might be ok for travel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this oral irrigator for more than 5 years and haven&#x27;t had any problems, at the beginning</li>
            <li>Found this item to be underpowered bit better than nothing while traveling.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>This machine is outstanding, it met all my needs and expectations.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recomended this product and said that it was better than using dental floss.</li>
            <li>However, rechargebles will keep it working until I can get a better device.</li>
            <li>love this item, can take it anywhere</li>
            <li>, if you go away you can fit it in your suitcase!</li>
            <li>great , better than I expected, easy to use and does great job</li>
            <li>Not enough pressure to do a very good job of cleaning</li>
            <li>Cheap is Cheap!</li>
            <li>I was able to return this product for better (cost me more, but worth it.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this was a fair product but its really just wetting your teeth.</li>
            <li>It is light, elegant, easy for travellers use.</li>
            <li>Good price had to get batteries separately, works well love how clean my mouth (braces) feels after I use it would recommend if you wants save a couple dollars</li>
            <li>The attachments fall off easily.  </li>
            <li>easy to use and can take with you when traveling</li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;m continuing to use it, because it&#x27;s so easy to store.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, compact, and travels compactly, (put a couple of pieces of tape on each side to keep it together/closed in my ditty bag).  </li>
            <li>The company was easy to have replaced.  </li>
            <li>The flow wasn&#x27;t as strong to wash away food particles.</li>
            <li>On its strong setting</li>
            <li>Worked decently for a while with good power but after a couple weeks it was falling apart and wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s about perfect, and certainly adequate for the intended purpose, in my opinion, to last through a trip even if you are used to full blast from a plug-in.</li>
            <li>Its fine, never used one before so dont know what to expect.</li>
            <li>I bought this to travel with, and the pressure works fine for me.</li>
            <li>Very nice for just general use.</li>
            <li>This little thing is awesome!.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this item , because  I wanted to use it on my vacation where no electricity was available.</li>
            <li>But not so much for home use unless you happen to work at or own stock in a battery</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, the nozzles don&#x27;t fit securely in the handle.</li>
            <li>Just what the dentist told me to get something light.</li>
            <li>The tips don&#x27;t fit securely into the tube where the water comes out and they are always falling out.  </li>
            <li>holes\\&quot; to fit into for storage, and once the cover (the upside-down reservoir) is on nothing will move.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For use take off the cover/reservoir, flip it over and fit it onto the seal...</li>
            <li>It was great for international travel because I didn&#x27;t need to worry about power conversion.</li>
            <li>this cheap to keep on working.</li>
            <li>The unit is light so it slides even tho</li>
            <li>wish Conair would revise the device with a better tip connector, since it could be a useful travel&lt;br /&gt;water pick.</li>
            <li>With fresh (weeks) batteries and on the full power setting you&#x27;ll get a pretty darn good squirt.</li>
            <li>light and powerful!</li>
            <li>Its also a more pleasant experience than flossing especially if you use HOT WATER (another free tip).</li>
            <li>This little hummer is remarkable!</li>
            <li>a sprays water all over while trying to clean my teeth</li>
            <li>I bought this mainly to clean my gums.  </li>
            <li>I have dentures and had implants for my bottom teeth and need to clean them.  </li>
            <li>If mine ever were to break I would most certainly purchase another one just like it.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s very handy, light weight, easy to travel with - Highly recommended for those on the move.  </li>
            <li>But it operates on AA btteries and the water pressure is too low to do a good cleaning job.</li>
            <li>We have tried it out and found it to be what we desired, a good dental irrigator completely independent of electical outlet variances so that it can be used in any country.</li>
            <li>I use a full size</li>
            <li>I have a full sized water pic..</li>
            <li>This device is very practical for those on the road and would need to maintain a healthy gum.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t enough power to do any good.</li>
            <li>I have traveled with it more times than I could count and without even taking any real care in packing it (just stick in among my clothes in the suitcase), everything, cover included, always arrives</li>
            <li>I never have my home unit on full blast so for me</li>
            <li>Perhaps I got a good one, I don&#x27;t know, but it has even functioned as my main home unit for a couple of weeks during a main unit break-down</li>
            <li>If the water runs out, just fill it up again, it&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li>, I refill the tank 2 times for every use three times per day and for more than two week I still use the same charge, so probably the battery issue will go away as they get better.</li>
            <li>I got the alternating current type instead of battery operated  and am super loving it.</li>
            <li>The reservoir can be pulled off of the seal it is currently sitting on, flipped over and slid right over top of the unit, encasing everything and becoming one self-contained entity.</li>
            <li>little one worked great..</li>
            <li>It might use a few batteries but using the rechargeable ones works great.</li>
            <li>It proves you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a useful item for me</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is worth returning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use rechargeable batteries and get a month&#x27;s worth of use before recharging.</li>
            <li>NIce design if only it worked and was not a piece of junk.</li>
            <li>This only has one kind of nozzle, which is nothing fancy</li>
            <li>If you need its worth trying for the $.</li>
            <li>Given that it is battery-operated and does not have an adapter, I&#x27;m not unhappy with its performance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Eats batteries and isn&#x27;t terribly powerful (not that you should be power-washing your gums anyway).</li>
            <li>Since this is the first \\&quot;machine\\&quot; of this kind I&#x27;ve ever used, I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect as far as power and speed with which the water comes out of the nozzles...  </li>
            <li>Just Right For Traveling</li>
            <li>They were right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad but it certainly has a couple flaws.  </li>
            <li>I have a great tountertop water pic, but needed a small compact one for traveling.  </li>
            <li>So...IF you have the cup filled and ready to go and then turn it on and no water comes out, it&#x27;s because the cup is not on the seal correctly, almost certainly because you DIDN&#x27;T slide the cup into the groove guides.</li>
            <li>should have spent more cheap</li>
            <li>Was surprised the item came with two water oils but didn&#x27;t produce strong force of water.</li>
            <li>It works fine, but I really don&#x27;t need it since I had the older one repaired.  </li>
            <li>I believe that this was down to the fact that I filled the liquid container with quarter of the available space with mouthwash (any cheap one will do).</li>
            <li>It also uses batteries very fast.</li>
            <li>if you need more than one filling to dwell on all your teeth, what&#x27;s the big deal?  </li>
            <li>Ordered first one.  </li>
            <li>first use tips pop off got sprayed.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S FIRST BATTERIES.  </li>
            <li>Overall, My gums have felt much better, and my mouth feels refreshed after each use.</li>
            <li>I first tried using rechargeable batteries</li>
            <li>it does the job very well!</li>
            <li>THe first one lasted longer than I thought it would.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I dislike that it doesn&#x27;t have plug-in capability, but this new one seems to have better battery life than my old one.  </li>
            <li>too weak would have liked more strength</li>
            <li>Product is &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; its so small..however, the stream that comes out isn&#x27;t strong enough to clean my teeth, I still must floss even with new batteries.</li>
            <li>This unit was a good idea, small and compact.</li>
            <li>Bought thi sbecause small size was good for the sink or counter</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize it was batter operated, but I guess it will be good for trips, when I usually don&#x27;t take one.</li>
            <li>It is compact &amp; easy to travel &amp; the batteries give plenty of power--which is something I was concerned about prior to the purchase.  </li>
            <li>(that was years ago now) and what sold me on this unit was how many people raved about how long the batteries lasted, and how much power they provided.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact and the stream is strong enough BUT the tips don&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li>I like the large unit I have</li>
            <li>I tried both tips and even tried to insert one from an Oral B which were too large for this unit to accommodate.</li>
            <li>(These were a newer NiZn rechargeable that work fine in my digital camera.)</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s much easier to refill than the one piece units, so</li>
            <li>I received this as a placeholder until I get my &#x27;real&#x27; water pick</li>
            <li>very underpowered.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference between the nozzles either.  </li>
            <li>It does not take up much room nor ties up a receptacle.</li>
            <li>but really works well.</li>
            <li>I have very close teeth</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It might look straight and sealed, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re similar but they don&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>This worked very well.</li>
            <li>Conair Interplak Dental Water Jet is a very compact unit that operates on batteries.  </li>
            <li>it does not have that much pressure.</li>
            <li>but you really have to go at it with floss too.  </li>
            <li>They really need to pull these products and start over or just give it up and stick with curling irons.</li>
            <li>I searched high and low for a decent one, and this is the first fabulous one I found.  </li>
            <li>The water pressure was very strong, enough to clear any debris, though it rather hurt if accidentally directly at gums.</li>
            <li>I really got this to irrigate the sides of the back of my throat, but have also tried it to clean between my teeth as well.  </li>
            <li>Finally agreed with me and said they could nothing and to return it to original seller.</li>
            <li>In fact, it is my second one with the first lasting more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>I used other Water Jets before and their water pressure was much better.</li>
            <li>I have used an electric water jet in the past and find it is much more powerful than this battery operated one.  </li>
            <li>I can tell my teeth aren&#x27;t as clean as they get with a larger, outlet powered Waterpik.  </li>
            <li>but only if I am not wearing a shirt and if I have time to clean up the sink area when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>It is messy to use at first, but once you get the hang of it is okay.  </li>
            <li>Use very new batteries.  </li>
            <li>This is a small handy size for traveling.</li>
            <li>Nice feature in a small area - no cord to deal with.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for travel, and at first I thought the water pressure could be increased, but then I realized pressure too high is not good for my sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only draw back is that the lid needs a better snap-shut system.  </li>
            <li>That noted -- on my home unit (the main brand)</li>
            <li>Product broke after only 3 months of 1 person mild use.</li>
            <li>simple to use grand daughter uses it without being told too hope it lastes.small enought to be left out on the counter</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for travel.</li>
            <li>It is is travel friendly and nice and compact,  but it failed to meet my expectations.</li>
            <li>Of course it IS a little travel model that isn&#x27;t made of gold, but it holds up well... and over time and over many miles.</li>
            <li>It makes a humming noise and jiggles in place a little, but water isn&#x27;t sloshing out of the top with people running and screaming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I normally go through 2 cups or a little more</li>
            <li>You have to hold on to the nozzle thing to keep it effective but its not too hard to do.</li>
            <li>I am an adult with braces and I use a lot of water (the full container on a larger home unit)</li>
            <li>Does not have enough powerful water stream</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s normal for this.</li>
            <li>The price was right and I will put it to use shortly.</li>
            <li>I thought that my other tips from my plug-in Interplak model would fit this.  </li>
            <li>So,so pressure on this new unit.</li>
            <li>But by firing the mouthwash into the gaps in the teeth, it seemed to not only blow away the food lodged there, but leave enough of the mouthwash to kill off the gingivitis and a very fresh feeling in the mouth.   </li>
            <li>Even on low it comes out pretty fast/hard.  </li>
            <li>Love the small size and battery operation.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier that way, especially the first time or two you use it.</li>
            <li>, I wish that I had followed the directions and used distilled water because out hard water quickly clogged the pipes, also this device ran through batteries rather quickly if buying again I would invest in one that plugs into the wall.</li>
            <li>I am very particular about any dental device right down to the floss I use.</li>
            <li>Had to disassemble old unit and remove old applicator with tubing,remove the new end,combine the two.</li>
            <li>The pressure is less than a standard pik but not terrible.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i went back to traveling with my large water pic</li>
            <li>The only thing you may miss are certain attachments you may use at home.</li>
            <li>So if you are looking to finally rid yourself of gingivitis, this is a pretty decently priced product and used in the way above, its should do the trick.</li>
            <li>You can push on the sides of the pik and it is okay, but if you tough the very tip, it falls off as if it was just waiting for you to touch it.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I could say about this that might POSSIBLY be a negative is that the reservoir is not as large as most home models (a-duh).</li>
            <li>EXPECTED SUCH A CHEAP PIECE OF ITEM BY AMAZON OR CONAIR</li>
            <li>I had to replace my old water-pic and found one in Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product 4 years, and although I have to change the batteries frequently, it has worked for me.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive gums, so this water has helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I really like about this is that it&#x27;s very quiet!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s at or just below the #2 setting on an early Water Pik I&#x27;ve used for 3 yrs.  </li>
            <li>The person I gave it to hasn&#x27;t really given me any extensive feedback on how she likes it as yet.</li>
            <li>But I remember the old blast your teeth out water pics.</li>
            <li>It completely broke.</li>
            <li>So far, as per my friends input, the item is matching described quality, I got what I paid for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Save up a chunk and get a real one; my next purchase will be [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The Water Pik has 5 settings and I usually use the #3, but for the first year used the highest setting (#5), which is so powerful that care is needed not to damage your gums.  </li>
            <li>I had a small, cord-operated, previous model that I liked very much, but it finally quit and, of course, Conair discontinued that model.</li>
            <li>, it fit practically everywhere , and final, it&#x27;s been long enough for an item</li>
            <li>But all I had to do was take out the batteries and leave the equipment to dry properly and went back to work just fine.</li>
            <li>This is a problem that would be pretty easily resolved with buttons.&lt;br /&gt;Second, battery life is not particularly good for regular use.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to take the cup off and put it back on, which could potentially spill your prepared irrigation liquid, so just go ahead and get it in place on the seal first and then fill it up.</li>
            <li>This small but powerful water jet really gets into the spaces where food particles can be missed by brushing and flossing.  </li>
            <li>The high and low setting make almost no difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything except super glue and the darned things come off during use, often making a mess.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one of these for several years, but needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>The unit uses 3 batteries and loses power very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Low pressure, tip does not fit securely and leaks (</li>
            <li>Absolutely one of the most useless products I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest not to buy this item, unless you have no other choice.</li>
            <li>It is very small and easy to pack</li>
            <li>Dont usually write reviews but thought worth it for this prodct as it did clear my gingivitis after 10 years of trying (Caveat</li>
            <li>but it is light and small enough that it suits traveling applications.</li>
            <li>If you happen to barely touch any part of your mouth while using this water pik, the tip falls off squirting water all over.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for so small.</li>
            <li>Your mouth won&#x27;t even begin to dry out, so I do not feel this TINY inconvenience is much of an inconvenience.</li>
            <li>but it was hard to use and clogged up after couple months of use, I expected better quality</li>
            <li>But for daily home use, the WJ3CSR is underpowered, and there seems to be absolutely no difference between the high and low settings -- both equally underpowered.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for travel purposes, and I will admit that I did not expect much from something that cost so little... and was battery powered.</li>
            <li>A little too gentle.  </li>
            <li>The batteries (4 AAA) obviously add a little weight, but the unit itself weighs very little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>jet stream is pretty weak even on a new set of battery.</li>
            <li>Before buying this I read several reviews which were good and bad.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> perfect for when I travel</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very intelligently designed with excellent compartments to hold the hose and tips inside the cover for travel.  </li>
            <li> if you are going to travel, this is the best water pick because it runs on 3 AA batteries.</li>
            <li> Great price and deal!</li>
            <li> Best if you by rechargeable batteries and a charger.</li>
            <li> In addition to being perfect for travel, its compact size and battery operation makes it perfect for home use too.</li>
            <li> and this is awesome.</li>
            <li> These grooves help ensure that the reservoir lines up perfectly with the seal.</li>
            <li> works well and the travel size is perfect.</li>
            <li> but I got lithium batteries and works great for me.!  </li>
            <li> Works great and is the perfect size to store away when not in use.</li>
            <li> He loved it!</li>
            <li> Everything is perfect in time and the price is good.</li>
            <li> For kids, it might be great</li>
            <li> Kept hoping that I could get one that worked because portability would be great.</li>
            <li> The convenience of having replaceable batteries is great.</li>
            <li> Great seller.  </li>
            <li> GREAT SHIPPING TIME.</li>
            <li> Great travel accessory</li>
            <li> so I was happy in the end.  </li>
            <li> great price.  </li>
            <li> this size is great and no electric cord is another plus</li>
            <li> the features are very nice; however i can&#x27;t keep it from pumping water out the bottom as well as from the nozzle.</li>
            <li> In fact this one thing alone, considering the price, I think impressed me the most.</li>
            <li> Item works fairly well, but the tip has to  be held in while using it and the &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button isn&#x27;t always very effective.</li>
            <li> No question in my mind that this should be given 5 brightly glistening stars.</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s a good thing for your situation, you will like this unit</li>
            <li> Works Great &amp; packs nicely for travel</li>
            <li> Good for travelers with dental issues.  </li>
            <li> IT IS A TOY GOOD FOR NOTHING</li>
            <li> Price wise</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon is a good company to use.</li>
            <li> this is a good thing to have when you travel.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic price for an awesome product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s surprising.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> But not so good for every day use.</li>
            <li> Good pick for battery operated</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a child, I am happy because it is very easy to use, plus its easy movement between the restrooms and the results in oral hygiene are excellent.</li>
            <li> I would rather spend more money and get a good one!</li>
            <li> The price is right and perfect for traveling!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> With the exception of 3 AA batteries rather than electricity for power, I love it!  </li>
            <li> AND WHEN IT WENT OUT I WAS SO HAPPY TO FINE ONE AGAIN.</li>
            <li> not purchase these kind of items from conair again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Awesome product fast shipping recommend</li>
            <li> You will need your own AA batteries.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> I used to own a Waterpik and this in my opinion is comparable.</li>
            <li> Its not quite as strong as the highest setting on a Waterpic, but that strength makes my gums bleed, so for me this is a very good fit.</li>
            <li> I love it and am confident you will too, plus you cannot beat the price!</li>
            <li> Good news is that I got a credit immediately, and a free shipping label to return it.</li>
            <li> this unit is Very light.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t as powerful or strong as the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; waterpik, but it&#x27;s great to take with you when you are away from home.......</li>
            <li> It has a propensity to tip over and the battery cover will not close, so, water + electricity - need I say more?</li>
            <li> a toothbrush does a much better job.</li>
            <li> that was much better.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s Ok</li>
            <li> , not if you go on cruises as most ships do not have electricity in the bathrooms and trying to use one of these out of the bathroom</li>
            <li> it does work ok .</li>
            <li> Like I said, its better than nothing, but  its power doesn&#x27;t compare  to the power of electrical jets.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i shld have saved and bought a better product</li>
            <li> recommend using the Rechargable AA since they are more durable.</li>
            <li> The most egregious is that it is &amp;</li>
            <li> WJ3CSR in order to save some bathroom counter space and have something more convenient to travel with.</li>
            <li> I have been using water pick products for 40 years, but this one is my all-time favorite.</li>
            <li> Seems kind of cheap</li>
            <li> This proved a much better choice.  </li>
            <li> Love that it has 2 adapters that are color coded so we can tell whose is whose.</li>
            <li> The more I use it, the better my gums feel, so for me, it works well.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad you did as you may need to refill a time or two...</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints and have had no problems after 3 years, or maybe more.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better than nothing.  </li>
            <li> This product uses 2 AA batteries, the batteries need replacing often, but the overall operation of this appliance is great to good.</li>
            <li> Have had on of these for years and love it.</li>
            <li> This product works as it was intended and is okay to have around.</li>
            <li> Sent a better model than the one in the ad.</li>
            <li> Best price for the larger model</li>
            <li> Might be ok for travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this oral irrigator for more than 5 years and haven&#x27;t had any problems, at the beginning</li>
            <li> Found this item to be underpowered bit better than nothing while traveling.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> This machine is outstanding, it met all my needs and expectations.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recomended this product and said that it was better than using dental floss.</li>
            <li> However, rechargebles will keep it working until I can get a better device.</li>
            <li> love this item, can take it anywhere</li>
            <li> , if you go away you can fit it in your suitcase!</li>
            <li> great , better than I expected, easy to use and does great job</li>
            <li> Not enough pressure to do a very good job of cleaning</li>
            <li> Cheap is Cheap!</li>
            <li> I was able to return this product for better (cost me more, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this was a fair product but its really just wetting your teeth.</li>
            <li> It is light, elegant, easy for travellers use.</li>
            <li> Good price had to get batteries separately, works well love how clean my mouth (braces) feels after I use it would recommend if you wants save a couple dollars</li>
            <li> The attachments fall off easily.  </li>
            <li> easy to use and can take with you when traveling</li>
            <li> That said, I&#x27;m continuing to use it, because it&#x27;s so easy to store.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, compact, and travels compactly, (put a couple of pieces of tape on each side to keep it together/closed in my ditty bag).  </li>
            <li> The company was easy to have replaced.  </li>
            <li> The flow wasn&#x27;t as strong to wash away food particles.</li>
            <li> On its strong setting</li>
            <li> Worked decently for a while with good power but after a couple weeks it was falling apart and wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s about perfect, and certainly adequate for the intended purpose, in my opinion, to last through a trip even if you are used to full blast from a plug-in.</li>
            <li> Its fine, never used one before so dont know what to expect.</li>
            <li> I bought this to travel with, and the pressure works fine for me.</li>
            <li> Very nice for just general use.</li>
            <li> This little thing is awesome!.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this item , because  I wanted to use it on my vacation where no electricity was available.</li>
            <li> But not so much for home use unless you happen to work at or own stock in a battery</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, the nozzles don&#x27;t fit securely in the handle.</li>
            <li> Just what the dentist told me to get something light.</li>
            <li> The tips don&#x27;t fit securely into the tube where the water comes out and they are always falling out.  </li>
            <li> holes\\&quot; to fit into for storage, and once the cover (the upside-down reservoir) is on nothing will move.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For use take off the cover/reservoir, flip it over and fit it onto the seal...</li>
            <li> It was great for international travel because I didn&#x27;t need to worry about power conversion.</li>
            <li> this cheap to keep on working.</li>
            <li> The unit is light so it slides even tho</li>
            <li> wish Conair would revise the device with a better tip connector, since it could be a useful travel&lt;br /&gt;water pick.</li>
            <li> With fresh (weeks) batteries and on the full power setting you&#x27;ll get a pretty darn good squirt.</li>
            <li> light and powerful!</li>
            <li> Its also a more pleasant experience than flossing especially if you use HOT WATER (another free tip).</li>
            <li> This little hummer is remarkable!</li>
            <li> a sprays water all over while trying to clean my teeth</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly to clean my gums.  </li>
            <li> I have dentures and had implants for my bottom teeth and need to clean them.  </li>
            <li> If mine ever were to break I would most certainly purchase another one just like it.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s very handy, light weight, easy to travel with - Highly recommended for those on the move.  </li>
            <li> But it operates on AA btteries and the water pressure is too low to do a good cleaning job.</li>
            <li> We have tried it out and found it to be what we desired, a good dental irrigator completely independent of electical outlet variances so that it can be used in any country.</li>
            <li> I use a full size</li>
            <li> I have a full sized water pic..</li>
            <li> This device is very practical for those on the road and would need to maintain a healthy gum.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t enough power to do any good.</li>
            <li> I have traveled with it more times than I could count and without even taking any real care in packing it (just stick in among my clothes in the suitcase), everything, cover included, always arrives</li>
            <li> I never have my home unit on full blast so for me</li>
            <li> Perhaps I got a good one, I don&#x27;t know, but it has even functioned as my main home unit for a couple of weeks during a main unit break-down</li>
            <li> If the water runs out, just fill it up again, it&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li> , I refill the tank 2 times for every use three times per day and for more than two week I still use the same charge, so probably the battery issue will go away as they get better.</li>
            <li> I got the alternating current type instead of battery operated  and am super loving it.</li>
            <li> The reservoir can be pulled off of the seal it is currently sitting on, flipped over and slid right over top of the unit, encasing everything and becoming one self-contained entity.</li>
            <li> little one worked great..</li>
            <li> It might use a few batteries but using the rechargeable ones works great.</li>
            <li> It proves you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a useful item for me</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is worth returning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use rechargeable batteries and get a month&#x27;s worth of use before recharging.</li>
            <li> NIce design if only it worked and was not a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> This only has one kind of nozzle, which is nothing fancy</li>
            <li> If you need its worth trying for the $.</li>
            <li> Given that it is battery-operated and does not have an adapter, I&#x27;m not unhappy with its performance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Eats batteries and isn&#x27;t terribly powerful (not that you should be power-washing your gums anyway).</li>
            <li> Since this is the first \\&quot;machine\\&quot; of this kind I&#x27;ve ever used, I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect as far as power and speed with which the water comes out of the nozzles...  </li>
            <li> Just Right For Traveling</li>
            <li> They were right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad but it certainly has a couple flaws.  </li>
            <li> I have a great tountertop water pic, but needed a small compact one for traveling.  </li>
            <li> So...IF you have the cup filled and ready to go and then turn it on and no water comes out, it&#x27;s because the cup is not on the seal correctly, almost certainly because you DIDN&#x27;T slide the cup into the groove guides.</li>
            <li> should have spent more cheap</li>
            <li> Was surprised the item came with two water oils but didn&#x27;t produce strong force of water.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but I really don&#x27;t need it since I had the older one repaired.  </li>
            <li> I believe that this was down to the fact that I filled the liquid container with quarter of the available space with mouthwash (any cheap one will do).</li>
            <li> It also uses batteries very fast.</li>
            <li> if you need more than one filling to dwell on all your teeth, what&#x27;s the big deal?  </li>
            <li> Ordered first one.  </li>
            <li> first use tips pop off got sprayed.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S FIRST BATTERIES.  </li>
            <li> Overall, My gums have felt much better, and my mouth feels refreshed after each use.</li>
            <li> I first tried using rechargeable batteries</li>
            <li> it does the job very well!</li>
            <li> THe first one lasted longer than I thought it would.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dislike that it doesn&#x27;t have plug-in capability, but this new one seems to have better battery life than my old one.  </li>
            <li> too weak would have liked more strength</li>
            <li> Product is &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; its so small..however, the stream that comes out isn&#x27;t strong enough to clean my teeth, I still must floss even with new batteries.</li>
            <li> This unit was a good idea, small and compact.</li>
            <li> Bought thi sbecause small size was good for the sink or counter</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it was batter operated, but I guess it will be good for trips, when I usually don&#x27;t take one.</li>
            <li> It is compact &amp; easy to travel &amp; the batteries give plenty of power--which is something I was concerned about prior to the purchase.  </li>
            <li> (that was years ago now) and what sold me on this unit was how many people raved about how long the batteries lasted, and how much power they provided.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact and the stream is strong enough BUT the tips don&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> I like the large unit I have</li>
            <li> I tried both tips and even tried to insert one from an Oral B which were too large for this unit to accommodate.</li>
            <li> (These were a newer NiZn rechargeable that work fine in my digital camera.)</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s much easier to refill than the one piece units, so</li>
            <li> I received this as a placeholder until I get my &#x27;real&#x27; water pick</li>
            <li> very underpowered.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference between the nozzles either.  </li>
            <li> It does not take up much room nor ties up a receptacle.</li>
            <li> but really works well.</li>
            <li> I have very close teeth</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It might look straight and sealed, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re similar but they don&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> This worked very well.</li>
            <li> Conair Interplak Dental Water Jet is a very compact unit that operates on batteries.  </li>
            <li> it does not have that much pressure.</li>
            <li> but you really have to go at it with floss too.  </li>
            <li> They really need to pull these products and start over or just give it up and stick with curling irons.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a decent one, and this is the first fabulous one I found.  </li>
            <li> The water pressure was very strong, enough to clear any debris, though it rather hurt if accidentally directly at gums.</li>
            <li> I really got this to irrigate the sides of the back of my throat, but have also tried it to clean between my teeth as well.  </li>
            <li> Finally agreed with me and said they could nothing and to return it to original seller.</li>
            <li> In fact, it is my second one with the first lasting more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> I used other Water Jets before and their water pressure was much better.</li>
            <li> I have used an electric water jet in the past and find it is much more powerful than this battery operated one.  </li>
            <li> I can tell my teeth aren&#x27;t as clean as they get with a larger, outlet powered Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> but only if I am not wearing a shirt and if I have time to clean up the sink area when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> It is messy to use at first, but once you get the hang of it is okay.  </li>
            <li> Use very new batteries.  </li>
            <li> This is a small handy size for traveling.</li>
            <li> Nice feature in a small area - no cord to deal with.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for travel, and at first I thought the water pressure could be increased, but then I realized pressure too high is not good for my sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only draw back is that the lid needs a better snap-shut system.  </li>
            <li> That noted -- on my home unit (the main brand)</li>
            <li> Product broke after only 3 months of 1 person mild use.</li>
            <li> simple to use grand daughter uses it without being told too hope it lastes.small enought to be left out on the counter</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for travel.</li>
            <li> It is is travel friendly and nice and compact,  but it failed to meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Of course it IS a little travel model that isn&#x27;t made of gold, but it holds up well... and over time and over many miles.</li>
            <li> It makes a humming noise and jiggles in place a little, but water isn&#x27;t sloshing out of the top with people running and screaming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I normally go through 2 cups or a little more</li>
            <li> You have to hold on to the nozzle thing to keep it effective but its not too hard to do.</li>
            <li> I am an adult with braces and I use a lot of water (the full container on a larger home unit)</li>
            <li> Does not have enough powerful water stream</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s normal for this.</li>
            <li> The price was right and I will put it to use shortly.</li>
            <li> I thought that my other tips from my plug-in Interplak model would fit this.  </li>
            <li> So,so pressure on this new unit.</li>
            <li> But by firing the mouthwash into the gaps in the teeth, it seemed to not only blow away the food lodged there, but leave enough of the mouthwash to kill off the gingivitis and a very fresh feeling in the mouth.   </li>
            <li> Even on low it comes out pretty fast/hard.  </li>
            <li> Love the small size and battery operation.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier that way, especially the first time or two you use it.</li>
            <li> , I wish that I had followed the directions and used distilled water because out hard water quickly clogged the pipes, also this device ran through batteries rather quickly if buying again I would invest in one that plugs into the wall.</li>
            <li> I am very particular about any dental device right down to the floss I use.</li>
            <li> Had to disassemble old unit and remove old applicator with tubing,remove the new end,combine the two.</li>
            <li> The pressure is less than a standard pik but not terrible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i went back to traveling with my large water pic</li>
            <li> The only thing you may miss are certain attachments you may use at home.</li>
            <li> So if you are looking to finally rid yourself of gingivitis, this is a pretty decently priced product and used in the way above, its should do the trick.</li>
            <li> You can push on the sides of the pik and it is okay, but if you tough the very tip, it falls off as if it was just waiting for you to touch it.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I could say about this that might POSSIBLY be a negative is that the reservoir is not as large as most home models (a-duh).</li>
            <li> EXPECTED SUCH A CHEAP PIECE OF ITEM BY AMAZON OR CONAIR</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old water-pic and found one in Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product 4 years, and although I have to change the batteries frequently, it has worked for me.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive gums, so this water has helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I really like about this is that it&#x27;s very quiet!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s at or just below the #2 setting on an early Water Pik I&#x27;ve used for 3 yrs.  </li>
            <li> The person I gave it to hasn&#x27;t really given me any extensive feedback on how she likes it as yet.</li>
            <li> But I remember the old blast your teeth out water pics.</li>
            <li> It completely broke.</li>
            <li> So far, as per my friends input, the item is matching described quality, I got what I paid for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Save up a chunk and get a real one; my next purchase will be [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The Water Pik has 5 settings and I usually use the #3, but for the first year used the highest setting (#5), which is so powerful that care is needed not to damage your gums.  </li>
            <li> I had a small, cord-operated, previous model that I liked very much, but it finally quit and, of course, Conair discontinued that model.</li>
            <li> , it fit practically everywhere , and final, it&#x27;s been long enough for an item</li>
            <li> But all I had to do was take out the batteries and leave the equipment to dry properly and went back to work just fine.</li>
            <li> This is a problem that would be pretty easily resolved with buttons.&lt;br /&gt;Second, battery life is not particularly good for regular use.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to take the cup off and put it back on, which could potentially spill your prepared irrigation liquid, so just go ahead and get it in place on the seal first and then fill it up.</li>
            <li> This small but powerful water jet really gets into the spaces where food particles can be missed by brushing and flossing.  </li>
            <li> The high and low setting make almost no difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything except super glue and the darned things come off during use, often making a mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for several years, but needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> The unit uses 3 batteries and loses power very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Low pressure, tip does not fit securely and leaks (</li>
            <li> Absolutely one of the most useless products I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest not to buy this item, unless you have no other choice.</li>
            <li> It is very small and easy to pack</li>
            <li> Dont usually write reviews but thought worth it for this prodct as it did clear my gingivitis after 10 years of trying (Caveat</li>
            <li> but it is light and small enough that it suits traveling applications.</li>
            <li> If you happen to barely touch any part of your mouth while using this water pik, the tip falls off squirting water all over.  </li>
            <li> Not bad for so small.</li>
            <li> Your mouth won&#x27;t even begin to dry out, so I do not feel this TINY inconvenience is much of an inconvenience.</li>
            <li> but it was hard to use and clogged up after couple months of use, I expected better quality</li>
            <li> But for daily home use, the WJ3CSR is underpowered, and there seems to be absolutely no difference between the high and low settings -- both equally underpowered.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for travel purposes, and I will admit that I did not expect much from something that cost so little... and was battery powered.</li>
            <li> A little too gentle.  </li>
            <li> The batteries (4 AAA) obviously add a little weight, but the unit itself weighs very little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> jet stream is pretty weak even on a new set of battery.</li>
            <li> Before buying this I read several reviews which were good and bad.</li>
            <li> IT APPEARS TO HAVE ENOUGH POWER TO BLOW THE STUFF FROM BETWEEN TIGHT TEETH, EVEN THOUGH IT IS MUCH LESS POWERFUL THAN THE 120 VOLT MODELS.  </li>
            <li> Even the maximum setting feels a little weak, but it&#x27;s ok for short term use.  </li>
            <li> and they were a tiny bit larger than single-use batteries, did sort of fit, but not well enough for power to flow, and it made it difficult to install the middle battery of the three.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough.</li>
            <li> this unit did not last long</li>
            <li> Batteries don&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> and they last really long</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, unless you are flat stony broke and need a water jet ASAP, I can&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> Same gizmos and gadgets that was all said to be included though so, not a whole big a deal.</li>
            <li> I was not careful when reading the description, because I will not willingly buy anything battery-powered.</li>
            <li> This reservoir, in the photo, is setting down tightly onto a seal, ready to be used (as is one of the wands.</li>
            <li> This looked like a great product, but unfortunately I was unable to travel and try out until the last week of December 2014.</li>
            <li> Too light, the water jet comes off when water come through it which makes it useless.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Interplak Water Jet to take on my week long vacation.</li>
            <li> It requires one hand to keep the button on the pic pressed so you don&#x27;t squirt water all over your bathroom, one hand to turn the knob and one hand to keep the unit from flipping over since the knob is harder to turn than the entire unit.  </li>
            <li> will buy another when this one gives out witch could be a long yime.</li>
            <li> Really helps get the little hidden pieces of food.</li>
            <li> feared that it would be a flimsy contraption that would break during transport, wobble all over the counter while in operation, leak water everywhere because of a less-than-secure seal, not have enough power because of the batteries resulting in a not very powerful jet of water, and that whatever power it did have would diminish quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> green reservoir/cup shown in the photo acts as a cover for the entire unit, which you have likely figured out by now.</li>
            <li> Has limited power</li>
            <li> complained again they actually sent a third one, same results.  </li>
            <li> I looked at a few other models and they&#x27;re all so loud they would reverberate throughout the building.</li>
            <li> Blows the tip off, loosely put together.</li>
            <li> In lieu of a third hand you can do what I do, and pin the thing down with an elbow.  </li>
            <li> Second let down with Conair.  </li>
            <li> We received the Conair W13CS Interplak Dental Water Jet sooner than we had expected.</li>
            <li> I tried twisting it, pushing it in harder</li>
            <li> Very weak&lt;br /&gt;In 3 uses the connection between the cord and the pik get broken</li>
            <li> It is NOT really of a sturdy-build.</li>
            <li> Due to the positives and minuses involved I can only rate this product at3 stars, as it took a little genius from yours truly to acheive the desired result.  </li>
            <li> This water pick is not very powerful.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful.</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed it doesn&#x27;t hold very much water and doesn&#x27;t have much power</li>
            <li> However that&#x27;s a small problem compared the the pluses - including a bigger water chamber than any other travel pic.  </li>
            <li> This may be due to a brittle gasket - judging by the reviews, I think my item may have been sitting on the shelf for a while.  </li>
            <li> You must use the other hand to keep it in.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it does bought for someone other them</li>
            <li> other thing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In comparison to other Dental Water Jets on the market</li>
            <li> It is small enough to take on trips or to college.  </li>
            <li> Biggest issue is that the cover which is also the water container has no latch or snap or other device to hold it on.</li>
            <li> After other things fell apart weeks into using it.</li>
            <li> When I got it, the spring holding the negative end of one of the batteries was crushed flat, so the battery was loose.  </li>
            <li> And I mean BARELY.  </li>
            <li> so I tried one that my father had, but found out too much pressure is not good for me, so that was a plus, another thing I like is the small size</li>
            <li> Regardless, the problem is not worth the cost to ship it for repairs - I will just save my money for the other product as I suggest everyone should.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use your water jet very long (the water quantity is small) or on a very high setting (the stream is very weak), you might like this.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to clean your teeth with this product.</li>
            <li> At least I have double the working length.</li>
            <li> I want this portable one as backup when the Water Pik fails until a replacement can be found, and because it is very portable for travel use.</li>
            <li> how do you get to all your teeth if it stops squirting when you turn it upside down?  </li>
            <li> So, I agree with the previous reviewers.</li>
            <li> The bottom of the tub chipped at a slight bump.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It makes a mess in the bathroom shooting water</li>
            <li> seal is remarkably tight and</li>
            <li> and it does not clean the teeth.  </li>
            <li> It does not clean anything that&#x27;s caught in between your teeth.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to use when we are vacationing (especially cruises where there are no outlets in the bathrooms) and it is exceptionally weak.</li>
            <li> it was with a little help from me</li>
            <li> By that time I was beyond the return policy window and have little choice but to garage the unit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost a little</li>
            <li> Everything... the wand, tips, and cord all have little \\&quot;cubby</li>
            <li> it does have some little rubber pads.  </li>
            <li> BUT THE LITTLE BUGGER HAS BEEN CHUGGING ALONG FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW</li>
            <li> After a few days use, here is what I found out.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> To review this product I would say \\&quot;Don&#x27;t Waste Your Money!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> waste your money</li>
            <li> A WASTE OF MONEY</li>
            <li> After approximately 30 days of daily use, the unit started to leak, flooding the battery compartment and pooling on the counter.</li>
            <li> This is compact and probably meant for travel and not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> This thing was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Waste of weight in my suitcase... and speaking of weight...</li>
            <li> MY TIP- Set the reservoir firmly onto the seal BEFORE you fill it with water.</li>
            <li> Use the grooves and all you have to do is give a firm push and the cup is sealed.</li>
            <li> Just LEAVE the reservoir/cup firmly attached to the seal and fill it from your measuring cup, mug, thermos, the tap, whatever.</li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> I EVEN BOUGHT A FEW FOR CHISTMAS GIFTS.</li>
            <li> I found that it doesn&#x27;t do the job that it was designed to do and it is quite messy to use, as the liquid can not be retained in the mouth as you use it.</li>
            <li> Only thing is sometimes the tank is hard to pull off from the base, so once I accidentally soaked the whole thing.</li>
            <li> so very little pulsing effect&lt;</li>
            <li> Some of the bad were that the tank was to small, the tip keep coming off and the batteries ran out to fast.</li>
            <li> I like this because it is small and doesn&#x27;t have a cord.</li>
            <li> Also, I have arthritis and the knob is so small</li>
            <li> Then, the small waterjet attachment started popping out during use (I did try another attachment; it popped out, as well).</li>
            <li> to me this is the first time I have been disappointed in any product I bought through Amazon.</li>
            <li> The tank is small just refill if needed.</li>
            <li> SMALL, BUT WORKS WELL.</li>
            <li> the batteries are stacked in a small space.  </li>
            <li> ill buy two extra at that price.</li>
            <li> Im not pleased at all with this product</li>
            <li> The reservoir is too small.</li>
            <li> This has no more power than my shower head.</li>
            <li> The water pressure is a little weak</li>
            <li> However, in addition with flossing it helped clear my gingivitis which I had found nearly impossible to do.</li>
            <li> Makes it hard to pack</li>
            <li> complained to service dept.</li>
            <li> My complaint is that when I tried to use it, there was no way to keep the handle tips in place which fell out repeatedly.</li>
            <li> The open design of the water container made it occasionally awkward to use, however.</li>
            <li> The tip shown on the wand will be removed and stored in the base next to the other tip shown).  </li>
            <li> However, it does work and it is very small, so</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The unit worked as intended but quit working after around 12 uses. Cheap is Cheap!</li>
            <li> perfect for when I travel</li>
            <li> The others are ridiculous.  This one works.  One serious hint:  when not in use, take the batteries out and store them separately.  I have ruined three of these by the batteries corroding while the thing was stored between trips.</li>
            <li> I like this because it is small and doesn&#x27;t have a cord. The batteries lasted me about 5  or 6 weeks. Its not quite as strong as the highest setting on a Waterpic, but that strength makes my gums bleed, so for me this is a very good fit.</li>
            <li> very weak spray and it does not clean the teeth.  I returned for credit.  I like the large unit I have but this portable is no good.</li>
            <li> Low pressure, tip does not fit securely and leaks (likely why the pressure is low) switch is finicky.</li>
            <li> I have a great tountertop water pic, but needed a small compact one for traveling.  I&#x27;ve tried others and they are all awful. The ones that are one-piece like the Panasonic not only have a small chamber, but are very awkward to use - how do you get to all your teeth if it stops squirting when you turn it upside down?  I found myself doing contortions to try to get to the inside of my lower teeth.  I searched high and low for a decent one, and this is the first fabulous one I found.  It&#x27;s very intelligently designed with excellent compartments to hold the hose and tips inside the cover for travel.  The only draw back is that the lid needs a better snap-shut system.  I have to tape mine on when I travel.  However that&#x27;s a small problem compared the the pluses - including a bigger water chamber than any other travel pic.  And it&#x27;s much easier to refill than the one piece units, so if you need more than one filling to dwell on all your teeth, what&#x27;s the big deal?  I&#x27;m buying them as presents for friends.</li>
            <li> This is a small handy size for traveling. That is why I bought it. But it operates on AA btteries and the water pressure is too low to do a good cleaning job.</li>
            <li> I received this as a placeholder until I get my &#x27;real&#x27; water pick and now it is literally doing that on my bathroom counter.  It was purchased at a closeout store for under $15.  I had no problems with the volume of the reservoir or battery life; perhaps I am not being thorough enough in my cleaning, but I digress.  My issues are with its design.  It has a propensity to tip over and the battery cover will not close, so, water + electricity - need I say more? Also, as stated by another reviewer, the tip pops off, which mine did regardless of the setting or whether the end was blocked.  This may be due to a brittle gasket - judging by the reviews, I think my item may have been sitting on the shelf for a while.  Regardless, the problem is not worth the cost to ship it for repairs - I will just save my money for the other product as I suggest everyone should.</li>
            <li> I bought this for traveling, but the tip pops out of the handle several times while in use.  I have to push the tip back in (with my teeth) again, and again &amp; again.  Also, I have arthritis and the knob is so small, I have to use tools to turn it on/off, depending on how my fingers are working that day.</li>
            <li> Just Right For Traveling</li>
            <li> I ordered this to use when we are vacationing (especially cruises where there are no outlets in the bathrooms) and it is exceptionally weak. If you don&#x27;t use your water jet very long (the water quantity is small) or on a very high setting (the stream is very weak), you might like this. I am an adult with braces and I use a lot of water (the full container on a larger home unit) so I have to fill this four or five times. Also, with braces a person needs the power of the home unit and this isn&#x27;t even close on its highest power. For kids, it might be great (they have a shorter attention span and don&#x27;t seem to like the stronger settings. That noted -- on my home unit (the main brand), I use my waterpick only on the lowest or second to the lowest settings and this unit isn&#x27;t even close to that strength. If that&#x27;s a good thing for your situation, you will like this unit</li>
            <li> For a kid only...otherwise it is JUNK</li>
            <li> worthless, in the trash</li>
            <li> Ordered first one.  first use tips pop off got sprayed.  complained to service dept. they sent a second one, same results.  complained again they actually sent a third one, same results.  Something wrong with the design.  Finally agreed with me and said they could nothing and to return it to original seller. Kept hoping that I could get one that worked because portability would be great.</li>
            <li> Blows the tip off, loosely put together. Had to disassemble old unit and remove old applicator with tubing,remove the new end,combine the two. At least I have double the working length. So,so pressure on this new unit. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again with the direction this product is going.</li>
            <li> Water pressure is very weak, so the stream is insufficient. Then, the small waterjet attachment started popping out during use (I did try another attachment; it popped out, as well). Unfortunately, I&#x27;d rate the product useless. I had a small, cord-operated, previous model that I liked very much, but it finally quit and, of course, Conair discontinued that model.</li>
            <li> After a few days use, here is what I found out.&lt;br /&gt;The jet stream is pretty weak even on a new set of battery. You don&#x27;t have the \\&quot;pick\\&quot; feeling of your teeth. The high and low setting make almost no difference. However, it does work. It is light, elegant, easy for travellers use. If your intended to use daily in house as I do, look something else.</li>
            <li> We received the Conair W13CS Interplak Dental Water Jet sooner than we had expected. We have tried it out and found it to be what we desired, a good dental irrigator completely independent of electical outlet variances so that it can be used in any country.</li>
            <li> This water pick is not very powerful. The water stream is weak. However, it does work and it is very small, so if you are going to travel, this is the best water pick because it runs on 3 AA batteries. You can not take an ac device with you to Europe, Africa, Russia, or Asia because the outlets are different! So I have to give this product a 5 for travel but a 1 for home use (3 overall).</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old water-pic and found one in Amazon.  The price was right and I will put it to use shortly.</li>
            <li> very underpowered. The pick part is difficult to hold into the hand piece. You must use the other hand to keep it in. It proves you get what you pay for. I did not realize this was a battery operated unit so that is why it is probably underpowered.</li>
            <li> great , better than I expected, easy to use and does great job</li>
            <li> This product was a disappointment. It has sufficient pressure but squirts water just about everywhere except in your mouth. The attachments fall off easily.  It is is travel friendly and nice and compact,  but it failed to meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Since this is the first \\&quot;machine\\&quot; of this kind I&#x27;ve ever used, I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect as far as power and speed with which the water comes out of the nozzles...  Even on low it comes out pretty fast/hard.  I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference between the nozzles either.  I really got this to irrigate the sides of the back of my throat, but have also tried it to clean between my teeth as well.  I&#x27;m still trying to master the art of using it so that I don&#x27;t get a bath and don&#x27;t soak my sink area and mirror.  I now always have a hand on the on/off switch to turn it off when it gets out of control.</li>
            <li> Good price had to get batteries separately, works well love how clean my mouth (braces) feels after I use it would recommend if you wants save a couple dollars</li>
            <li> Was disappointed with the water pressure.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a useful item for me but it has no real power for an adult&#x27;s mouth or teeth.  It does not clean anything that&#x27;s caught in between your teeth. a toothbrush does a much better job. to me this is the first time I have been disappointed in any product I bought through Amazon. Sorry this items gets an F from me - failed to do the job.  and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of crap.  The heads won&#x27;t even stay in under pressure so you end up having to hold the entire unit almost inside your mouth to keep it from popping off.</li>
            <li> It is very small and easy to pack</li>
            <li> Battery run pump is way underpowered.  Had a plug in version before that was much better.</li>
            <li> Who need a simple waterpik  i recommend that.  Everything is perfect in time and the price is good. it&#x27;s Ok</li>
            <li> It works fine, but I really don&#x27;t need it since I had the older one repaired.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I like this, I wish that I had followed the directions and used distilled water because out hard water quickly clogged the pipes, also this device ran through batteries rather quickly if buying again I would invest in one that plugs into the wall.</li>
            <li> Dont usually write reviews but thought worth it for this prodct as it did clear my gingivitis after 10 years of trying (Caveat it was with a little help from me so continue reading).   So, I agree with the previous reviewers. You have to hold on to the nozzle thing to keep it effective but its not too hard to do. It also uses batteries very fast. However, in addition with flossing it helped clear my gingivitis which I had found nearly impossible to do. I believe that this was down to the fact that I filled the liquid container with quarter of the available space with mouthwash (any cheap one will do). But by firing the mouthwash into the gaps in the teeth, it seemed to not only blow away the food lodged there, but leave enough of the mouthwash to kill off the gingivitis and a very fresh feeling in the mouth.   Its also a more pleasant experience than flossing especially if you use HOT WATER (another free tip). So instead of flossing twice every day, I only floss as part of my evening routine which is floss, water jet (with mouthwash), then brush.  Due to the positives and minuses involved I can only rate this product at3 stars, as it took a little genius from yours truly to acheive the desired result.  So if you are looking to finally rid yourself of gingivitis, this is a pretty decently priced product and used in the way above, its should do the trick.</li>
            <li> easy to use and can take with you when traveling</li>
            <li> Works Great &amp; packs nicely for travel</li>
            <li> I purchased this Interplak Water Jet to take on my week long vacation. It worked 2 days and then started to eject the wand. Even on low setting the wand would not stay in. I tried twisting it, pushing it in harder but nothing worked. I was very disappointed in this product. I have gum problems that necessitate a water pick. I purchased this one so I would not have to take my larger electic one from home. After 2 days of vacation I was without a water pick. To review this product I would say \\&quot;Don&#x27;t Waste Your Money!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for several years, but needed a new one.  I dislike that it doesn&#x27;t have plug-in capability, but this new one seems to have better battery life than my old one.  I always carry extra batteries just in case, but didn&#x27;t need them during our last trip of three weeks.  Good for travelers with dental issues.  I use a full size Interplak at home.</li>
            <li> It worked poorly literally one time, then a belt snapped inside and it never worked again.</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed it doesn&#x27;t hold very much water and doesn&#x27;t have much power and now it come part a sprays water all over while trying to clean my teeth</li>
            <li> I have a full sized water pic..&lt;br /&gt;works great,,&lt;br /&gt;but, not if you go on cruises as most ships do not have electricity in the bathrooms and trying to use one of these out of the bathroom is a horror.&lt;br /&gt;the big ones are also a pain to pack.&lt;br /&gt;this little one worked great..&lt;br /&gt;much easier to pack and I found the water pressure to be equal to my fancy version water pic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVISION: 2 months later it died&lt;br /&gt;just died.no warning.&lt;br /&gt;cannot recommend an item that dies like this.&lt;br /&gt;i went back to traveling with my large water pic flosser.&lt;br /&gt;will not purchase these kind of items from conair again.&lt;br /&gt;great blowdryers...subpar technology on dental appliances</li>
            <li> I ordered this item , because  I wanted to use it on my vacation where no electricity was available. it does work ok . Like I said, its better than nothing, but  its power doesn&#x27;t compare  to the power of electrical jets. You need to change batteries often. Twice a week.  I would suggest not to buy this item, unless you have no other choice.</li>
            <li> Very weak&lt;br /&gt;In 3 uses the connection between the cord and the pik get broken doesnt fit&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your money</li>
            <li> Requires a battery, the default switch his on so you have to constantly hold the pause button to make it quit spraying</li>
            <li> Works great and is the perfect size to store away when not in use.</li>
            <li> Has limited power but it is light and small enough that it suits traveling applications.</li>
            <li> Water pressure is low.</li>
            <li> Before buying this I read several reviews which were good and bad. Some of the bad were that the tank was to small, the tip keep coming off and the batteries ran out to fast. The tank is small just refill if needed. No problem with the tip coming off. Don&#x27;t know about the batteries. Haven&#x27;t had it long enough. This was a gift for my husband and he is picky. He loved it! Great price and deal!</li>
            <li> BUT THE LITTLE BUGGER HAS BEEN CHUGGING ALONG FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW ON IT&#x27;S FIRST BATTERIES.  IT APPEARS TO HAVE ENOUGH POWER TO BLOW THE STUFF FROM BETWEEN TIGHT TEETH, EVEN THOUGH IT IS MUCH LESS POWERFUL THAN THE 120 VOLT MODELS.  THIS DOES HAVE BENIFIT, AS IT DOES NOT CAUSE DAMAGE OR BLEEDING.</li>
            <li> This is the second portable Interplak water flosser I buy. The convenience of having replaceable batteries is great. Best if you by rechargeable batteries and a charger.</li>
            <li> IT IS A TOY GOOD FOR NOTHING A WASTE OF MONEY&lt;br /&gt;NEVER EXPECTED SUCH A CHEAP PIECE OF ITEM BY AMAZON OR CONAIR</li>
            <li> extremely weak pressure so very little pulsing effect&lt;br /&gt;i shld have saved and bought a better product&lt;br /&gt;dont buy this</li>
            <li> This device is very practical for those on the road and would need to maintain a healthy gum. Price wise it&#x27;s affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not drain the AA batteries at an accelerated rate&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using the Rechargable AA since they are more durable. This device could have been improved if it was designed to run on an adaptor. Overall, it&#x27;s very handy, light weight, easy to travel with - Highly recommended for those on the move.  Thank you</li>
            <li> this unit did not last long it has aready quit working it  did not last one week. I don&#x27;t think it is worth returning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is a good company to use.</li>
            <li> Awesome product fast shipping recommend</li>
            <li> Hideous.  The water leaks into the battery compartment after a few uses, corroding my expensive rechargeable batteries.  Serious design flaw -- why would the water compartment not be seperate from the battery compartment?  This makes no sense at all and this product should be avoided at all costs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact and the stream is strong enough BUT the tips don&#x27;t stay on. I&#x27;ve tried everything except super glue and the darned things come off during use, often making a mess.</li>
            <li> tip wont stay inserted it is useless</li>
            <li> the features are very nice; however i can&#x27;t keep it from pumping water out the bottom as well as from the nozzle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad but it certainly has a couple flaws.  The most egregious is that it is &amp;#34;three handed&amp;#34; operation.  It requires one hand to keep the button on the pic pressed so you don&#x27;t squirt water all over your bathroom, one hand to turn the knob and one hand to keep the unit from flipping over since the knob is harder to turn than the entire unit.  In lieu of a third hand you can do what I do, and pin the thing down with an elbow.  This is a problem that would be pretty easily resolved with buttons.&lt;br /&gt;Second, battery life is not particularly good for regular use.  I mistakenly bought it for home use before noticing the battery operated.  That&#x27;s my fault.  For travelers, it would work well.  But not so much for home use unless you happen to work at or own stock in a battery factory.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the nozzles don&#x27;t fit securely in the handle.</li>
            <li> The unit uses 3 batteries and loses power very quickly.  After approximately 30 days of daily use, the unit started to leak, flooding the battery compartment and pooling on the counter.</li>
            <li> this is a good thing to have when you travel.  it isn&#x27;t as powerful or strong as the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; waterpik, but it&#x27;s great to take with you when you are away from home.......</li>
            <li> When my Conair Interplak WJ7B Water Jet wore out, I decided to replace it with the smaller, cordless WJ3CSR in order to save some bathroom counter space and have something more convenient to travel with. I&#x27;m going to keep it only to use for travel. But for daily home use, the WJ3CSR is underpowered, and there seems to be absolutely no difference between the high and low settings -- both equally underpowered.</li>
            <li> Great seller.  Item works fairly well, but the tip has to  be held in while using it and the &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button isn&#x27;t always very effective.</li>
            <li> Conair Dental Jet. Just what the dentist told me to get something light.</li>
            <li> I have been using water pick products for 40 years, but this one is my all-time favorite. In fact, it is my second one with the first lasting more than 10 years. In addition to being perfect for travel, its compact size and battery operation makes it perfect for home use too. It does not take up much room nor ties up a receptacle. And, do not let being battery-powered concern you. I use rechargeable batteries and get a month&#x27;s worth of use before recharging. It has two power settings, but I prefer the stronger. I love it and am confident you will too, plus you cannot beat the price!</li>
            <li> just didn&#x27;t work out for me and i lost my money on this product.  Nothing against the company.</li>
            <li> SMALL, BUT WORKS WELL. GREAT SHIPPING TIME.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!  After a couple of uses, the pic will not stay in place, pops out as soon as machine is turned on.</li>
            <li> too weak would have liked more strength should have spent more cheap is dear</li>
            <li> Seems kind of cheap but really works well. My son and I hate flossing, and I always have to remind him to brush his teeth (he&#x27;s 17!), but since purchasing this, he loves it and uses it after brushing his teeth (without reminder!) every day.  Finally, an affordable water-pik type dental appliance. You will need your own AA batteries.</li>
            <li> It leaks a lot but it gets the job done</li>
            <li> I would rather spend more money and get a good one!</li>
            <li> Pick blows out of holder when I am using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it does bought for someone other them my self have not heard any bad things about it</li>
            <li> Product is &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; its so small..however, the stream that comes out isn&#x27;t strong enough to clean my teeth, I still must floss even with new batteries.</li>
            <li> I have used an electric water jet in the past and find it is much more powerful than this battery operated one.  This is compact and probably meant for travel and not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after having another portable dental water jet.  This proved a much better choice.  It is compact &amp; easy to travel &amp; the batteries give plenty of power--which is something I was concerned about prior to the purchase.  The water container also holds ample water so you don&#x27;t need to refill.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> the water pressure...even on he lowest setting...dislodges the cleaning tip...this is an absolute waste of&lt;br /&gt;$20 and freight...</li>
            <li> I love it! I have very close teeth and this is awesome. Fantastic price for an awesome product. I am very particular about any dental device right down to the floss I use. Love that it has 2 adapters that are color coded so we can tell whose is whose.</li>
            <li> This looked like a great product, but unfortunately I was unable to travel and try out until the last week of December 2014. By that time I was beyond the return policy window and have little choice but to garage the unit. My complaint is that when I tried to use it, there was no way to keep the handle tips in place which fell out repeatedly. I tried both tips and even tried to insert one from an Oral B which were too large for this unit to accommodate. NIce design if only it worked and was not a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Love the small size and battery operation.  However, the power is just too inadequate to do its job.  I can tell my teeth aren&#x27;t as clean as they get with a larger, outlet powered Waterpik.  That said, I&#x27;m continuing to use it, because it&#x27;s so easy to store.  Hope I don&#x27;t regret it if dental problems result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing.  When I got it, the spring holding the negative end of one of the batteries was crushed flat, so the battery was loose.  I had to reach in with a tiny hook and stretch it to create enough tension to make the current flow.  Crummy quality.  I haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries yet, so don&#x27;t know if my quickie repair will hold up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the batteries are stacked in a small space.  They are VERY difficult to remove and to get seated down in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d have dropped it to only a couple starts, but I must admit I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This thing was a waste of money. The tips don&#x27;t fit securely into the tube where the water comes out and they are always falling out.  There isn&#x27;t enough power to do any good. What a waste of money.  I always thought Conair was a reliable name, but this was a really poorly designed product.</li>
            <li> Great travel accessory</li>
            <li> I have been using this product 4 years, and although I have to change the batteries frequently, it has worked for me. It&#x27;s good for travel, and at first I thought the water pressure could be increased, but then I realized pressure too high is not good for my sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, over a 4 year period, there were times the tips would fall off. But, after securing them, I had no problems. Overall, My gums have felt much better, and my mouth feels refreshed after each use. I have extremely sensitive gums, so this water has helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to other Dental Water Jets on the market, this product is much less expensive. The more I use it, the better my gums feel, so for me, it works well. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The hose snapped in 2  days of purchasing.  Amazon reimbursed and picked up the defective product so I was happy in the end.  I got the alternating current type instead of battery operated  and am super loving it.</li>
            <li> The flow wasn&#x27;t as strong to wash away food particles. However convenient for compact packing when traveling. Was surprised the item came with two water oils but didn&#x27;t produce strong force of water.</li>
            <li> great price.  Does the job.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for travel purposes, and I will admit that I did not expect much from something that cost so little... and was battery powered. This little hummer is remarkable! Perhaps I got a good one, I don&#x27;t know, but it has even functioned as my main home unit for a couple of weeks during a main unit break-down and I still haven&#x27;t found anything to complain about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feared that it would be a flimsy contraption that would break during transport, wobble all over the counter while in operation, leak water everywhere because of a less-than-secure seal, not have enough power because of the batteries resulting in a not very powerful jet of water, and that whatever power it did have would diminish quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I discovered is that all of my concerns were unfounded...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is quite sturdy. Of course it IS a little travel model that isn&#x27;t made of gold, but it holds up well... and over time and over many miles. I have traveled with it more times than I could count and without even taking any real care in packing it (just stick in among my clothes in the suitcase), everything, cover included, always arrives just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not wobbly at all, or \\&quot;walk\\&quot; across the counter while in operation. It makes a humming noise and jiggles in place a little, but water isn&#x27;t sloshing out of the top with people running and screaming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seal is remarkably tight and no water leaks from it, at ALL. In fact this one thing alone, considering the price, I think impressed me the most. There is something that says \\&quot;Quality\\&quot;, to me anyway, when a seal doesn&#x27;t leak a drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I purchased this I read the reviews (that was years ago now) and what sold me on this unit was how many people raved about how long the batteries lasted, and how much power they provided. They were right. It&#x27;s almost a little \\&quot;Twilight Zone-ish\\&quot; when you are on vacation for over 2 weeks and never change batteries and never see a reduction in power. I remember one person mentioning months and I believe it. I have stopped packing extra batteries for a trip of 1 month or under. Never need them. Waste of weight in my suitcase... and speaking of weight... this unit is Very light. The batteries (4 AAA) obviously add a little weight, but the unit itself weighs very little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For water power- it&#x27;s surprising. With fresh (weeks) batteries and on the full power setting you&#x27;ll get a pretty darn good squirt. I never have my home unit on full blast so for me it&#x27;s about perfect, and certainly adequate for the intended purpose, in my opinion, to last through a trip even if you are used to full blast from a plug-in. The only thing you may miss are certain attachments you may use at home. This only has one kind of nozzle, which is nothing fancy but it does the job, and there is no way to add or replace the nozzle with something different. There are 2 different nozzles though so you won&#x27;t need to share if there are 2 of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... with all of that said... a couple of Tips, or \\&quot;Notes.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;The green reservoir/cup shown in the photo acts as a cover for the entire unit, which you have likely figured out by now. This reservoir, in the photo, is setting down tightly onto a seal, ready to be used (as is one of the wands. The tip shown on the wand will be removed and stored in the base next to the other tip shown).  The reservoir can be pulled off of the seal it is currently sitting on, flipped over and slid right over top of the unit, encasing everything and becoming one self-contained entity. Everything... the wand, tips, and cord all have little \\&quot;cubby holes\\&quot; to fit into for storage, and once the cover (the upside-down reservoir) is on nothing will move. Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For use take off the cover/reservoir, flip it over and fit it onto the seal... and HERE&#x27;S MY TIP- Set the reservoir firmly onto the seal BEFORE you fill it with water. It&#x27;s easier that way, especially the first time or two you use it.Getting it onto the seal is quite simple but there are 2 GROOVED GUIDES along the \\&quot;wall\\&quot; of the white unit that the back of the reservoir slides into. These grooves help ensure that the reservoir lines up perfectly with the seal. Use the grooves and all you have to do is give a firm push and the cup is sealed. Now just fill it up and turn the unit on. The problem is that these grooves are often forgotten or overlooked. So...IF you have the cup filled and ready to go and then turn it on and no water comes out, it&#x27;s because the cup is not on the seal correctly, almost certainly because you DIDN&#x27;T slide the cup into the groove guides. It might look straight and sealed, but it&#x27;s not. You&#x27;ll have to take the cup off and put it back on, which could potentially spill your prepared irrigation liquid, so just go ahead and get it in place on the seal first and then fill it up. You&#x27;ll be glad you did as you may need to refill a time or two...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... The only thing I could say about this that might POSSIBLY be a negative is that the reservoir is not as large as most home models (a-duh). It holds about 1 cup of liquid and I normally go through 2 cups or a little more so I have to refill it once, or sometimes twice. Just LEAVE the reservoir/cup firmly attached to the seal and fill it from your measuring cup, mug, thermos, the tap, whatever. If you need to pick up the unit, go ahead and pick it up to get it under the tap or wherever. The reservoir cup is on that seal and will not fall off. Refilling takes only seconds. Your mouth won&#x27;t even begin to dry out, so I do not feel this TINY inconvenience is much of an inconvenience. I would rather the unit be the size it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints and have had no problems after 3 years, or maybe more. I highly recommend this for travel. If mine ever were to break I would most certainly purchase another one just like it. No question in my mind that this should be given 5 brightly glistening stars.</li>
            <li> I thought that my other tips from my plug-in Interplak model would fit this.  They&#x27;re similar but they don&#x27;t fit.  The water pressure is a little weak but it&#x27;s better than nothing.  What I really like about this is that it&#x27;s very quiet!  I can use it in a private bathroom at work.  I looked at a few other models and they&#x27;re all so loud they would reverberate throughout the building.</li>
            <li> This is identical to one I just bought at CVS for about $22.  On its strong setting it&#x27;s at or just below the #2 setting on an early Water Pik I&#x27;ve used for 3 yrs.  The Water Pik has 5 settings and I usually use the #3, but for the first year used the highest setting (#5), which is so powerful that care is needed not to damage your gums.  I want this portable one as backup when the Water Pik fails until a replacement can be found, and because it is very portable for travel use. Even the maximum setting feels a little weak, but it&#x27;s ok for short term use.  I first tried using rechargeable batteries and they were a tiny bit larger than single-use batteries, did sort of fit, but not well enough for power to flow, and it made it difficult to install the middle battery of the three.  (These were a newer NiZn rechargeable that work fine in my digital camera.) So, if this will be your only device, and you use it daily, and batteries are an issue, think twice.</li>
            <li> This product uses 2 AA batteries, the batteries need replacing often, but the overall operation of this appliance is great to good. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Lives in the travel trailer and works for on the road.</li>
            <li> Product broke after only 3 months of 1 person mild use.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly to clean my gums.  I have dentures and had implants for my bottom teeth and need to clean them.  This is a must have item for my life!!</li>
            <li> light and powerful! no cords and it does the job very well! will buy another when this one gives out witch could be a long yime. if it last 6 mo. ill buy two extra at that price. thanks</li>
            <li> Nice. works well and the travel size is perfect.</li>
            <li> It only came with the 1 attachment, and every time I use it the piece that attaches falls out.  Im not pleased at all with this product</li>
            <li> Batteries drain after 1-2 weeks usage.</li>
            <li> The reservoir is too small. The tips fall off when in use. The unit leaks through the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It was not what I was expecting. Too light, the water jet comes off when water come through it which makes it useless.</li>
            <li> this travels with me everywhere. It was great for international travel because I didn&#x27;t need to worry about power conversion. Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Have had on of these for years and love it. bought this for my sister in UK and she loves it too. It might use a few batteries but using the rechargeable ones works great. I would buy again if mine ever stops working</li>
            <li> This small but powerful water jet really gets into the spaces where food particles can be missed by brushing and flossing.  It is small enough to take on trips or to college.  We have 6 of these water jets in our family.&lt;br /&gt;It uses batteries so it can be taken on a camping vacation.&lt;br /&gt;We shop the sales on batteries.</li>
            <li> Its fine, never used one before so dont know what to expect. Its over a month now.. it don&#x27;t get rid of stains in-between your teeth.</li>
            <li> It is NOT really of a sturdy-build. The bottom of the tub chipped at a slight bump.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product with confidence.</li>
            <li> This is our second Interplak Dental Water Jet.  We&#x27;ve also had two similar Waterpik devices.  For us the Interplak devices have lasted longer before wearing out.  That along with the difference in price makes this device our choice.</li>
            <li> The person I gave it to hasn&#x27;t really given me any extensive feedback on how she likes it as yet.</li>
            <li> WE HAVE HAD ONE FOR YEARS AND WHEN IT WENT OUT I WAS SO HAPPY TO FINE ONE AGAIN. I EVEN BOUGHT A FEW FOR CHISTMAS GIFTS.</li>
            <li> This product works as it was intended and is okay to have around. An alternative to the more expensive models of dental water jets.</li>
            <li> Sent a better model than the one in the ad. Works well . Best price for the larger model</li>
            <li> My mother suggested this to me.  I have a WaterPik for home use and I was looking for a travel one.  This little thing is awesome!.  It is easy to use, compact, and travels compactly, (put a couple of pieces of tape on each side to keep it together/closed in my ditty bag).  It works just as well as my waterpik.  Some people don&#x27;t like batteries but I got lithium batteries and works great for me.!  With the exception of 3 AA batteries rather than electricity for power, I love it!  The price is right and perfect for traveling!  Less expensive than my WaterPik.  It may even replace my WaterPik in the future.</li>
            <li> This product is not up to the mark,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Functionality of this product is not good&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0017HWR1U Conair WJ3CSR Interplak Dental Water Jet]]</li>
            <li> It is impossible to clean your teeth with this product. The pressure of the water is way to low. I used other Water Jets before and their water pressure was much better.</li>
            <li> I was able to return this product for better (cost me more, but worth it. The company was easy to have replaced.  Thanks again.</li>
            <li> This has no more power than my shower head.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful. Batteries don&#x27;t last long.  Might be ok for travel. But not so good for every day use.</li>
            <li> The unit I got. The mechining is off. The tips come out of the handle wile using. Makes the unit useless.&lt;br /&gt;Please send another.</li>
            <li> Very small, portable, and battery operated. Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this oral irrigator for more than 5 years and haven&#x27;t had any problems, at the beginning I thought the pressure was not enough so I tried one that my father had, but found out too much pressure is not good for me, so that was a plus, another thing I like is the small size, it fit practically everywhere , and final, it&#x27;s been long enough for an item this cheap to keep on working. The batteries I use with this unit are sanyo eneloop and they last really long , I refill the tank 2 times for every use three times per day and for more than two week I still use the same charge, so probably the battery issue will go away as they get better. The only issue I had with this is the tip coming out, my solution was to put Teflon tape around and problem solved.</li>
            <li> Will break in a month. Worked decently for a while with good power but after a couple weeks it was falling apart and wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This worked very well. The water pressure was very strong, enough to clear any debris, though it rather hurt if accidentally directly at gums. It also worked for the removal of tonsiliths before I had my tonsils surgically removed. The open design of the water container made it occasionally awkward to use, however.</li>
            <li> Súper bad ..dont waist tour time</li>
            <li> This unit was a good idea, small and compact. Runs on batteries, but has no water pressure compared to the plug in model to do the correct job. So I sent mine back. Good news is that I got a credit immediately, and a free shipping label to return it. I re ordered the plug in model.</li>
            <li> Bought thi sbecause small size was good for the sink or counter but it was hard to use and clogged up after couple months of use, I expected better quality</li>
            <li> Found this item to be underpowered bit better than nothing while traveling.  Biggest issue is that the cover which is also the water container has no latch or snap or other device to hold it on. Makes it hard to pack</li>
            <li> Does not have enough powerful water stream</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a child, I am happy because it is very easy to use, plus its easy movement between the restrooms and the results in oral hygiene are excellent.</li>
            <li> Good pick for battery operated</li>
            <li> stopped working after the 2nd use. Leaked all over the place.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Conair Interplak Dental Water Jet is a very compact unit that operates on batteries.  Nice feature in a small area - no cord to deal with.  HOWEVER the instructions say not to touch the tip to your gums or your teeth.  If you happen to barely touch any part of your mouth while using this water pik, the tip falls off squirting water all over.  And I mean BARELY.  You can push on the sides of the pik and it is okay, but if you tough the very tip, it falls off as if it was just waiting for you to touch it.  I tried pushing it in tighter but it was already all the way in. Another flaw is that the on-off control is so close to the base of the unit that it is hard to turn on with one hand.  The unit is light so it slides even tho it does have some little rubber pads.  Someone with larger fingers might have a some difficulty.  The pressure is less than a standard pik but not terrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay it does not have that much pressure.</li>
            <li> Yes, the tip pops off with every use. It makes a mess in the bathroom shooting water everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;I wish Conair would revise the device with a better tip connector, since it could be a useful travel&lt;br /&gt;water pick.</li>
            <li> Very small.  Is deceiving when you go to look at it online.  Am going to have too get a different one now.  I sent to my son and when i went to visit months later realized it loss like a toy.</li>
            <li> This machine is outstanding, it met all my needs and expectations.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Works okay.  But when I use it - I end up squirting the mirror and all over.  I guess it&#x27;s normal for this.</li>
            <li> Not bad for so small. Didn&#x27;t realize it was battery op.  Use very new batteries.  A little too gentle.  But I remember the old blast your teeth out water pics. Does get the stuck object out but you really have to go at it with floss too.  Very nice for just general use.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this was a fair product but its really just wetting your teeth. Do not expect any seriously deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> My dentist recomended this product and said that it was better than using dental floss. I found that it doesn&#x27;t do the job that it was designed to do and it is quite messy to use, as the liquid can not be retained in the mouth as you use it. Occasionally I do use it. but only if I am not wearing a shirt and if I have time to clean up the sink area when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> After it arrived, it was not the same style show in what&#x27;s displayed. Same gizmos and gadgets that was all said to be included though so, not a whole big a deal. 2 months later (or so) It completely broke. After other things fell apart weeks into using it.</li>
            <li> this size is great and no electric cord is another plus</li>
            <li> I ordered this Item via friend from US, so it has been delivered to US, but I am still waiting for my friend to bringit to me here in Bosnia. So far, as per my friends input, the item is matching described quality, I got what I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied.</li>
            <li> The only reason this was purchased is that the dentist suggest it for my gums.  It is messy to use at first, but once you get the hang of it is okay.  One of the pics doesn&#x27;t stay on the tubing.  If you need its worth trying for the $.</li>
            <li> I bought this to travel with, and the pressure works fine for me. Only thing is sometimes the tank is hard to pull off from the base, so once I accidentally soaked the whole thing. But all I had to do was take out the batteries and leave the equipment to dry properly and went back to work just fine. Really helps get the little hidden pieces of food. I used to own a Waterpik and this in my opinion is comparable. If the water runs out, just fill it up again, it&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li> Not enough pressure to do a very good job of cleaning</li>
            <li> Absolutely one of the most useless products I have ever purchased.  No pressure at all, therefore, does not even come close to doing what it was designed and advertised to do.  I bought it for travel because it is battery operated.  We went on a cruise and by the time I returned, I immediately threw this piece of disappointing piece of *#@* into the trash bin.  Second let down with Conair.  They really need to pull these products and start over or just give it up and stick with curling irons.</li>
            <li> Yes it did thank you .</li>
            <li> I must of missed-it, but I didn&#x27;t see where this was battery powered!</li>
            <li> I was not careful when reading the description, because I will not willingly buy anything battery-powered. However, rechargebles will keep it working until I can get a better device. Given that it is battery-operated and does not have an adapter, I&#x27;m not unhappy with its performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, unless you are flat stony broke and need a water jet ASAP, I can&#x27;t recommend this. Eats batteries and isn&#x27;t terribly powerful (not that you should be power-washing your gums anyway). Save up a chunk and get a real one; my next purchase will be [[ASIN:B00HFQQ0VU Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser (WP-660)]], which was about $60 when I wrote this.</li>
            <li> love this item, can take it anywhere</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it was batter operated, but I guess it will be good for trips, when I usually don&#x27;t take one.</li>
            <li> simple to use grand daughter uses it without being told too hope it lastes.small enought to be left out on the counter</li>
            <li> This is my second COnair.  THe first one lasted longer than I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;AND, if you go away you can fit it in your suitcase!</li>
