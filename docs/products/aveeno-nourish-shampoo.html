            <li>THE BEST I HAVE USED, DOES EVERYTHING</li>
            <li>However, great shampoo for an excellent price.  </li>
            <li>Works just as good as the Matrix shampoos!</li>
            <li>I tried Aveeno Nourish + Volume and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li>lol...</li>
            <li>This product is great on the scalp - I have dermititis on my scalp and since I&#x27;ve been using this</li>
            <li>then more each day afterwards!!</li>
            <li>It does smell good though.</li>
            <li>In my experience, Aveeno is a consistently good brand,  and this shampoo does give my hair good shine and volume.  </li>
            <li>Good shampoo... will probbaly buy again.  </li>
            <li>It smells fantastic!!  </li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair looking and feeling oily, more so than before I washed it!</li>
            <li>This is great for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Really nice shampoo...works well on my hair and not overly scented.</li>
            <li>love this shampoo and conditioner, I use them both together and they do a good job of giving my fine color</li>
            <li>Gives good amount of volume but has a chemical smell and doesn&#x27;t really clean your head.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells great - very clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very reasonably priced,  smells a bit oaty (in a nice way!)</li>
            <li>I liked the scent and light feel of the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>During the wash and condition I had 3x more hair fall out than when I use another OTC brand.  </li>
            <li>and my hair has more volume...</li>
            <li>Better than most salon brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>IT is okay</li>
            <li>I love the Aveeno Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love It.</li>
            <li>I tried this shampoo expecting to love it as I do most Aveeno products</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Most shampoos and conditioners have fragrance in them that I cannot tolerate; Aveeno does not.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner duo.</li>
            <li>Always have a grease free non-shampoo day too!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new shampoo to try at an affordable price, and this was a great find.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a better product for fine hair than I&#x27;ve used, but still not what I&#x27;m looking for...</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and nothing seems to work.</li>
            <li>I had my hair treated with the BKT and my hair should not be getting this frizzy; I imagine the light weight conditioner is skimping out on the essentials, which is why it didn&#x27;t flatten my hair.    </li>
            <li>It makes my hair smell fantastic and keeps my oily hair from getting too greasy.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves fine hair shiny and full.  </li>
            <li>I immediately noticed my hair feeling more full after the first wash.  </li>
            <li>Only giving it 4 out of 5 because I&#x27;m sure if I wanted to spend three times the amount I could get something better.  </li>
            <li>Love that my hair looks and feels healthy and has more volume than usual.</li>
            <li>Gives a great boost to your roots and allows your hair to look a little thicker - and healthier.  </li>
            <li>PRICEY BUT WORTH THE COST.</li>
            <li>My hair does not dry out at all, it appears shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I tried Aveeno Nourish + Volumize Shampoo and as soon as I rinsed it off (from my first wash)</li>
            <li>As much as I love Aveeno products, this shampoo is definitely not for me.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the first day/use - and</li>
            <li>It feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>this is a good shampoo,i&#x27;ve tried alot ,so far this is the only one that continues to work.you don&#x27;t need to use a lotand it leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li>Before getting too excited there were two major flaws     1:</li>
            <li>I have normal hair, but many moisturizing shampoos leave my hair flat.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner to be able to comb through wet hair.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for having it on line.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the way it smells.</li>
            <li>I can feel the difference in my hair, much easier to brush after using this.  </li>
            <li>but I like their other shampoos better.</li>
            <li>My hair easily gets dry after using it.</li>
            <li>As I stated in the conditioner review, I have very fine hair and this product never weighs down my hair!</li>
            <li>I made sure it was this product by going back to Pantene and noticing less hair fallout, then going back to this and again more fallout.    </li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars because although it offers volume, it didn&#x27;t offer me the nourishment (as suggested by the name).  </li>
            <li>I have not been using conditioner but find that my hair is still soft and not tangled.  </li>
            <li>and gives my (shortish,  frequently dyed) hair shine and movement.  </li>
            <li>This one conditions without leaving hair too soft and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t especially like the scent, but otherwise it really does work well.</li>
            <li>I assume my hair falls out because it doesn&#x27;t particularly nourish the need of MY hair, causing the dryness, ironic because my hair is extremely oily (unfathomable how it is shedding my natural oil to cause my hair to frizz).     </li>
            <li>The first few times I used this my hair felt so soft and silky!</li>
            <li>after it is completely dried, I saw that my hair was so much fuller!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> As I have become totally grey, I have also noticed my hair thinning.  </li>
            <li> and it goes a long way (and you can rinse and reuse if desired).  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and I find this shampoo is one of the few on the market that I can use.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair, so</li>

            <li> you only need a little amount.</li>
            <li> They want a small fortune for this product in my local stores and I am tired of paying high prices.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read other reviews where they used the Moisturizing conditioner instead of the Volumizing one and it did them wonders, but the shampoo itself caused a lot of my hair to fall out, so I&#x27;m pretty skeptical about recommending this to anyone.    </li>
            <li> After a few washes it feels brittle and dry, the smell reminds me of hairspray!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> The conditioner wasn&#x27;t heavy, so it didn&#x27;t flatten my hair.  </li>
            <li> : I will go bald in a few months, but won&#x27;t notice it because of the voluminous look the frizz gives me.    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think volume is an even trade with dried, damaged, falling hair.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair out quite a bit</li>
            <li> After using Aveeno I will not waste my money on expensive hair care.</li>
            <li> No more tangles either.</li>
            <li> I have very limp hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair was dry and knotty and my boyfriend said something weird, he said, \\&quot;It doesn&#x27;t feel bouncy and moisturized\\&quot; as he helped me brush it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have break outs hardly at all.  </li>
            <li> This stuff sucks.</li>
            <li> I have thick frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have used some very expensive hair products in the past.</li>
            <li> not getting all weird on this review...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it leaves a film on my hair that the cheaper shampoos (Suave specifically) don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> A lot of times the ends of my hair look bad.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have fine hair and nothing seems to work. I tried Aveeno Nourish + Volume and my hair feels great. No more tangles either.</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks. I got the shampoo and conditioner sample of this in the mail. I liked the scent and light feel of the shampoo and conditioner but when I got out of the shower I had to have my boyfriend help me get out all the knots from my hair. My hair was dry and knotty and my boyfriend said something weird, he said, \\&quot;It doesn&#x27;t feel bouncy and moisturized\\&quot; as he helped me brush it. I even brushed my hair BEFORE showering to remove any knots and it came out knotty and dry. I will stick to Aussie.</li>
            <li> I have very limp hair.  I tried Aveeno Nourish + Volumize Shampoo and as soon as I rinsed it off (from my first wash) I felt my hair standing up, I was amazed it already felt like I was getting a lot of volume.  The conditioner wasn&#x27;t heavy, so it didn&#x27;t flatten my hair.  I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair, so after it is completely dried, I saw that my hair was so much fuller! Before getting too excited there were two major flaws     1: During the wash and condition I had 3x more hair fall out than when I use another OTC brand.  I made sure it was this product by going back to Pantene and noticing less hair fallout, then going back to this and again more fallout.    2: Oh-my, the frizz: After my hair had dried there was so much frizz.  I had my hair treated with the BKT and my hair should not be getting this frizzy; I imagine the light weight conditioner is skimping out on the essentials, which is why it didn&#x27;t flatten my hair.    I can foresee the damage this product will cause my hair if I continue to use it: I will go bald in a few months, but won&#x27;t notice it because of the voluminous look the frizz gives me.    I assume my hair falls out because it doesn&#x27;t particularly nourish the need of MY hair, causing the dryness, ironic because my hair is extremely oily (unfathomable how it is shedding my natural oil to cause my hair to frizz).     I read other reviews where they used the Moisturizing conditioner instead of the Volumizing one and it did them wonders, but the shampoo itself caused a lot of my hair to fall out, so I&#x27;m pretty skeptical about recommending this to anyone.    I gave it 2 stars because although it offers volume, it didn&#x27;t offer me the nourishment (as suggested by the name).  I don&#x27;t think volume is an even trade with dried, damaged, falling hair.</li>
            <li> Only giving it 4 out of 5 because I&#x27;m sure if I wanted to spend three times the amount I could get something better.  However, great shampoo for an excellent price.  Love that my hair looks and feels healthy and has more volume than usual.</li>
            <li> For the last 10 years I used nexus therepe.. but now I switched to this and my hair has more volume... but I&#x27;m a dude with curly hair so i&#x27;m stopping there.. I like it... lol... not getting all weird on this review...</li>
            <li> Really nice shampoo...works well on my hair and not overly scented.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo that will give some volume and lift to my hair.  As I have become totally grey, I have also noticed my hair thinning.  I saw a commercial for this shampoo and decided to try it.  I immediately noticed my hair feeling more full after the first wash.  My hair is chin length with some layers, and it definitely added some lift.  I have not been using conditioner but find that my hair is still soft and not tangled.  I plan to try out their conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> THE BEST I HAVE USED, DOES EVERYTHING IT IS ADVERTISED TO DO. PRICEY BUT WORTH THE COST. WILL ODER AGAIN</li>
            <li> Gives good amount of volume but has a chemical smell and doesn&#x27;t really clean your head.</li>
            <li> This is great for my fine hair. It keeps it moisturized and and yet i still have volume. I will continue to get this repeatedly.</li>
            <li> As much as I love Aveeno products, this shampoo is definitely not for me.  It dried my hair out quite a bit so I can&#x27;t support the &amp;#34;nourishing&amp;#34; claim.  It does smell good though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 2 months now.  I have some problems with thinning of my hair so it&#x27;s definately a boost.  It smells fantastic!!  You only have to use a little and it goes a long way (and you can rinse and reuse if desired).  This product is great on the scalp - I have dermititis on my scalp and since I&#x27;ve been using this I don&#x27;t have break outs hardly at all.  It leaves you with a feeling that you have healty air.  Gives a great boost to your roots and allows your hair to look a little thicker - and healthier.  Use for about a week to see the change in your hair.  I noticed a difference the first day/use - and then more each day afterwards!!</li>
            <li> this is a good shampoo,i&#x27;ve tried alot ,so far this is the only one that continues to work.you don&#x27;t need to use a lotand it leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li> In my experience, Aveeno is a consistently good brand,  and this shampoo does give my hair good shine and volume.  It&#x27;s very reasonably priced,  smells a bit oaty (in a nice way!) and gives my (shortish,  frequently dyed) hair shine and movement.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great - very clean and fresh.  Unfortunately, it leaves a film on my hair that the cheaper shampoos (Suave specifically) don&#x27;t.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have normal hair, but many moisturizing shampoos leave my hair flat.  This one conditions without leaving hair too soft and unmanageable.  Better than most salon brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I like the smell. you only need a little amount. 10.5 ounce last long time even for my long hair. It feels soft and smooth. highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> IT is okay but I like their other shampoos better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a better product for fine hair than I&#x27;ve used, but still not what I&#x27;m looking for...if that even exists.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves fine hair shiny and full.  I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner to be able to comb through wet hair.  I wish I could buy it locally.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as the Matrix shampoos!</li>
            <li> Good shampoo... will probbaly buy again.  Does what it says and I like it.  Thanks for having it on line.</li>
            <li> I love the Aveeno Shampoo and Conditioner. I have thick frizzy hair. A lot of times the ends of my hair look bad. I have used some very expensive hair products in the past. Not anymore. After using Aveeno I will not waste my money on expensive hair care. After using aveeno one time I could tell my hair was softer. After using this product for about 3 or 4 washes I could see a difference in the ends of my hair. They wasn&#x27;t as brittle and dry. My hair looked healthier and felt softer. I use the nourish and volumize. Love It.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used this my hair felt so soft and silky! After a few washes it feels brittle and dry, the smell reminds me of hairspray!</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo expecting to love it as I do most Aveeno products but I was disappointed. This shampoo leaves my hair looking and feeling oily, more so than before I washed it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new shampoo to try at an affordable price, and this was a great find.  It makes my hair smell fantastic and keeps my oily hair from getting too greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair easily gets dry after using it. I have to use conditioner. I don&#x27;t really like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair shiny and soft. It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I don&#x27;t especially like the scent, but otherwise it really does work well.</li>
            <li> They want a small fortune for this product in my local stores and I am tired of paying high prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this shampoo and conditioner, I use them both together and they do a good job of giving my fine color treated hair volume.  My hair does not dry out at all, it appears shiny and healthy.  My skin is sensitive and I find this shampoo is one of the few on the market that I can use.  Most shampoos and conditioners have fragrance in them that I cannot tolerate; Aveeno does not.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like it.  Will order again</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner duo. As I stated in the conditioner review, I have very fine hair and this product never weighs down my hair! Always have a grease free non-shampoo day too!</li>
            <li> I can feel the difference in my hair, much easier to brush after using this.  My hair felt dry before using this.</li>
