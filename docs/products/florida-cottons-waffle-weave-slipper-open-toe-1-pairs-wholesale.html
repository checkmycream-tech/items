            <li> These are amazing. It is so hard to find solid, sturdy and non skid slippers. Very comfortable.</li>
            <li> They served our purpose. I was looking for throw-away slippers for guests. One size fits all and you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> Love these slippers! Bought these to have for my own use as well as for house guests and everyone has raved about how comfortable they are! Like bringing the spa to your house.</li>
            <li> I wear women&#x27;s size 8 to 8 1/2 shoes.  The slippers are much too large to be comfortable and to feel safe for walking.</li>
            <li> These slippers look good and can be thrown in washer, so has a long shelf life.  Im a mens 10.5 and its snug but not tight. My wifes a womens 7.5 and surprising fits her as well, though shes got kind of wide feet, hehe.</li>
            <li> great sauna shoes.  Keep extra for guests.  very affordable.</li>
            <li> These slippers are made for someone with feet the thickness of a pancake.  I have normal feet, but couldn&#x27;t slide my feet in.  If I pick them up and put them on like socks, I can squeeze my feet in if I have no socks on.  Slide-in slippers are supposed to be slid into.  Perhaps someone else would be able to get into the pair they bought because I suspect that they are not all made the same.</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase.  Fit well and have two more pair if the first gets ruined.</li>
            <li> I give this a five star because they&#x27;re nice ,but after a while They get to be to big .Can you wash them so they might return to the original sides ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angel Mom</li>
            <li> This was a gift and she loves them. She had a pair while on a cruise and liked them, so now she has another pair.</li>
            <li> Super comfy. No regrets. Love it. Bring the spa to your home. I highly recommend. Get it now. You will love.</li>
            <li> eventhough i read the reviews that warned me of the slippers running large in size, i ordered them anyway.  i wear a womens size 10 and these were still too large.  My own fault.</li>
            <li> They are about an inch to long.  I dont like the cloth soles.  Sorry.  I like my old ones better</li>
            <li> Too thin, and expensive.</li>
            <li> Excellent slippers for travel, especially in a b&#x27;n&#x27;b where you have to go from room to shower down the hall. Lightweight and comfortable and the right price.  Could have just a tiny bit more padding underfoot.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 pairs of this for myself (male, foot size 10), my mom, and sister. They wear the slippers comfortably but my feet can&#x27;t go in at all.</li>
            <li> These slippers are nice. They are very flat and light. The downer for me is that they were to big. I am a size 6 is shoes and these baby&#x27;s are like a size 8 or 9. I still wear them though and they are pretty comfortable. And like I said they are very light so it&#x27;s not that big of a deal to me. They also wash well. I didn&#x27;t wash them in the washing machine though, I let them soak in a tub with hot water and laundry detergent and then scrubbed them with a brush and they looked like new.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Just what I expected. Has not washed them yet to see how the slippers will handle it.</li>
            <li> Great product for a fair price.  Very comfy!</li>
            <li> the title says&#x27;3 pairs&amp;#34; . I bought 5 &amp;#34;sets&#x27; of 3 pairs. I was expecting 18 pairs of slippers. I got 5!&lt;br /&gt;They washed well but I got ripped off</li>
            <li> Great Product. Can be worn for quite a long time. Comfortable, and can wash a few times.&lt;br /&gt;Great Value... I hope that Amazon would have more.  I had to purchase another brand that&lt;br /&gt;was Terry Cloth and was not even close to the quality of these slippers.</li>
            <li> These are great around the house slippers.  I wear em a month or so and move on to another pair!&lt;br /&gt;Time for more soon!</li>
            <li> I love these slippers, they wear well and washes well.  I have had a knee replacement and can&#x27;t walk in the slippers with the thick, soft soles and I have been looking for an alternative which I found in these. They are also perfect for travel. I will certainly be back for more.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable but don&#x27;t expect them to stay on your feet if you plan to walk in them.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a pair of these before in a spa basket and wondered how they were sized.  I would say they about a size 8.  The pair I had before I literally wore out.  Thank goodness they are washable.  I was thrilled to find another pair of them.</li>
