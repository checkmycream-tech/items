            <li>I have used this dryer for over a month now and love it!</li>
            <li>I had a Sedu and this is so much better!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled!  </li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>I thought my hair was damaged beyond hope, and couldn&#x27;t believe how nice it turned out by using this dryer.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best hair dryer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>I love my hair and take really good care of it.  </li>
            <li>and I really appreciate this wonderful dryer.</li>
            <li>Nice dryer.</li>
            <li>And, it gives my very fine hair BODY.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>First, the reason I put 5 stars, is because the product is great, even with how its packaged.   </li>
            <li>I guess that I was really na√Øve to think that I could get this great blowdryer at this price; it was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>While this is a GREAT hairdryer, I was very displeased</li>
            <li>I do agree that there could be better instructions.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer, has a lot of airflow which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>, well balanced.&lt;br /&gt;The air flow I would say is about 300% more than the Conair, it is literally Hurricane Force.</li>
            <li>wife wanted one with much more air flow</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through MANY hair dryers in my life and never seen any difference in anything but speed.</li>
            <li>I love the Elchim products.  </li>
            <li>I love the elchim 5000 Da Vinci.  </li>
            <li>This hairdryer is much, much better</li>
            <li>, My moms was quieter and just dryed my hair better.</li>
            <li>Gets 1 star for getting crappy packaging and for my mothers cheaper Tourmaline blow dryer being better.</li>
            <li>I do use top of the line products too though (Fekkai, Aveda, Bumble and Bumble).    </li>
            <li>what more can you ask for???</li>
            <li>I enjoyed it while it lasted.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m not so sure it is not refurbished.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, my hair was actually smooth and silky when I was done drying.  </li>
            <li>is great for me because now I am not subjected to 15 mins of loud noise every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I trusted that I would not be ripped off and would be provided excellent quality assurance as with other products I&#x27;ve ordered from them.</li>
            <li>This is a high-quality hair dryer, easy to use, easy to plug into wall socket.  </li>
            <li>so the quick dry was wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is my first time spending more that drugstore money on a hair dryer and am pleased.  </li>
            <li>The cool shot is excellent, the variable temperature and speed controls allow you to dry hair quickly without frying it.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it cost more than the drugstore hair dryers, but it&#x27;s well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>The dryer is also light</li>
            <li>so I went in search of THE most powerful one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this dryer because of all the fabulous reviews.</li>
            <li>I called Elchim company in US, and they confirmed that the packaging should look like that.</li>
            <li>I am now in the market to see if they sell a diffuser that will fit on the dryer</li>
            <li>The cosmotologist enjoy using.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this dryer for about 2 weeks now and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>REALLY, REALLY UPSET!!!</li>
            <li>The air is fast and high powered, and is great.</li>
            <li>Just used the new hair dryer yesterday and love it!  </li>
            <li>, even more surprising is that it is not as loud as the old Conair even though it is much more powerful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The nozzle attachment makes for very sleek, nicely shaped frizz-free blowouts--and quickly.  </li>
            <li>So worth it!    </li>
            <li>If you take this vent set up with the screen offered on the Da Vinci and put it on the original tan dryer, you would have a winner.</li>
            <li>First and foremost just to get it out of the way this is an OUTSTANDING hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Recently</li>
            <li>The dryer arrived in original packaging and undamaged.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Told me it was well worth the money I paid for it, as I asked her opinion on that!, for this review.  </li>
            <li>I have the old dryer (the tan one) and sort of like it better because it is quieter than this one, but this one has a better vent set up.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the most outstanding blowdryer ever.  </li>
            <li>Its very powerful and the drying gets done quickly.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer is powerful, sits in a hand comfortably.</li>
            <li>I consider this Da Vinci to be a step up over my Uragano because it has the cool shot</li>
            <li>It looks great and the dryer is so powerful that my hair is dry in about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Also, I purchased from DiscountsJungle, recieved the product quickly (2 days) in a sealed box.</li>
            <li>With a quick wip through with a straighter, my hair was just how I like it in under 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>and it was cheaper and BETTER packaging (actually  had cardboard support to hold the dryer) and better quality.</li>
            <li>What it does is provide for a very fast, smooth blow out.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with it</li>
            <li>Dries hair very fast!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very powerful and gets just as hot as my previous Elchim, and also has the cool button which is great.</li>
            <li>Great looking hair in half the time...</li>
            <li>quality hair dryer certainly makes a huge difference when  styling your hair.</li>
            <li>Dries my hair amazingly fast, leaving it smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>My hair is much softer than when I used my cheap target dryer.</li>
            <li>I tried it at a relative&#x27;s house with amazing results.  </li>
            <li>works great, have this for a few years now</li>
            <li>The price is worth it.</li>
            <li>I purchased my own, and again, same results.  </li>
            <li>I gave this as a Christmas Gift to my 28 yr old Grand Daughter  </li>
            <li>replaced plug on two of them,otherwise powerful hair blower</li>
            <li>My sister even bought the same one once she saw how nice my hair straightens</li>
            <li>It dried my hair quickly, leaving my hair in good condition.</li>
            <li>Hot heat, powerful air dryer...</li>
            <li>this was the main reason I decided to purchase the Da Vinci 5000, as far as my research found this is THE most powerful dryer on the market @</li>
            <li>I had my last Elchim for 9 years and felt that I needed a more powerful one.  </li>
            <li>Considering how much a hair cut costs today I feel the price of this hair dryer is a bargain given the dramatic and wonderful results.  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>(look it up on Youtube!- Funny)  </li>
            <li>Love the red color!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m out the door with shiny, smooth, professional results.  </li>
            <li>I was reluctant to spend so much on a hairdryer, but it was absolutely worth it.  </li>
            <li>When I first turned it on, it took about 2 min to get even luke-warm.  </li>
            <li>Since then, now it takes about 30 sec to get warm.  </li>
            <li>If you like your hairdryer really hot, this might not be the item for you.</li>
            <li>and it is not that hot.  </li>
            <li>The first dryer arrived and within a week the filter kept falling off-and no I had not dropped it.</li>
            <li>My hair is always soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>( The original works fine , but I want to have the safety shut off check out ) I am happy with this new dryer and it is a little smaller and lighter than my older model.  </li>
            <li>Easy to dry my hair and have it come out straight and smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair is straighter and shinier than I have ever been able to manage with dryer, flat iron and chemical hair products.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was quick and it definitely is new and not a refurb.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot and it dries hair fast.</li>
            <li>I love Elchim, as I have been using their hair dryers for a long time.</li>
            <li>chose the Da Vinci because it is a bit more powerful than the other 2, has the option to use a REAL Ion</li>
            <li>this hair dryer makes me able to dry it with some heat and no smell of burnt hair (like my drugstore brands).  </li>
            <li>I was not confident in my ability to create a similar look at home, but with this dryer I had a nice smooth finish on the first try!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not paying this much for some used dryer.</li>
            <li>and I blow it straight when I wash it.  </li>
            <li>It really dries the hair fast.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair straight and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>On the flip side, that means it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair too much.</li>
            <li>Elchim is very well made (made in Italy) feels well made in your hand</li>
            <li>VERY DISSAPOINTED.</li>
            <li>It looks salon styled, straight with no frizz.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon ...PaPuddin</li>
            <li>Ended up buying mine from Amazon - for much lower cost then from the store</li>
            <li>The hair dryer works well, but not as well as the same one my hairdresser has, thus leaving me wondering if it is a genuine product or just a copy.</li>
            <li>straight</li>
            <li>The comb attachment is nice for drying before straightening with a round brush and the concentrator attachment.    </li>
            <li>(save that card/address someplace safe), with $18 - and they completely rebuild it and send it back to you (like if the motor ever reaches the end of its life).  </li>
            <li>Only con would be that its loud, but no louder then most.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I saw this blowdryer especially at that price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>And what I enjoy most about using this dryer is the easy heat and air controls and the cold shot button.  </li>
            <li>night I turned it on, the plug made a strange sound- shook in the outlet and after this the dryer will not turn on.</li>
            <li>This dryer has cut my maintenance time in half with much better results.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased countless hair dryers of many different brands over the years.  </li>
            <li>My item shipped in a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>I wanted a high end dryer that would reduce the frizz and make my hair softer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I would never go back to using any other kind.    </li>
            <li>This is my second one, the first one someone stole from me!</li>
            <li>This model&#x27;s cord (where it meets the handle of the hair dryer) is much sturdier and I believe they have fixed the problem.  </li>
            <li>Elchim dryer is a true professional hair dryer this is not your run of the mill Walmart/Drugstore hair dryer as you can tell by the price.&lt;br /&gt;There is a BIG difference between the 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that I am sending the original one to the repair center  to have the plug in worked on.</li>
            <li>I like using the attachments as well to help direct the airflow and straighten my hair a little more while drying.</li>
            <li>so I wanted something new regardless.  </li>
            <li>I bought the first one 7 years ago and the only reason I bought this new one -is</li>
            <li>/&gt;It now takes her about 5-6mins to dry her hair instead of 15 mins and her hair surprisingly enough actually feels better to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I replaced my old Elchim because of a power cord issue.  </li>
            <li>My dryer was about 9 years old and they are warrantied for life, so I&#x27;ll probably send it in at some point and just have it as a spare in a guest bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews and choose to disregard the low reviews because I really wanted an ELCHIM blowdryer.  </li>
            <li>The dryer&#x27;s printed on logo was already fading (brand new?)and only had \\&quot;Elchim\\&quot; printed on the side, which I know is not what the real dryer has as its logo.</li>
            <li>Also not as loud as this blow dryer.     </li>
            <li>I am over 70 years old</li>
            <li>She Loves the Hair Dryer and says it makes her hair so soft.  </li>
            <li>I am 51 years old and have been blowing drying my hair every day since, well since electricity was invented (almost).  </li>
            <li>I bought it just a few days before Christmas and sure enough it came in time like they said it would.  </li>
            <li>dryer works as promised, has cut down the time it takes to dry her hair by 50% or more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all, from drugstore quality to various high end, mortgage payment price quality - and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much quieter than my previous dryer and dries much faster.  </li>
            <li>and I used to have to dry my hair then use a straighting iron to get it completely straight.  </li>
            <li>Now it takes 10 minutes to get my hair dry and straight and with body.  </li>
            <li>I have only had this dryer for a week, but so far it has delivered on all it promised.  </li>
            <li>THIS dryer not only cuts my drying time in half, but my hair is now SO soft and straight!</li>
            <li>and it is as heavy or slightly heavier than most retail brands today</li>
            <li>This little guy does exactly that.</li>
            <li>When I received the box, it just didn&#x27;t look new and the parts were loose in the box.  </li>
            <li>the dryer I received did not have the gold text, but BLACK text, very minimalist look..</li>
    </ol>

            <li> so I trusted that I would not be ripped off and would be provided excellent quality assurance as with other products I&#x27;ve ordered from them.</li>
            <li> This is a high-quality hair dryer, easy to use, easy to plug into wall socket.  </li>
            <li> so the quick dry was wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is my first time spending more that drugstore money on a hair dryer and am pleased.  </li>
            <li> The cool shot is excellent, the variable temperature and speed controls allow you to dry hair quickly without frying it.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it cost more than the drugstore hair dryers, but it&#x27;s well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> The dryer is also light</li>
            <li> so I went in search of THE most powerful one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer because of all the fabulous reviews.</li>
            <li> I called Elchim company in US, and they confirmed that the packaging should look like that.</li>
            <li> I am now in the market to see if they sell a diffuser that will fit on the dryer</li>
            <li> The cosmotologist enjoy using.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for about 2 weeks now and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> REALLY, REALLY UPSET!!!</li>
            <li> The air is fast and high powered, and is great.</li>
            <li> Just used the new hair dryer yesterday and love it!  </li>
            <li> , even more surprising is that it is not as loud as the old Conair even though it is much more powerful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The nozzle attachment makes for very sleek, nicely shaped frizz-free blowouts--and quickly.  </li>
            <li> So worth it!    </li>
            <li> If you take this vent set up with the screen offered on the Da Vinci and put it on the original tan dryer, you would have a winner.</li>
            <li> First and foremost just to get it out of the way this is an OUTSTANDING hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Recently</li>
            <li> The dryer arrived in original packaging and undamaged.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Told me it was well worth the money I paid for it, as I asked her opinion on that!, for this review.  </li>
            <li> I have the old dryer (the tan one) and sort of like it better because it is quieter than this one, but this one has a better vent set up.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the most outstanding blowdryer ever.  </li>
            <li> Its very powerful and the drying gets done quickly.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer is powerful, sits in a hand comfortably.</li>
            <li> I consider this Da Vinci to be a step up over my Uragano because it has the cool shot</li>
            <li> It looks great and the dryer is so powerful that my hair is dry in about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Also, I purchased from DiscountsJungle, recieved the product quickly (2 days) in a sealed box.</li>
            <li> With a quick wip through with a straighter, my hair was just how I like it in under 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> and it was cheaper and BETTER packaging (actually  had cardboard support to hold the dryer) and better quality.</li>
            <li> What it does is provide for a very fast, smooth blow out.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with it</li>
            <li> Dries hair very fast!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powerful and gets just as hot as my previous Elchim, and also has the cool button which is great.</li>
            <li> Great looking hair in half the time...</li>
            <li> quality hair dryer certainly makes a huge difference when  styling your hair.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair amazingly fast, leaving it smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> My hair is much softer than when I used my cheap target dryer.</li>
            <li> I tried it at a relative&#x27;s house with amazing results.  </li>
            <li> works great, have this for a few years now</li>
            <li> The price is worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased my own, and again, same results.  </li>
            <li> I gave this as a Christmas Gift to my 28 yr old Grand Daughter  </li>
            <li> replaced plug on two of them,otherwise powerful hair blower</li>
            <li> My sister even bought the same one once she saw how nice my hair straightens</li>
            <li> It dried my hair quickly, leaving my hair in good condition.</li>
            <li> Hot heat, powerful air dryer...</li>
            <li> this was the main reason I decided to purchase the Da Vinci 5000, as far as my research found this is THE most powerful dryer on the market @</li>
            <li> I had my last Elchim for 9 years and felt that I needed a more powerful one.  </li>
            <li> Considering how much a hair cut costs today I feel the price of this hair dryer is a bargain given the dramatic and wonderful results.  </li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> (look it up on Youtube!- Funny)  </li>
            <li> Love the red color!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m out the door with shiny, smooth, professional results.  </li>
            <li> I was reluctant to spend so much on a hairdryer, but it was absolutely worth it.  </li>
            <li> When I first turned it on, it took about 2 min to get even luke-warm.  </li>
            <li> Since then, now it takes about 30 sec to get warm.  </li>
            <li> If you like your hairdryer really hot, this might not be the item for you.</li>
            <li> and it is not that hot.  </li>
            <li> The first dryer arrived and within a week the filter kept falling off-and no I had not dropped it.</li>
            <li> My hair is always soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> ( The original works fine , but I want to have the safety shut off check out ) I am happy with this new dryer and it is a little smaller and lighter than my older model.  </li>
            <li> Easy to dry my hair and have it come out straight and smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair is straighter and shinier than I have ever been able to manage with dryer, flat iron and chemical hair products.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was quick and it definitely is new and not a refurb.  </li>
            <li> It gets hot and it dries hair fast.</li>
            <li> I love Elchim, as I have been using their hair dryers for a long time.</li>
            <li> chose the Da Vinci because it is a bit more powerful than the other 2, has the option to use a REAL Ion</li>
            <li> this hair dryer makes me able to dry it with some heat and no smell of burnt hair (like my drugstore brands).  </li>
            <li> I was not confident in my ability to create a similar look at home, but with this dryer I had a nice smooth finish on the first try!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not paying this much for some used dryer.</li>
            <li> and I blow it straight when I wash it.  </li>
            <li> It really dries the hair fast.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair straight and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> On the flip side, that means it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair too much.</li>
            <li> Elchim is very well made (made in Italy) feels well made in your hand</li>
            <li> VERY DISSAPOINTED.</li>
            <li> It looks salon styled, straight with no frizz.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon ...PaPuddin</li>
            <li> Ended up buying mine from Amazon - for much lower cost then from the store</li>
            <li> The hair dryer works well, but not as well as the same one my hairdresser has, thus leaving me wondering if it is a genuine product or just a copy.</li>
            <li> straight</li>
            <li> The comb attachment is nice for drying before straightening with a round brush and the concentrator attachment.    </li>
            <li> (save that card/address someplace safe), with $18 - and they completely rebuild it and send it back to you (like if the motor ever reaches the end of its life).  </li>
            <li> Only con would be that its loud, but no louder then most.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw this blowdryer especially at that price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> And what I enjoy most about using this dryer is the easy heat and air controls and the cold shot button.  </li>
            <li> night I turned it on, the plug made a strange sound- shook in the outlet and after this the dryer will not turn on.</li>
            <li> This dryer has cut my maintenance time in half with much better results.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased countless hair dryers of many different brands over the years.  </li>
            <li> My item shipped in a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> I wanted a high end dryer that would reduce the frizz and make my hair softer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I would never go back to using any other kind.    </li>
            <li> This is my second one, the first one someone stole from me!</li>
            <li> This model&#x27;s cord (where it meets the handle of the hair dryer) is much sturdier and I believe they have fixed the problem.  </li>
            <li> Elchim dryer is a true professional hair dryer this is not your run of the mill Walmart/Drugstore hair dryer as you can tell by the price.&lt;br /&gt;There is a BIG difference between the 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that I am sending the original one to the repair center  to have the plug in worked on.</li>
            <li> I like using the attachments as well to help direct the airflow and straighten my hair a little more while drying.</li>
            <li> so I wanted something new regardless.  </li>
            <li> I bought the first one 7 years ago and the only reason I bought this new one -is</li>
            <li> /&gt;It now takes her about 5-6mins to dry her hair instead of 15 mins and her hair surprisingly enough actually feels better to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Elchim because of a power cord issue.  </li>
            <li> My dryer was about 9 years old and they are warrantied for life, so I&#x27;ll probably send it in at some point and just have it as a spare in a guest bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and choose to disregard the low reviews because I really wanted an ELCHIM blowdryer.  </li>
            <li> The dryer&#x27;s printed on logo was already fading (brand new?)and only had \\&quot;Elchim\\&quot; printed on the side, which I know is not what the real dryer has as its logo.</li>
            <li> Also not as loud as this blow dryer.     </li>
            <li> I am over 70 years old</li>
            <li> She Loves the Hair Dryer and says it makes her hair so soft.  </li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and have been blowing drying my hair every day since, well since electricity was invented (almost).  </li>
            <li> I bought it just a few days before Christmas and sure enough it came in time like they said it would.  </li>
            <li> dryer works as promised, has cut down the time it takes to dry her hair by 50% or more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, from drugstore quality to various high end, mortgage payment price quality - and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much quieter than my previous dryer and dries much faster.  </li>
            <li> and I used to have to dry my hair then use a straighting iron to get it completely straight.  </li>
            <li> Now it takes 10 minutes to get my hair dry and straight and with body.  </li>
            <li> I have only had this dryer for a week, but so far it has delivered on all it promised.  </li>
            <li> THIS dryer not only cuts my drying time in half, but my hair is now SO soft and straight!</li>
            <li> and it is as heavy or slightly heavier than most retail brands today</li>
            <li> This little guy does exactly that.</li>
            <li> When I received the box, it just didn&#x27;t look new and the parts were loose in the box.  </li>
            <li> the dryer I received did not have the gold text, but BLACK text, very minimalist look..</li>
            <li> After spending hours reviewing for professional blow dryers, I settled on the Elchim 5000 DaVinci for numerous reasons:  Other reviewers&#x27; feedback, particularly here on Amazon (and on other review sites), the $19 exchange program for defects after one year, the power of the dryer, the design, and oh yeah - Amazon had a price which could NOT be beat anywhere!  </li>
            <li> This process took me 30 minutes and would make my hair flat.  </li>
            <li> I have invested in a dryer from Italy that seems to have comments I like to hear- including long lasting, no fire hazard and silky hair.</li>
            <li> /this while not needed a flat iron.</li>
            <li> plug is poorly made not durable,cracks easily if dropped, never happened with other manufactures.</li>
            <li> and I know the quality of Elchim will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> so it is not a struggle to get the back dry.  </li>
            <li> but even though my wife has very short hair it takes her like 15 mins to dry her hair in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Late review but better late than never.     </li>
            <li> The 2000 watts definitely makes my hair dry faster.  </li>
            <li> Left my hair soft, and I dried my hair on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> what I have seen in other reviews by people that have owned Elchim dryers this one should be about the last dryer we ever buy, not to mention IF something happens to it for the lifetime of the dryer you simply send it in along with $18 and they repair</li>
            <li> I found this strange.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair which I prefer to wear straight.  </li>
            <li> It was so powerful that it cut my hair drying time in half (at least).  </li>
            <li> I use the comb attachment to dry my hair</li>
            <li> I am a girl that is comb blow dry and go!</li>
            <li> the only other one that came close was a Sedu (made in France) that has 86 M3/h (1500 liters per min) air flow.&lt;br /&gt;There are also 3-4 other Elchim dryers in that 1400-1500liters per min air flow range.&lt;br</li>
            <li> cheaper dryer might give the same performance for less money even if it breaks yearly.</li>
            <li> It really does take less time for me to dry my hair,which is wavy shoulder length and thick.-</li>
            <li> If you ever have a problem with an Elchim, you just send it to the repair center at the address provided on your warranty card in the box</li>
            <li> The $94.50 plus a few dollars for shipping is a deal in my mind (compared to my local retail stores and salons).</li>
            <li> I have had this dryer for 4 years now with absolutely no issues.</li>
            <li> I spent almost $90 on this dryer.</li>
            <li> Only downside, long thick and unwieldy cord and absolutely no instructions other than don&#x27;t use around water.</li>
            <li> I used the comb attachment to start with drying my bangs and the back underside of my hair, then switch to using the black attachment with a round brush.  </li>
            <li> I cant say that I feel it is quieter than other brands (as other reviewers have claimed)</li>
            <li> Two years have passed with use just about every other day.</li>
            <li> I found this hair dryer to be heavier than my older model, but not too heavy so that it&#x27;s difficult to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> From wet hair patted with a towel to styled and dried 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> My two cons are that it didn&#x27;t come with a diffuser, and the cord seems to be wearing down already.</li>
            <li> only issue is that diffusers do not fit on this one!!</li>
            <li> The only possible conclusion was that it is a FAKE.  </li>
            <li> I previously had the ConAir Ion shine.  </li>
            <li> What used to seem like a lot of money for an Elchim (typically I pay in the $130 range) now seems like a bargain (when compared to that $300 piece of junk).    </li>
            <li> My hair dries in half the time.  </li>
            <li> I needed less anti frizz products as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> I have hair that is above shoulder length and is naturally wavy and tends to frizz, sometimes badly, during the humid summer months.  </li>
            <li> My hair dresser said my hair dryer was too harsh on my hair.  </li>
            <li> 4/20/14 have had it for about 6 1/2 years so far and still works perfectly, no problems.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time.  </li>
            <li> Yet cheaper models have some scary reviews, complete with flames, burned hair and sparks.  </li>
            <li> I taped it up with some electrical tape, but it&#x27;s disappointing from such an expensive high end dryer.</li>
            <li> I had tried a few times at home and ended up with Roseanna Roseanadanna hair!  </li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 just because I wanted different models (got bored).  </li>
            <li> In the past, this has always meant 20-25 minutes of blow drying followed by the straightening iron...until the elchim.  </li>
            <li> Actually I won&#x27;t be surprised if the seller gave me a broken or FAKE.</li>
            <li> The power in this machine is unbelievable - my short, but very thick hair, can take forever to dry, but not with this bad boy - 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and</li>
            <li> I have thick and curly shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I think the design in the previous model was flawed</li>
            <li> Before buying it, I checked reviews and a lot of people were concerned that this product is a fake, because of the way it was packaged (Dryer in the small plastic bag and the rest of the parts are just laying around).</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective blow dryer or its FAKE.</li>
            <li> I am not inherently vain but for some reason am obsessed with ensuring that my hair looks presentable.  </li>
            <li> but it is not unwieldy or difficult to manipulate during the drying process.  </li>
            <li> It makes me sad because I have curly hair.</li>
            <li> It may look like it would be awkward to hold, but it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> since it was packaged like it was used or the product itself is bad.     </li>
            <li> I went to a beauty supply store, where they had this dryer, packaged as badly.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed.   </li>
            <li> I paid alot of money for this and was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> While this is a GREAT hairdryer, I was very displeased w/ the packaging and condition it arrived in &amp; I am returning it! I think I got someone else&#x27;s returned dryer. The metal grid has rust on it, the dryer is scuffed. The box looked crappy. I&#x27;m not paying this much for some used dryer. When I ordered the items said \\&quot;ships &amp; sells from AMAZON\\&quot; so I thought it was a trust-worthy buy.. guess not. I have just entered for an exchange so i think Amazon will come thru for me though, and I will update my review. ;)  Oh, also, the photo needs to be updated..  the dryer I received did not have the gold text, but BLACK text, very minimalist look..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for about 2 weeks now and so far, so good.  I have long, thick, curly hair and I blow it straight when I wash it.  I also use the dryer to freshen up the look on days when I don&#x27;t wash my hair.  Its very powerful and the drying gets done quickly.  The comb attachment is nice for drying before straightening with a round brush and the concentrator attachment.    At this time, I have no complaints regarding this product and am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I was using a drugstore-bought hair dryer and my hair was FRIED.  It became coarse, brittle, and unmanageable.  My hair dresser said my hair dryer was too harsh on my hair.  I decided to invest in a good dryer.  After checking reviews on Amazon, I bought the Elchim 5000 Da Vinci Ionic Plus.  Boy!  What a difference a hair dryer made!  It was so powerful that it cut my hair drying time in half (at least).  What&#x27;s more, my hair was actually smooth and silky when I was done drying.  I thought my hair was damaged beyond hope, and couldn&#x27;t believe how nice it turned out by using this dryer.  Yes, it cost more than the drugstore hair dryers, but it&#x27;s well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is powerful, sits in a hand comfortably. The quality of the product is greate. Our experience with the Amazon is the pleasure.</li>
            <li> After research online I chose the Elchim 5000 - and I am happy with my choice.  This is my first time spending more that drugstore money on a hair dryer and am pleased.  I have thick hair and this hair dryer makes me able to dry it with some heat and no smell of burnt hair (like my drugstore brands).  I do agree that there could be better instructions.</li>
            <li> I have thick and curly shoulder length hair. I would have my hair straightened only when I would get a cut or color.  I had tried a few times at home and ended up with Roseanna Roseanadanna hair!  (look it up on Youtube!- Funny)  I was not confident in my ability to create a similar look at home, but with this dryer I had a nice smooth finish on the first try!  I used the comb attachment to start with drying my bangs and the back underside of my hair, then switch to using the black attachment with a round brush.  I use two products- a BB holding spray and a smoothing gel (Aveda maybe?) and follow the directions from my stylist.  It looks great and the dryer is so powerful that my hair is dry in about 15 minutes.  The dryer is also light so it is not a struggle to get the back dry.  I have only had this dryer for a week, but so far it has delivered on all it promised.  Will update if I have any mechanical issues.    Only downside, long thick and unwieldy cord and absolutely no instructions other than don&#x27;t use around water.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Elchim because of a power cord issue.  My dryer was about 9 years old and they are warrantied for life, so I&#x27;ll probably send it in at some point and just have it as a spare in a guest bathroom.  I think the design in the previous model was flawed so I wanted something new regardless.  This model&#x27;s cord (where it meets the handle of the hair dryer) is much sturdier and I believe they have fixed the problem.  I found this hair dryer to be heavier than my older model, but not too heavy so that it&#x27;s difficult to dry my hair.  It&#x27;s very powerful and gets just as hot as my previous Elchim, and also has the cool button which is great. Overall, I am very pleased with it and I know the quality of Elchim will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Just used the new hair dryer yesterday and love it!  It really dries the hair fast.  I have wavy hair and I used to have to dry my hair then use a straighting iron to get it completely straight.  This process took me 30 minutes and would make my hair flat.  Now it takes 10 minutes to get my hair dry and straight and with body.  I recommend this hair dryer to those with wavy or curly hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best hair dryer I have ever owned. Dries my hair amazingly fast, leaving it smooth and shiny.  Love the red color!</li>
            <li> I have used this dryer for over a month now and love it! I wanted a high end dryer that would reduce the frizz and make my hair softer. This little guy does exactly that. My hair is much softer than when I used my cheap target dryer. It is also lightweight and a good shape/balance for my hands. I like using the attachments as well to help direct the airflow and straighten my hair a little more while drying. I would recommend this product. The price is worth it.</li>
            <li> After spending hours reviewing for professional blow dryers, I settled on the Elchim 5000 DaVinci for numerous reasons:  Other reviewers&#x27; feedback, particularly here on Amazon (and on other review sites), the $19 exchange program for defects after one year, the power of the dryer, the design, and oh yeah - Amazon had a price which could NOT be beat anywhere!  This blow dryer ROCKS!  I&#x27;ve tried them all, from drugstore quality to various high end, mortgage payment price quality - and the Elchim beats them all!  The power in this machine is unbelievable - my short, but very thick hair, can take forever to dry, but not with this bad boy - 5 minutes and I&#x27;m out the door with shiny, smooth, professional results.  With the exchange program, I don&#x27;t see the need to worry about another dryer for years to come.  Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw this blowdryer especially at that price on Amazon.  I read the reviews and choose to disregard the low reviews because I really wanted an ELCHIM blowdryer.  When I received the box, it just didn&#x27;t look new and the parts were loose in the box.  I immediately got a flaskback to the warnings in the 2 star reviews.  I looked at the pictures on Amazon and Elchim websites and the logo on the dryer didn&#x27;t look the same at all.  The only possible conclusion was that it is a FAKE.  I was really disappointed.   I guess that I was really na√Øve to think that I could get this great blowdryer at this price; it was too good to be true.  I asked for a refund since I really believe that it&#x27;s not a genuine Elchim blowdryer and I will not take a chance, even though it works well it might breakdown faster.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to spend so much on a hairdryer, but it was absolutely worth it.  It&#x27;s much quieter than my previous dryer and dries much faster.  The cool shot is excellent, the variable temperature and speed controls allow you to dry hair quickly without frying it.  The nozzle attachment makes for very sleek, nicely shaped frizz-free blowouts--and quickly.  So worth it!    Also, I purchased from DiscountsJungle, recieved the product quickly (2 days) in a sealed box.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer. I had a Sedu and this is so much better! Keeps hair straight and not frizzy. Sedu reviews say that too, but not for me. Good value.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer, has a lot of airflow which is what I wanted. I previously had the ConAir Ion shine.  This one is quieter. When I first turned it on, it took about 2 min to get even luke-warm.  I found this strange.  Since then, now it takes about 30 sec to get warm.  If you like your hairdryer really hot, this might not be the item for you. I have mine on the hottest heat setting and it is not that hot.  On the flip side, that means it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair too much.</li>
            <li> I have the old dryer (the tan one) and sort of like it better because it is quieter than this one, but this one has a better vent set up.  If you take this vent set up with the screen offered on the Da Vinci and put it on the original tan dryer, you would have a winner.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer. Easy to dry my hair and have it come out straight and smooth.</li>
            <li> First and foremost just to get it out of the way this is an OUTSTANDING hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Recently purchased this dryer for my wife, the dryer we replaced was a Conair 1875 Ionshine which still works we have had no problems with it but even though my wife has very short hair it takes her like 15 mins to dry her hair in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;This Elchim dryer is a true professional hair dryer this is not your run of the mill Walmart/Drugstore hair dryer as you can tell by the price.&lt;br /&gt;There is a BIG difference between the 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Elchim is very well made (made in Italy) feels well made in your hand, well balanced.&lt;br /&gt;The air flow I would say is about 300% more than the Conair, it is literally Hurricane Force. (over 80mph)&lt;br /&gt;In fact this was the main reason I decided to purchase the Da Vinci 5000, as far as my research found this is THE most powerful dryer on the market @ 92 M3/h (1600 liters per min) air flow the only other one that came close was a Sedu (made in France) that has 86 M3/h (1500 liters per min) air flow.&lt;br /&gt;There are also 3-4 other Elchim dryers in that 1400-1500liters per min air flow range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the Da Vinci because it is a bit more powerful than the other 2, has the option to use a REAL Ion generator.&lt;br /&gt;My wife wanted one with much more air flow so I went in search of THE most powerful one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It now takes her about 5-6mins to dry her hair instead of 15 mins and her hair surprisingly enough actually feels better to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;This dryer works as promised, has cut down the time it takes to dry her hair by 50% or more, even more surprising is that it is not as loud as the old Conair even though it is much more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;This is great for me because now I am not subjected to 15 mins of loud noise every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I have seen in other reviews by people that have owned Elchim dryers this one should be about the last dryer we ever buy, not to mention IF something happens to it for the lifetime of the dryer you simply send it in along with $18 and they repair it.&lt;br /&gt;I paid $130.67 from Amazon which is counting shipping and is the cheapest price I could find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Edit)  4/20/14 have had it for about 6 1/2 years so far and still works perfectly, no problems.</li>
            <li> The dryer arrived in original packaging and undamaged.  From wet hair patted with a towel to styled and dried 10 minutes. (shoulder length hair.) Left my hair soft, and I dried my hair on the lowest setting. With a quick wip through with a straighter, my hair was just how I like it in under 15 minutes. Wonderful. This item was fulfilled by amazon.com</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this hair dryer! I&#x27;ve been through MANY hair dryers in my life and never seen any difference in anything but speed. THIS dryer not only cuts my drying time in half, but my hair is now SO soft and straight! I use the comb attachment to dry my hair and it&#x27;s done in no time! Just found out it&#x27;s what my hair dresser uses at the salon!</li>
            <li> I love the Elchim products.  I had my last Elchim for 9 years and felt that I needed a more powerful one.  I love the elchim 5000 Da Vinci.  It gets hot and it dries hair fast.</li>
            <li> The dryer I received yesterday arrived in an open box (not factory sealed) with all of the contents rolling around inside. The dryer box was damaged and there was no instruction booklet (?)   The most disapponting part was that the dryer itself was clearly a fake. The picture of the Elhim Da Vinci 5000 on Amazon was NOT what I received. The dryer&#x27;s printed on logo was already fading (brand new?)and only had \\&quot;Elchim\\&quot; printed on the side, which I know is not what the real dryer has as its logo. Amazon stated it would be shipped from them so I trusted that I would not be ripped off and would be provided excellent quality assurance as with other products I&#x27;ve ordered from them. Not so with this product! I have asked for a prompt refund and will be more wary of things I order from this site going forward.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer because of all the fabulous reviews. I love my hair and take really good care of it.  The first dryer arrived and within a week the filter kept falling off-and no I had not dropped it. I called amazon and they replaced it with another one. THIS ON ACTUALLY SUCKED MY HAIR THROUGH THE FILTER AND WRAPPED IT AROUND THE FAN!!! I HAD TO CUT OFF A CHUNK OF MY HAIR OFF TO GET IT OUT!!!!   I AM REALLY, REALLY UPSET!!! I can&#x27;t believe no one had this issue before? I have medium length hair and have never had this problem before????  BEWARE IF YOU CHERISH YOUR HAIR DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading the rave reviews, and when I got it and used it, I thought: \\&quot;Meh. Big deal. It&#x27;s a hairdryer.\\&quot;    Then, after 3 months of using it, I was visiting friends and used their ConAir hairdryer (similar to the one I used to use prior to purchasing this one). Boy! What a difference! This hairdryer is much, much better and I would never go back to using any other kind.    I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with this product. Late review but better late than never.     I bought this last Christmas as one of my gifts for my wife and the packaging was abysmal. Literally was just dumped in a box. No foam, plastic, or anything to support the dryer. It seemed like it was opened used and put back in the box. Actually I won&#x27;t be surprised if the seller gave me a broken or FAKE. VERY DISSAPOINTED. I bought another blow dryer (Tourmaline) for christmas for my mom as well and it was cheaper and BETTER packaging (actually  had cardboard support to hold the dryer) and better quality. Also not as loud as this blow dryer.     Reason I am writing the review 5 months from now is after using this product for 5 months and going back to my moms house recently to use the Tourmaline blow dryer i bought her for christmas, My moms was quieter and just dryed my hair better. I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective blow dryer or its FAKE. since it was packaged like it was used or the product itself is bad.     Gets 1 star for getting crappy packaging and for my mothers cheaper Tourmaline blow dryer being better.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most outstanding blowdryer ever.  I have purchased three Elchim&#x27;s over the last 15 years and I still have them all.  If you ever have a problem with an Elchim, you just send it to the repair center at the address provided on your warranty card in the box (save that card/address someplace safe), with $18 - and they completely rebuild it and send it back to you (like if the motor ever reaches the end of its life).  So, unless you somehow lose it, this blowdryer could be the last one you ever purchase.  I have purchased 3 just because I wanted different models (got bored).  I consider this Da Vinci to be a step up over my Uragano because it has the cool shot and it is 2000 watts.  The 2000 watts definitely makes my hair dry faster.  My hair is always soft and smooth. I do use top of the line products too though (Fekkai, Aveda, Bumble and Bumble).    I won&#x27;t say you have to trust me, but I have been AROUND THE BLOCK with blowdryers in my 45 years.  All the best salons use Elchim&#x27;s.  They are the best.    My sister recently tried to sell me on those T3 Evolution $300 blowdryers recently.  What a waste of time.  The hottest setting on that one actually singed my a hair off.  What used to seem like a lot of money for an Elchim (typically I pay in the $130 range) now seems like a bargain (when compared to that $300 piece of junk).    Mine came from BeautySupplies4Less through Amazon.  The shipping was quick and it definitely is new and not a refurb.  The $94.50 plus a few dollars for shipping is a deal in my mind (compared to my local retail stores and salons).</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair which I prefer to wear straight.  In the past, this has always meant 20-25 minutes of blow drying followed by the straightening iron...until the elchim.  I tried it at a relative&#x27;s house with amazing results.  I purchased my own, and again, same results.  My hair dries in half the time.  It looks salon styled, straight with no frizz.  I&#x27;m using the same hair products, so the only difference is the dryer.  I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled!  Great looking hair in half the time...what more can you ask for???</li>
            <li> This is a high-quality hair dryer, easy to use, easy to plug into wall socket.  And, it gives my very fine hair BODY.  I am over 70 years old and I really appreciate this wonderful dryer.</li>
            <li> Elchim 5000r 5000 Da Vinci Ionic Plus 2000 Watt Hair Dryer, Red  I gave this as a Christmas Gift to my 28 yr old Grand Daughter  Finally got word for my review from her today ...  She Loves the Hair Dryer and says it makes her hair so soft.  Told me it was well worth the money I paid for it, as I asked her opinion on that!, for this review.  So if she is Happy , I am happy .  Might have to buy one for myself now !  I will also add the service through Amazon was wonderful as always.  I bought it just a few days before Christmas and sure enough it came in time like they said it would.  Thanks Amazon ...PaPuddin</li>
            <li> First, the reason I put 5 stars, is because the product is great, even with how its packaged.   Before buying it, I checked reviews and a lot of people were concerned that this product is a fake, because of the way it was packaged (Dryer in the small plastic bag and the rest of the parts are just laying around). I went to a beauty supply store, where they had this dryer, packaged as badly. I called Elchim company in US, and they confirmed that the packaging should look like that. Ended up buying mine from Amazon - for much lower cost then from the store</li>
            <li> This is my second one, the first one someone stole from me! I bought the same model and everything. This blow dryer rocks!! I am a girl that is comb blow dry and go! This blower dryer is the fastest blow dryer i have ever owned! Read the reviews about it before I brought it and it lived up to everything everyone was raving about! BUY IT!!!</li>
            <li> The hair dryer arrived in a open box smashed inside a USPS box leaving the contents rolling around inside and  subsequently the hair dryer was scratched. The NOT factory sealed box did not contain a warranty card or instruction booklet. The hair dryer works well, but not as well as the same one my hairdresser has, thus leaving me wondering if it is a genuine product or just a copy. I paid alot of money for this and was very disappointed. If an item I want on Amazon is from DiscountJungle I won&#x27;t be buying.</li>
            <li> Nice dryer. Made in Italy. Looks good, feels good but realy over priced  Makes a lot of noise. Saves around 10-15% of time compare with previos $30.00 drier.     Would I recomend? Yes if you have extra $50.00 to spear and no if you on budget</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and have been blowing drying my hair every day since, well since electricity was invented (almost).  I am not inherently vain but for some reason am obsessed with ensuring that my hair looks presentable.  I have purchased countless hair dryers of many different brands over the years.  With no reservation whatsoever I can say that this is the best hairdryer I have ever used.  I have hair that is above shoulder length and is naturally wavy and tends to frizz, sometimes badly, during the humid summer months.  Unfortunatley I happen to like my hair straight so I spend alot of time fussing.  This dryer has cut my maintenance time in half with much better results.  I cant say that I feel it is quieter than other brands (as other reviewers have claimed) and it is as heavy or slightly heavier than most retail brands today but it is not unwieldy or difficult to manipulate during the drying process.  What it does is provide for a very fast, smooth blow out.  My hair is straighter and shinier than I have ever been able to manage with dryer, flat iron and chemical hair products.  Considering how much a hair cut costs today I feel the price of this hair dryer is a bargain given the dramatic and wonderful results.  I do not hesitate to recommend it if you can afford the price.</li>
            <li> I have had this dryer for 4 years now with absolutely no issues. It was authentic and works beautifully to this day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that diffusers do not fit on this one!! Diffusers made by elchim, universal diffusers.... Nothing works. It makes me sad because I have curly hair.</li>
            <li> I spent almost $90 on this dryer. It dried my hair quickly, leaving my hair in good condition. I have thick hair so the quick dry was wonderful. I needed less anti frizz products as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night I turned it on, the plug made a strange sound- shook in the outlet and after this the dryer will not turn on. It did not over heat or require clearing out of debree.  Two years have passed with use just about every other day. I was expecting a longer life, as this comes out at about $45 a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cheaper dryer might give the same performance for less money even if it breaks yearly. Yet cheaper models have some scary reviews, complete with flames, burned hair and sparks.  I have invested in a dryer from Italy that seems to have comments I like to hear- including long lasting, no fire hazard and silky hair. Stay tuned on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully when the Elchim broke it caused no harm, no sparks no flames. I enjoyed it while it lasted.</li>
            <li> This dryer was recommended by my hairdresser.  It may look like it would be awkward to hold, but it isn&#x27;t.  And what I enjoy most about using this dryer is the easy heat and air controls and the cold shot button.  I am now in the market to see if they sell a diffuser that will fit on the dryer so I can also go curly.</li>
            <li> works great, have this for a few years now</li>
            <li> I love Elchim, as I have been using their hair dryers for a long time. I bought this one as a gift for my mom, she loves it!&lt;br /&gt;A quality hair dryer certainly makes a huge difference when  styling your hair.</li>
            <li> plug is poorly made not durable,cracks easily if dropped, never happened with other manufactures. replaced plug on two of them,otherwise powerful hair blower</li>
            <li> This came recommended by my hair stylist.  Is is the best hair dryer I have owned.  Wish it came in a travel size.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent Blow Dryer. The cosmotologist enjoy using.  We have purchase before and will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> I did not have any problems with the company. My item shipped in a decent amount of time. I am happy with my blow dryer but i&#x27;m not so sure it is not refurbished.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Discounts Jungle and it looked like I got a used dryer. No instructions, no booklet, and it came in an opened bag.</li>
            <li> This dryer is great! Hot heat, powerful air dryer... Then died after just one year! At this price it should last longer than that!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer! The air is fast and high powered, and is great. My two cons are that it didn&#x27;t come with a diffuser, and the cord seems to be wearing down already. I taped it up with some electrical tape, but it&#x27;s disappointing from such an expensive high end dryer. (Although it&#x27;s probably caused by the way I wrap the cord around the dryer.)</li>
            <li> Great blow dryer!  Dries hair very fast!  Only con would be that its loud, but no louder then most. I&#x27;d still buy again and definitely recommend it to others.  My sister even bought the same one once she saw how nice my hair straightens w/this while not needed a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Replacement for an existing Elchim&lt;br /&gt;This is my second Elchim- I bought the first one 7 years ago and the only reason I bought this new one -is that I am sending the original one to the repair center  to have the plug in worked on. ( The original works fine , but I want to have the safety shut off check out ) I am happy with this new dryer and it is a little smaller and lighter than my older model.  It really does take less time for me to dry my hair,which is wavy shoulder length and thick.-</li>
