            <li>I was happy with.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy that I can play with the hair remover treatment and not ruin my hair.</li>

            <li>am now happy to report that my hair is a uniform medium brown color.</li>
            <li>good - it did the job.</li>
            <li>My hair was in really good shape, considering that I just bleached the daylights out of it.  </li>
            <li>and it didnt do as well as this product but still worked fairly well.</li>
            <li>The thing did not smell good at all.</li>
            <li>So in the end i was very very pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li>and it was very effective and does not contain bleach (though it sure smells</li>
            <li>But yea, awesome product, if need, i will go to this product first before bleach or anything else.</li>
            <li>and I ended up with a carrot top!</li>
            <li>It looks really cute!  </li>
            <li>It was amazing.</li>
            <li>I had bought a light blond dye to redye as recommended, but no way would I use it now as my hair is a great color.</li>
            <li>I had bought my recover dye, but I really liked the amber color</li>
            <li>And i honestly didnt want sulphur smelling hair, So after reading reviews about loreal hair color remover, i decided to take a plunge and try it.</li>
            <li>...I have been dying my own hair for years.</li>
            <li>I said to myself there has to be a way to do this on my own.</li>
            <li>a nice \\&quot;carrot top\\&quot; color</li>
            <li>Although this product is far from perfect, I think it does a good job at what it&#x27;s supposed to do:</li>
            <li>You should do thorough research before doing your hair at home on your own.</li>
            <li>The product also gets warm to the touch in about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>My hair is still in very good condition and i achieved the exact color</li>
            <li>My hair is still in very good condition and i achieved the exact color i wanted.</li>
            <li>I put the new color on and everything went superb after that.  </li>
            <li>Im just super happy</li>
            <li>Made it very easy to color with a lighter color</li>
            <li>oops and despite the smell which nearly suffocated me, LOVED LOVED IT!</li>
            <li>Color oops shrinks the die molecules and leaves your natural hair alone, this product turned my hair bright ORANGE!!!!</li>
            <li>It is now a warm light-medium brown, more natural-looking and uniformly colored than I&#x27;ve seen it in years.</li>
            <li>but I was able to dye it a light brown afterward and am very pleased an relieved.</li>
            <li>Nice and Easy</li>
            <li>so I went with one that was more orange-red.</li>
            <li>A lot more, it turned out.</li>
            <li>I had been scared that it would just get more orange than what I stared with, but the red-red came out well</li>
            <li>Ok, background information.</li>
            <li>However, my healthy, shiny hair was ravaged.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not for people who are just used to coloring at home, it needs more skill and ability.  </li>
            <li>I then read what many people had said about the product and was so scared to try it out myself.</li>
            <li>I was able to re-color with Clairol 118A</li>
            <li>I read many reviews and the biggest problems seemed to be that this remover worked too well...</li>
            <li>I should have more luck lightening and recoloring.</li>
            <li>/&gt;update.. i was able to color over my hair and get a mostly even color result.</li>
            <li>Ive read before to make sure you have your desired color on hand to color afterwards.</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t LOOK damaged, it was silky and perfect, but obviously the color wasn&#x27;t taking.</li>
            <li>but this is a multi-step process and this product saved me a lot of money by being able to do step one in the process</li>
            <li>but this is a multi-step process and this product saved me a lot of money by being able to do step one in the process</li>
            <li>With many doubts, My hair never goes how I want it to.</li>
            <li>For the $1 more it cost over OOPS</li>
            <li>My hair is more than 95% gray and keeping it brown required doing my roots every two weeks.</li>
            <li>There was alot of breakage, and even more tears.</li>
            <li>Ok, I learned my lesson years ago with bleach.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it is still chemical</li>
            <li>TURNED MY HAIR ORANGE on top and spotted everywhere else.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off buying a pack of bleach (2.99) and developer (2.99) for about $6 tops at Sallys.</li>
            <li>This worked leaps and bounds better than the stuff I got at Sally Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li>I love this product for the price.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I would not leave it on more than 20-mins.</li>
            <li>i am satisfied but plan on recoloring to a lighter color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>More problems then before....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li>The hair was an even Marilyn Monroe flaxen blond and looked fabulous!  </li>
            <li>be fair, on the VERY top of directions within the box it does say that it doesn&#x27;t return your hair to natural color.</li>
            <li>Plus with the conditioner I didn&#x27;t have problems with it being too runny as it made more of a cream that I was able to easily apply all over my hair.</li>
            <li>It was 25 minutes in (not the original 45!)</li>
            <li>Worth the price!!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT because it removed Jet Black hair color perfectly</li>
            <li>/&gt;IT WORKED AMAZINGLY and according to exactly what it said!  </li>
            <li>For those of you that arent familiar which a protein filler, it basically helps your hair to absorb the color better.</li>
            <li>Unless you are someone familiar with product ingredients, it is not until you get home and are able to read the instructions that you find out that the product is not what the name implies.</li>
            <li>shampooed the solution out, which wasn&#x27;t that easy to do since it made</li>
            <li>It does not spread easily once it is on the hair.  </li>
            <li>i would not recommend using this hair color remover product unless you have really strong hair follicles that can withstand the bleaching done to the hair,</li>
            <li>The smell is quite strong</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a strong bleach.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be good to try taking all the color out of my hair to do new color.  </li>
            <li>and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>But this is the best thing to strip black.</li>
            <li>and it should be fine.</li>
            <li>If you DO want to lighten your hair, you are much better off just using bleach to be able to apply evenly and get a consistent outcome.</li>
            <li>My hair lightened tremendously!</li>
            <li>so I wanted to go light brown.  </li>
            <li>It is important to remember, when using this product, the goal is red/orange/yellow.</li>
            <li>read ALL the reviews, found it available in store, and despite the instructions to do a test strip of hair, I went all in and immediately used the product according to the directions.  </li>
            <li>What a fantastic job</li>
            <li>Unless you already have light hair, the minimum waiting time on this is 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once your hair turns a nice orange shade, you&#x27;re ready to wash it out.</li>
            <li>the cheap under $5</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the product and would use it again if I find myself in the same predicament in the future.e</li>
            <li>it stripped the color leaving it a light copper/brownish color.</li>
            <li>however I would not use a warm tone as the hair color remover already leaves you with plenty of red/orange/yellow tones and a warm hair color is likely to leave you quite brassy.</li>
            <li>I always use L&#x27;Oreal color products and decided to go with a brand I was familiar with.     </li>
            <li>I used Vidal Sassoon Salonist in Light Cool Brown and my hair is still caramel/light auburn brown</li>
            <li>It worked great for me, and I have very long hair.</li>
            <li>, i used my L&#x27;Oréal light reddish blonde and was good to go.</li>
            <li>I thought that it worked great, and I am glad to be back to a normal color.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>so it reaches the right color!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, no breakage, and minimally frizzy.</li>
            <li>All you really need to do with this product is closely follow the instructions, test it out on a cut section of hair, and make sure you watch it</li>
            <li>Yes, my hair was a copper color (which I actually liked, but of course still had my natural colored roots)</li>
            <li>but it was healthy and ready immediately to recolor.  </li>
            <li>You have to really make sure it&#x27;s soaked into your hair in order for it to work.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I wasn&#x27;t expecting much however, my hair looks fantastic!  </li>
            <li>If you want a TRUE hair color REMOVER, this is NOT the product for you.</li>
            <li>If you want a TRUE hair color REMOVER, this is NOT the product for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad color</li>
            <li>I dyed my hair a light brown (it says to dye your hair right away).</li>
            <li>If you did buy this and want to use this product anyways I STRONGLY recommend doing a strand test first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d lightened my medium brown hair to a nice light copper color, but it was starting to grow out.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the result, and I&#x27;m glad to be blonde again!</li>
            <li>This does work like mild bleach.</li>
            <li>i quickly washed this garbage out of my hair and had a closer look.</li>
            <li>Seeing some of the reviews here, I can say I was lucky.</li>
            <li>Your roots will turn super blonde/orange if you put this product in those areas.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I read the ingredients before using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Always put conditioner on your ends before coloring, and super condition after you color.</li>
            <li>I am usually very pleased with the results (all excepting this last time).</li>
            <li>My hair was pretty much light orange when I washed this product out after leaving it on for twenty minutes.</li>
            <li>I used dark ash blond haircolor and it turned out great.</li>
            <li>It was a rather vibrant light orange color, which I had been warned to expect, so I countered the orange tones by dying my hair a light \\&quot;ash\\&quot; brown.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend the protein filler, this really made the difference.</li>
            <li>One box didn&#x27;t go very far, but it turned out okay in the end.</li>
            <li>I wished I had saved myself the $20 and started with this first!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to use bleach on your hair, read the ingredients FIRST!</li>
            <li>It worked very well!!</li>
            <li>I had very healthy, soft hair, but the last coloring leaned way too much red, especially right on top.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend OOPS as a remover.ust using bleach to be able to apply evenly and get a consistent outcome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried to pull color out of my hair before on my own and have only had it done once at the salon.</li>
            <li>I dyed my naturally medium-blonde hair with L&#x27;Oreals \\&quot;Healthy</li>
            <li>I am going to have to look up some conditioning treatments that work better than the hot oil stuff and normal conditioners.  </li>
            <li>and i also picked up 1 bottle of colorful neutral protein filler hair dressers color insurance.</li>
            <li>And my hair is soft as silk :)</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B001HBN5JO COLORFUL Neutral Protein Filler Hairdressers Color Insurance</li>

            <li>B001HBN5JO COLORFUL Neutral Protein Filler Hairdressers</li>
            <li>I decided it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it felt soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled as my hair really has an even natural color.  </li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a try</li>
            <li>And if your hair is in good condition proceed with extreme caution.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave my hair orange but not quite right.</li>
            <li>It also stung my scalp in use, and the texture of my hair right now is just destroyed.    </li>
            <li>it says you should recolor right away.</li>
            <li>right side?</li>
            <li>I am satisfied because it did live up to its promise and now (when I&#x27;m ready)</li>
            <li>and it is basically back to the nice copper I was going for--with the roots lightened enough to blend better.</li>
            <li>:P If this doesn&#x27;t fill it in I&#x27;ll just go tomorrow and get a flat brown close to my natural color and then leave it for a while.</li>
            <li>It needs a nice long break.</li>
            <li>I typically wait the full 50-60 minutes, just to make sure it&#x27;s as light as it&#x27;s going to get.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty streaky right now because of the lack of coverage one box of this product provides.</li>
            <li>Ion&#x27;s Color Corrector is gentle, easy &amp; extremely effective in only removing the product, leaving you with your natural hair color.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>But I could tell my ends were no longer black, so that was good.</li>
            <li>But I could tell my ends were no longer black, so that was good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the product and would use it again if I find myself in the same predicament in the future.</li>
            <li>I shampooed my hair three times, then conditioned it really good, rinsed with cool water for a short time and left conditioner in my hair.</li>
            <li>This product is very gentle to the hair, I suggest to go ahead and put a protein pack on it for 30 minutes afterwards.</li>
            <li>Per the instructions, I then followed up immediately by applying a new permanent color, which was the medium brown I was originally going for.</li>
            <li>Per the instructions, I then followed up immediately by applying a new permanent color, which was the medium brown I was originally going for.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome, I had gone to a professional salon asking about a color correction (I had bright pink hair, with patches or green and yellow streaks)</li>
            <li>The Developer liquid is 2 oz, so I put some hot tap water in a measuring cup and stirred in a blob of conditioner until it was melted, then poured that into the bottle with the powder in it.</li>
            <li>And I made sure to deep condition before I used it just as an added precaution.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is only for the highly skilled.  </li>
            <li>Okay, I actually bought this item a couple days ago from duane reade but had never read the reviews of it at first.</li>
            <li>First thing I did was mix the powder with hot water instead of the hair color remover liquid.</li>
            <li>I knew, going in, that this product was a bleach and not merely a color remover.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased.</li>
            <li>this product does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>I combined the mixture from all four kits in one bowl and made sure it was thoroughly mixed before I had</li>
            <li>I rinsed out my hair, and at first i couldnt tell if there was any change.</li>
            <li>product does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li>but it faded after a week to the exact color I intended it to be, medium auburn brown.</li>
            <li>I wanted to go lighter and needed to get the brown out first.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I had wanted.</li>
            <li>Personally I think COlor Oops works better to REMOVE the color</li>
            <li>In my 20+ yrs of self-coloring, this was the first time I had goofed on my roots.  </li>
            <li>the hairdresser didn&#x27;t want to \\&quot;damage\\&quot; my hair, or just wanted me to come back again and again for more money.</li>
            <li>I have an even all over color for the first time in a year.  </li>
            <li>But I tried to apply the liquid to ends first, working up.</li>
            <li>my hair kind of rough &amp; tangle-y (sp?).</li>
            <li>I no longer have hot roots or orangey-red splotches.</li>
            <li>So for me, this product worked exactly as intended.</li>
            <li>kind of rough &amp; tangle-y (sp?).</li>
            <li>I no longer have hot roots or orangey-red splotches.</li>
            <li>So for me, this product worked exactly as intended.</li>
            <li>This is my first time &amp;#34;bleaching&amp;#34; my hair.</li>
            <li>Make sure to avoid the colored roots until last.  </li>
            <li>Also, I chose a dark golden blonde/light golden brown hair color because the OOPS says you should try a shade or two lighter as hair will soak more color after use...</li>
            <li>I tried the vitamin-c method, and it did great lifting my newest hair, my roots, to a burgundy red without any damage but not really my bleached/black ends.</li>
            <li>Using this product was a little scary and took a lot of nerve, but I did it and was proud of myself and happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Because the color is a great shade of blonde for me, I won&#x27;t be using any other dyes over it.    </li>
            <li>the only good part of this whole thing is that my hair didn&#x27;t fall out, but i ended up having to get 16 inches of hair cut off because every time i brushed my hair</li>
            <li>I decided to color my hair dark blond, which turned out kind of reddish brown.  </li>
            <li>I am changing my makeup to a more pastel look and the total effect is young and fresh.  </li>
            <li>After 15 minutes the JET BLACK color was already a nice chestnut brown.</li>
            <li>It was simple to use and easy to gauge.</li>
            <li>make sure you have a box of color to follow the remover with once your hair is dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It damages your hair of course but with the conditioner that comes with hair dye boxes or just buy a good one, it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve been dyeing my head with the main color (cool dark brown), but, using this to create highlights (bangs, streaks on top, etc.).  </li>
            <li>The color remover removed the black from most of my hair and turned it orange, with very light almost blonde roots.</li>
            <li>Plus, 2 oz is not very much, so I can see how people with longer hair or wanting to saturate it more than I was would have problems.</li>
            <li>Save your money, time, and hair and just go professional the first time!</li>
            <li>I was able to re-dye my hair its natural color right after using this, and with a deep conditioning treatment, my hair is pretty much as healthy and the same color as it was before the initial dye job.</li>
            <li>stayed calm and did a little more research.</li>
            <li>Uneven saturation is probably a big component in the splotchy results some people have experienced.     </li>
            <li>used this product and, as expected, my hair ended up bright orange red with platinum/yellow roots.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really improve things.     </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Bleachy\\&quot; is one thing; \\&quot;ready for the</li>
            <li>This stuff did nothing for my hair, didn&#x27;t remove much color.</li>
            <li>color oops is not a bleach based product and it works very well for me</li>
            <li>in that it stripped hair too much.</li>
            <li>my jet-black hair turned a shade of red-orange; very tiger-like in tones.</li>
            <li>I made sure to apply it carefully so that each piece of hair was covered.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to use between 1-2 oz, but i felt 2 oz was too much.</li>
            <li>Even my mother noticed my hair was changing color fast.</li>
            <li>And my hair was soo much softer.</li>
            <li>...My hair wasn&#x27;t exactly ready to color again.</li>
            <li>So after  a day of research I was ready to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is a harder shade to remove, maybe needed more time)  </li>
            <li>had to leave it on the whole hour...</li>
            <li>I just do the mask very couple of days now.</li>
            <li>I assume this is because my hair was really red/orange before I colored and that changed the outcome.</li>
            <li>and when it was light enough, I washed it out.  </li>
            <li>and next I may go to a light mocha...~</li>
            <li>But this product just being bleach didn&#x27;t really have a smell that lingered, I&#x27;m used to bleaching hair so it didn&#x27;t bother me but didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li>I went straight to the bathroom and started mixing this stuff.</li>
            <li>Having dye stripped out of your hair in a salon is VERY expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you have really damaged hair already though you may want to opt for the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I absolutely had to, I would use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is basically bleach, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s done as much damage to my hair as bleach has.</li>
            <li>but i didn&#x27;t really care at the time.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I did NOT take out much of my hair color.</li>
            <li>did not come out, it got lighter but not by much.</li>
            <li>I thought.&lt;br /&gt;I put this gunk on my hair, avoiding my roots as much as I can, waited the 50 minutes I did for my test strands.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>The product DOES basically do what it says it will do in the instructions, but I think it is very misleading to customers to call it a hair color remover.</li>
            <li>I really wish I bought two instead of</li>
            <li>If you are thinking that a \\&quot;hair color remover\\&quot; will magically bring you back to your natural color</li>
            <li>Get a good boar brush, don&#x27;t shampoo for several days prior to coloring, shampoo will strip hair of natural protection.</li>
            <li>After 4 uses, it has consistently stripped my hair and made it ready to take new color.</li>
            <li>But I would recommend using a clear protein filler right after you use this</li>
            <li>But I would recommend using a clear protein filler right after you use this</li>
            <li>Over all I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to go lighter or back to their original hair color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m following it up with a Garnier Nutrisse light brown SUPER hydrating dye to try to fill in the blonde roots</li>
            <li>I had red splotches on my face, though I would clean it off ASAP.  </li>
            <li>About four years ago I had virgin hair which is naturally dark brown and went to a salon and asked for a bright wine red</li>
            <li>oops was gentle, even though it stunk to high heaven).</li>
            <li>My hair was still black --except for where I used to have highlights which turned BRIGHT COPPERY RED.</li>
            <li>This seemedf like an effective, affordable solution from my usual hair dye brand.</li>
            <li>I left the product on my hair for a full hour, shampooed, and rinsed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s just a regular old bleach powder and developer, which is fine, just call it what it is.</li>
            <li>It will be ready for a new color as long as it is light brown or darker.</li>
            <li>and before you color your hair so that your new color will really</li>
            <li>and before you color your hair so that your new color will really</li>
            <li>It started lightening some parts of it right away, and it turned a lot of my hair dark red and bright blonde.....</li>
            <li>I will use this product on the top half of my head in a day or two.    </li>
            <li>It left the color in the ends of my hair, turned my hair many shades of yellow.  </li>
            <li>I did use the super conditioner that I had left from coloring (I used Feria)after rinsing and shampooing.</li>
            <li>He paid for my hair to be recolored by a professional about a week later, after that I had a light blondish brown color.</li>
            <li>It is NOT like OOPS which simply removes the most recent colors you have applied to your hair.</li>
            <li>The following day, after wearing a hat all day, I picked up this hair color remover as well as a shade of red that I knew was safe.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend that.</li>
            <li>Because the box HIGHLY recommends you have</li>
            <li>I highly recommend OOPS as a remover.</li>
            <li>If you left you t18 wella toner on too long like me and some of your very light streaks ended with a blueish tint  </li>
            <li>but I am going to wait a week and tone it a little more with Wella T14.</li>
            <li>They need to put a little more in the box.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly impressed with this, despite all the bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And my choice of ultra ash blonde left my hair a reddish/golden light brown that was very close to what I wanted.</li>
            <li>And my choice of ultra ash blonde left my hair a reddish/golden light brown that was very close to what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I normally apply this generously and leave in for 1hour.</li>
            <li>I noticed as i was coloring, my hair was taking the color in faster than normal.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t golden or blonde</li>
            <li>But in a pinch, if you do have to use this, definitely DON&#x27;T put it on your healthy natural hair unless you want it instantly blonde.</li>
            <li>returns to its normal softness.</li>
            <li>needs to be highlighted ON THE FRONT OF THE BOX THAT IT DOES NOT return your hair to normal color.</li>
            <li>Extremely annoyed because I  do not look good with orange hair.</li>
            <li>i have medium-dark brown hair naturally, but had dyed it a brown-black color, then black over the top of that.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a far better product with less frustration buteven</li>
            <li>have dyed my hair JET BLACK many times in my life and had a salon professionally strip the dye out and it will still be a red/orangey color.</li>
            <li>The drying quality and strong smell are the only factors preventing me from giving this product 5 stars, but I would still turn to it again if necessary and recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li>YES in about 10 minutes it bleached the roots of my hair that was my NATURAL hair color a very pretty blonde.</li>
            <li>used one bottle on my hair, it barely lightened it but some parts turned brown like it did on the hair strand test because it was more drenched in the product than the other strands.</li>
            <li>My hair turned out the exact color of the dye I bought , a little more red tint</li>
            <li>I had attempted to go to a light brown twice in the last 2 years and went to 2 different high end salons for it</li>
            <li>I immediately colored my hair with a drugstore foam color in dark ash blonde afterwards (to achieve a golden light brown) but there was no change.</li>
            <li>Just like with most hair dye products if you have long or thick hair by two boxes don&#x27;t be cheap.</li>
            <li>my misfortune in trying a new color.  </li>
            <li>your new hair color already picked out and purchased, it does not recommend conditioning.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t rub into your scalp, and do not apply to new roots.  </li>
            <li>I could live with fixing orange.)&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>but my hair always ended up red or strawberry blonde with platinum roots even though I asked for light brown.</li>
            <li>The red undertones are now completely gone and look like golden highlights.</li>
            <li>The red undertones are now completely gone and look like golden highlights.</li>
            <li>Waste of money and time...and to top it all off, now I have to go get my hair fixed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually not going to re-color it right away since I have to be up early tomorrow</li>
            <li>I did finally achieve a good result later with a little protein filler.</li>
            <li>I measured 2oz hot water and squeezed in some conditioner, mixed it until melted and poured it into the bottle with the powder and shook it up.</li>
            <li>And WOW!</li>
            <li>First of all I have to say that all the people bashing this product because it will turn your hair a red/orange color have obviously never had dye stripped out of their hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>anyways and WOW!</li>
            <li>with huge black chunks.</li>
            <li>I used a boxed hair dye kit with the intent of having slightly darker, more colorful brown hair but instead the color ended up practically black.</li>
            <li>Almost every positive review I&#x27;ve read recommends using the product differently than per the instructions.</li>
            <li>My ends are still a tad darker than the new roots, but you can&#x27;t really tell unless you are totally scrutinizing.</li>
            <li>My ends are still a tad darker than the new roots, but you can&#x27;t really tell unless you are totally scrutinizing.</li>
            <li>I have used this multiple times now when getting ready for a new color to remove the old one.</li>
            <li>I am a natural strawberry blonde, I  usually maintain the color with L&#x27;Oréal light reddish blonde, since i noticed grays creeping in, so during the winter I decided to go darker with a light Auburn, when spring came</li>
            <li>I actually wanted it to go a little more lighter</li>
            <li>Overall my hair was a little more fried than with OOPS, but it took out the color</li>
            <li>I rinsed my hair until the water was clear.</li>
            <li>I am a frequent user of hair color.  </li>
            <li>My hair naturally is a medium brown.  </li>
            <li>(But for those who want to actually have a much lighter color, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this method)    </li>
            <li>I started with my natural hair color (medium brown)</li>
            <li>and I am natural a medium brunette.</li>
            <li>and have had it professionally stripped once</li>
            <li>I was left with very copper hair which is what the insert indicated.</li>
            <li>waiting 40 minutes, when i got into the shower to rinse out my hair and looked in the mirror, i nearly died.</li>
            <li>So the next day i continued with my whole head.</li>
            <li>Most of the negative reviews state it made their hair orange.</li>
            <li>My hair is a natural medium brown color</li>
            <li>and I almost didn&#x27;t have enough for my whole head.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I purchased the Loreal color remover and my regular Loreal hair color and went straight home.  </li>
            <li>I put on my regular dye, and I&#x27;m pretty much back to normal.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is VERY WATERY, something I forgot since the last time I used it.</li>
            <li>I was running low on this application and the hair that got a few light swipes of remover didn&#x27;t change color much.</li>
            <li>To me, because it&#x27;s so watery, it takes much longer to apply than regular hair dyes.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really see the removal process because the solution is bluish white, so you&#x27;ll have to experiment a bit with timing.  </li>
            <li>I try to condition my hair at least 2X a week to keep it healthy and switched shampoos that help the scalp rather than the hair.  </li>
            <li>: my hair is naturally chestnut brown.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i dont feel it damaged my hair completely</li>
            <li>should have ordered 2 which surprised me.</li>
            <li>Also bleached roots, with one giant spot that was bleached liek all the way and a few bright orange spots (too be expected.</li>
            <li>The color was fun, but not \\&quot;me\\&quot;, so I had been looking to go back to blonde.    </li>
            <li>i got tired of it and wanted a change, so i went to the drugstore to buy a box of Color Oops, which i had used before and really liked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning on going full blonde tomorrow when my hair is dry.</li>
            <li>I was beginning to think i was just pretty much stuck with the black.</li>
            <li>My hair was actually one color, and a normal color!</li>
            <li>But once I blew it dry, it had done exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>super dark.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dyed my hair super dark brown for well over two years now.</li>
            <li>recently I tried to dye my hair from red to a light brown and for some reason my hair turned out super black!In lieu of all the negative reviews I gave this product a try</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally light brown and had some blonde highlights in it when I tried twice to dye it dark brown.</li>
            <li>very next day I used the protein filler first, as directed, and mixed the remaining protein filler with the color.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly, and carefully watched my hair, and the timer, as the product developed.  </li>
            <li>If you are going for a blonde or a vibrant color that requires bleached hair, you will have to bleach your hair after using this before re-coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I use L&#x27;Oréal from start to finish, never had dried out hair, my hair comes out soft and shiney every time and color is always true to box.</li>
            <li>I used the product, followed the instructions carefully, and within 5 minutes or so the pink was going VERY light blonde (just how i wanted it)</li>
            <li>My hair color was actually back to my natural hair color, which is brown, with a tinge of red/orange and the added bonus my hair was not damaged at all!!</li>
            <li>So i tried to lighten it with another box color which was a light brown, to my surprise it only colored my roots and the black on my ends</li>
            <li>The first time I was introduced to this stuff, I was 13 and had just dyed my hair black (from my normally medium brown).</li>
            <li>This product will turn your hair anywhere ranging from tiger orange to light yellowy orange and usually a combination of them.</li>
            <li>Unless you have short, thin hair, I would get two boxes if you really want to be able to cover all of your hair evenly.</li>
            <li>In the end, I decided my hair is pretty healthy, no damage other than the fact that I color it, and I would go for it with a few minor adjustments.</li>
            <li>My strong lustrous hair is now brittle and dull.  </li>
            <li>The directions clearly say that you should color your hair after using this product, no where does it say \\&quot;use this and your hair will turn back to your beautiful natural color!\\&quot; like the bad reviews seemed to have thought would happen.  </li>
            <li>I poured half of it down the sink &amp; replaced it with warm tap water mixed with a couple squirts of conditioner.</li>
            <li>a blonde (which it does say not to color new hair, oops)</li>
            <li>The new color was perfect and there was no leftover color from the previous bad</li>
            <li>I rinsed the product out, gently shampooed it, and allowed my hair to air dry.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to being able to apply the blonde dye I purchased and now I can&#x27;t for AT LEAST a week until it recovers from this horrid horrid product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would never use it again, but at least, I was able to fix it enough so that I didn&#x27;t have to go to a salon for re-coloring.</li>
            <li>I have pretty dark hair that&#x27;s been colored frequently.</li>
            <li>I used this product as per directions (left it on for 30 minutes, in a shower cap) and it did exactly what I expected/what the box said it would do... turned my hair a gross yellow orange color.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, i read other reviews about using water instead of the developer, i recommend trying this method first before using the developer.</li>
            <li>Lightening your hair without causing major damage to your hair.</li>
            <li>In big bold letters, the directions say that if you have dark brown hair it will turn orange...</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally a dull light brown, and I wanted to make the color richer.</li>
            <li>Clerks at the store started calling me \\&quot;dear\\&quot; and \\&quot;sweetie\\&quot; and generally treating me like I was 100.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural blonde.</li>
            <li>Nothing can take you directly back to your natural color, that pigment is lost.</li>
            <li>If you are trying to remove a one time too dark color or lighter colors, I would try Color Oops first.</li>
            <li>So I bought this product to take it back to my natural brunette hair.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair, and 1 box wasnt near enough.</li>
            <li>If anything went wrong, I was willing to cut my long hair just to have it healthy again</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only natural color I&#x27;ve never been before.</li>
            <li>cause this stuff can splash all over the place if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>I used this color remover, left it on for about an hour with a shower cap to retain the natural heat from my head and was surprised to see it come out a burgundy red as well, some areas were spotty</li>
            <li>Only time growing your hair out will restore your natural color.</li>
            <li>Also, I dyed my hair the same night and the color was no where near what it should have been, and the orange was still all over my hair.</li>
            <li>My biggest issue with this product is that it&#x27;s name is completely and totally misleading!!</li>
            <li>I am 73 years old and have white hair.</li>
            <li>I have had RED hair for awhile and slowly but surely have been bringing it back to</li>
            <li>this is a bleach like product and ruined my natural hair color I&#x27;ve spent months trying to get it back to normal after this disaster!</li>
            <li>all, i am satisfied because it lighten my almost black dark red hair.</li>
            <li>, It took the color, but it is very highlighted with orange and yellow all throughout and still very dry.</li>
            <li>So this time I decided to DIY at least the first part of it to save some money ( I spent close to $400 each time  at the salon only to go right back to my old color</li>
            <li>Unlike OOPS, which is runny and clear this was thicker, blue, and gritty.</li>
            <li>I have to use bleach to get it a little bit lighter but prefer to use a dye remover first.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the lower lengths of my hair had been dyed so many times, the dark, nearly black, color would not budge when I tried to dye it a light brown color, closer to my natural shade.</li>
            <li>I would be a little more hesitant if my hair was DARK brown, or black, but it will at least remove most of it, so you could redye it blonde, or whatever color you were thinking.</li>
            <li>Most hair dyes have reds in them which is pretty much impossible to remove.</li>
            <li>Since my ends were still black, i applied the mixture to my ends first and left it on for 20min.</li>
            <li>First off, I read all the directions, it did indeed strip the black out of my hair, along with everything else!</li>
            <li>I mixed 1TBS haircolor powder with 2TBS hot water and squeezed in a little bit of my conditioner.</li>
            <li>I barely had enough to cover my hair and it wasn&#x27;t as easy to apply by myself without feeling like I was stretching it thin.</li>
            <li>I purchased a few of these kits (4 to be exact, which ended up being just enough to coat my hair) and came home to read some reviews before applying it.</li>
            <li>Several months later I got tired of the white hair showing in the back and even after touching it up, it always looked lighter and made me look pitiful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little dry but worth it and definitely not fried...</li>
            <li>After only a half hour, however, I decided that it had lightened as much as I needed it to.</li>
            <li>I had a friend put one box on bottom half of my hair first, and she kept running the product through evenly, never letting it sit in one spot too long.</li>
            <li>(but is super damaging with a very stinky smell that lasts for DAYS)  and since this is just bleach it will turn your hair a weird color.</li>
            <li>After a long fiasco trying to let my grey grow out gracefully I finally decided to strip the years worth of dark brown/black build-up and re-dye a lighter color that would be easier to blend into the greys.</li>
            <li>It will fry your hair....and is not worth the high price...</li>

            <li> am now happy to report that my hair is a uniform medium brown color.</li>
            <li> good - it did the job.</li>
            <li> My hair was in really good shape, considering that I just bleached the daylights out of it.  </li>
            <li> and it didnt do as well as this product but still worked fairly well.</li>
            <li> The thing did not smell good at all.</li>
            <li> So in the end i was very very pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li> and it was very effective and does not contain bleach (though it sure smells</li>
            <li> But yea, awesome product, if need, i will go to this product first before bleach or anything else.</li>
            <li> and I ended up with a carrot top!</li>
            <li> It looks really cute!  </li>
            <li> It was amazing.</li>
            <li> I had bought a light blond dye to redye as recommended, but no way would I use it now as my hair is a great color.</li>
            <li> I had bought my recover dye, but I really liked the amber color</li>
            <li> And i honestly didnt want sulphur smelling hair, So after reading reviews about loreal hair color remover, i decided to take a plunge and try it.</li>
            <li> ...I have been dying my own hair for years.</li>
            <li> I said to myself there has to be a way to do this on my own.</li>
            <li> a nice \\&quot;carrot top\\&quot; color</li>
            <li> Although this product is far from perfect, I think it does a good job at what it&#x27;s supposed to do:</li>
            <li> You should do thorough research before doing your hair at home on your own.</li>
            <li> The product also gets warm to the touch in about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> My hair is still in very good condition and i achieved the exact color</li>
            <li> My hair is still in very good condition and i achieved the exact color i wanted.</li>
            <li> I put the new color on and everything went superb after that.  </li>
            <li> Im just super happy</li>
            <li> Made it very easy to color with a lighter color</li>
            <li> oops and despite the smell which nearly suffocated me, LOVED LOVED IT!</li>
            <li> Color oops shrinks the die molecules and leaves your natural hair alone, this product turned my hair bright ORANGE!!!!</li>
            <li> It is now a warm light-medium brown, more natural-looking and uniformly colored than I&#x27;ve seen it in years.</li>
            <li> but I was able to dye it a light brown afterward and am very pleased an relieved.</li>
            <li> Nice and Easy</li>
            <li> so I went with one that was more orange-red.</li>
            <li> A lot more, it turned out.</li>
            <li> I had been scared that it would just get more orange than what I stared with, but the red-red came out well</li>
            <li> Ok, background information.</li>
            <li> However, my healthy, shiny hair was ravaged.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for people who are just used to coloring at home, it needs more skill and ability.  </li>
            <li> I then read what many people had said about the product and was so scared to try it out myself.</li>
            <li> I was able to re-color with Clairol 118A</li>
            <li> I read many reviews and the biggest problems seemed to be that this remover worked too well...</li>
            <li> I should have more luck lightening and recoloring.</li>
            <li> /&gt;update.. i was able to color over my hair and get a mostly even color result.</li>
            <li> Ive read before to make sure you have your desired color on hand to color afterwards.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t LOOK damaged, it was silky and perfect, but obviously the color wasn&#x27;t taking.</li>
            <li> but this is a multi-step process and this product saved me a lot of money by being able to do step one in the process</li>
            <li> but this is a multi-step process and this product saved me a lot of money by being able to do step one in the process</li>
            <li> With many doubts, My hair never goes how I want it to.</li>
            <li> For the $1 more it cost over OOPS</li>
            <li> My hair is more than 95% gray and keeping it brown required doing my roots every two weeks.</li>
            <li> There was alot of breakage, and even more tears.</li>
            <li> Ok, I learned my lesson years ago with bleach.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it is still chemical</li>
            <li> TURNED MY HAIR ORANGE on top and spotted everywhere else.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off buying a pack of bleach (2.99) and developer (2.99) for about $6 tops at Sallys.</li>
            <li> This worked leaps and bounds better than the stuff I got at Sally Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li> I love this product for the price.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I would not leave it on more than 20-mins.</li>
            <li> i am satisfied but plan on recoloring to a lighter color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> More problems then before....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li> The hair was an even Marilyn Monroe flaxen blond and looked fabulous!  </li>
            <li> be fair, on the VERY top of directions within the box it does say that it doesn&#x27;t return your hair to natural color.</li>
            <li> Plus with the conditioner I didn&#x27;t have problems with it being too runny as it made more of a cream that I was able to easily apply all over my hair.</li>
            <li> It was 25 minutes in (not the original 45!)</li>
            <li> Worth the price!!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT because it removed Jet Black hair color perfectly</li>
            <li> /&gt;IT WORKED AMAZINGLY and according to exactly what it said!  </li>
            <li> For those of you that arent familiar which a protein filler, it basically helps your hair to absorb the color better.</li>
            <li> Unless you are someone familiar with product ingredients, it is not until you get home and are able to read the instructions that you find out that the product is not what the name implies.</li>
            <li> shampooed the solution out, which wasn&#x27;t that easy to do since it made</li>
            <li> It does not spread easily once it is on the hair.  </li>
            <li> i would not recommend using this hair color remover product unless you have really strong hair follicles that can withstand the bleaching done to the hair,</li>
            <li> The smell is quite strong</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a strong bleach.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be good to try taking all the color out of my hair to do new color.  </li>
            <li> and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> But this is the best thing to strip black.</li>
            <li> and it should be fine.</li>
            <li> If you DO want to lighten your hair, you are much better off just using bleach to be able to apply evenly and get a consistent outcome.</li>
            <li> My hair lightened tremendously!</li>
            <li> so I wanted to go light brown.  </li>
            <li> It is important to remember, when using this product, the goal is red/orange/yellow.</li>
            <li> read ALL the reviews, found it available in store, and despite the instructions to do a test strip of hair, I went all in and immediately used the product according to the directions.  </li>
            <li> What a fantastic job</li>
            <li> Unless you already have light hair, the minimum waiting time on this is 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Once your hair turns a nice orange shade, you&#x27;re ready to wash it out.</li>
            <li> the cheap under $5</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product and would use it again if I find myself in the same predicament in the future.e</li>
            <li> it stripped the color leaving it a light copper/brownish color.</li>
            <li> however I would not use a warm tone as the hair color remover already leaves you with plenty of red/orange/yellow tones and a warm hair color is likely to leave you quite brassy.</li>
            <li> I always use L&#x27;Oreal color products and decided to go with a brand I was familiar with.     </li>
            <li> I used Vidal Sassoon Salonist in Light Cool Brown and my hair is still caramel/light auburn brown</li>
            <li> It worked great for me, and I have very long hair.</li>
            <li> , i used my L&#x27;Oréal light reddish blonde and was good to go.</li>
            <li> I thought that it worked great, and I am glad to be back to a normal color.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> so it reaches the right color!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, no breakage, and minimally frizzy.</li>
            <li> All you really need to do with this product is closely follow the instructions, test it out on a cut section of hair, and make sure you watch it</li>
            <li> Yes, my hair was a copper color (which I actually liked, but of course still had my natural colored roots)</li>
            <li> but it was healthy and ready immediately to recolor.  </li>
            <li> You have to really make sure it&#x27;s soaked into your hair in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I wasn&#x27;t expecting much however, my hair looks fantastic!  </li>
            <li> If you want a TRUE hair color REMOVER, this is NOT the product for you.</li>
            <li> If you want a TRUE hair color REMOVER, this is NOT the product for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad color</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair a light brown (it says to dye your hair right away).</li>
            <li> If you did buy this and want to use this product anyways I STRONGLY recommend doing a strand test first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d lightened my medium brown hair to a nice light copper color, but it was starting to grow out.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the result, and I&#x27;m glad to be blonde again!</li>
            <li> This does work like mild bleach.</li>
            <li> i quickly washed this garbage out of my hair and had a closer look.</li>
            <li> Seeing some of the reviews here, I can say I was lucky.</li>
            <li> Your roots will turn super blonde/orange if you put this product in those areas.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I read the ingredients before using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Always put conditioner on your ends before coloring, and super condition after you color.</li>
            <li> I am usually very pleased with the results (all excepting this last time).</li>
            <li> My hair was pretty much light orange when I washed this product out after leaving it on for twenty minutes.</li>
            <li> I used dark ash blond haircolor and it turned out great.</li>
            <li> It was a rather vibrant light orange color, which I had been warned to expect, so I countered the orange tones by dying my hair a light \\&quot;ash\\&quot; brown.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend the protein filler, this really made the difference.</li>
            <li> One box didn&#x27;t go very far, but it turned out okay in the end.</li>
            <li> I wished I had saved myself the $20 and started with this first!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to use bleach on your hair, read the ingredients FIRST!</li>
            <li> It worked very well!!</li>
            <li> I had very healthy, soft hair, but the last coloring leaned way too much red, especially right on top.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend OOPS as a remover.ust using bleach to be able to apply evenly and get a consistent outcome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried to pull color out of my hair before on my own and have only had it done once at the salon.</li>
            <li> I dyed my naturally medium-blonde hair with L&#x27;Oreals \\&quot;Healthy</li>
            <li> I am going to have to look up some conditioning treatments that work better than the hot oil stuff and normal conditioners.  </li>
            <li> and i also picked up 1 bottle of colorful neutral protein filler hair dressers color insurance.</li>
            <li> And my hair is soft as silk :)</li>

            <li> I decided it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it felt soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled as my hair really has an even natural color.  </li>
            <li> I figured it was worth a try</li>
            <li> And if your hair is in good condition proceed with extreme caution.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my hair orange but not quite right.</li>
            <li> It also stung my scalp in use, and the texture of my hair right now is just destroyed.    </li>
            <li> it says you should recolor right away.</li>
            <li> right side?</li>
            <li> I am satisfied because it did live up to its promise and now (when I&#x27;m ready)</li>
            <li> and it is basically back to the nice copper I was going for--with the roots lightened enough to blend better.</li>
            <li> :P If this doesn&#x27;t fill it in I&#x27;ll just go tomorrow and get a flat brown close to my natural color and then leave it for a while.</li>
            <li> It needs a nice long break.</li>
            <li> I typically wait the full 50-60 minutes, just to make sure it&#x27;s as light as it&#x27;s going to get.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty streaky right now because of the lack of coverage one box of this product provides.</li>
            <li> Ion&#x27;s Color Corrector is gentle, easy &amp; extremely effective in only removing the product, leaving you with your natural hair color.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> But I could tell my ends were no longer black, so that was good.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product and would use it again if I find myself in the same predicament in the future.</li>
            <li> I shampooed my hair three times, then conditioned it really good, rinsed with cool water for a short time and left conditioner in my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is very gentle to the hair, I suggest to go ahead and put a protein pack on it for 30 minutes afterwards.</li>
            <li> Per the instructions, I then followed up immediately by applying a new permanent color, which was the medium brown I was originally going for.</li>
            <li> Per the instructions, I then followed up immediately by applying a new permanent color, which was the medium brown I was originally going for.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, I had gone to a professional salon asking about a color correction (I had bright pink hair, with patches or green and yellow streaks)</li>
            <li> The Developer liquid is 2 oz, so I put some hot tap water in a measuring cup and stirred in a blob of conditioner until it was melted, then poured that into the bottle with the powder in it.</li>
            <li> And I made sure to deep condition before I used it just as an added precaution.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is only for the highly skilled.  </li>
            <li> Okay, I actually bought this item a couple days ago from duane reade but had never read the reviews of it at first.</li>
            <li> First thing I did was mix the powder with hot water instead of the hair color remover liquid.</li>
            <li> I knew, going in, that this product was a bleach and not merely a color remover.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased.</li>
            <li> this product does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I combined the mixture from all four kits in one bowl and made sure it was thoroughly mixed before I had</li>
            <li> I rinsed out my hair, and at first i couldnt tell if there was any change.</li>
            <li> product does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li> but it faded after a week to the exact color I intended it to be, medium auburn brown.</li>
            <li> I wanted to go lighter and needed to get the brown out first.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I had wanted.</li>
            <li> Personally I think COlor Oops works better to REMOVE the color</li>
            <li> In my 20+ yrs of self-coloring, this was the first time I had goofed on my roots.  </li>
            <li> the hairdresser didn&#x27;t want to \\&quot;damage\\&quot; my hair, or just wanted me to come back again and again for more money.</li>
            <li> I have an even all over color for the first time in a year.  </li>
            <li> But I tried to apply the liquid to ends first, working up.</li>
            <li> my hair kind of rough &amp; tangle-y (sp?).</li>
            <li> I no longer have hot roots or orangey-red splotches.</li>
            <li> So for me, this product worked exactly as intended.</li>
            <li> kind of rough &amp; tangle-y (sp?).</li>
            <li> I no longer have hot roots or orangey-red splotches.</li>
            <li> So for me, this product worked exactly as intended.</li>
            <li> This is my first time &amp;#34;bleaching&amp;#34; my hair.</li>
            <li> Make sure to avoid the colored roots until last.  </li>
            <li> Also, I chose a dark golden blonde/light golden brown hair color because the OOPS says you should try a shade or two lighter as hair will soak more color after use...</li>
            <li> I tried the vitamin-c method, and it did great lifting my newest hair, my roots, to a burgundy red without any damage but not really my bleached/black ends.</li>
            <li> Using this product was a little scary and took a lot of nerve, but I did it and was proud of myself and happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Because the color is a great shade of blonde for me, I won&#x27;t be using any other dyes over it.    </li>
            <li> the only good part of this whole thing is that my hair didn&#x27;t fall out, but i ended up having to get 16 inches of hair cut off because every time i brushed my hair</li>
            <li> I decided to color my hair dark blond, which turned out kind of reddish brown.  </li>
            <li> I am changing my makeup to a more pastel look and the total effect is young and fresh.  </li>
            <li> After 15 minutes the JET BLACK color was already a nice chestnut brown.</li>
            <li> It was simple to use and easy to gauge.</li>
            <li> make sure you have a box of color to follow the remover with once your hair is dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It damages your hair of course but with the conditioner that comes with hair dye boxes or just buy a good one, it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve been dyeing my head with the main color (cool dark brown), but, using this to create highlights (bangs, streaks on top, etc.).  </li>
            <li> The color remover removed the black from most of my hair and turned it orange, with very light almost blonde roots.</li>
            <li> Plus, 2 oz is not very much, so I can see how people with longer hair or wanting to saturate it more than I was would have problems.</li>
            <li> Save your money, time, and hair and just go professional the first time!</li>
            <li> I was able to re-dye my hair its natural color right after using this, and with a deep conditioning treatment, my hair is pretty much as healthy and the same color as it was before the initial dye job.</li>
            <li> stayed calm and did a little more research.</li>
            <li> Uneven saturation is probably a big component in the splotchy results some people have experienced.     </li>
            <li> used this product and, as expected, my hair ended up bright orange red with platinum/yellow roots.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really improve things.     </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Bleachy\\&quot; is one thing; \\&quot;ready for the</li>
            <li> This stuff did nothing for my hair, didn&#x27;t remove much color.</li>
            <li> color oops is not a bleach based product and it works very well for me</li>
            <li> in that it stripped hair too much.</li>
            <li> my jet-black hair turned a shade of red-orange; very tiger-like in tones.</li>
            <li> I made sure to apply it carefully so that each piece of hair was covered.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to use between 1-2 oz, but i felt 2 oz was too much.</li>
            <li> Even my mother noticed my hair was changing color fast.</li>
            <li> And my hair was soo much softer.</li>
            <li> ...My hair wasn&#x27;t exactly ready to color again.</li>
            <li> So after  a day of research I was ready to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is a harder shade to remove, maybe needed more time)  </li>
            <li> had to leave it on the whole hour...</li>
            <li> I just do the mask very couple of days now.</li>
            <li> I assume this is because my hair was really red/orange before I colored and that changed the outcome.</li>
            <li> and when it was light enough, I washed it out.  </li>
            <li> and next I may go to a light mocha...~</li>
            <li> But this product just being bleach didn&#x27;t really have a smell that lingered, I&#x27;m used to bleaching hair so it didn&#x27;t bother me but didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> I went straight to the bathroom and started mixing this stuff.</li>
            <li> Having dye stripped out of your hair in a salon is VERY expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you have really damaged hair already though you may want to opt for the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I absolutely had to, I would use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is basically bleach, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s done as much damage to my hair as bleach has.</li>
            <li> but i didn&#x27;t really care at the time.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I did NOT take out much of my hair color.</li>
            <li> did not come out, it got lighter but not by much.</li>
            <li> I thought.&lt;br /&gt;I put this gunk on my hair, avoiding my roots as much as I can, waited the 50 minutes I did for my test strands.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> The product DOES basically do what it says it will do in the instructions, but I think it is very misleading to customers to call it a hair color remover.</li>
            <li> I really wish I bought two instead of</li>
            <li> If you are thinking that a \\&quot;hair color remover\\&quot; will magically bring you back to your natural color</li>
            <li> Get a good boar brush, don&#x27;t shampoo for several days prior to coloring, shampoo will strip hair of natural protection.</li>
            <li> After 4 uses, it has consistently stripped my hair and made it ready to take new color.</li>
            <li> But I would recommend using a clear protein filler right after you use this</li>
            <li> But I would recommend using a clear protein filler right after you use this</li>
            <li> Over all I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to go lighter or back to their original hair color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m following it up with a Garnier Nutrisse light brown SUPER hydrating dye to try to fill in the blonde roots</li>
            <li> I had red splotches on my face, though I would clean it off ASAP.  </li>
            <li> About four years ago I had virgin hair which is naturally dark brown and went to a salon and asked for a bright wine red</li>
            <li> oops was gentle, even though it stunk to high heaven).</li>
            <li> My hair was still black --except for where I used to have highlights which turned BRIGHT COPPERY RED.</li>
            <li> This seemedf like an effective, affordable solution from my usual hair dye brand.</li>
            <li> I left the product on my hair for a full hour, shampooed, and rinsed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just a regular old bleach powder and developer, which is fine, just call it what it is.</li>
            <li> It will be ready for a new color as long as it is light brown or darker.</li>
            <li> and before you color your hair so that your new color will really</li>
            <li> and before you color your hair so that your new color will really</li>
            <li> It started lightening some parts of it right away, and it turned a lot of my hair dark red and bright blonde.....</li>
            <li> I will use this product on the top half of my head in a day or two.    </li>
            <li> It left the color in the ends of my hair, turned my hair many shades of yellow.  </li>
            <li> I did use the super conditioner that I had left from coloring (I used Feria)after rinsing and shampooing.</li>
            <li> He paid for my hair to be recolored by a professional about a week later, after that I had a light blondish brown color.</li>
            <li> It is NOT like OOPS which simply removes the most recent colors you have applied to your hair.</li>
            <li> The following day, after wearing a hat all day, I picked up this hair color remover as well as a shade of red that I knew was safe.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend that.</li>
            <li> Because the box HIGHLY recommends you have</li>
            <li> I highly recommend OOPS as a remover.</li>
            <li> If you left you t18 wella toner on too long like me and some of your very light streaks ended with a blueish tint  </li>
            <li> but I am going to wait a week and tone it a little more with Wella T14.</li>
            <li> They need to put a little more in the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly impressed with this, despite all the bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And my choice of ultra ash blonde left my hair a reddish/golden light brown that was very close to what I wanted.</li>
            <li> And my choice of ultra ash blonde left my hair a reddish/golden light brown that was very close to what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I normally apply this generously and leave in for 1hour.</li>
            <li> I noticed as i was coloring, my hair was taking the color in faster than normal.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t golden or blonde</li>
            <li> But in a pinch, if you do have to use this, definitely DON&#x27;T put it on your healthy natural hair unless you want it instantly blonde.</li>
            <li> returns to its normal softness.</li>
            <li> needs to be highlighted ON THE FRONT OF THE BOX THAT IT DOES NOT return your hair to normal color.</li>
            <li> Extremely annoyed because I  do not look good with orange hair.</li>
            <li> i have medium-dark brown hair naturally, but had dyed it a brown-black color, then black over the top of that.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a far better product with less frustration buteven</li>
            <li> have dyed my hair JET BLACK many times in my life and had a salon professionally strip the dye out and it will still be a red/orangey color.</li>
            <li> The drying quality and strong smell are the only factors preventing me from giving this product 5 stars, but I would still turn to it again if necessary and recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> YES in about 10 minutes it bleached the roots of my hair that was my NATURAL hair color a very pretty blonde.</li>
            <li> used one bottle on my hair, it barely lightened it but some parts turned brown like it did on the hair strand test because it was more drenched in the product than the other strands.</li>
            <li> My hair turned out the exact color of the dye I bought , a little more red tint</li>
            <li> I had attempted to go to a light brown twice in the last 2 years and went to 2 different high end salons for it</li>
            <li> I immediately colored my hair with a drugstore foam color in dark ash blonde afterwards (to achieve a golden light brown) but there was no change.</li>
            <li> Just like with most hair dye products if you have long or thick hair by two boxes don&#x27;t be cheap.</li>
            <li> my misfortune in trying a new color.  </li>
            <li> your new hair color already picked out and purchased, it does not recommend conditioning.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t rub into your scalp, and do not apply to new roots.  </li>
            <li> I could live with fixing orange.)&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> but my hair always ended up red or strawberry blonde with platinum roots even though I asked for light brown.</li>
            <li> The red undertones are now completely gone and look like golden highlights.</li>
            <li> The red undertones are now completely gone and look like golden highlights.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time...and to top it all off, now I have to go get my hair fixed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually not going to re-color it right away since I have to be up early tomorrow</li>
            <li> I did finally achieve a good result later with a little protein filler.</li>
            <li> I measured 2oz hot water and squeezed in some conditioner, mixed it until melted and poured it into the bottle with the powder and shook it up.</li>
            <li> And WOW!</li>
            <li> First of all I have to say that all the people bashing this product because it will turn your hair a red/orange color have obviously never had dye stripped out of their hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> anyways and WOW!</li>
            <li> with huge black chunks.</li>
            <li> I used a boxed hair dye kit with the intent of having slightly darker, more colorful brown hair but instead the color ended up practically black.</li>
            <li> Almost every positive review I&#x27;ve read recommends using the product differently than per the instructions.</li>
            <li> My ends are still a tad darker than the new roots, but you can&#x27;t really tell unless you are totally scrutinizing.</li>
            <li> My ends are still a tad darker than the new roots, but you can&#x27;t really tell unless you are totally scrutinizing.</li>
            <li> I have used this multiple times now when getting ready for a new color to remove the old one.</li>
            <li> I am a natural strawberry blonde, I  usually maintain the color with L&#x27;Oréal light reddish blonde, since i noticed grays creeping in, so during the winter I decided to go darker with a light Auburn, when spring came</li>
            <li> I actually wanted it to go a little more lighter</li>
            <li> Overall my hair was a little more fried than with OOPS, but it took out the color</li>
            <li> I rinsed my hair until the water was clear.</li>
            <li> I am a frequent user of hair color.  </li>
            <li> My hair naturally is a medium brown.  </li>
            <li> (But for those who want to actually have a much lighter color, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this method)    </li>
            <li> I started with my natural hair color (medium brown)</li>
            <li> and I am natural a medium brunette.</li>
            <li> and have had it professionally stripped once</li>
            <li> I was left with very copper hair which is what the insert indicated.</li>
            <li> waiting 40 minutes, when i got into the shower to rinse out my hair and looked in the mirror, i nearly died.</li>
            <li> So the next day i continued with my whole head.</li>
            <li> Most of the negative reviews state it made their hair orange.</li>
            <li> My hair is a natural medium brown color</li>
            <li> and I almost didn&#x27;t have enough for my whole head.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I purchased the Loreal color remover and my regular Loreal hair color and went straight home.  </li>
            <li> I put on my regular dye, and I&#x27;m pretty much back to normal.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is VERY WATERY, something I forgot since the last time I used it.</li>
            <li> I was running low on this application and the hair that got a few light swipes of remover didn&#x27;t change color much.</li>
            <li> To me, because it&#x27;s so watery, it takes much longer to apply than regular hair dyes.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really see the removal process because the solution is bluish white, so you&#x27;ll have to experiment a bit with timing.  </li>
            <li> I try to condition my hair at least 2X a week to keep it healthy and switched shampoos that help the scalp rather than the hair.  </li>
            <li> : my hair is naturally chestnut brown.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i dont feel it damaged my hair completely</li>
            <li> should have ordered 2 which surprised me.</li>
            <li> Also bleached roots, with one giant spot that was bleached liek all the way and a few bright orange spots (too be expected.</li>
            <li> The color was fun, but not \\&quot;me\\&quot;, so I had been looking to go back to blonde.    </li>
            <li> i got tired of it and wanted a change, so i went to the drugstore to buy a box of Color Oops, which i had used before and really liked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on going full blonde tomorrow when my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I was beginning to think i was just pretty much stuck with the black.</li>
            <li> My hair was actually one color, and a normal color!</li>
            <li> But once I blew it dry, it had done exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> super dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dyed my hair super dark brown for well over two years now.</li>
            <li> recently I tried to dye my hair from red to a light brown and for some reason my hair turned out super black!In lieu of all the negative reviews I gave this product a try</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally light brown and had some blonde highlights in it when I tried twice to dye it dark brown.</li>
            <li> very next day I used the protein filler first, as directed, and mixed the remaining protein filler with the color.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly, and carefully watched my hair, and the timer, as the product developed.  </li>
            <li> If you are going for a blonde or a vibrant color that requires bleached hair, you will have to bleach your hair after using this before re-coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I use L&#x27;Oréal from start to finish, never had dried out hair, my hair comes out soft and shiney every time and color is always true to box.</li>
            <li> I used the product, followed the instructions carefully, and within 5 minutes or so the pink was going VERY light blonde (just how i wanted it)</li>
            <li> My hair color was actually back to my natural hair color, which is brown, with a tinge of red/orange and the added bonus my hair was not damaged at all!!</li>
            <li> So i tried to lighten it with another box color which was a light brown, to my surprise it only colored my roots and the black on my ends</li>
            <li> The first time I was introduced to this stuff, I was 13 and had just dyed my hair black (from my normally medium brown).</li>
            <li> This product will turn your hair anywhere ranging from tiger orange to light yellowy orange and usually a combination of them.</li>
            <li> Unless you have short, thin hair, I would get two boxes if you really want to be able to cover all of your hair evenly.</li>
            <li> In the end, I decided my hair is pretty healthy, no damage other than the fact that I color it, and I would go for it with a few minor adjustments.</li>
            <li> My strong lustrous hair is now brittle and dull.  </li>
            <li> The directions clearly say that you should color your hair after using this product, no where does it say \\&quot;use this and your hair will turn back to your beautiful natural color!\\&quot; like the bad reviews seemed to have thought would happen.  </li>
            <li> I poured half of it down the sink &amp; replaced it with warm tap water mixed with a couple squirts of conditioner.</li>
            <li> a blonde (which it does say not to color new hair, oops)</li>
            <li> The new color was perfect and there was no leftover color from the previous bad</li>
            <li> I rinsed the product out, gently shampooed it, and allowed my hair to air dry.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to being able to apply the blonde dye I purchased and now I can&#x27;t for AT LEAST a week until it recovers from this horrid horrid product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would never use it again, but at least, I was able to fix it enough so that I didn&#x27;t have to go to a salon for re-coloring.</li>
            <li> I have pretty dark hair that&#x27;s been colored frequently.</li>
            <li> I used this product as per directions (left it on for 30 minutes, in a shower cap) and it did exactly what I expected/what the box said it would do... turned my hair a gross yellow orange color.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, i read other reviews about using water instead of the developer, i recommend trying this method first before using the developer.</li>
            <li> Lightening your hair without causing major damage to your hair.</li>
            <li> In big bold letters, the directions say that if you have dark brown hair it will turn orange...</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally a dull light brown, and I wanted to make the color richer.</li>
            <li> Clerks at the store started calling me \\&quot;dear\\&quot; and \\&quot;sweetie\\&quot; and generally treating me like I was 100.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural blonde.</li>
            <li> Nothing can take you directly back to your natural color, that pigment is lost.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to remove a one time too dark color or lighter colors, I would try Color Oops first.</li>
            <li> So I bought this product to take it back to my natural brunette hair.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair, and 1 box wasnt near enough.</li>
            <li> If anything went wrong, I was willing to cut my long hair just to have it healthy again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only natural color I&#x27;ve never been before.</li>
            <li> cause this stuff can splash all over the place if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> I used this color remover, left it on for about an hour with a shower cap to retain the natural heat from my head and was surprised to see it come out a burgundy red as well, some areas were spotty</li>
            <li> Only time growing your hair out will restore your natural color.</li>
            <li> Also, I dyed my hair the same night and the color was no where near what it should have been, and the orange was still all over my hair.</li>
            <li> My biggest issue with this product is that it&#x27;s name is completely and totally misleading!!</li>
            <li> I am 73 years old and have white hair.</li>
            <li> I have had RED hair for awhile and slowly but surely have been bringing it back to</li>
            <li> this is a bleach like product and ruined my natural hair color I&#x27;ve spent months trying to get it back to normal after this disaster!</li>
            <li> all, i am satisfied because it lighten my almost black dark red hair.</li>
            <li> , It took the color, but it is very highlighted with orange and yellow all throughout and still very dry.</li>
            <li> So this time I decided to DIY at least the first part of it to save some money ( I spent close to $400 each time  at the salon only to go right back to my old color</li>
            <li> Unlike OOPS, which is runny and clear this was thicker, blue, and gritty.</li>
            <li> I have to use bleach to get it a little bit lighter but prefer to use a dye remover first.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the lower lengths of my hair had been dyed so many times, the dark, nearly black, color would not budge when I tried to dye it a light brown color, closer to my natural shade.</li>
            <li> I would be a little more hesitant if my hair was DARK brown, or black, but it will at least remove most of it, so you could redye it blonde, or whatever color you were thinking.</li>
            <li> Most hair dyes have reds in them which is pretty much impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> Since my ends were still black, i applied the mixture to my ends first and left it on for 20min.</li>
            <li> First off, I read all the directions, it did indeed strip the black out of my hair, along with everything else!</li>
            <li> I mixed 1TBS haircolor powder with 2TBS hot water and squeezed in a little bit of my conditioner.</li>
            <li> I barely had enough to cover my hair and it wasn&#x27;t as easy to apply by myself without feeling like I was stretching it thin.</li>
            <li> I purchased a few of these kits (4 to be exact, which ended up being just enough to coat my hair) and came home to read some reviews before applying it.</li>
            <li> Several months later I got tired of the white hair showing in the back and even after touching it up, it always looked lighter and made me look pitiful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little dry but worth it and definitely not fried...</li>
            <li> After only a half hour, however, I decided that it had lightened as much as I needed it to.</li>
            <li> I had a friend put one box on bottom half of my hair first, and she kept running the product through evenly, never letting it sit in one spot too long.</li>
            <li> (but is super damaging with a very stinky smell that lasts for DAYS)  and since this is just bleach it will turn your hair a weird color.</li>
            <li> After a long fiasco trying to let my grey grow out gracefully I finally decided to strip the years worth of dark brown/black build-up and re-dye a lighter color that would be easier to blend into the greys.</li>
            <li> It will fry your hair....and is not worth the high price...</li>
            <li> This stuff really works but it only did half of my hair!</li>
            <li> So I went to sally&#x27;s and bought the following:  Clear protein filler, ultra ash dark blonde color</li>
            <li> Anyway this product did exactly what it was suppose to and now my naturally dark hair that I had dyed red then black is now blonde</li>
            <li> And it also repairs previously damaged protein bonds, and it protects hair against new chemical damage.</li>
            <li> When I bleached my hair for the first time back in 2008, not even half of my dark hair color came out.</li>
            <li> To start out, my natural hair is dark brown.</li>
            <li> My locks were far too dark</li>
            <li> and i came out blonde not far from platinum</li>
            <li> According to loreal products this was enough to cover long hair.</li>
            <li> One bottle is not enough for long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dark brown to blonde shades (black looks too intense)</li>
            <li> I died it numerous times to a dark red red (almost ariana grande red).</li>
            <li> And over a year ago i colored it soft black ( revlon box color)</li>
            <li> But once i blew it dry, my hair was a brassy orange red color.</li>
            <li> Your hair will feel gross and dry while you&#x27;re rinsing it out, and even when you&#x27;re done shampooing it.</li>
            <li> My natural hair is black and I&#x27;ve been experimenting with colors to cover my greys.  </li>
            <li> I have auburn hair and dyed it natural medium brunette, which turned out black.</li>
            <li> I purchased two boxes of the L&#x27;Oreal Haircolor Remover and did a strand test (with two strands from different parts of my hair to be extra careful).</li>
            <li> this stuff had dripped onto my roots and bleached them white, left some of my hair black, and the rest was varying shades of yellow, orange, and red.</li>
            <li> Waste of ten bucks, going to a professional this week praying she can fix it.</li>
            <li> Since I was getting red out of my hair, my hair was left a cartoon orange/yellow (which was what I expected).  </li>
            <li> (this product didn&#x27;t even dissolve the color as promised), and my poor, natural hair color at the ends, asking \\&quot;Really, was this necessary?\\</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this product; getting a year&#x27;s worth of black dye out of my hair without making it look damaged is not easy!  </li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this product; getting a year&#x27;s worth of black dye out of my hair without making it look damaged is not easy!  </li>
            <li> No more blue just natural looking blonde.</li>
            <li> In fact my hair is still pretty black with splotches of reddish brown and it was really uneven.</li>
            <li> Be very careful to get every part of your hair because it will bleach it orange, and leave it on long enough, blonde.</li>
            <li> my whole head lion yellow (not a good look for Asians).  </li>
            <li> I bought an ultra ash to counter the red/orange color and chose a dark blonde because I expected it to come out 2 shades darker given my current(red) hair color, the tone change, and the darkening properties of the filler (I got a clear filler, but still expected it to darken things).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only have to lift to an orange color to get that dark blue I want.</li>
            <li> (I mixed it in a bowl and used a color brush to apply), and it turned my hair a red tone which blended well with my dark to medium brown color.  </li>
            <li> So I wound up with what is called &amp;#34;hot roots&amp;#34; apparently --- my roots came out medium/reddish brown, but the rest of my hair stayed dark brown/black.</li>
            <li> I knew my hair would come out not natural, but a bleachy color.    </li>
            <li> I feel like all of the complaints regarding streakiness or patchiness could have been avoided by simply having someone else carefully and evenly apply it for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional</li>
            <li> Since the beauty store was closed and Wal-mart was open</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not totally out of military regs.</li>
            <li> (I worked at an architect firm at the time), it wasn&#x27;t a professional color at all</li>
            <li> have medium thickness hair down to the middle of my back</li>
            <li> /&gt;i applied it, following the directions to \\&quot;not apply to new hair growth,\\&quot; and followed the hair timing guide for \\&quot;dark shades or heavily colored hair.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I thought it would take 30 mins to get out the deep violet black color, but after 20, I saw the orange and red tones and washed out.  </li>
            <li> It colored some areas brighter and some darker, but this is due to imperfect coverage; something not the fault of the color remover but through \\&quot;human error\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> mixed with my usual medium brown color, applied it to the \\&quot;orange\\&quot; and left it for 35 mins then for the last 5 mins</li>
            <li> At the suggestion of other reviewers, I decided not to use the entire bottle of peroxide.</li>
            <li> I probably could&#x27;ve used the entire bottle of peroxide, and potentially could&#x27;ve kept the solution on a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> I probably could&#x27;ve used the entire bottle of peroxide, and potentially could&#x27;ve kept the solution on a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> My situation is very similar to other users.</li>
            <li> This stuff got the color out, but turned my hair a very dry, damaged, yellow, blonde, orange spotty mess.</li>
            <li> My hair was on the dry side, to remedy this</li>
            <li> My head looks like a patchwork quilt and its terribly, terribly dry.</li>
            <li> I blew my hair completely dry.</li>
            <li> Immediately after my hair was dry</li>
            <li> After the hair was completely dry</li>
            <li> I used a permanent black color at least three times since and finally, this winter, was ready to return to a chocolate brown and/or</li>
            <li> Now I have short, dark, dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair black for a long time (ten years?)</li>
            <li> long enough to get the black out.....</li>
            <li> ~Late last winter/early spring, I decided to try to go back to my natural hair color which is black.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally red hair and have been dyeing it dark brown for about a year.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to the tee (I am naturally dark blonde).</li>
            <li> i finally reached my dark brown again.</li>
            <li> so on the results and ended up dying my hair back to dark brown.</li>
            <li> I red reviews for this and watched tons of youtube videos regarding lightening dark hair color</li>
            <li> /&gt;And of course this product damages your hair and makes it dry!</li>
            <li> I was concerned about it getting totally bleached out since I wasn&#x27;t trying to remove black or anything</li>
            <li> I expected to wait close to an hour, which the time chart recommended for stubborn, dark, and/or hair that had been dyed multiple times.</li>
            <li> But in the end i came out with orange roots and red black striped ends..</li>
            <li> And actually took less time than I&#x27;d anticipated.  </li>
            <li> So I have been dying my hair all shades of purple, red, black, brown, auburn...</li>
            <li> About two months later I got over the maintenance and damage from the bleach and dyed my hair JET BLACK.</li>
            <li> This time, I used only half the box</li>
            <li> My hair when from a dark brown left by the previous product to a blazing red/orange (expected) and yellow roots (also expected).</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry and damaged; in the end I had to cut a lot of it off.</li>
            <li> And you will definitely be covered in product and have a mess on the floor around you.  </li>
            <li> It did dry my hair out a bit, but that isn&#x27;t anything a few deep conditioning treatments and a trim can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> After allowing the allotted time to pass, I rinsed my hair, stepped out of the shower to the most gruesome sight I have ever experienced...white-bleach blonde roots (where I rubbed the solution on the actual dye, as specified), pink in the middle</li>
            <li> There are some red undertones in my hair, but at least my color now looks like something that could be found in nature and not bozo the clown red.</li>
            <li> There are some red undertones in my hair, but at least my color now looks like something that could be found in nature and not bozo the clown red.</li>
            <li> I went to Walgreens totally resigned to buying the dark, dark color to match the rest of my hair, when I saw this box of haircolor remover.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that there is not enough product in one box.  </li>
            <li> I have burnt-orange strands with fried-yellow roots and almost pink ends.  </li>
            <li> and i keep a few extra boxes of it on my shelf so that i have them for when my i color change my hair</li>
            <li> For me, this product did what it promised and (according to the enclosed expected result color chart)</li>
            <li> (Some of my green was left - my guess</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s to be expected since this product contains bleach.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times over the last 12 years when I&#x27;ve decided to lighten my color up a bit.</li>
            <li> so I can dye portions of it pink.</li>
            <li> This product worked exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> I used the remover on the heavy buildup, on the ends and left it for 35 mins, the end result was an orange color.  </li>
            <li> Spend a few extra dollars avoid bargain bin hair color.</li>
            <li> The product has a consistency not much thicker than water, and without help, you basically just have to work it through your hair using your gloved hands.</li>
            <li> dark in the back, jet black in the front.</li>
            <li> my hair was a almost black dark red?</li>
            <li> I have medium shoulder length brown hair with slight grey roots.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan on getting nasty, but I will warn the first timers to read a little more about the product.</li>
            <li> My hair color is naturally medium to dark brown, but lately it&#x27;s been getting darker &amp; darker because I can never seem to pick the correct color from the box.</li>
            <li> May hair became slightly less orangey when it was dry.</li>
            <li> May hair became slightly less orangey when it was dry.</li>
            <li> last week I decided I wanted a dark blue hair color and knew I&#x27;d have a hard time lifting my black.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to put in evenly in the first place since it was grainy and dried up extremely quickly, making it difficult to see where I had already placed it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I read the reviews here on Amazon and some other sites.</li>
            <li> So, use with extreme caution.  </li>
            <li> so unlucky for me, when using this product, it bleached a small area of my hair yellow close to the scalp.</li>
            <li> In the box you get 2 bottles one with the bleaching powder and the other is a 2 oz bottle of developer.</li>
            <li> My scalp is pretty angry.</li>
            <li> I usually like to give my hair a 24-48 hour break between bleaching and coloring, so I use my regular conditioner and my hair</li>
            <li> My hair was three different shades as I have been dying my hair at home for the past year.  </li>
            <li> Nothing but a small amount of bleach...barely covered mine &amp; I have short hair.</li>
            <li> I have read at least 15 different ways on here to use the product other than as instructed.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the product if used AS DIRECTED leaves your hair a frizzy, dry, brittle consistency, although it IS slightly less harsh than bleach.  </li>
            <li> That seemed like a much less risky approach given other people&#x27;s over-bleaching experiences.     </li>
            <li> as I was) in taking off that dark hair color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to go dye my hair dark brown,</li>
            <li> Then i picked up my desired hair color ( revlon box color, dark brown)</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> This stuff took ALL of the dark hair dye out.</li>
            <li> I knew it wouldnt lighten the still dark parts</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think this will benefit anyone with dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is long a bit past the shoulders.</li>
            <li> long hair that is close or past the shoulders, use two bottles.</li>
            <li> So, I decided to purchase this product after desiring to rid myself of a few pink streaks in my hair, remnants of Burning Man.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t wild about how thin this product is.</li>
            <li> I recently dyed my hair black after fixing it after using color oops to try to get the color out.(it didn&#x27;t work too well, but at least the color</li>
            <li> I mean really red...</li>
            <li> The smell of the liquid was horrible, by the way, but pretty much expected, since it&#x27;s basically straight bleach.</li>
            <li> This worked like a charm to remove black hair dye.</li>
            <li> But this stripped out the black</li>
            <li> I had dyed my hair black for Halloween and needed to remove it.</li>
            <li> this worked to get the black dye out, i tried 2 boxes of the color oops</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair jet black for years</li>
            <li> I planned on just dying it black again, but I had seen this product at the store and thought I would give it a shot.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing is this severely dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> This evening I ended up with an unsightly case of maroon roots and black ends...</li>
            <li> 10-mins. will give a slight reddish-brown, and additional 5-minute increments will increase the redness.  </li>
            <li> I had a build up that was almost black at the sides and ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair was nearly black.</li>
            <li> I have dyed my hair jet black.</li>
            <li> (By the way, my hair was quite dark, a very dark brown, almost black).  </li>
            <li> The product is very thin and you must spend enough time shaking it up to mix the two ingredients or the blue powder tends to stick to the bottom of the container.  </li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair medium to dark brown for a few years to cover gray.  </li>
            <li> The reviews, generally, were not great, but I decided to give it a try anyway.  </li>
            <li> Because my hair is so thick and long, I split my hair in two parts.</li>
            <li> I do have long thick hair</li>
            <li> These past four years, I have continuously dyed my hair black on black on black on black on black.</li>
            <li> had dyed black hair and this turned it very dark brown.</li>
            <li> but I thought it would at the very least tone down the bleached blonde roots, so it was obnoxious.</li>
            <li> so I figured I would save 4 bucks and buy the L&#x27;Oreal in hopes to take out the little that needed to be removed...</li>
            <li> And recently, i went to a salon to try desperately to get my dark brown back.</li>
            <li> Yes a little lighter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll foam and go a little funky but keep and eye</li>
            <li> So that made me a little nervous, but I pushed on.</li>
            <li> So that made me a little nervous, but I pushed on.</li>
            <li> I have hair just above my shoulders, but it&#x27;s very thick.</li>
            <li> bad - I have just above shoulder length, thick, course hair and I really felt like I needed two boxes.</li>
            <li> If you think this product is going to just take the coloring out of your hair and leave you with your natural color, then you&#x27;d be wrong.  </li>
            <li> so hopefully this helps everyone out there that has hair trouble.</li>
            <li> As I dried off my hair, I noticed parts of my hair were ORANGE.</li>
            <li> Waste of 10$</li>
            <li> I started with two boxes of Color OOPS, but that was a waste of time (see my review there).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Also, if you&#x27;re somewhat messy at dying your hair, you probably want to cover EVERYTHING</li>
            <li> It does not, and is not meant to, leave an acceptable color behind - it will be yellow, orange, or reddish depending on the color you started with.</li>
            <li> You might save a few bucks buying clairol or revlon</li>
            <li> Just brush thoroughly with boar brush and color, and there is no need to shampoo everyday.</li>
            <li> HELL yea it killed my poor roots and turned them blonde.</li>
            <li> Both of my samples remained completely black with no change whatsoever!</li>
            <li> and she decided I looked way too pale</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not easy to take the color out.</li>
            <li> The resulting concoction was a lavender runny soup consistency, so not exactly easy to apply in one-inch sections.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, bra strap length hair and 3-4 bottles minimal should have been used.</li>
            <li> I thought it was weird because my hair is only chin length.</li>
            <li> Not sure if anybody else had this problem</li>
            <li> For the record, I have never &amp;#34;removed&amp;#34; my hair color before and am not sure I will again.</li>
            <li> I did not, which I usually do.</li>
            <li> The resulting color was very uneven--</li>
            <li> I have very thick, semi-coarse hair down to my hips.</li>
            <li> When I got out of the shower, it was hard to tell what it had done.</li>
            <li> but it is hard to apply in my opinion yet</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already late.</li>
            <li> i have never wished i could give a product negative stars before, but this one has done it.</li>
            <li> Ive decided im gonna wait at least a week or so,</li>
            <li> any place I had scratched earlier burned like crazy with the color remover.</li>
            <li> Not even a star rating is deserved, but Amazon is forcing me to give at least one.</li>
            <li> so thats another negative people seem to complain about that does not makes sense...</li>
            <li> I have almost shoulder length, kinda thick hair.</li>
            <li> My poor hair has been through hell the past two days.</li>
            <li> THE JET BLACK/NATURAL BLACK/SOFT BLACK color was REMOVED!!!  </li>
            <li> it kinda looks like i had subtle highlights in.</li>
            <li> Seriously read all directions on the color remover, it works if you can follow instructions not a miracle worker though.  </li>
            <li> today) i was finally fed up with this nasty red brown mix and decided to try this.</li>
            <li> but little did i know that black is almost impossible to get out.</li>
            <li> I actually ended up leaving this color because it didn&#x27;t even look all that bad.</li>
            <li> After dying my hair dark brown/auburn at least 12 times over the course of 5 years, I decided that the maintenance was too costly and inconvenient to continue.</li>
            <li> She told me it was going to be difficult, and long, and expensive ($300</li>
            <li> I had tried several other dyes to remove my black dye so I can go purple and was getting sick of wasting money on crap that wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I had to cut it really short :(</li>
            <li> So I dyed my hair black the other day and absolutely hated it.</li>

            <li> I have had RED hair for awhile and slowly but surely have been bringing it back to it&#x27;s natural blonde. I bought color oops and despite the smell which nearly suffocated me, LOVED LOVED IT! It didn&#x27;t leave my hair orange but not quite right. The directions said it may take several processes to fully remove a buildup so I figured I would save 4 bucks and buy the L&#x27;Oreal in hopes to take out the little that needed to be removed... now my hair is fried. I am so unhappy. I was looking forward to being able to apply the blonde dye I purchased and now I can&#x27;t for AT LEAST a week until it recovers from this horrid horrid product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOn&#x27;t buy it! PLEASE! For the ingerity of your hair spend the extra money on COlor Oops! It was amazing. This stuff might as well have been bleach. I can&#x27;t brush my hair, pull it into a pony tail... nothing. It&#x27;s bad... tomorrow morning I am going to go buy mayo to soak my hair in ....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried to pull color out of my hair before on my own and have only had it done once at the salon. I&#x27;d lightened my medium brown hair to a nice light copper color, but it was starting to grow out. I went to the store and they didn&#x27;t have a the same color, so I went with one that was more orange-red. A lot more, it turned out. I hated it and waiting a couple weeks to see if it would fade didn&#x27;t really improve things.     I&#x27;d seen Color Oops on the shelf the ill-fated night I chose the way-too-red color and decided to give it a try. But when I went to the store, they had this L&#x27;Oreal product on the shelf next to it. I always use L&#x27;Oreal color products and decided to go with a brand I was familiar with.     I didn&#x27;t get around to doing it for a couple nights and last-minute decided to do some research since I had no idea how it was going to work. I read the reviews here on Amazon and some other sites. I was concerned about it getting totally bleached out since I wasn&#x27;t trying to remove black or anything super dark. I didn&#x27;t mind if my roots got a bit bleached since they were darker than the color I wanted to go anyway.     In a couple of the reviews, people used water instead of the peroxide developer that comes in the box. One even suggested mixing a bit of conditioner into the water. That seemed like a much less risky approach given other people&#x27;s over-bleaching experiences.     The Developer liquid is 2 oz, so I put some hot tap water in a measuring cup and stirred in a blob of conditioner until it was melted, then poured that into the bottle with the powder in it. After shaking it up well, I started applying it. It was a bit tricky since it wasn&#x27;t a cream at all, just watery liquid that you had to apply without dripping everywhere. Plus, 2 oz is not very much, so I can see how people with longer hair or wanting to saturate it more than I was would have problems. Uneven saturation is probably a big component in the splotchy results some people have experienced.     By the time I finished applying it, it had been on the lower layers of my hair for quite a while, so I only left it in for about 10 minutes after that. When I got out of the shower, it was hard to tell what it had done. But once I blew it dry, it had done exactly what I wanted. I had been scared that it would just get more orange than what I stared with, but the red-red came out well and it is basically back to the nice copper I was going for--with the roots lightened enough to blend better. I&#x27;m actually not going to re-color it right away since I have to be up early tomorrow and it&#x27;s already late. I&#x27;m really happy with how it worked.</li>
            <li> I dyed my naturally medium-blonde hair with L&#x27;Oreals \\&quot;Healthy Look Creme Gloss Color\\&quot; that is semi-permanent that supposedly lasts through 28 washes.    Well my virgin hair soaked up that red/brown dye like nobody&#x27;s business, and 2 months later it hadn&#x27;t faded but maybe a shade. The color was fun, but not \\&quot;me\\&quot;, so I had been looking to go back to blonde.    I&#x27;d seen the mixed reviews about this color removal product, but I decided to go with it anyway. I tested it out per the instructions, and my hair test strip took 45 minutes for it to reach the desired blonde I was looking for. No breakage with this test.    Because my hair is so thick and long, I split my hair in two parts. I had a friend put one box on bottom half of my hair first, and she kept running the product through evenly, never letting it sit in one spot too long. It was 25 minutes in (not the original 45!) when my hair reached the desired shade. I rinsed the product out, gently shampooed it, and allowed my hair to air dry. It&#x27;s great, no breakage, and minimally frizzy. I will use this product on the top half of my head in a day or two.    Because the color is a great shade of blonde for me, I won&#x27;t be using any other dyes over it.    All you really need to do with this product is closely follow the instructions, test it out on a cut section of hair, and make sure you watch it so it reaches the right color! I am pleased with the result, and I&#x27;m glad to be blonde again!</li>
            <li> Ok, background information. I am a frequent user of hair color.  Before I used this product, my hair was in excellent condition.  And I made sure to deep condition before I used it just as an added precaution.  My hair naturally is a medium brown.  I have been coloring my hair medium to dark brown for a few years to cover gray.  I&#x27;m noticing the darker color is starting to make me look washed out so I wanted to go light brown.  As stated, I deep conditioned.  Then used the hair color remover the next day.  It does remove the hair color.  I was left with the yellow/orange color it says you are suppose to get.  Made it very easy to color with a lighter color however I would not use a warm tone as the hair color remover already leaves you with plenty of red/orange/yellow tones and a warm hair color is likely to leave you quite brassy. So, does the product work? Yes. However, my healthy, shiny hair was ravaged.  It dried it out terribly. And was made even worse by having to color it afterwards.  My strong lustrous hair is now brittle and dull.  So, use with extreme caution.  If your hair is in poor condition I would not recommend using this product.  And if your hair is in good condition proceed with extreme caution.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works but it only did half of my hair! I thought it was weird because my hair is only chin length. Not sure if anybody else had this problem but it does work and will lift your color. My hair was dyed red.</li>
            <li> This stuff is only for the highly skilled.  You must have it perfectly distributed.  It left the color in the ends of my hair, turned my hair many shades of yellow.  If you think this product is going to just take the coloring out of your hair and leave you with your natural color, then you&#x27;d be wrong.  I would only recommend this to someone who has a trained cosmetologist friend or family member who will do this for you at home.  It&#x27;s not for people who are just used to coloring at home, it needs more skill and ability.  I have been coloring my hair for years and I will never use this product again.  I thought it would be good to try taking all the color out of my hair to do new color.  I will get the help of a Sally Beauty staff member next time I need advice on starting over with color.</li>
            <li> I have naturally red hair and have been dyeing it dark brown for about a year.  I used this product as per directions (left it on for 30 minutes, in a shower cap) and it did exactly what I expected/what the box said it would do... turned my hair a gross yellow orange color.  The directions clearly say that you should color your hair after using this product, no where does it say \\&quot;use this and your hair will turn back to your beautiful natural color!\\&quot; like the bad reviews seemed to have thought would happen.  It is meant to give you a surface that you can color over.  In big bold letters, the directions say that if you have dark brown hair it will turn orange...</li>
            <li> Okay, I actually bought this item a couple days ago from duane reade but had never read the reviews of it at first. I then read what many people had said about the product and was so scared to try it out myself. After contemplating for a couple of hours I decided to try it...    First thing I did was mix the powder with hot water instead of the hair color remover liquid. (By the way, my hair was quite dark, a very dark brown, almost black).  After 30 minutes I washed it out and the end result? My hair color was actually back to my natural hair color, which is brown, with a tinge of red/orange and the added bonus my hair was not damaged at all!! I actually ended up leaving this color because it didn&#x27;t even look all that bad. I actually wanted it to go a little more lighter and if I probably would&#x27;ve left it on longer, it probably would&#x27;ve gone lighter. (But for those who want to actually have a much lighter color, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this method)    Anyway ladies, this method worked for me and hopefully it will work for the ones that are sick and tired(just as I was) in taking off that dark hair color. Hope this helps!!</li>
            <li> I had very healthy, soft hair, but the last coloring leaned way too much red, especially right on top. So, I bought this product hoping to have a \\&quot;do over\\&quot;. This stuff got the color out, but turned my hair a very dry, damaged, yellow, blonde, orange spotty mess. I have medium shoulder length brown hair with slight grey roots. I was able to re-color with Clairol 118A Nice and Easy, It took the color, but it is very highlighted with orange and yellow all throughout and still very dry. I am going to have to look up some conditioning treatments that work better than the hot oil stuff and normal conditioners.  I would never use it again, but at least, I was able to fix it enough so that I didn&#x27;t have to go to a salon for re-coloring.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE!!!! I bought this product only because Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply did not have Ion Color Corrector. I have used Ion&#x27;s Color Corrector several times &amp; it only removed the product (last hair color you applied). Ion&#x27;s Color Corrector is gentle, easy &amp; extremely effective in only removing the product, leaving you with your natural hair color.&lt;br /&gt;This product (L&#x27;Oreal Haircolor Removal) BLEACHED my hair!!!! I&#x27;m beyond mad! I started with my natural hair color (medium brown), I applied a medium brown caramel color (which I didn&#x27;t like), then applied L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Haircolor removal for 30 mins) and now MY HAIR IS COPPER, YELLOW &amp; ORANGE SPOTTED!!!! This is a BLEACH PRODUCT! DO NOT USE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;TRY ION&#x27;S COLOR CORRECTOR! IT&#x27;S THE BEST PRODUCT FOR REMOVING BOXED COLOR.</li>
            <li> I knew, going in, that this product was a bleach and not merely a color remover.  I knew my hair would come out not natural, but a bleachy color.    What I didn&#x27;t know was that my hair would come out as *several different* bleachy colors.  I have burnt-orange strands with fried-yellow roots and almost pink ends.  \\&quot;Bleachy\\&quot; is one thing; \\&quot;ready for the circus\\&quot; is another.    It also stung my scalp in use, and the texture of my hair right now is just destroyed.    I&#x27;m going to go dye my hair dark brown, hope that covers this up, and never use this product again.</li>
            <li> This stuff did nothing for my hair, didn&#x27;t remove much color. Unhappy with this.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible!!! I grabbed it at a local CVS instead of Color Oops (which I have used before and works great) only because it was on sale. My hair is naturally light brown and had some blonde highlights in it when I tried twice to dye it dark brown. The resulting color was very uneven-- dark in the back, jet black in the front. About a week after the dyeing, I applied the L&#x27;Oreal color remover to my hair and waited over an hour... After rinsing it out, I saw that NOTHING happened. My hair was still black --except for where I used to have highlights which turned BRIGHT COPPERY RED. My hair was very dry and damaged; in the end I had to cut a lot of it off. Now I have short, dark, dry hair. Wish I had just sucked it up and went to a salon... or paid the $5 extra for Color Oops.</li>
            <li> Before you purchase this hair color remover for your hair try color oops first i usually purchase two to three boxes of color oops and i keep a few extra boxes of it on my shelf so that i have them for when my i color change my hair ,I decided to give this product a  try and it almost ruined my hair,so i would not recommend using this hair color remover product unless you have really strong hair follicles that can withstand the bleaching done to the hair,color oops is not a bleach based product and it works very well for me so hopefully this helps everyone out there that has hair trouble.</li>
            <li> Horrible product. I used it to remove color build up. After putting this product on my hair and only leaving it for 10 minutes I ended up with blonde hair and I am natural a medium brunette.</li>
            <li> I so wanted this product to work. I read many reviews and the biggest problems seemed to be that this remover worked too well...in that it stripped hair too much. However, I had the opposite problem.   I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair black for a long time (ten years?) and have had it professionally stripped once and it worked fine. I purchased two boxes of the L&#x27;Oreal Haircolor Remover and did a strand test (with two strands from different parts of my hair to be extra careful). I set my timer in 10 minute increments and checked every ten minutes up until 70 minutes. Both of my samples remained completely black with no change whatsoever! So disappointing. Especially since the box \\&quot;guarantees\\&quot; that this product will remove hair dye, even after multiple uses.  I just hope I can return the unopened box of remover and red hair dye I bought.</li>
            <li> This worked like a charm to remove black hair dye. It is important to remember, when using this product, the goal is red/orange/yellow. Nothing can take you directly back to your natural color, that pigment is lost. But this stripped out the black so I could re color it. This does work like mild bleach. I did have to do a deep conditioning treatment afterwards. If you are trying to remove a one time too dark color or lighter colors, I would try Color Oops first. But this is the best thing to strip black. I was left with very copper hair which is what the insert indicated. I used Vidal Sassoon Salonist in Light Cool Brown and my hair is still caramel/light auburn brown but I am going to wait a week and tone it a little more with Wella T14. Overall, I am pleased.</li>
            <li> i have never wished i could give a product negative stars before, but this one has done it. i have medium-dark brown hair naturally, but had dyed it a brown-black color, then black over the top of that. i got tired of it and wanted a change, so i went to the drugstore to buy a box of Color Oops, which i had used before and really liked. but then i saw this, which was made by L&#x27;Oreal (a company i&#x27;d actually heard of before), and it was on sale, so i decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i applied it, following the directions to \\&quot;not apply to new hair growth,\\&quot; and followed the hair timing guide for \\&quot;dark shades or heavily colored hair.\\&quot; the directions said to leave it on for 20-60 minutes, so i left it on for 40. the only part of the directions i didn&#x27;t follow was to \\&quot;monitor the lightening process until you reach the color target,\\&quot; but since it turns blue i don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;d be able to tell what color your hair was without rinsing it off, thus giving yourself weird streaks of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after waiting 40 minutes, when i got into the shower to rinse out my hair and looked in the mirror, i nearly died. it looked like i had a bald spot. i quickly washed this garbage out of my hair and had a closer look. thankfully, my hair hadn&#x27;t fallen out, it had just been bleached white in that spot. this stuff had dripped onto my roots and bleached them white, left some of my hair black, and the rest was varying shades of yellow, orange, and red. i called my hairstylist immediately, and she said she&#x27;d be worried about the parts that had been bleached white falling out. the only good part of this whole thing is that my hair didn&#x27;t fall out, but i ended up having to get 16 inches of hair cut off because every time i brushed my hair i was terrified that i&#x27;d hit a knot and pull it out. now, every time i have to style my short hair, i get depressed. i will never buy another L&#x27;Oreal hair product because of what this garbage did to my hair.</li>
            <li> It worked great for me, and I have very long hair. I had to get a ghastly shade of orange out. I worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at my local Walmart for $9 and hoping that this would work. I had tried several other dyes to remove my black dye so I can go purple and was getting sick of wasting money on crap that wouldn&#x27;t work. Seeing some of the reviews here, I can say I was lucky. For me, this product did what it promised and (according to the enclosed expected result color chart) my jet-black hair turned a shade of red-orange; very tiger-like in tones. It colored some areas brighter and some darker, but this is due to imperfect coverage; something not the fault of the color remover but through \\&quot;human error\\&quot;. I am satisfied because it did live up to its promise and now (when I&#x27;m ready) I should have more luck lightening and recoloring. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So I dyed my hair black the other day and absolutely hated it. So I bought this product to take it back to my natural brunette hair. I followed all the directions. I waited about 45 minutes to wash it out. As I dried off my hair, I noticed parts of my hair were ORANGE. It now looks like I have orange highlights. I did NOT expect this to happen, I thought the orange color would wash out when I shampooed my hair. Nope. Extremely annoyed because I  do not look good with orange hair. Waste of 10$</li>
            <li> So, I decided to purchase this product after desiring to rid myself of a few pink streaks in my hair, remnants of Burning Man. I followed the instructions to the tee (I am naturally dark blonde). After allowing the allotted time to pass, I rinsed my hair, stepped out of the shower to the most gruesome sight I have ever experienced...white-bleach blonde roots (where I rubbed the solution on the actual dye, as specified), pink in the middle (this product didn&#x27;t even dissolve the color as promised), and my poor, natural hair color at the ends, asking \\&quot;Really, was this necessary?\\&quot; Do not use this product.</li>
            <li> this is a bleach like product and ruined my natural hair color I&#x27;ve spent months trying to get it back to normal after this disaster! Color oops shrinks the die molecules and leaves your natural hair alone, this product turned my hair bright ORANGE!!!!</li>
            <li> this product does exactly what it says it does. I had dyed my hair black for Halloween and needed to remove it. The color remover removed the black from most of my hair and turned it orange, with very light almost blonde roots. I kinda dig the orange, lol. I&#x27;m planning on going full blonde tomorrow when my hair is dry. I did use the super conditioner that I had left from coloring (I used Feria)after rinsing and shampooing. I think that helped the \\&quot;helmet\\&quot; feel my hair had after rinsing. I&#x27;m giving the product 3 stars only because of the value for the money. My hair doesn&#x27;t even touch my shoulders. If I dye my hair and have dye left over, then I shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about running out of the remover. They need to put a little more in the box. My hair is pretty streaky right now because of the lack of coverage one box of this product provides.</li>
            <li> this worked to get the black dye out, i tried 2 boxes of the color oops and all it did was lighten my roots. so unlucky for me, when using this product, it bleached a small area of my hair yellow close to the scalp. totally my fault though, i tried to keep it away from my roots but accidentally got some on there. its nothing i cant fix though. i didn&#x27;t bleach my hair to blonde, just to an orange color. long enough to get the black out.....happy with this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update.. i was able to color over my hair and get a mostly even color result. it kinda looks like i had subtle highlights in. i colored it a brownish red color..&lt;br /&gt;i would use this again if i had to.</li>
            <li> No matter what color you are trying to remove it will bleach your hair WHITE or ORANGE. Both are unnatural looking and undesirable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do me the favor of never purchasing this............. hopefully it becomes discontinued.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  I had to buy 2 boxes because my hair is longer. I made sure to apply it carefully so that each piece of hair was covered. I did the root area last, then covered it with a shower cap to keep the heat in. After 15 minutes the JET BLACK color was already a nice chestnut brown. 15 minutes after that it was a lighter amber shade. I had bought my recover dye, but I really liked the amber color so I left it.  This product is very gentle to the hair, I suggest to go ahead and put a protein pack on it for 30 minutes afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, semi-coarse hair down to my hips. After dying my hair dark brown/auburn at least 12 times over the course of 5 years, I decided that the maintenance was too costly and inconvenient to continue. Unfortunately, the lower lengths of my hair had been dyed so many times, the dark, nearly black, color would not budge when I tried to dye it a light brown color, closer to my natural shade. I purchased a few of these kits (4 to be exact, which ended up being just enough to coat my hair) and came home to read some reviews before applying it. The reviews, generally, were not great, but I decided to give it a try anyway.  I combined the mixture from all four kits in one bowl and made sure it was thoroughly mixed before I had someone else apply it for me. I expected to wait close to an hour, which the time chart recommended for stubborn, dark, and/or hair that had been dyed multiple times. After only a half hour, however, I decided that it had lightened as much as I needed it to. It was a rather vibrant light orange color, which I had been warned to expect, so I countered the orange tones by dying my hair a light \\&quot;ash\\&quot; brown. It is now a warm light-medium brown, more natural-looking and uniformly colored than I&#x27;ve seen it in years. Hopefully I can now let my natural color grow in with minimal maintenance. I feel like all of the complaints regarding streakiness or patchiness could have been avoided by simply having someone else carefully and evenly apply it for you. It did dry my hair out a bit, but that isn&#x27;t anything a few deep conditioning treatments and a trim can&#x27;t fix. The smell is quite strong so I applied it in my garage with the doors raised. The drying quality and strong smell are the only factors preventing me from giving this product 5 stars, but I would still turn to it again if necessary and recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> To start out, my natural hair is dark brown. And over a year ago i colored it soft black ( revlon box color) but little did i know that black is almost impossible to get out. So i tried to lighten it with another box color which was a light brown, to my surprise it only colored my roots and the black on my ends didnt budge. now its been another year And recently, i went to a salon to try desperately to get my dark brown back. But in the end i came out with orange roots and red black striped ends.. And since then i have been looking for ways to fix my hair color myself. I thought about one n only colorfix, ion color brilliance color corrector so i researched these 2 products. And i honestly didnt want sulphur smelling hair, So after reading reviews about loreal hair color remover, i decided to take a plunge and try it. In the box you get 2 bottles one with the bleaching powder and the other is a 2 oz bottle of developer. Ive read before to make sure you have your desired color on hand to color afterwards. So today i picked up 2 boxes of the loreal hair color remover, no matter how short you hair is trust me you will need 2 boxes. I have shoulder length hair, and 1 box wasnt near enough. Plus the consistency of the product is watery. Then i picked up my desired hair color ( revlon box color, dark brown) and i also picked up 1 bottle of colorful neutral protein filler hair dressers color insurance. This i found at sallys for around $5. For those of you that arent familiar which a protein filler, it basically helps your hair to absorb the color better. And it also repairs previously damaged protein bonds, and it protects hair against new chemical damage. Anyway, i read other reviews about using water instead of the developer, i recommend trying this method first before using the developer. And i also recommend doing a strand test, so that way you will know what results to expect. I mixed 1TBS haircolor powder with 2TBS hot water and squeezed in a little bit of my conditioner. Picked a 1\\&quot;\\&quot; section of hair and did my strand test. My hair lightened tremendously! So the next day i continued with my whole head. I measured 2oz hot water and squeezed in some conditioner, mixed it until melted and poured it into the bottle with the powder and shook it up. Just a warning it will be watery, so i suggest putting a towel on the floor where your coloring. Since my ends were still black, i applied the mixture to my ends first and left it on for 20min. Then went back in and continued on my roots and left that in for another 15 min. So the total time was 45 min. I rinsed out my hair, and at first i couldnt tell if there was any change. But once i blew it dry, my hair was a brassy orange red color. If you get this color Do NOT freak out, this is what your supposed to get. But i was so happy that my hair was all one color. So in the end i was very very pleased with the outcome. My hair was on the dry side, to remedy this i suggest buying some cholesterol cream from sallys beauty supply. Its a leave in conditioning cream that softens brittle hair. I normally apply this generously and leave in for 1hour. And my hair is soft as silk :)&lt;br /&gt;For my hair color, i poured the color and the developer into a hair color mixing bowl ( purchased from sallys) and then added in 1.5 oz of the protein filler. The instructions say to use between 1-2 oz, but i felt 2 oz was too much. So i decided 1.5oz would be enough. Mind you, this mixture will also be watery. I then applied this to my roots only, waited. And then went back in and colored the rest of my hair and left that in for 20 min. I rinsed my hair until the water was clear. And WOW! My hair was actually one color, and a normal color! There is just a tiny hint of red, but you cant tell. Im just super happy i finally reached my dark brown again. I strongly recommend the protein filler, this really made the difference. I noticed as i was coloring, my hair was taking the color in faster than normal. Even my mother noticed my hair was changing color fast. And my hair was soo much softer. Ive decided im gonna wait at least a week or so, then im going to re color my hair again with the protein filler, to insure the red is all out. But overall i recommend using the water method before using the developer. A miracle for my hair!</li>
            <li> I dont understand some of the reviews on here.&lt;br /&gt;This product does exactly what it should. Be very careful to get every part of your hair because it will bleach it orange, and leave it on long enough, blonde. Any parts you missed will definitely stick out.&lt;br /&gt;I have medium thickness hair down to the middle of my back and I needed two boxes. I thought I might need 3 but 2 did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It damages your hair of course but with the conditioner that comes with hair dye boxes or just buy a good one, it won&#x27;t last long. My hair turned out the exact color of the dye I bought , a little more red tint but it faded after a week to the exact color I intended it to be, medium auburn brown. A def improvement from the brown/black I had!  THANK GOD FOR THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> ...My hair wasn&#x27;t exactly ready to color again. I did finally achieve a good result later with a little protein filler. [[ASIN:B001HBN5JO COLORFUL Neutral Protein Filler Hairdressers Color Insurance 16 oz/473 ml]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair jet black for years so it&#x27;s not easy to take the color out. I had attempted to go to a light brown twice in the last 2 years and went to 2 different high end salons for it but my hair always ended up red or strawberry blonde with platinum roots even though I asked for light brown. So this time I decided to DIY at least the first part of it to save some money ( I spent close to $400 each time  at the salon only to go right back to my old color so I wasn&#x27;t doing that again). I&#x27;m not a professional but I figured that if I did enough research about hair coloring and my specific situation I could do some DIY. So after  a day of research I was ready to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product and, as expected, my hair ended up bright orange red with platinum/yellow roots. I immediately colored my hair with a drugstore foam color in dark ash blonde afterwards (to achieve a golden light brown) but there was no change. The hair color didn&#x27;t hold AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stayed calm and did a little more research. Turns out that sometimes bleached hair won&#x27;t absorb the color because of the damage. My hair didn&#x27;t LOOK damaged, it was silky and perfect, but obviously the color wasn&#x27;t taking. So I went to sally&#x27;s and bought the following:  Clear protein filler, ultra ash dark blonde color (This is AA instead of A or .1), developer (20), and a mixing bowl, brush and gloves. I bought an ultra ash to counter the red/orange color and chose a dark blonde because I expected it to come out 2 shades darker given my current(red) hair color, the tone change, and the darkening properties of the filler (I got a clear filler, but still expected it to darken things).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very next day I used the protein filler first, as directed, and mixed the remaining protein filler with the color. The color did take this time because of the protein filler, what a lifesaver!!!! And my choice of ultra ash blonde left my hair a reddish/golden light brown that was very close to what I wanted. There are some red undertones in my hair, but at least my color now looks like something that could be found in nature and not bozo the clown red. I will go to a salon next month to get that brassiness out but this is a multi-step process and this product saved me a lot of money by being able to do step one in the process myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product; getting a year&#x27;s worth of black dye out of my hair without making it look damaged is not easy!  But I would recommend using a clear protein filler right after you use this and before you color your hair so that your new color will really take.[[ASIN:B001HBN5JO COLORFUL Neutral Protein Filler Hairdressers Color Insurance 16 oz/473 ml]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I waited a week and colored 1 shade darker in the ultra ash tone. The red undertones are now completely gone and look like golden highlights. My hair is still in very good condition and i achieved the exact color i wanted.the remaining protein filler with the color.

            <li> ...I have been dying my own hair for years. I am usually very pleased with the results (all excepting this last time). I planned on just dying it black again, but I had seen this product at the store and thought I would give it a shot. For the record, I have never &amp;#34;removed&amp;#34; my hair color before and am not sure I will again. This stuff lightened my hair, bleached if you will. It did NOT &amp;#34;REMOVE&amp;#34; any color. I don&#x27;t plan on getting nasty, but I will warn the first timers to read a little more about the product. I did not, which I usually do. Oh well, lesson learned.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, I had gone to a professional salon asking about a color correction (I had bright pink hair, with patches or green and yellow streaks) She told me it was going to be difficult, and long, and expensive ($300+..) I said to myself there has to be a way to do this on my own. I bought this product at Lawtons Drugstore With many doubts, My hair never goes how I want it to. I used the product, followed the instructions carefully, and within 5 minutes or so the pink was going VERY light blonde (just how i wanted it) After 30 minutes I washed it out with Go Blonder Shampoo and Conditioner, and i was amazed with the results, I got the shade of blonde I wanted with no brassy tones, or needing blonde dye to go over it. (Some of my green was left - my guess it is a harder shade to remove, maybe needed more time)  I give this product 10/10. I would be a little more hesitant if my hair was DARK brown, or black, but it will at least remove most of it, so you could redye it blonde, or whatever color you were thinking. But yea, awesome product, if need, i will go to this product first before bleach or anything else. Worth the price!!</li>
            <li> I recently dyed my hair black after fixing it after using color oops to try to get the color out.(it didn&#x27;t work too well, but at least the color oops was gentle, even though it stunk to high heaven). I have hair just above my shoulders, but it&#x27;s very thick. I bought and used three boxes which was enough to cover about 95% of my hair, and I left it on for an hour, checking it every 20 minutes as recommended. It started lightening some parts of it right away, and it turned a lot of my hair dark red and bright blonde.....with huge black chunks. My head looks like a patchwork quilt and its terribly, terribly dry. Not worth it. Going to attempt to redye it. Hope that works.</li>
            <li> After a long fiasco trying to let my grey grow out gracefully I finally decided to strip the years worth of dark brown/black build-up and re-dye a lighter color that would be easier to blend into the greys. I started with two boxes of Color OOPS, but that was a waste of time (see my review there). Twice it removed only to have the color re-oxidize by the next day. I was going to the beauty store to pick-up a last ditch effort when the reviews for Color Remover caught my attention. Since the beauty store was closed and Wal-mart was open I decided it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good - it did the job. Over a decade of permanent hair color once to twice a month gone in an hour. My hair when from a dark brown left by the previous product to a blazing red/orange (expected) and yellow roots (also expected). Best part was no re-oxidation!! It was simple to use and easy to gauge. OOPS had a rotten egg smell that wasn&#x27;t so bad when I used it but lingered in the bathroom for a week...this had no smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad - I have just above shoulder length, thick, course hair and I really felt like I needed two boxes. Unlike OOPS, which is runny and clear this was thicker, blue, and gritty. I barely had enough to cover my hair and it wasn&#x27;t as easy to apply by myself without feeling like I was stretching it thin. OOPS also had no affect on my scalp...any place I had scratched earlier burned like crazy with the color remover. It was tolerable but be prepared. My shirt however was ruined, it bleached the color where ever it touched..so wear clothing you can toss out and don&#x27;t drip on the carpet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to leave it on the whole hour...Overall my hair was a little more fried than with OOPS, but it took out the color and I followed it with a protein treatment and a hair mask. It&#x27;s a little dry but worth it and definitely not fried...I just do the mask very couple of days now. For the $1 more it cost over OOPS it&#x27;s a far better product with less frustration buteven shorter hair might need two boxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also, I chose a dark golden blonde/light golden brown hair color because the OOPS says you should try a shade or two lighter as hair will soak more color after use...I assumed this to be the case with the Color Remover - however, what I got was a red blonde/brown. I mean really red...I assume this is because my hair was really red/orange before I colored and that changed the outcome. It looks nothing like the box...perhaps if I had chosen a darker shade this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue but beware. It&#x27;s not a bad color but it isn&#x27;t golden or blonde and it&#x27;s taken some adjustment with my make-up and clothing...I&#x27;m debating on trying a brass remover and hoping it fades a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The need for two boxes and the change in my box color are the reasons I gave it four instead of five stars. I wished I had saved myself the $20 and started with this first! I definitely will keep it in mind if I need to change colors again or know someone with a color mishap!  It does not change natural color (the few brown roots I have are still brown) or take you back to a natural color - your results will be somewhere between yellow and red...make sure you have a box of color to follow the remover with once your hair is dry. it says you should recolor right away. Good luck!!</li>
            <li> ~Late last winter/early spring, I decided to try to go back to my natural hair color which is black.  I used a permanent black color at least three times since and finally, this winter, was ready to return to a chocolate brown and/or \\&quot;cherry cola\\&quot; color but DID NOT want to go to the salon to have them ruin my hair again and pay an outrageous price for it in the process, literally...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read ALL the reviews, found it available in store, and despite the instructions to do a test strip of hair, I went all in and immediately used the product according to the directions.  If anything went wrong, I was willing to cut my long hair just to have it healthy again but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT WORKED AMAZINGLY and according to exactly what it said!  Yes, my hair was a copper color (which I actually liked, but of course still had my natural colored roots) but it was healthy and ready immediately to recolor.  THE JET BLACK/NATURAL BLACK/SOFT BLACK color was REMOVED!!!  All of it!!!  And actually took less time than I&#x27;d anticipated.  I was expecting to be sitting around for up to an hour waiting for it to work but I kept a watchful eye and when it was light enough, I washed it out.  SIMPLE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT because it removed Jet Black hair color perfectly and now my hair is the Cherry Cola color I want and next I may go to a light mocha...~</li>
            <li> Using this product was a little scary and took a lot of nerve, but I did it and was proud of myself and happy with the results. My hair is more than 95% gray and keeping it brown required doing my roots every two weeks. I wanted to go lighter and needed to get the brown out first. My hair is almost shoulder length and wish I would have had two boxes to use. One box didn&#x27;t go very far, but it turned out okay in the end. My hair was pretty much light orange when I washed this product out after leaving it on for twenty minutes. This was scary. I probably could have left it on longer. I shampooed my hair three times, then conditioned it really good, rinsed with cool water for a short time and left conditioner in my hair. I blew my hair completely dry. This product did not damage my hair at all and it felt soft and healthy. I used dark ash blond haircolor and it turned out great. No brassy tones. The color is perfect.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally a dull light brown, and I wanted to make the color richer. I used a boxed hair dye kit with the intent of having slightly darker, more colorful brown hair but instead the color ended up practically black. I did some research and decided to purchase a box of Color Zap, but this was the only product similar in stock. It needs to have clearer labels, because by \\&quot;color remover\\&quot; it means bleach. After using this my hair was completely fried and a horrible copper-orange color. There was alot of breakage, and even more tears. Please, if you are reading this, leave the oage now. Do NOT buy this product unless you&#x27;re TRYING to ruin your hair.</li>
            <li> Ok, I learned my lesson years ago with bleach.  After years of bleaching and dying my hair it was soo damaged I had to cut it really short :( I have used this product a couple of times since as I still do dye my hair and have used it when I wanted to change up the color.  Sure, it is still chemical but I don&#x27;t find that it is as bad as the bleaching I used to do.  The last time I used it though, I decided to try something a bit different after having read some of the reviews.  I didn&#x27;t want it too runny so instead of water, I mixed in the powder with a conditioning treatment and voila!  Zero damage.  It removed my hair color and my hair didn&#x27;t feel like straw after!  Plus with the conditioner I didn&#x27;t have problems with it being too runny as it made more of a cream that I was able to easily apply all over my hair.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!!!! GO TO A SALON!!!!! TURNED MY HAIR ORANGE on top and spotted everywhere else.  Spent a lot of money at the salon getting it fixed.  Not even a star rating is deserved, but Amazon is forcing me to give at least one.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I had wanted. Most of the negative reviews state it made their hair orange. Here&#x27;s a wake up call for ya. It&#x27;s suppose to do that. If you had cared to read the instructions given you would of known to expect that. Second your suppose to dye your hair immediately after applying. Also stated in the instructions. Anyway this product did exactly what it was suppose to and now my naturally dark hair that I had dyed red then black is now blonde like I wanted it. The only negative thing is this severely dried out my hair. That&#x27;s to be expected since this product contains bleach. Over all I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to go lighter or back to their original hair color.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This is only bleach for $10. You&#x27;re better off buying a pack of bleach (2.99) and developer (2.99) for about $6 tops at Sallys. Personally I think COlor Oops works better to REMOVE the color (but is super damaging with a very stinky smell that lasts for DAYS)  and since this is just bleach it will turn your hair a weird color. Salon alternatives smell too. Ask anyone at Sally&#x27;s they will tell you. But this product just being bleach didn&#x27;t really have a smell that lingered, I&#x27;m used to bleaching hair so it didn&#x27;t bother me but didn&#x27;t work either. Overpriced.</li>
            <li> This stuff is basically just bleach. It was difficult to put in evenly in the first place since it was grainy and dried up extremely quickly, making it difficult to see where I had already placed it.&lt;br /&gt;I had dyed black hair and this turned it very dark brown. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I tried color oops a couple of weeks ago and it was very effective and does not contain bleach (though it sure smells awful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use this!</li>
            <li> Ok. So I have been dying my hair all shades of purple, red, black, brown, auburn...you name it I&#x27;ve done it. I&#x27;ve never touched my hair with bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally, I used Color Oops! On my hair and it was awesome. Pulled the color out, lightened it beautifully, never hurt my hair. HIGHLY recommend that. I needed to do the process again and went to Target looking for Color Oops! Couldn&#x27;t find it, picked this up as a substitute. YES it is bleach. YES in about 10 minutes it bleached the roots of my hair that was my NATURAL hair color a very pretty blonde. It lightened the rest of my hair but the instant I saw the roots I rushed to rinse it out. Yes a little lighter. HELL yea it killed my poor roots and turned them blonde. Not orange...I&#x27;ll give it that. My hair is not orange. It just didn&#x27;t come close to pulling the color out of the rest of my hair. So. Recommend? No. Color Oops! All the way. But in a pinch, if you do have to use this, definitely DON&#x27;T put it on your healthy natural hair unless you want it instantly blonde. Put it on the dyed portions of your hair - the middle and ends - and keep a close close eye on it. It&#x27;ll foam and go a little funky but keep and eye and it should be fine. I&#x27;m following it up with a Garnier Nutrisse light brown SUPER hydrating dye to try to fill in the blonde roots so I&#x27;m not totally out of military regs. :P If this doesn&#x27;t fill it in I&#x27;ll just go tomorrow and get a flat brown close to my natural color and then leave it for a while. My poor hair has been through hell the past two days. It needs a nice long break.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dyed my hair super dark brown for well over two years now. I was bored with it and wanted a change. I&#x27;ve bleached my hair before and it turned out horrible. (I used a different product) Earlier this year, I used a hair dye remover from Sally&#x27;s and was kinda so-so on the results and ended up dying my hair back to dark brown. My hair is a natural medium brown color but I wanted to attempt to go blonde. It&#x27;s the only natural color I&#x27;ve never been before. I went to a local walmart and was caught between Oops and this product. A friend has used Oops and said it worked moderately well for her. My biggest concern was if it could get out the hair color. When I bleached my hair for the first time back in 2008, not even half of my dark hair color came out. I grabbed L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s hair color remover instead of Oops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got home I went straight to the bathroom and started mixing this stuff. I wasn&#x27;t wild about how thin this product is. Not to mention, my hair is just above my shoulders and I almost didn&#x27;t have enough for my whole head. As I was applying this to my hair, it started working immediately. I left it on for about 40 to 45 minutes and washed it out and shampooed. This stuff took ALL of the dark hair dye out. My hair isn&#x27;t fried. It&#x27;s super soft and shiny. I&#x27;m highly impressed with this, despite all the bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the instructions. If you don&#x27;t want to use bleach on your hair, read the ingredients FIRST! This worked leaps and bounds better than the stuff I got at Sally Beauty Supply. I will be using this again in the future!!</li>
            <li> If you left you t18 wella toner on too long like me and some of your very light streaks ended with a blueish tint  then this product is a must!  Loreal hair color remover worked like a gem!  Follow the instructions and only leave it on for five minutes to lift the ashy tones.  Came out perfect!  No more blue just natural looking blonde.</li>
            <li> First of all I have to say that all the people bashing this product because it will turn your hair a red/orange color have obviously never had dye stripped out of their hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have dyed my hair JET BLACK many times in my life and had a salon professionally strip the dye out and it will still be a red/orangey color. Most hair dyes have reds in them which is pretty much impossible to remove. If you are thinking that a \\&quot;hair color remover\\&quot; will magically bring you back to your natural color you are mistaken because there is NO product that can do that.&lt;br /&gt;Most recently I tried to dye my hair from red to a light brown and for some reason my hair turned out super black!In lieu of all the negative reviews I gave this product a try anyways and WOW! What a fantastic job it did!&lt;br /&gt;Of course it turned my hair a nice \\&quot;carrot top\\&quot; color but I was able to dye it a light brown afterward and am very pleased an relieved. Having dye stripped out of your hair in a salon is VERY expensive.&lt;br /&gt;If you have really damaged hair already though you may want to opt for the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course this product damages your hair and makes it dry! But its no different then the box hair dyes so thats another negative people seem to complain about that does not makes sense... Any time you dye or treat your hair with a chemical it&#x27;s damaging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho. I think this product was great and I give an A++ and am thankful for not having to spend hundres of dollars (and hours) in a salon!</li>
            <li> This evening I ended up with an unsightly case of maroon roots and black ends...my misfortune in trying a new color.  In my 20+ yrs of self-coloring, this was the first time I had goofed on my roots.  Anyway, I purchased the Loreal color remover and my regular Loreal hair color and went straight home.  I have never used a color striepper before and was worried that I would trash my hair.  I followed the directions exactly, and carefully watched my hair, and the timer, as the product developed.  I thought it would take 30 mins to get out the deep violet black color, but after 20, I saw the orange and red tones and washed out.  My hair was in really good shape, considering that I just bleached the daylights out of it.  I put on my regular dye, and I&#x27;m pretty much back to normal.  I thought that it worked great, and I am glad to be back to a normal color.  If I absolutely had to, I would use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reasons I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars are: 1.  The chemicals made my eyes burn.  2.  It burned my skin, even if it was on my arm.  I had red splotches on my face, though I would clean it off ASAP.  3.  My scalp is pretty angry.</li>
            <li> The first time I was introduced to this stuff, I was 13 and had just dyed my hair black (from my normally medium brown). I was visiting my Aunt and she decided I looked way too pale and she wanted to lighten my hair up. This stuff is basically bleach, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s done as much damage to my hair as bleach has. I&#x27;ve used it a few times over the last 12 years when I&#x27;ve decided to lighten my color up a bit. BE PREPARED: This stuff is VERY WATERY, something I forgot since the last time I used it. I have almost shoulder length, kinda thick hair. One box was not nearly enough. Unless you have short, thin hair, I would get two boxes if you really want to be able to cover all of your hair evenly. You have to really make sure it&#x27;s soaked into your hair in order for it to work. I was running low on this application and the hair that got a few light swipes of remover didn&#x27;t change color much. Also, if you&#x27;re somewhat messy at dying your hair, you probably want to cover EVERYTHING cause this stuff can splash all over the place if you&#x27;re not careful. You should know that this is time consuming. To me, because it&#x27;s so watery, it takes much longer to apply than regular hair dyes. Then you have the wait time. Unless you already have light hair, the minimum waiting time on this is 20 minutes. I typically wait the full 50-60 minutes, just to make sure it&#x27;s as light as it&#x27;s going to get. Once your hair turns a nice orange shade, you&#x27;re ready to wash it out. Your hair will feel gross and dry while you&#x27;re rinsing it out, and even when you&#x27;re done shampooing it. Because the box HIGHLY recommends you have your new hair color already picked out and purchased, it does not recommend conditioning. I usually like to give my hair a 24-48 hour break between bleaching and coloring, so I use my regular conditioner and my hair returns to its normal softness. Although this product is far from perfect, I think it does a good job at what it&#x27;s supposed to do: Lightening your hair without causing major damage to your hair.</li>
            <li> So let me start off by telling you about my hair before using this product. About four years ago I had virgin hair which is naturally dark brown and went to a salon and asked for a bright wine red, i ended up with a copper brown that i didn&#x27;t like but the hairdresser didn&#x27;t want to \\&quot;damage\\&quot; my hair, or just wanted me to come back again and again for more money. Ughh. I ended up re-dying my hair at home and achieved the wine red color myself. Unfortunately, my boss didn&#x27;t like the color (I worked at an architect firm at the time), it wasn&#x27;t a professional color at all but i didn&#x27;t really care at the time. He paid for my hair to be recolored by a professional about a week later, after that I had a light blondish brown color. I still wasn&#x27;t please and decided to bleach my tips lighter which is now called \\&quot;ombre hair\\&quot;. I achieved my desired color once again. About two months later I got over the maintenance and damage from the bleach and dyed my hair JET BLACK. These past four years, I have continuously dyed my hair black on black on black on black on black. Numerous brands, semi-colors and permanent ones as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So last week I decided I wanted a dark blue hair color and knew I&#x27;d have a hard time lifting my black. I bought bleach and a hair stripper before even using this product. Did a test strand with the bleach using a 40 vol developer which everyone warns you about, left it on for an hour, did nothing! Used a color stripper, test strand did nothing. I was beginning to think i was just pretty much stuck with the black. I red reviews for this and watched tons of youtube videos regarding lightening dark hair color, this product came up continuously as well as the \\&quot;vitamin-c\\&quot; hair lightening at home process as well. I tried the vitamin-c method, and it did great lifting my newest hair, my roots, to a burgundy red without any damage but not really my bleached/black ends. I used this color remover, left it on for about an hour with a shower cap to retain the natural heat from my head and was surprised to see it come out a burgundy red as well, some areas were spotty yes but that was my fault. Your roots will turn super blonde/orange if you put this product in those areas. I tried staying away from them but I just threw it on. I dont mind the spotty hair because I plan on fixing my roots to match the ends after this product with bleach. I only have to lift to an orange color to get that dark blue I want. This product as well as any product lifting hair pigment will damage your hair, no doubt. You should do thorough research before doing your hair at home on your own. I love this product for the price. It was the only thing that worked for me. I tried the color oops as well and it didnt do as well as this product but still worked fairly well. Know what you&#x27;re getting yourself into before using this product or any product or yeah you&#x27;ll have a bad experience. Will definitely be using this product again and would definitely recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I did a test strand using this product as well and nothing happened. This product needs to be kept heated to work. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using a blow dryer to help heat this product up though or your hair might fry or fall out. Ahhh, like I said, know what you&#x27;re doing. haha. good luck!</li>
            <li> My natural hair is black and I&#x27;ve been experimenting with colors to cover my greys.  I&#x27;ve used dark brown to blonde shades (black looks too intense) but I didn&#x27;t like a color once and had to remove it.  I used &amp;#34;Color Oops&amp;#34; according to directions and it turned my whole head lion yellow (not a good look for Asians).  Since it was a weekend, I re-dyed the next day with a color I was happy with.  THEN, I thought to myself, what if I just used it to highlight portions of my hair?  I went to Walgreens but they didn&#x27;t have the Color Oops, so I bought L&#x27;Oreal instead (a brand I trust).  This time, I used only half the box (I mixed it in a bowl and used a color brush to apply), and it turned my hair a red tone which blended well with my dark to medium brown color.  Since then, I&#x27;ve been dyeing my head with the main color (cool dark brown), but, using this to create highlights (bangs, streaks on top, etc.).  I LOVE IT and it doesn&#x27;t harm my hair.  I&#x27;ve also played with the timing as well ... 10-mins. will give a slight reddish-brown, and additional 5-minute increments will increase the redness.  You can&#x27;t really see the removal process because the solution is bluish white, so you&#x27;ll have to experiment a bit with timing.  I would not leave it on more than 20-mins. but your hair might be different than mine.  So my point here is the Color Oops will give you yellow undertones, while L&#x27;Oreal will give you red undertones.  I try to condition my hair at least 2X a week to keep it healthy and switched shampoos that help the scalp rather than the hair.  I&#x27;m extremely happy that I can play with the hair remover treatment and not ruin my hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, but it does the job. I have used this multiple times now when getting ready for a new color to remove the old one. It does not, and is not meant to, leave an acceptable color behind - it will be yellow, orange, or reddish depending on the color you started with. It will be ready for a new color as long as it is light brown or darker. If you are going for a blonde or a vibrant color that requires bleached hair, you will have to bleach your hair after using this before re-coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I have no complaints. After 4 uses, it has consistently stripped my hair and made it ready to take new color.</li>
            <li> I have used Color Oops! recently to remove the strawberry blonde hair dye I use regularly so I can dye portions of it pink. It works like a charm, *occasionally* I have to use bleach to get it a little bit lighter but prefer to use a dye remover first. I went to the store and they didn&#x27;t have Color Oops, so I bought this thinking it was a similar product. Luckily, I read the ingredients before using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BLEACH BLEACH BLEACH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention that this product is bleach? I am going to need bleach tonight, so it&#x27;s not like this isn&#x27;t getting used, but I have to go back out to the store to get Color Oops first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, if you want to claim that \\&quot;any\\&quot; product will do the same thing to your hair as bleach, here are the ingredients of Color Oops:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part 1 - Deinonized Water, Hydrosulfite, Fragrance, Polysorbate - 80, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Cocamidopropylhydroxysultaine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part 2 - Deionized Water, Citric Acid, Cocamidopropylhydroxysultaine, Xantham Gum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And these are the ingredients in L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s \\&quot;Hair Color Remover:\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haircolor Remover Powder: Sodium Persulfate, Potassium Persulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Strontium Peroxide, Sodium Metasilicate, Ammonium Chloride, Cellulose Gum, Diethylhexyl Sodium Sulfosuccinate, Edta, Ci 77007/ Ultramarines, Sodium Benzoate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haircolor Remover Developer: Aqua/Water/Eau, Hydrogen Peroxide, Pentasodium Pentetate, Sodium Stannate, Tetrasodium Pyrophosphate, Phosphoric Acid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a regular old bleach powder and developer, which is fine, just call it what it is.</li>
            <li> I have used this product several times to remove color. It has always worked well on my hair, without leaving my hair feeling damaged. Just be prepared to color your after using this treatment.</li>
            <li> This product worked exactly as expected. I have auburn hair and dyed it natural medium brunette, which turned out black. Immediately after my hair was dry I bought this product and used it. I only left it on for 5-10 minutes and my hair was a yellow-orange straw color so I went ahead and rinsed it out. I was able to re-dye my hair its natural color right after using this, and with a deep conditioning treatment, my hair is pretty much as healthy and the same color as it was before the initial dye job.</li>
            <li> My hair was three different shades as I have been dying my hair at home for the past year.  I had a build up that was almost black at the sides and ends of my hair.  I did the strand test to determine the amount of time just using the darkest hair.  I used the remover on the heavy buildup, on the ends and left it for 35 mins, the end result was an orange color.  I then dyed my hair using 10 lifter(?) mixed with my usual medium brown color, applied it to the \\&quot;orange\\&quot; and left it for 35 mins then for the last 5 mins I pulled the color through the hair.  I have to say that I wasn&#x27;t expecting much however, my hair looks fantastic!  I have an even all over color for the first time in a year.  I am very, very impressed with this product.  Don&#x27;t rub into your scalp, and do not apply to new roots.  I am thrilled as my hair really has an even natural color.  I followed the \\&quot;colorist tip\\&quot; and it worked great.</li>
            <li> I am a natural strawberry blonde, I  usually maintain the color with L&#x27;Oréal light reddish blonde, since i noticed grays creeping in, so during the winter I decided to go darker with a light Auburn, when spring came I wanted to learn lighten so I bought this, followed instructions and i came out blonde not far from platinum, i used my L&#x27;Oréal light reddish blonde and was good to go. Just like with most hair dye products if you have long or thick hair by two boxes don&#x27;t be cheap. If you have any hair color left in bottle mix with 50% water and work it into your hair when your lathering up to  rinse out  the dye, it gives your hair extra shine. Always put conditioner on your ends before coloring, and super condition after you color. You might save a few bucks buying clairol or revlon the cheap under $5 you get what you pay  for. I use L&#x27;Oréal from start to finish, never had dried out hair, my hair comes out soft and shiney every time and color is always true to box. Get a good boar brush, don&#x27;t shampoo for several days prior to coloring, shampoo will strip hair of natural protection. Just brush thoroughly with boar brush and color, and there is no need to shampoo everyday. Only time growing your hair out will restore your natural color. Seriously read all directions on the color remover, it works if you can follow instructions not a miracle worker though.  Spend a few extra dollars avoid bargain bin hair color.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to the word. I did NOT take out much of my hair color. In fact my hair is still pretty black with splotches of reddish brown and it was really uneven. The thing did not smell good at all. it left my hair feeling really nasty and ugly and I know that I&#x27;m going to have to do it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this yesterday after a botched-up hair coloring incident. My hair color is naturally medium to dark brown, but lately it&#x27;s been getting darker &amp; darker because I can never seem to pick the correct color from the box. I decided to buy a lighter brown to fix what has been happening, not realizing the lighter (medium) brown would not affect the darkness on the ends of my hair. So I wound up with what is called &amp;#34;hot roots&amp;#34; apparently --- my roots came out medium/reddish brown, but the rest of my hair stayed dark brown/black. I went to Walgreens totally resigned to buying the dark, dark color to match the rest of my hair, when I saw this box of haircolor remover. I figured it was worth a try --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I got home, I started looking at these reviews and began to question whether or not I wanted to go through with it. In the end, I decided my hair is pretty healthy, no damage other than the fact that I color it, and I would go for it with a few minor adjustments. At the suggestion of other reviewers, I decided not to use the entire bottle of peroxide. I poured half of it down the sink &amp; replaced it with warm tap water mixed with a couple squirts of conditioner. I mixed that up and poured it into the powder bottle. The resulting concoction was a lavender runny soup consistency, so not exactly easy to apply in one-inch sections. But I tried to apply the liquid to ends first, working up. I stopped as I got closer to my roots, which I already knew would take the updated color. The smell of the liquid was horrible, by the way, but pretty much expected, since it&#x27;s basically straight bleach. I kept the solution on for 25 minutes, based on the chart that was included. I have pretty dark hair that&#x27;s been colored frequently. The chart said to keep on for 20-60 minutes -- I probably should&#x27;ve kept it on for 10 minutes longer, but I didn&#x27;t want to push my luck, just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shampooed the solution out, which wasn&#x27;t that easy to do since it made my hair kind of rough &amp; tangle-y (sp?). I dumped tons of conditioner on my head &amp; let it sit for a minute, then rinsed again. When I towel-dried, I saw my roots were an orangey-red, and splotchy in areas. So that made me a little nervous, but I pushed on. I sprayed a ton of leave-in conditioner before blow-drying. May hair became slightly less orangey when it was dry. But I could tell my ends were no longer black, so that was good. Per the instructions, I then followed up immediately by applying a new permanent color, which was the medium brown I was originally going for. I followed through with that entire process, then rinsed. I again added a ton of conditioner, then rinsed again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now happy to report that my hair is a uniform medium brown color. I no longer have hot roots or orangey-red splotches. So for me, this product worked exactly as intended. I probably could&#x27;ve used the entire bottle of peroxide, and potentially could&#x27;ve kept the solution on a little bit longer. My ends are still a tad darker than the new roots, but you can&#x27;t really tell unless you are totally scrutinizing. I&#x27;m happy with the product and would use it again if I find myself in the same predicament in the future.e my hair kind of rough &amp; tangle-y (sp?).

            <li> hair situation: my hair is naturally chestnut brown. I died it numerous times to a dark red red (almost ariana grande red). when i was sick of that color i let it fade and died it a chocolate brown and that didnt cover all the red. so a week later a redied it the same color and the red still stuck. my hair was a almost black dark red? (i dont even know but i HATED it) so about a month later (today) i was finally fed up with this nasty red brown mix and decided to try this. it stripped the color leaving it a light copper/brownish color. i am satisfied but plan on recoloring to a lighter color.&lt;br /&gt;i dont feel it damaged my hair completely, however, this is what i did:&lt;br /&gt;- I applied it (so incorrectly but it is hard to apply in my opinion yet it still worked)&lt;br /&gt;- it started to turn my roots a blonde (which it does say not to color new hair, oops) so i got nervous and hopped in the shower after maybe 20 mins&lt;br /&gt;- i washed once with mane &amp; tail shampoo and then again with a moisture shampoo&lt;br /&gt;- then i put on a hair mask for about 5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;over all, i am satisfied because it lighten my almost black dark red hair.</li>
            <li> should have ordered 2 which surprised me. According to loreal products this was enough to cover long hair. I have shoulder length hair and my daughter had to drop everything to go bye another, also the red in my hair  did not come out, it got lighter but not by much. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is my first time &amp;#34;bleaching&amp;#34; my hair. My locks were far too dark and I wanted to go lighter for this spring. This seemedf like an effective, affordable solution from my usual hair dye brand. It says not to get it on your roots, so I did my best not too. My hair was nearly black. Here&#x27;s what happened:&lt;br /&gt;I did the test strands (two seperate chunks even), those turned out perfect...it didnt get rid of the color but did lighten it ALOT. Perfect I thought.&lt;br /&gt;I put this gunk on my hair, avoiding my roots as much as I can, waited the 50 minutes I did for my test strands.&lt;br /&gt;The left side of my hair resulted in bleached roots...which is, whatever but it DIDN&amp;#34;T FADE THE HAIR DYE AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;The right side? Also bleached roots, with one giant spot that was bleached liek all the way and a few bright orange spots (too be expected. I could live with fixing orange.)&lt;br /&gt;Then I dyed my hair a light brown (it says to dye your hair right away). I knew it wouldnt lighten the still dark parts but I thought it would at the very least tone down the bleached blonde roots, so it was obnoxious. Once again I was wrong. Waste of money and time...and to top it all off, now I have to go get my hair fixed.</li>
            <li> Everyone listen....do not buy....it will leave the lightest of hair orange.  Nothing but a small amount of bleach...barely covered mine &amp; I have short hair. It will fry your hair....and is not worth the high price...I paid $12.99...for what??  More problems then before....warning....save your money.....you will regret buying this. Belongs in a trash heap....destroyed my hair and I ended up with a carrot top!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. Nothing like color oops. It&#x27;s just a strong bleach. If you did buy this and want to use this product anyways I STRONGLY recommend doing a strand test first. I&#x27;m glad I did or I would&#x27;ve burned my hair! Now idk what to do with the rest of it!</li>
            <li> First off, I read all the directions, it did indeed strip the black out of my hair, along with everything else! My hair is so damaged now. Also, I dyed my hair the same night and the color was no where near what it should have been, and the orange was still all over my hair. I looked like a freaking clown. The hair dresser at the salon couldn&#x27;t stop shaking her head and saying OMG when I went to her for help! She said this is a really bad product. Save your money, time, and hair and just go professional the first time!</li>
            <li> My situation is very similar to other users. I&#x27;ve used the Oops! Before and it worked very well. Saw this and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot after wanting to go lighter brown and my hair ended up looking the same but with a very red tint.&lt;br /&gt;It needs to be highlighted ON THE FRONT OF THE BOX THAT IT DOES NOT return your hair to normal color. After ten minutes I noticed a copperry orange and thought it was just temporary before I rinsed. Nope. My hair is now coppery orange.&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, on the VERY top of directions within the box it does say that it doesn&#x27;t return your hair to natural color. My fault for not reading, but still... I was too trusting just as I was with the Oops!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this will benefit anyone with dark brown hair. Waste of ten bucks, going to a professional this week praying she can fix it. It looks awful!!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t get into all the details of my hair color, etc. My biggest issue with this product is that it&#x27;s name is completely and totally misleading!! It is NOT a hair color &amp;#34;REMOVER.&amp;#34;  It is a hair color LIGHTENER!  It contains ammonia and peroxide.  It is NOT like OOPS which simply removes the most recent colors you have applied to your hair. This product will turn your hair anywhere ranging from tiger orange to light yellowy orange and usually a combination of them. Unless you are someone familiar with product ingredients, it is not until you get home and are able to read the instructions that you find out that the product is not what the name implies. The product DOES basically do what it says it will do in the instructions, but I think it is very misleading to customers to call it a hair color remover. Secondly, there are no warnings or suggestions on the box about the fact that one box only contains enough product for very short hair. Again, it isn&#x27;t until you open the box and mix the product that you find this out. I have very thick, bra strap length hair and 3-4 bottles minimal should have been used. Thirdly, it is impossible to apply the product the way the instructions state. The product has a consistency not much thicker than water, and without help, you basically just have to work it through your hair using your gloved hands. And you will definitely be covered in product and have a mess on the floor around you.  Additionally, the product if used AS DIRECTED leaves your hair a frizzy, dry, brittle consistency, although it IS slightly less harsh than bleach.  Almost every positive review I&#x27;ve read recommends using the product differently than per the instructions. I have read at least 15 different ways on here to use the product other than as instructed. To sum up, using this product is like rolling dice...everyone gets a different result and YOU will get a different result with every use. If you DO want to lighten your hair, you are much better off just using bleach to be able to apply evenly and get a consistent outcome. If you want a TRUE hair color REMOVER, this is NOT the product for you. I highly recommend OOPS as a remover.ust using bleach to be able to apply evenly and get a consistent outcome. If you want a TRUE hair color REMOVER, this is NOT the product for you. I highly recommend OOPS as a remover.</li>
            <li> I use this to lighten my hair. It doesn&#x27;t cause damage like bleach.  I put red henna over it after washing it out.</li>
            <li> I am 73 years old and have white hair. White hair bugged me and made me look \\&quot;old\\&quot;.  Clerks at the store started calling me \\&quot;dear\\&quot; and \\&quot;sweetie\\&quot; and generally treating me like I was 100. I decided to color my hair dark blond, which turned out kind of reddish brown.  I had to change my makeup to go with a redhead color.  Several months later I got tired of the white hair showing in the back and even after touching it up, it always looked lighter and made me look pitiful. I bought the L&#x27;Oreal hair color remover, put it all over my short hair and about 20 minutes later rinsed and shampooed it out.  I was shocked! The hair was an even Marilyn Monroe flaxen blond and looked fabulous!  My husband almost had an attack when he saw me as I no longer look like my \\&quot;old\\&quot; self.  It looks really cute!  I had bought a light blond dye to redye as recommended, but no way would I use it now as my hair is a great color. I am changing my makeup to a more pastel look and the total effect is young and fresh.  My hair is not damaged at all and is silky and shiny.  The product is very thin and you must spend enough time shaking it up to mix the two ingredients or the blue powder tends to stick to the bottom of the container.  It worked for me.</li>
            <li> I have dyed my hair jet black. My hair is long a bit past the shoulders. I tested my hair strand before placing this product in my hair.It worked very well!! It turned it to a brown orange color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works best when it is drenched in it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used one bottle on my hair, it barely lightened it but some parts turned brown like it did on the hair strand test because it was more drenched in the product than the other strands. One bottle is not enough for long hair. Two is required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For long hair that is close or past the shoulders, use two bottles. I really wish I bought two instead of one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works perfectly like it described.</li>
            <li> After coloring my hair for 17+ years various shades of red, I finally chose a horrible shade that made me look awful.  The following day, after wearing a hat all day, I picked up this hair color remover as well as a shade of red that I knew was safe.  After getting home I immediately opened the box, followed the instructions, and started applying it to my hair.  My only complaint was that there is not enough product in one box.  I do have long thick hair but I have never had to buy two boxes of color and it didn&#x27;t even cross my mind that I would have to buy two boxes of hair color remover.  If my hair was 1-2\\&quot; longer, it would have definitely required an additional box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the remover did its job.  It does not spread easily once it is on the hair.  Make sure to avoid the colored roots until last.  The product also gets warm to the touch in about 10 minutes.  I left the product on my hair for a full hour, shampooed, and rinsed.  Since I was getting red out of my hair, my hair was left a cartoon orange/yellow (which was what I expected).  After the hair was completely dry I put the new color on and everything went superb after that.  The new color was perfect and there was no leftover color from the previous bad decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully will not need to use this again, but I will if necessary.</li>
