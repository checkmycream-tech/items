            <li>These plates are of course very famous and popular, and I love them too.</li>

            <li>The images stamp very nice and clean.</li>
            <li>but since there&#x27;s no guaranty the new set would be flawless...</li>
            <li>happy with all the designs, theres a lot of them, good quality, fast delivery</li>

            <li>These r the best plates I have come by so far.</li>
            <li>So many amazing images to choose from.</li>
            <li>These plates are one of the better plate sets I own.</li>
            <li>They stamp beautifully and they are elegant and fun designs.</li>
            <li>Great fun for my daughter.</li>
            <li>Really nicely etched plates cute designs</li>
            <li>They stamp clear and transfer on to nails wonderfully.</li>
            <li>So far these plates are awesome.</li>
            <li>So nice and love how it comes with a case.</li>
            <li>Another of my nail plates that is very good, and the designs come out very clean and crisp.  </li>
            <li>But this set has very nice full nail designs, prettier than most.  </li>
            <li>but they are all very nice and useful.</li>
            <li>I was able to stamp crisp, beautiful images.</li>
            <li>After using this set, I can say that the quality is wonderful and the variety of images is fresh and fun.  </li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of the Pueen plates at all, and I must say, I am SUPER IMPRESSED.</li>
            <li>I bought the first set of Pueen plates &amp; was not too happy with them, and hesitated on buying these.</li>
            <li>(I have the first generation Winstonia as well as Pueen Plate 1-25) and I was so happy because I have medium-long nails</li>
            <li>quick shipping as well!!</li>
            <li>brands of image plates and some images will work well, others won&#x27;t work at all, and some will transfer onto the nail very lightly.</li>
            <li>Really liked the stamping plates, as a beginner, they are really easy to use.</li>
            <li>in all good quality plates, pretty images and a nice case.</li>
            <li>They came early which was great, and I just love these!</li>
            <li>Most of the images work well</li>
            <li>However, since it doesn&#x27;t cover 100% of the plate and more than just the edge is exposed; I&#x27;m concerned the exposed portion can/will scratch another plate easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I love the cute designs on these plates :)</li>
            <li>For the price they are even better.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic quality!</li>

            <li>I use plastic razor blades for scraping because the metal one I have seems to scratch these more than the Konad plates.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure about how these would be</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m greatly pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love this set.</li>
            <li>Love all the designs.</li>
            <li>They love them</li>
            <li>There are so many design choices.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with my collection.  </li>
            <li>The images with larger voids scrape better with a metal scraper otherwise an expired gift card works best for me.</li>
            <li>Use the templates and got so many compliments on my nails.</li>
            <li>The one I am most concerned about is pueen 47.</li>
            <li>Be sure to measure your nail beds before ordering.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;These plates were easy to use when paired with Konad nail stamper and scraper.</li>
            <li>Price was good, shipping time minimal, case is a good idea.</li>
            <li>The set is full of great, fun, and sophisticated designs, which are very well executed.</li>
            <li>and I like that most of the images are for full nails</li>
            <li>There are so many \\&quot;full nail\\</li>
            <li>Who would have thought I could have such beautiful nail designs done at home.</li>
            <li>I really liked all the images and having bought the first set of Pueen plates I didn&#x27;t think there would be any issues with the quality.</li>
            <li>The patterns stamp clean and there are a variety of patterns ranging from light hearted to elegant.  </li>
            <li>so I stamp the top first, then pick up more of the image a stamp the tip.</li>
            <li>Some of the stamps are to fine</li>
            <li>The details are so fine</li>
            <li>The images stamp perfectly fine</li>

            <li>The heart collection is impressive but it also has a little bit of everything,the majority is hearts so .</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect for little finger</li>
            <li>These fit my nails quite well, they are a smidgen wider than the Konad plates and that makes all the difference.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using it...</li>
            <li>I am still learning but cant wait to try all the fabulous stamp art.  </li>
            <li>I really like the variety of the designs and the handy case.</li>
            <li>Picking up the image with any stamper is a breeze and they clean easily.  </li>
            <li>I also ordered the Konad double stamper, which works great.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so great, I actually got another friend to buy this one.</li>
            <li>so once both of them were available (1-49)</li>
            <li>and they definitely work great.</li>
            <li>I wasted sooooo much money!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>They are a great value for the price and will last forever.</li>
            <li>Not a paper box stating it was a case but a real leather case with each plate is inside its own sheet protector.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved them and I would totally buy more plates from this company...</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a good stamper, and I don&#x27;t recommend one that needs to be primed or filed, especially if you&#x27;ve never done it before.</li>
            <li>Havent use a ton of the stamps yet, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>I have loved all the ones I have tried so far</li>
            <li>, I love most of the designs and they stamp very well.</li>
            <li>These image plates have a lot of beautiful designs,  Their whimsy and romantic style is for far more than just Valentines day!</li>
            <li>I was right :).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice large sized full nail stamps.</li>
            <li>and I have found a few creative ways to make beautiful nails with this set.</li>
            <li>My new favorite thing!</li>
            <li>I mostly got this set because it&#x27;s very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>threw these out after purchasing a Konad set (and new scrapper/stamper set) and finally got a perfect result!</li>
            <li>and it works great; the double ended transfer tool is super helpful.</li>
            <li>This pack is better than the first pack of Pueen.</li>
            <li>and I excited to add them to my collection.</li>
            <li>Such a nice product!  </li>
            <li>I love this set, the images are all so pretty and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any defects</li>
            <li>This is the first set of stamp stamping plates that I brought and I absolutely love them</li>
            <li>My \\&quot;gold standard\\&quot; stamping polish is A-England Excalibur (the original version) when testing plates.</li>
            <li>The full size images will fit even the largest of nail beds.</li>
            <li>These are really unique plates that I have not seen anywhere else</li>
            <li>but this is a fun way to start!</li>
            <li>This is a great way to get really distinct looks in your nails without really doing that much work.</li>
            <li>Nice WIDE images which I love!</li>
            <li>I am always looking for new plate sets, and this one is nice.  </li>
            <li>It has a lot of different designs and most of them are nice.</li>
            <li>It is a nice set, but many plates were scratched before they placed the blue plastic.</li>
            <li>Not as clean of an image sometimes</li>
            <li>They clean well and transfer well.</li>
            <li>other images I tried stamped beautifully</li>
            <li>I am new to stamping and these are so much fun to use!!!  </li>
            <li>For the first time someone packaged some plates in a super cute leather like case where you can pull out each of the plates and show them before deciding which one you want to use.</li>
            <li>This would be a really nice set of love and romance designs but more than half the plates arrived scratched.</li>
            <li>so I haven’t had the need to by any type of special nail polish for this.</li>
            <li>I love that these plates have large designs and a lot of variety.</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift and loved that it came in its own little snap case!</li>
            <li>These designs are definitely the best ones out of the major brands that I already have.</li>
            <li>I have used them with the special nail stamping polish and regular nail polish and has work really good.</li>
            <li>This second set works great just like the first.</li>
            <li>Good designs and crisp, clear images.</li>
            <li>Every transfer seems nice and clear.</li>
            <li>Cannot say enough good things, want to buy the rest of everything they have put out!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The images are etched very well, and the designs are interesting and varied.</li>
            <li>I love the variety of patterns included here, and the plates hold up very well to repeated use.  </li>
            <li>I like the variety of designs in this collection, very feminine and cute.</li>
            <li>there is so much variety that it will take a while for me to use all the images :)</li>
            <li>Just scrape lighter on the images with more flooded areas to prevent scraping too much polish from the image.  </li>
            <li>I like the designs and the full nail designs</li>
            <li>I use the pueen plastic scraper or any old gift card will also do the trick nicely.</li>
            <li>the plates are sweet.</li>
            <li>the price this product is not bad but expect some not to work.</li>
            <li>Pueen really built on their strengths of their first set, and improved their techniques and style to deliver a great new set.</li>
            <li>Plate 43 was off center ,but, after contacting the seller they shipped me a new one with no muss or fuss Very happy.</li>
            <li>I can easily say that this brand has become my favorite as far as stamping plates</li>
            <li>/&gt;The plates are made of a nice metal and comes covered in blue cellophane, which came off easily.  </li>
            <li>When I ordered it, mine even came with a free case which was really nice and better than what other companies offer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real bonus that they came in a nice leather case with a large snap holding it together.</li>
            <li>With so many different brands out, I wasn&#x27;t sure which to buy.  </li>
            <li>I have several stamping plate sets -- BM, Red Angel, Mash &amp; Winstonia -- and while I like them as well, these Pueen plates are the best out of all of them.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping also.</li>
            <li>I got them quickly.</li>
            <li>This is my second full set of stamping plates (I started out buying singles till I was sure I could do it) and I look forward to many fun manicures ahead.</li>
            <li>The polish you use has to be just right for a good visible application because the imprint of the designs are not very deep.</li>
            <li>Came very fast, images pick up well..easy to use!</li>
            <li>Very cute, durable, has the backing so no possible cuts.</li>
            <li>The designs are very pretty on each and every plate.</li>
            <li>These plates are good for long nails.</li>
            <li>if/when they have more new plates.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more as soon as new ones are offered.</li>
            <li>There are so many cute desins, I will be experimenting for a long time</li>
            <li>so Much I bought 1 of Each Set!!</li>
            <li>They have nice crisp lines and actually do fit my finger except for my middle finger and thumb</li>
            <li>I would recommend these for anyone who loves to have pretty nails!</li>
            <li>Also, they are really pretty and original.</li>
            <li>The images are unique and crisp.</li>
            <li>I got a white case of course, my favorite color!</li>
            <li>Came in a cute vinyl case with clear sachets for each of the plates!</li>
            <li>There is a nice wide range of styles in the set, and the full nail designs measure in at 1.5 x 2 cm, so will fit a lot of nails (</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more Pueen plates!</li>
            <li>Lots of different and cute designs!</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s a lot of new images in this set, some are very unique and cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the white leatherette case was a super nice touch, trying to figure out if I have a use for it, since I keep my plates in a plate holder book.</li>
            <li>I tested all the plates, about 2-3 images per plate and they stamped clean and crisp.  </li>
            <li>The images come out crisp and clean everytime.</li>
            <li>The stamps are highly detailed with large images.  </li>
            <li>Decent stamp set, not the most crisp designs when transferring.</li>
            <li>I would recommend watching you tube tutorials first and googling which polishes will work, or ordering special stamping polishes.</li>
            <li>but I do have wider nail beds so it will be more than large enough for most people.</li>
            <li>Great image sizes that are big enough to fit my thumb nail.  </li>
            <li>The images are fantastic and stamp really well.  </li>
            <li>Overall Amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure I want to give this in a basket of nail products to my 22 year old niece.</li>
            <li>I use a konad stamper and the design comes out clear :)</li>
            <li>Takes a bit of getting used to, but makes really fun designs.</li>
            <li>So far pueen seems to be my favorite brand of stamp plates.</li>
            <li>They are not thin and flimsy like others I have and they work the best with the least amount of effort.  </li>
            <li>This nail art is fun for all</li>
            <li>I just got my pueen set and one of my plate was bent but love the plate they come out clear.</li>
            <li>so much fun to use.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re nice and from what I tried last night, they work well.  </li>
            <li>This was a really fun collection.  </li>
            <li>and I own all the plates by all the different makers.</li>
            <li>but, just a fair warning, be careful with the edges.</li>
            <li>You can see this in the picture, but it doesn&#x27;t come with any french tip designs which I would have liked.</li>
            <li>Having so much fun decorating my nails.</li>
            <li>In addition to the plates, they come with a nice pouch with sleeves for each individual plate.</li>
            <li>So exciting.</li>
            <li>There is also a large variety of unique designs.</li>
            <li>I have many stamping plates and this is a great product, with images bigger than other plates, designs very crispy and original.</li>
            <li>These came in pretty quick, I had no problems with scratches on the plates or anything like that.</li>
            <li>I really was excited to get these.</li>
            <li>It is taking a lot of patience and practice to get it right.  </li>
            <li>I jumped right one</li>
            <li>right away-</li>
            <li>They arrived very quickly in the new case by Pueen.</li>
            <li>I am new to stamping and these plates are so easy to use.</li>
            <li>and I have received two 36 plates and none 33, but it is ok in general.</li>
            <li>So be aware this may happen to you as well and decide if its worth it to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the cute little case they came in as well.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t even pick up or it was super patchy and didn&#x27;t catch the whole design.</li>
            <li>this keeps the designs clear and easy to decide which ones to use.  </li>
            <li>and, when I tested them out, they fit better than I expected</li>
            <li>I got this set super fast with the prime shipping.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to pretty much to cover my nail beds and look professional.</li>
            <li>I want to give a higher rating because the designs look great, but I had quite a few plates that were really scratched up.</li>
            <li>I watched several you tube videos, and was able to pick it up right away.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>I like the plates very much.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>They need to be used with a high quality nail stamping paint, I use konad special paint.</li>
            <li>The Images come off CLEAN CRISP AND CLEAR!!</li>
            <li>Great designs, although I have a hard time with the case, it&#x27;s not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>Love the designs, and so far everything comes out very clear!</li>
            <li>The scratches were evident before the protective film was removed.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Fast service!</li>
            <li>All of the designs stamp very well!</li>
            <li>This is definitely the set I reach for most often.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more from this seller.</li>
            <li>Love he different designs..</li>
            <li>and these are the first plates i bought</li>
            <li>Love them , I can only recommend them.</li>
            <li>but I was only able to get one out of each plate to work.</li>
            <li>Will be looking forward to more plates from Pueen in the future.</li>
            <li>or if you are willing to take the time to learn.  </li>
            <li>and am overall satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I cleaned them both with acetone remover and got the image transfered on my second try on the Stamper and on the nail, just need some more practice.</li>
            <li>The stamp that goes with this, broke on the first use</li>
            <li>This was my first from Pureen</li>
            <li>First the caveat.</li>
            <li>, they work pretty well</li>
            <li>They came in this cute book-style case with individual plastic sleeves</li>
            <li>I love American Apparel.</li>
            <li>Some polishes definitely work better than others.  </li>
            <li>It does take a bit of practice but it is not difficult to get started.</li>
            <li>n crisp.</li>
            <li>I have the first set of pueen plates as well.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying nail stamping</li>
            <li>With these, all of the designs are crisp while keeping some level of intricacy where needed.</li>
            <li>those of us with bigger thumbs often have to get creative, but it&#x27;s easier with these).</li>
            <li>All of my plates are etched perfectly - deep enough but not too deep, and many are now my most favorite and most-used plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was pleasing to the eyes for the fact that the presentation is so pretty.</li>
            <li>My first stamping set</li>
            <li>For a first time user I had to get the hang of it</li>
            <li>but if you use a higher end or stamping polish you wont even know.</li>
            <li>because they are small enough to fit on the stamp, and the nail, it&#x27;s a great beginner set for this reason.  </li>
            <li>Love the little booklet holder the plates fit into.</li>
            <li>Just as good as more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>Yellow rusty stuff on white pleather or leather just isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li>I love this set so much, I have even decided to do my nails myself next summer for my wedding along with my maid of honor and bridesmaids.</li>
            <li>I love that they are larger than average &amp; cover my large nails nicely.</li>
            <li>I really like them, and have found that the designs are, on the whole, the right size for my nails.  </li>
            <li>There is a nice range of very feminine styles, from floral lace to butterflies and other stuff like that.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and product was exactly as stated</li>
            <li>Loved the price but stamps don&#x27;t come out clearly and some don&#x27;t work at all not a consistent product all the time</li>
            <li>I got a nice pink storage case which I&#x27;m glad came as a bonus because I don&#x27;t have a case for any of my other plates yet.  </li>
            <li>Love the case will keep for a long time!</li>
            <li>Purchased it with  PUEEN Nail Art Super Soft Squishy Silicone Stamper it came in one week.</li>
            <li>but she is super busy and our schedules dont work.  </li>
            <li>Ten (10)plates were scratched but I&#x27;m hoping they will take it back and give an undamaged product because the designs are very cute</li>
            <li>You can easily to all nails the same with these, for this reason.  </li>
            <li>I think these plates are cool and had lots of fun designs - even holiday specific!</li>
            <li>Prefer them over Konad in quality and in price.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus, they come in a cute little case and shipping is quick.</li>
            <li>The full nail designs are big enough to fit my thumbs (yay!)</li>
            <li>The case I got was white and it was perfectly fine</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re going to need a pretty decent quality stamper, which I bought separately from Amazon.</li>
            <li>They stamp well and come in their own little organizer.</li>
            <li>but the price is pretty high.</li>
            <li>The full nail designs are large but they do not have the moon shape at the bottom for French tips like their first set.</li>
            <li>but I am intelligent enough to figure this out with the help of a few tutorials.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s recommends returning the whole thing.  </li>
            <li>you haven&#x27;t really looked at the designs on the stamp, you should.  </li>
            <li>Very comparable to Konad plates for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>the sleeves are very flimsy and stick together...</li>
            <li>With all the heart, stars and butterflies, it&#x27;s very feminine.</li>
            <li>I really recommend.</li>
            <li>I really like this set.</li>
            <li>really didn&#x27;t know much about stamping</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these for anyone collecting stamping plates!</li>
            <li>I am looking very forward to start decorating nails with them.</li>
            <li>They work just as well as the Konad brand and are much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, well packaged.  </li>
            <li>For the price you really can&#x27;t beat them</li>
            <li>The designs all work very</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them for any nail art lover!</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>They work very well</li>
            <li>and I really like the designs.</li>
            <li>and they worked very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>thanks 👌</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li>but how ironic my mermaid plate won&#x27;t stamp.</li>
            <li>Works really well, just took about an hour of practice before I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li>They stamp very well.</li>
            <li>Just do it really fast or</li>
            <li>and she really likes the diversity of the stamping options.</li>
            <li>Some of the images do not transfer very well</li>
            <li>These plates are working very well, the images came out neatly.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li>I had some Konad stamping plates and didn&#x27;t like them that much, they just didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shipping time was reasonable, ordered on 8th May and received on 14th May.</li>
            <li>These make some pretty fun designs and totally worth it as long as you have some patience!</li>
            <li>I am new in stamping nail art, and this set is the first for me.</li>
            <li>so you are sure not to get duplicates from other kits/manufacturers.</li>
            <li>Although this set is more feminine than the other one.</li>
            <li>the size of the designs is wonderful whereas other companies are very small and don&#x27;t cover the whole nail.  </li>
            <li>Other than that there are so many designs on this plate for your heart&#x27;s desires.</li>
            <li>but once we got it down we were able to finish each hand in under 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Love the plates but edges are very sharp..</li>
            <li>I used one plate for my Independence Day manicure and plan on using several more for future nail designs.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more in the future!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more image plates from this brand in the future.</li>
            <li>Delicate images that stamp flawlessly for everyday nail art...</li>
            <li>Overall my daughter enjoyed this product and now has a different technique of doing nail art.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality nail stamping plate kit.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations on this product, when I tried to do the transfer from the plates to the nail, the nail polish didn&#x27;t stick at all on the plates or the rubber stamp.</li>
            <li>I oove this brand and all the designs I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>You get high quality plates and a protective case to hold your plates in.</li>
            <li>I love the little case these come with.</li>
            <li>so just be a little more</li>
            <li>I love the little leather case it comes with</li>
            <li>so if your looking for cute little designs this is not the collection for you.</li>
            <li>The little case it comes in is really cute.</li>
            <li>But I will say my MASH set stamps a little better.</li>
            <li>The protective film coating removed easily - easier than other brands.</li>
            <li>I had a hard time picking an image, lot of nice designs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wish there were more hearts and stars and animal print, but they have other sets!!</li>
            <li>have tried out 3 different plates so far, and I have to say the quality is MUCH better than the Shany or Red Angel plates.</li>
            <li>Took awhile to get the hang of it, but after watching a few videos on youtube and some practice I love it.</li>
            <li>It definitely takes a lot of practice to get the transfer process just right though.  </li>
            <li>They are large enough to cover my whole nail.</li>
            <li>Pueen images are large enough to cover your whole nail.</li>
            <li>After a little research and more trail and error, I discovered that these discs are just not the quality needed to get a clear stamp on the nail.</li>
            <li>They transfer to the nail quite well and have a wide variety of unique designs.</li>
            <li>The images are unique and not the same typical designs you find from one set to the next; 2) They are full size designs, meaning they don&#x27;t have the curved french tip built into them, which also means they fit longer nails; and 3)</li>
            <li>plates are beautiful as always the only reason I am giving a lower review is 4 of them were scratched through the designs, visibly enough to show up after removing the blue film and one was dented luckily not in on image.</li>
            <li>I am brand new to stamping.</li>
            <li>much exited I was to receive this purchase, and it did not let me down, thank you Pueen and Amazon, definitely going to extend my collection of plates.  : )</li>
            <li>I only had a few of other brands that cost much more and wasn&#x27;t sure the transfer would be good,but it does nicely..🎀</li>
            <li>I got this set specifically for one of the star designs, its hard to use the other plates in this set and my other plates I own because I just love the stars so much!</li>
            <li>Most of the images are wide enough to just cover my nails</li>
            <li>The images transfer very clearly and the plates are well made.</li>
            <li>When I finally gathered enough courage to get it I had to wait,even further because only this set was available (and not the one I originally wanted)</li>
            <li>Boy was I surprised!  </li>
            <li>and I love the small case.</li>
            <li>Such pretty design, will be ordering newer items.</li>
            <li>One of the plates the first one had a deep scrape across it</li>
            <li>They much preferred the little pictures to the full nail decorations and the pictures are the ones that I have the hardest time with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Stamps very clear cut deep enough for full detail even the tiniest detail works well.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and order is as expected.</li>
            <li>As stubborn as I am, I decided not to purchase the nail polish I am &amp;#34;Supposed&amp;#34; to be using, instead I am making sure that the nail polish I use in thick, that way it doesn&#x27;t dry so quick while im creating stamps.</li>
            <li>The full nail bed plates seem to be a bit wider than the other sets I have purchased, which is helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Could have been worse I&#x27;m sure!</li>
            <li>Even though these are \\&quot;Love\\&quot; themed, there is such a large variety of designs that I don&#x27;t feel like these are strictly designated for Valentine&#x27;s day or dates.  </li>
            <li>Only certain nail polishes will work (opaque ones).</li>
            <li>I do exhaustive research before ordering and these plates rate very high in overall usefulness.  </li>
            <li>For never having heard of the pueen brand I am really pleased with the quality, they are paper backed which helps keep down the sharp edges, etched well and have the typical blue sticker that covers the plates, these come off with great ease unlike some other brands I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m just looking through the clear wrap.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the quality.</li>
            <li>So far all of the designs we&#x27;ve used have stamped well.  </li>
            <li>I am a 26 year old woman who loves nails</li>
            <li>You could also use an old credit card too which I did before a got the blades.</li>
            <li>so you don’t scratch your plates because mine scratched a bit with the metal scrapper and I am now using an old credit</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really looking forward to seeing what Pueen does next with stamping plates!</li>
            <li>I like them better than Konad plate selection and at least Pueen gives you a storage case.</li>
            <li>There are many plates in the pack that I would never use and I feel its such a waste of money.</li>
            <li>Some are extremely deep and located right in the middle of the design which renders it unusable.</li>
            <li>The images that you can get to work, mainly the small, single images, are very light.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be watching for new sets from this maker!</li>
            <li>The patterns with the more intricate details are so shallow that the polish dries before you can get it onto the stamp</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mainly reviewing the outside of the product, this is a gift</li>
            <li>And they are big enough to fit my larger middle fingers and thumb nails!</li>
            <li>in Hot Pink.</li>
            <li>When I first saw these plates I thought the price was a little high.</li>
            <li>The images on these other brands stamped very sloppily or not at all.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I like the plates overall, but I definitely don&#x27;t like how a large number of images look when on the nail.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Outside of #34 plate having a really deep and large scratch in it</li>
            <li>My friend and I spent a little over two hours playing around with these, but I do feel I&#x27;m getting better at it</li>
            <li>Mine was light blue and round.  </li>
            <li>This is the first nail stamping set I have used, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands.  </li>
            <li>The edges are rounded so its not sharp like some others.</li>
            <li>I noticed this especially with one of the rose lace designs, the fish net style in the background made it a little hard to see exactly what it was once stamped.</li>
            <li>They are different enough from other plates to inspire different looks easily.</li>
            <li>There are different sized full nail images all of which are way bigger than the images on my other plates (used Konad M057 to compare).</li>
            <li>, the plates stamp decent, the designs are deep enough, they pick up well, etc.</li>
            <li>Quick dry polish of any kind is impossible to use with these plates.</li>
            <li>but this problem might be fixed with a different stamper.</li>
            <li>The image is so deeply edged in you can feel it completely with just your fingers.</li>
            <li>There should be a frequent customer discount or lighten up on the price for the next sets.</li>
            <li>cause the designs are nice but ill</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m waiting for the Ankh (an Egyptain Cross) and the Triquetra (a Celtic Trinity Knot) to be the new images on next set of plates to come out.</li>
            <li>These plates came less than five days after I ordered them, talk about fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>All images are etched very well and come out sharp in stamping.  </li>
            <li>I still plan on purchasing the other set of plates very soon.</li>
            <li>The disc may look like all of the others, but I don&#x27;t believe the etching is deep enough to get a clear</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that some of the designs are very busy and you don&#x27;t really realize just how busy they are until you have stamped them.</li>
            <li>various other scratches all over the plates straight out of the package.</li>
            <li>The edges are NOT sharp, which I was worried about since I have heard that complaint for other cheap sets.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very pretty, unfortunately I don&#x27;t use this set as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li>I really like how this comes with a little case to keep all the plates together in one place, and you can flip through it to look for one.</li>
            <li>highly recommend for average nail length and shorter.</li>
            <li>They stamp clear and arrived sooner than I expected.</li>

            <li> Good quality and love playing with them</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you need to get the &amp;#34;nail plate polish&amp;#34; but use a thicker richer polish if you want a nice print.</li>

            <li> They wipe clean very easily after use and have beautiful designs.</li>
            <li> The designs are very nice and they have a huge variety.</li>
            <li> Both this set and their original are great</li>
            <li> These plates are of course very famous and popular, and I love them too.</li>
            <li> These plates are excellent and high quality.  </li>
            <li> I like that this set has a lot of hearts, lace and is very appropriate for valentine or to show your love of nail stamping</li>
            <li> The images stamp very nice and clean.</li>
            <li> but since there&#x27;s no guaranty the new set would be flawless...</li>
            <li> happy with all the designs, theres a lot of them, good quality, fast delivery</li>

            <li> These r the best plates I have come by so far.</li>
            <li> So many amazing images to choose from.</li>
            <li> These plates are one of the better plate sets I own.</li>
            <li> They stamp beautifully and they are elegant and fun designs.</li>
            <li> Great fun for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Really nicely etched plates cute designs</li>
            <li> They stamp clear and transfer on to nails wonderfully.</li>
            <li> So far these plates are awesome.</li>
            <li> So nice and love how it comes with a case.</li>
            <li> Another of my nail plates that is very good, and the designs come out very clean and crisp.  </li>
            <li> But this set has very nice full nail designs, prettier than most.  </li>
            <li> but they are all very nice and useful.</li>
            <li> I was able to stamp crisp, beautiful images.</li>
            <li> After using this set, I can say that the quality is wonderful and the variety of images is fresh and fun.  </li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of the Pueen plates at all, and I must say, I am SUPER IMPRESSED.</li>
            <li> I bought the first set of Pueen plates &amp; was not too happy with them, and hesitated on buying these.</li>
            <li> (I have the first generation Winstonia as well as Pueen Plate 1-25) and I was so happy because I have medium-long nails</li>
            <li> quick shipping as well!!</li>
            <li> brands of image plates and some images will work well, others won&#x27;t work at all, and some will transfer onto the nail very lightly.</li>
            <li> Really liked the stamping plates, as a beginner, they are really easy to use.</li>
            <li> in all good quality plates, pretty images and a nice case.</li>
            <li> They came early which was great, and I just love these!</li>
            <li> Most of the images work well</li>
            <li> However, since it doesn&#x27;t cover 100% of the plate and more than just the edge is exposed; I&#x27;m concerned the exposed portion can/will scratch another plate easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> I love the cute designs on these plates :)</li>
            <li> For the price they are even better.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic quality!</li>
            <li> My clients love them.</li>
            <li> so I decided to give it a try because I love their designs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love infinity plates</li>
            <li> fast shipping - great quality</li>
            <li> and I love the case for them.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> Love it just the same and am very happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love them all but there were many that I did love.</li>

            <li> I love these plates.</li>
            <li> Love the designs.</li>
            <li> These stamp plates mostly feature designs that cover that</li>
            <li> They are well made and there are SO many designs to choose from.  </li>
            <li> Love them and they work well</li>
            <li> I use plastic razor blades for scraping because the metal one I have seems to scratch these more than the Konad plates.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about how these would be</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m greatly pleased.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my collection.  </li>
            <li> The images with larger voids scrape better with a metal scraper otherwise an expired gift card works best for me.</li>
            <li> Use the templates and got so many compliments on my nails.</li>
            <li> The one I am most concerned about is pueen 47.</li>
            <li> Be sure to measure your nail beds before ordering.  </li>
            <li> but thats okay</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> I love my plates.</li>
            <li> Ok, item not the easiest to use</li>
            <li> Mostly I think the trick is in the polish.</li>
            <li> I am glad I got the set.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Case is cute, and compact.</li>

            <li> The top clear coat should be a high quality pain for best results.</li>
            <li> the images are clear and the fine detail is great.</li>
            <li> Such a good combo of plates!  </li>
            <li> I have other sets from Pueen and am very happy with this one as well.  </li>
            <li> I have this set as well as the first one and love them both!</li>
            <li> I love most of the images which is rare for stamping plates</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, even though doesn&#x27;t come in with instructions went through (u tube)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried out all of the images, but the ones that I have tried have all been easy to use and stamp.</li>
            <li> The plates scratch easily though.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Lots of diff designs, easy to clean, love the pouch they come in.</li>
            <li> Easy to do</li>
            <li> Transfer came off easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These plates were easy to use when paired with Konad nail stamper and scraper.</li>
            <li> Price was good, shipping time minimal, case is a good idea.</li>
            <li> The set is full of great, fun, and sophisticated designs, which are very well executed.</li>
            <li> and I like that most of the images are for full nails</li>
            <li> There are so many \\&quot;full nail\\</li>
            <li> Who would have thought I could have such beautiful nail designs done at home.</li>
            <li> I really liked all the images and having bought the first set of Pueen plates I didn&#x27;t think there would be any issues with the quality.</li>
            <li> The patterns stamp clean and there are a variety of patterns ranging from light hearted to elegant.  </li>
            <li> so I stamp the top first, then pick up more of the image a stamp the tip.</li>
            <li> Some of the stamps are to fine</li>
            <li> The details are so fine</li>
            <li> The images stamp perfectly fine</li>
            <li> I really love all the designs, so pretty &amp; interesting.</li>
            <li> Very nice and easy to store as they arrived in their own little leather-like pouch.</li>
            <li> The heart collection is impressive but it also has a little bit of everything,the majority is hearts so .</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect for little finger</li>
            <li> These fit my nails quite well, they are a smidgen wider than the Konad plates and that makes all the difference.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using it...</li>
            <li> I am still learning but cant wait to try all the fabulous stamp art.  </li>
            <li> I really like the variety of the designs and the handy case.</li>
            <li> Picking up the image with any stamper is a breeze and they clean easily.  </li>
            <li> I also ordered the Konad double stamper, which works great.</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so great, I actually got another friend to buy this one.</li>
            <li> so once both of them were available (1-49)</li>
            <li> and they definitely work great.</li>
            <li> I wasted sooooo much money!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> They are a great value for the price and will last forever.</li>
            <li> Not a paper box stating it was a case but a real leather case with each plate is inside its own sheet protector.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved them and I would totally buy more plates from this company...</li>
            <li> Make sure you have a good stamper, and I don&#x27;t recommend one that needs to be primed or filed, especially if you&#x27;ve never done it before.</li>
            <li> Havent use a ton of the stamps yet, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> I have loved all the ones I have tried so far</li>
            <li> , I love most of the designs and they stamp very well.</li>
            <li> These image plates have a lot of beautiful designs,  Their whimsy and romantic style is for far more than just Valentines day!</li>
            <li> I was right :).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice large sized full nail stamps.</li>
            <li> and I have found a few creative ways to make beautiful nails with this set.</li>
            <li> My new favorite thing!</li>
            <li> I mostly got this set because it&#x27;s very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> threw these out after purchasing a Konad set (and new scrapper/stamper set) and finally got a perfect result!</li>
            <li> and it works great; the double ended transfer tool is super helpful.</li>
            <li> This pack is better than the first pack of Pueen.</li>
            <li> and I excited to add them to my collection.</li>
            <li> Such a nice product!  </li>
            <li> I love this set, the images are all so pretty and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any defects</li>
            <li> This is the first set of stamp stamping plates that I brought and I absolutely love them</li>
            <li> My \\&quot;gold standard\\&quot; stamping polish is A-England Excalibur (the original version) when testing plates.</li>
            <li> The full size images will fit even the largest of nail beds.</li>
            <li> These are really unique plates that I have not seen anywhere else</li>
            <li> but this is a fun way to start!</li>
            <li> This is a great way to get really distinct looks in your nails without really doing that much work.</li>
            <li> Nice WIDE images which I love!</li>
            <li> I am always looking for new plate sets, and this one is nice.  </li>
            <li> It has a lot of different designs and most of them are nice.</li>
            <li> It is a nice set, but many plates were scratched before they placed the blue plastic.</li>
            <li> Not as clean of an image sometimes</li>
            <li> They clean well and transfer well.</li>
            <li> other images I tried stamped beautifully</li>
            <li> I am new to stamping and these are so much fun to use!!!  </li>
            <li> For the first time someone packaged some plates in a super cute leather like case where you can pull out each of the plates and show them before deciding which one you want to use.</li>
            <li> This would be a really nice set of love and romance designs but more than half the plates arrived scratched.</li>
            <li> so I haven’t had the need to by any type of special nail polish for this.</li>
            <li> I love that these plates have large designs and a lot of variety.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and loved that it came in its own little snap case!</li>
            <li> These designs are definitely the best ones out of the major brands that I already have.</li>
            <li> I have used them with the special nail stamping polish and regular nail polish and has work really good.</li>
            <li> This second set works great just like the first.</li>
            <li> Good designs and crisp, clear images.</li>
            <li> Every transfer seems nice and clear.</li>
            <li> Cannot say enough good things, want to buy the rest of everything they have put out!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The images are etched very well, and the designs are interesting and varied.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of patterns included here, and the plates hold up very well to repeated use.  </li>
            <li> I like the variety of designs in this collection, very feminine and cute.</li>
            <li> there is so much variety that it will take a while for me to use all the images :)</li>
            <li> Just scrape lighter on the images with more flooded areas to prevent scraping too much polish from the image.  </li>
            <li> I like the designs and the full nail designs</li>
            <li> I use the pueen plastic scraper or any old gift card will also do the trick nicely.</li>
            <li> the plates are sweet.</li>
            <li> the price this product is not bad but expect some not to work.</li>
            <li> Pueen really built on their strengths of their first set, and improved their techniques and style to deliver a great new set.</li>
            <li> Plate 43 was off center ,but, after contacting the seller they shipped me a new one with no muss or fuss Very happy.</li>
            <li> I can easily say that this brand has become my favorite as far as stamping plates</li>
            <li> /&gt;The plates are made of a nice metal and comes covered in blue cellophane, which came off easily.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered it, mine even came with a free case which was really nice and better than what other companies offer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real bonus that they came in a nice leather case with a large snap holding it together.</li>
            <li> With so many different brands out, I wasn&#x27;t sure which to buy.  </li>
            <li> I have several stamping plate sets -- BM, Red Angel, Mash &amp; Winstonia -- and while I like them as well, these Pueen plates are the best out of all of them.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping also.</li>
            <li> I got them quickly.</li>
            <li> This is my second full set of stamping plates (I started out buying singles till I was sure I could do it) and I look forward to many fun manicures ahead.</li>
            <li> The polish you use has to be just right for a good visible application because the imprint of the designs are not very deep.</li>
            <li> Came very fast, images pick up well..easy to use!</li>
            <li> Very cute, durable, has the backing so no possible cuts.</li>
            <li> The designs are very pretty on each and every plate.</li>
            <li> These plates are good for long nails.</li>
            <li> if/when they have more new plates.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more as soon as new ones are offered.</li>
            <li> There are so many cute desins, I will be experimenting for a long time</li>
            <li> so Much I bought 1 of Each Set!!</li>
            <li> They have nice crisp lines and actually do fit my finger except for my middle finger and thumb</li>
            <li> I would recommend these for anyone who loves to have pretty nails!</li>
            <li> Also, they are really pretty and original.</li>
            <li> The images are unique and crisp.</li>
            <li> I got a white case of course, my favorite color!</li>
            <li> Came in a cute vinyl case with clear sachets for each of the plates!</li>
            <li> There is a nice wide range of styles in the set, and the full nail designs measure in at 1.5 x 2 cm, so will fit a lot of nails (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy more Pueen plates!</li>
            <li> Lots of different and cute designs!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s a lot of new images in this set, some are very unique and cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the white leatherette case was a super nice touch, trying to figure out if I have a use for it, since I keep my plates in a plate holder book.</li>
            <li> I tested all the plates, about 2-3 images per plate and they stamped clean and crisp.  </li>
            <li> The images come out crisp and clean everytime.</li>
            <li> The stamps are highly detailed with large images.  </li>
            <li> Decent stamp set, not the most crisp designs when transferring.</li>
            <li> I would recommend watching you tube tutorials first and googling which polishes will work, or ordering special stamping polishes.</li>
            <li> but I do have wider nail beds so it will be more than large enough for most people.</li>
            <li> Great image sizes that are big enough to fit my thumb nail.  </li>
            <li> The images are fantastic and stamp really well.  </li>
            <li> Overall Amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure I want to give this in a basket of nail products to my 22 year old niece.</li>
            <li> I use a konad stamper and the design comes out clear :)</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of getting used to, but makes really fun designs.</li>
            <li> So far pueen seems to be my favorite brand of stamp plates.</li>
            <li> They are not thin and flimsy like others I have and they work the best with the least amount of effort.  </li>
            <li> This nail art is fun for all</li>
            <li> I just got my pueen set and one of my plate was bent but love the plate they come out clear.</li>
            <li> so much fun to use.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re nice and from what I tried last night, they work well.  </li>
            <li> This was a really fun collection.  </li>
            <li> and I own all the plates by all the different makers.</li>
            <li> but, just a fair warning, be careful with the edges.</li>
            <li> You can see this in the picture, but it doesn&#x27;t come with any french tip designs which I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Having so much fun decorating my nails.</li>
            <li> In addition to the plates, they come with a nice pouch with sleeves for each individual plate.</li>
            <li> So exciting.</li>
            <li> There is also a large variety of unique designs.</li>
            <li> I have many stamping plates and this is a great product, with images bigger than other plates, designs very crispy and original.</li>
            <li> These came in pretty quick, I had no problems with scratches on the plates or anything like that.</li>
            <li> I really was excited to get these.</li>
            <li> It is taking a lot of patience and practice to get it right.  </li>
            <li> I jumped right one</li>
            <li> right away-</li>
            <li> They arrived very quickly in the new case by Pueen.</li>
            <li> I am new to stamping and these plates are so easy to use.</li>
            <li> and I have received two 36 plates and none 33, but it is ok in general.</li>
            <li> So be aware this may happen to you as well and decide if its worth it to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the cute little case they came in as well.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t even pick up or it was super patchy and didn&#x27;t catch the whole design.</li>
            <li> this keeps the designs clear and easy to decide which ones to use.  </li>
            <li> and, when I tested them out, they fit better than I expected</li>
            <li> I got this set super fast with the prime shipping.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to pretty much to cover my nail beds and look professional.</li>
            <li> I want to give a higher rating because the designs look great, but I had quite a few plates that were really scratched up.</li>
            <li> I watched several you tube videos, and was able to pick it up right away.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> I like the plates very much.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> They need to be used with a high quality nail stamping paint, I use konad special paint.</li>
            <li> The Images come off CLEAN CRISP AND CLEAR!!</li>
            <li> Great designs, although I have a hard time with the case, it&#x27;s not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> Love the designs, and so far everything comes out very clear!</li>
            <li> The scratches were evident before the protective film was removed.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Fast service!</li>
            <li> All of the designs stamp very well!</li>
            <li> This is definitely the set I reach for most often.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more from this seller.</li>
            <li> Love he different designs..</li>
            <li> and these are the first plates i bought</li>
            <li> Love them , I can only recommend them.</li>
            <li> but I was only able to get one out of each plate to work.</li>
            <li> Will be looking forward to more plates from Pueen in the future.</li>
            <li> or if you are willing to take the time to learn.  </li>
            <li> and am overall satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I cleaned them both with acetone remover and got the image transfered on my second try on the Stamper and on the nail, just need some more practice.</li>
            <li> The stamp that goes with this, broke on the first use</li>
            <li> This was my first from Pureen</li>
            <li> First the caveat.</li>
            <li> , they work pretty well</li>
            <li> They came in this cute book-style case with individual plastic sleeves</li>
            <li> I love American Apparel.</li>
            <li> Some polishes definitely work better than others.  </li>
            <li> It does take a bit of practice but it is not difficult to get started.</li>
            <li> n crisp.</li>
            <li> I have the first set of pueen plates as well.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying nail stamping</li>
            <li> With these, all of the designs are crisp while keeping some level of intricacy where needed.</li>
            <li> those of us with bigger thumbs often have to get creative, but it&#x27;s easier with these).</li>
            <li> All of my plates are etched perfectly - deep enough but not too deep, and many are now my most favorite and most-used plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was pleasing to the eyes for the fact that the presentation is so pretty.</li>
            <li> My first stamping set</li>
            <li> For a first time user I had to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> but if you use a higher end or stamping polish you wont even know.</li>
            <li> because they are small enough to fit on the stamp, and the nail, it&#x27;s a great beginner set for this reason.  </li>
            <li> Love the little booklet holder the plates fit into.</li>
            <li> Just as good as more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Yellow rusty stuff on white pleather or leather just isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> I love this set so much, I have even decided to do my nails myself next summer for my wedding along with my maid of honor and bridesmaids.</li>
            <li> I love that they are larger than average &amp; cover my large nails nicely.</li>
            <li> I really like them, and have found that the designs are, on the whole, the right size for my nails.  </li>
            <li> There is a nice range of very feminine styles, from floral lace to butterflies and other stuff like that.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product was exactly as stated</li>
            <li> Loved the price but stamps don&#x27;t come out clearly and some don&#x27;t work at all not a consistent product all the time</li>
            <li> I got a nice pink storage case which I&#x27;m glad came as a bonus because I don&#x27;t have a case for any of my other plates yet.  </li>
            <li> Love the case will keep for a long time!</li>
            <li> Purchased it with  PUEEN Nail Art Super Soft Squishy Silicone Stamper it came in one week.</li>
            <li> but she is super busy and our schedules dont work.  </li>
            <li> Ten (10)plates were scratched but I&#x27;m hoping they will take it back and give an undamaged product because the designs are very cute</li>
            <li> You can easily to all nails the same with these, for this reason.  </li>
            <li> I think these plates are cool and had lots of fun designs - even holiday specific!</li>
            <li> Prefer them over Konad in quality and in price.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus, they come in a cute little case and shipping is quick.</li>
            <li> The full nail designs are big enough to fit my thumbs (yay!)</li>
            <li> The case I got was white and it was perfectly fine</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re going to need a pretty decent quality stamper, which I bought separately from Amazon.</li>
            <li> They stamp well and come in their own little organizer.</li>
            <li> but the price is pretty high.</li>
            <li> The full nail designs are large but they do not have the moon shape at the bottom for French tips like their first set.</li>
            <li> but I am intelligent enough to figure this out with the help of a few tutorials.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s recommends returning the whole thing.  </li>
            <li> you haven&#x27;t really looked at the designs on the stamp, you should.  </li>
            <li> Very comparable to Konad plates for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> the sleeves are very flimsy and stick together...</li>
            <li> With all the heart, stars and butterflies, it&#x27;s very feminine.</li>
            <li> I really recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like this set.</li>
            <li> really didn&#x27;t know much about stamping</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these for anyone collecting stamping plates!</li>
            <li> I am looking very forward to start decorating nails with them.</li>
            <li> They work just as well as the Konad brand and are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, well packaged.  </li>
            <li> For the price you really can&#x27;t beat them</li>
            <li> The designs all work very</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them for any nail art lover!</li>
            <li> fast shipping</li>
            <li> They work very well</li>
            <li> and I really like the designs.</li>
            <li> and they worked very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> thanks 👌</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li> but how ironic my mermaid plate won&#x27;t stamp.</li>
            <li> Works really well, just took about an hour of practice before I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> They stamp very well.</li>
            <li> Just do it really fast or</li>
            <li> and she really likes the diversity of the stamping options.</li>
            <li> Some of the images do not transfer very well</li>
            <li> These plates are working very well, the images came out neatly.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> I had some Konad stamping plates and didn&#x27;t like them that much, they just didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shipping time was reasonable, ordered on 8th May and received on 14th May.</li>
            <li> These make some pretty fun designs and totally worth it as long as you have some patience!</li>
            <li> I am new in stamping nail art, and this set is the first for me.</li>
            <li> so you are sure not to get duplicates from other kits/manufacturers.</li>
            <li> Although this set is more feminine than the other one.</li>
            <li> the size of the designs is wonderful whereas other companies are very small and don&#x27;t cover the whole nail.  </li>
            <li> Other than that there are so many designs on this plate for your heart&#x27;s desires.</li>
            <li> but once we got it down we were able to finish each hand in under 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Love the plates but edges are very sharp..</li>
            <li> I used one plate for my Independence Day manicure and plan on using several more for future nail designs.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more image plates from this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> Delicate images that stamp flawlessly for everyday nail art...</li>
            <li> Overall my daughter enjoyed this product and now has a different technique of doing nail art.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality nail stamping plate kit.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations on this product, when I tried to do the transfer from the plates to the nail, the nail polish didn&#x27;t stick at all on the plates or the rubber stamp.</li>
            <li> I oove this brand and all the designs I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> You get high quality plates and a protective case to hold your plates in.</li>
            <li> I love the little case these come with.</li>
            <li> so just be a little more</li>
            <li> I love the little leather case it comes with</li>
            <li> so if your looking for cute little designs this is not the collection for you.</li>
            <li> The little case it comes in is really cute.</li>
            <li> But I will say my MASH set stamps a little better.</li>
            <li> The protective film coating removed easily - easier than other brands.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time picking an image, lot of nice designs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wish there were more hearts and stars and animal print, but they have other sets!!</li>
            <li> have tried out 3 different plates so far, and I have to say the quality is MUCH better than the Shany or Red Angel plates.</li>
            <li> Took awhile to get the hang of it, but after watching a few videos on youtube and some practice I love it.</li>
            <li> It definitely takes a lot of practice to get the transfer process just right though.  </li>
            <li> They are large enough to cover my whole nail.</li>
            <li> Pueen images are large enough to cover your whole nail.</li>
            <li> After a little research and more trail and error, I discovered that these discs are just not the quality needed to get a clear stamp on the nail.</li>
            <li> They transfer to the nail quite well and have a wide variety of unique designs.</li>
            <li> The images are unique and not the same typical designs you find from one set to the next; 2) They are full size designs, meaning they don&#x27;t have the curved french tip built into them, which also means they fit longer nails; and 3)</li>
            <li> plates are beautiful as always the only reason I am giving a lower review is 4 of them were scratched through the designs, visibly enough to show up after removing the blue film and one was dented luckily not in on image.</li>
            <li> I am brand new to stamping.</li>
            <li> much exited I was to receive this purchase, and it did not let me down, thank you Pueen and Amazon, definitely going to extend my collection of plates.  : )</li>
            <li> I only had a few of other brands that cost much more and wasn&#x27;t sure the transfer would be good,but it does nicely..🎀</li>
            <li> I got this set specifically for one of the star designs, its hard to use the other plates in this set and my other plates I own because I just love the stars so much!</li>
            <li> Most of the images are wide enough to just cover my nails</li>
            <li> The images transfer very clearly and the plates are well made.</li>
            <li> When I finally gathered enough courage to get it I had to wait,even further because only this set was available (and not the one I originally wanted)</li>
            <li> Boy was I surprised!  </li>
            <li> and I love the small case.</li>
            <li> Such pretty design, will be ordering newer items.</li>
            <li> One of the plates the first one had a deep scrape across it</li>
            <li> They much preferred the little pictures to the full nail decorations and the pictures are the ones that I have the hardest time with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stamps very clear cut deep enough for full detail even the tiniest detail works well.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and order is as expected.</li>
            <li> As stubborn as I am, I decided not to purchase the nail polish I am &amp;#34;Supposed&amp;#34; to be using, instead I am making sure that the nail polish I use in thick, that way it doesn&#x27;t dry so quick while im creating stamps.</li>
            <li> The full nail bed plates seem to be a bit wider than the other sets I have purchased, which is helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Could have been worse I&#x27;m sure!</li>
            <li> Even though these are \\&quot;Love\\&quot; themed, there is such a large variety of designs that I don&#x27;t feel like these are strictly designated for Valentine&#x27;s day or dates.  </li>
            <li> Only certain nail polishes will work (opaque ones).</li>
            <li> I do exhaustive research before ordering and these plates rate very high in overall usefulness.  </li>
            <li> For never having heard of the pueen brand I am really pleased with the quality, they are paper backed which helps keep down the sharp edges, etched well and have the typical blue sticker that covers the plates, these come off with great ease unlike some other brands I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m just looking through the clear wrap.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the quality.</li>
            <li> So far all of the designs we&#x27;ve used have stamped well.  </li>
            <li> I am a 26 year old woman who loves nails</li>
            <li> You could also use an old credit card too which I did before a got the blades.</li>
            <li> so you don’t scratch your plates because mine scratched a bit with the metal scrapper and I am now using an old credit</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really looking forward to seeing what Pueen does next with stamping plates!</li>
            <li> I like them better than Konad plate selection and at least Pueen gives you a storage case.</li>
            <li> There are many plates in the pack that I would never use and I feel its such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Some are extremely deep and located right in the middle of the design which renders it unusable.</li>
            <li> The images that you can get to work, mainly the small, single images, are very light.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be watching for new sets from this maker!</li>
            <li> The patterns with the more intricate details are so shallow that the polish dries before you can get it onto the stamp</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mainly reviewing the outside of the product, this is a gift</li>
            <li> And they are big enough to fit my larger middle fingers and thumb nails!</li>
            <li> in Hot Pink.</li>
            <li> When I first saw these plates I thought the price was a little high.</li>
            <li> The images on these other brands stamped very sloppily or not at all.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I like the plates overall, but I definitely don&#x27;t like how a large number of images look when on the nail.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Outside of #34 plate having a really deep and large scratch in it</li>
            <li> My friend and I spent a little over two hours playing around with these, but I do feel I&#x27;m getting better at it</li>
            <li> Mine was light blue and round.  </li>
            <li> This is the first nail stamping set I have used, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands.  </li>
            <li> The edges are rounded so its not sharp like some others.</li>
            <li> I noticed this especially with one of the rose lace designs, the fish net style in the background made it a little hard to see exactly what it was once stamped.</li>
            <li> They are different enough from other plates to inspire different looks easily.</li>
            <li> There are different sized full nail images all of which are way bigger than the images on my other plates (used Konad M057 to compare).</li>
            <li> , the plates stamp decent, the designs are deep enough, they pick up well, etc.</li>
            <li> Quick dry polish of any kind is impossible to use with these plates.</li>
            <li> but this problem might be fixed with a different stamper.</li>
            <li> The image is so deeply edged in you can feel it completely with just your fingers.</li>
            <li> There should be a frequent customer discount or lighten up on the price for the next sets.</li>
            <li> cause the designs are nice but ill</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting for the Ankh (an Egyptain Cross) and the Triquetra (a Celtic Trinity Knot) to be the new images on next set of plates to come out.</li>
            <li> These plates came less than five days after I ordered them, talk about fast delivery!  </li>
            <li> All images are etched very well and come out sharp in stamping.  </li>
            <li> I still plan on purchasing the other set of plates very soon.</li>
            <li> The disc may look like all of the others, but I don&#x27;t believe the etching is deep enough to get a clear</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that some of the designs are very busy and you don&#x27;t really realize just how busy they are until you have stamped them.</li>
            <li> various other scratches all over the plates straight out of the package.</li>
            <li> The edges are NOT sharp, which I was worried about since I have heard that complaint for other cheap sets.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very pretty, unfortunately I don&#x27;t use this set as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li> I really like how this comes with a little case to keep all the plates together in one place, and you can flip through it to look for one.</li>
            <li> highly recommend for average nail length and shorter.</li>
            <li> They stamp clear and arrived sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> As much is i absolutely love this product there is one con: not ideal for really long nails (which i don&#x27;t have but plan on growing out my nails).</li>
            <li> In their older set, they tried to cram too much into too little space for a few designs, and the results were murky.</li>
            <li> The thought process behind the design execution seems better than in other sets.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about trying yet another stamping company, but these images are clear, easy to stamp, and there&#x27;s something for everyone in this set!</li>
            <li> The price is a little high</li>
            <li> I have short nails and small nail beds, and these work very well.</li>
            <li> i have large nails and this plates are too small for them.</li>
            <li> I watched several videos on stamping and used other suggestions like scraping with different items and at varying angles and several different polish brands.  </li>
            <li> I usually only buy Konad because other plates often have problems with the etching being not deep enough.</li>
            <li> It takes time and practice, some of the designs do not work, other are very small (like for your pinky nail)  - after you master it, it is cool</li>
            <li> year round, right now my nails are stamped with one of the heart designs from this set and there are a few specifically for Valentine&#x27;s Day like they have words written into the design</li>
            <li> I got one in a orange case (my 2nd fav color) and the other one is white.</li>
            <li> It takes some experimentation and getting used to, but you&#x27;ll be stamping professionally in no time.</li>
            <li> I have long stilleto nails</li>
            <li> I tend to have long nails</li>
            <li> , There aren&#x27;t any french manicure designs and only a few of the tiny ones.  </li>
            <li> only fits the other two fingers.</li>
            <li> Definitely will be buying other PUEEN stamping collections.</li>
            <li> A few of the plates have images that aren&#x27;t etched deep enough to hold polish.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I feel like the designs could have been etched into the plates a little deeper, some of them are pretty shallow</li>
            <li> Both full-nail and single image designs included.  </li>
            <li> but some are a little more difficult as the etching is pretty shallow on a few.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like writing negative reviews, but hopefully this will help someone who is new to nail</li>
            <li> I usually only like maybe half</li>
            <li> the polish will dry and give it a couple tries.</li>
            <li> Some of these images are super useless to ME..</li>
            <li> Little on the small side, but high quality.</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s just hard to etch it deep enough without making it too</li>
            <li> Just what i expected</li>
            <li> and I have wide nail beds</li>
            <li> no issues with anything at all, a wide variety</li>
            <li> The designs are plenty wide</li>
            <li> all what I expected.</li>
            <li> ; so that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> The stamping plates came inside a white case and are individually covered with thin, blue plastic sheets to avoid scratching.</li>
            <li> They took a few tries but I finally got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Very vert small slight scratch on surface of ONE plate but doesnt effect stamping!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to get the polish to stay in the design while scraping hard enough to get the surface of the plate clean.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t an isolated case based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> I use this idea with other brands and couldn&#x27;t get this one to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Lots of design to do for endless designs...</li>
            <li> (not like my other one)</li>
            <li> I had heard that persons said in other brands that some plates might not stamp well</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what it was that sharp</li>
            <li> and that were repeated on other plates and even other brands.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the reason I got the plates and for other designs.</li>
            <li> Different from the other plates I have collected which usually just come wrapped in plastic.</li>
            <li> Ordering the other set today.</li>
            <li> The images are sharp and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> The little screw on the bottom was a bit loose</li>
            <li> but one plate was off center to where the image was half off the plate.</li>
            <li> I am on a very tight budget and find it hard to spend the money to have my nails done professionally.</li>
            <li> It comes with a blue film that makes it hard to see the designs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly unfortunate because the designs are really pretty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The images are clear and even if you use a thin nail polish they are well picked.</li>
            <li> The images r bit small for my nails because I have really long nails bt</li>
            <li> only complaint I have is that I did not receive plate #45.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem with half the image on the stamp and the other half on the plate.</li>
            <li> They did offer a generous discount due to the missing plates but it is a disappointment not to have the full set I ordered and few choices to replace them.</li>
            <li> So needless to say I have some good plates and So plates so badly done (image won&#x27;t stamp &amp;/or sharp edges)</li>
            <li> I can get some of them without any problem but some work half the time</li>
            <li> I have others that use the entire plate, and it can get confusing.. and messy..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odd</li>
            <li> but they are ever so slightly thinner than a Konad plate</li>
            <li> Compared to some other stamping plate brands (Uberchic, Moyou London, Dashica, etc.), these pale in comparison.</li>
            <li> I think the engravings are just a little bit deeper on those.</li>
            <li> The little plastic envelopes inside the case were quite flimsy, it felt like the slightest thing and they would tear</li>
            <li> and I have to say that my favorites hands down are the Pueen!  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;d heard about this from a Reddit thread and was infatuated.</li>
            <li> (though there was some discoloration on a few plates).</li>
            <li> biggest waste of money ever.</li>
            <li> but there were a few images I had to have</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time, crappy stencils.</li>
            <li> I will recap on my review after I try a few.</li>
            <li> Unable to determine if it works due to the stamper bought separately from the same company does not work</li>
            <li> it cut my thumb pretty bad</li>
            <li> had a hard time picking up a few images, but I think that&#x27;s because of the worn out stamper and not the plates.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all, the stamp was not able to get a thing from it.</li>
            <li> go.&lt;br /&gt;Other brands that i have purchased had designs that were way too small to use on any of my nails</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed when I got them I expected them to be bigger images, but I have to tell ya</li>
            <li> You can use any polish for the base, but to use on the plate, you need a more expensive polish.</li>
            <li> (no super thin lines that don&#x27;t transfer, etc)</li>
            <li> and I have a hard time getting the picture to transfer.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m having a really hard time transferring the designs from the plates to my nails.</li>
            <li> Hopefully if I give to her, it will work fabulously and she&#x27;ll overlook the nasty snap.</li>
            <li> and they were not thrilled with this set of stamps.</li>
            <li> ,  I was hoping to have at least pueen 47 image replaced.</li>
            <li> Too shallow, so when you put the nail polish on the pattern - it dries out in seconds.</li>
            <li> My set arrived missing two plates (33 &amp; 44) which after contacting customer service they were unable to replace.</li>
            <li> There are a few cheesy images</li>
            <li> The plastic bags inside the holder feel somehow weak, like they will tear any minute</li>
            <li> Plates are etched perfectly, I never have problems picking up the design even with a hard stamper.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, but disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Not happy and not @</li>
            <li> however hers was worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The etchings on the plates are very, very shallow.  </li>
            <li> im sad</li>
            <li> unable to get stamper to work</li>
            <li> these have lots of lacey whimsical images.</li>
            <li> ill upload a pic..</li>
            <li> I have used some very bad plates in the past.</li>
            <li> Nothing else indicated as needed so this item was useless by itself!</li>
            <li> I have never had a Pueen plate before but, despite wanting one so bad I decided to wait.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too clunky and ugly.  </li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m NOT impressed with is the nasty yellowing around the snap closure, otherwise this would look presentable.</li>
            <li> have to return it.  :(</li>
            <li> disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed with this set</li>
            <li> The base coat can be any color or brand.</li>
            <li> Check your records, please, this is getting a tad annoying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hated the Bonus case.  </li>
            <li> So I returned it very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awful product does not work at all.</li>
            <li> Worst thing I have ever bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Beautiful designs and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Beware that these are for smaller nails. I can stretch the images with my squishy stamper to make the image a bit wider for the smaller images but they do not fill my nails when they are a longer length, which is the majority of the time. Most of the images work well but some are a little more difficult as the etching is pretty shallow on a few. Compared to some other stamping plate brands (Uberchic, Moyou London, Dashica, etc.), these pale in comparison.</li>
            <li> This would be a really nice set of love and romance designs but more than half the plates arrived scratched. The scratches were evident before the protective film was removed.  Some are extremely deep and located right in the middle of the design which renders it unusable. This isn&#x27;t an isolated case based on other reviews. It&#x27;s truly unfortunate because the designs are really pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates come in a white round-shaped protective case. I like the practical aspect for storage and convenience purposes.  However, since it doesn&#x27;t cover 100% of the plate and more than just the edge is exposed; I&#x27;m concerned the exposed portion can/will scratch another plate easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was nothing (no packing slip) included with the item so I have no way to contact someone for a resolution.  Amazon&#x27;s recommends returning the whole thing.  I&#x27;d return and repurchase but since there&#x27;s no guaranty the new set would be flawless...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy at your own peril!</li>
            <li> These Pueen Plates are Really Great Quality Very Good designs and Very Sturdy Plates I loved them so Much I bought 1 of Each Set!! The Images come off CLEAN CRISP AND CLEAR!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Fast service! All of the designs stamp very well! I love the little case these come with.</li>
            <li> I loved these plates! They have gorgeous uniqe designs and awsome stamping quality! I absolutely loved them and I would totally buy more plates from this company...</li>
            <li> Love these. Just as good as more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great with any nail polish. Make sure you have a good stamper, and I don&#x27;t recommend one that needs to be primed or filed, especially if you&#x27;ve never done it before. I really like how this comes with a little case to keep all the plates together in one place, and you can flip through it to look for one.</li>
            <li> Decent stamp set, not the most crisp designs when transferring. Price was good, shipping time minimal, case is a good idea.</li>
            <li> Yay!!! I love the cute designs on these plates :) And they are big enough to fit my larger middle fingers and thumb nails!</li>
            <li> These plates came less than five days after I ordered them, talk about fast delivery!  I got a nice pink storage case which I&#x27;m glad came as a bonus because I don&#x27;t have a case for any of my other plates yet.  I tested all the plates, about 2-3 images per plate and they stamped clean and crisp.  Even though these are \\&quot;Love\\&quot; themed, there is such a large variety of designs that I don&#x27;t feel like these are strictly designated for Valentine&#x27;s day or dates.  I used one plate for my Independence Day manicure and plan on using several more for future nail designs.  These fit my nails quite well, they are a smidgen wider than the Konad plates and that makes all the difference.</li>
            <li> You could pay $5-$7 per plate if you want the Konad brand.  Or you could buy this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The edges are sharper than Konad plates so just be a little more careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hated the Bonus case.  It&#x27;s just too clunky and ugly.  I pulled mine apart and left each plate in the slip covers.  However, I can see how people would like the storage case, it&#x27;s just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t really looked at the designs on the stamp, you should.  The variety is vast.  The designs are also larger than a Konad plate.  If you couldn&#x27;t cover your entire nail with Konad, you can now!</li>
            <li> Some plates don´t work and I have received two 36 plates and none 33, but it is ok in general.</li>
            <li> I like that this set has a lot of hearts, lace and is very appropriate for valentine or to show your love of nail stamping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mainly reviewing the outside of the product, this is a gift so I don&#x27;t want to open it, I&#x27;m just looking through the clear wrap. What I&#x27;m NOT impressed with is the nasty yellowing around the snap closure, otherwise this would look presentable. I&#x27;m not even sure I want to give this in a basket of nail products to my 22 year old niece. Hopefully if I give to her, it will work fabulously and she&#x27;ll overlook the nasty snap. Yellow rusty stuff on white pleather or leather just isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> i have large nails and this plates are too small for them. it doesnt cover my entire thumb, ring finger or middle finger.. only fits the other two fingers. im sad cause the designs are nice but ill have to return it.  :(</li>
            <li> These stamping plates are WONDERFUL! I have used some very bad plates in the past. For the price they are even better. The selection is also very great. Very comparable to Konad plates for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Awesome, works very well. I use a konad stamper and the design comes out clear :)</li>
            <li> Havent use a ton of the stamps yet, but so far, so good. Takes a bit of getting used to, but makes really fun designs. Works good and lots of designs.</li>
            <li> The stamps are great. Just what i expected</li>
            <li> The images looked like they did in the ad.&lt;br /&gt;The stamps transferred well</li>
            <li> love them they stamp beautifully</li>
            <li> Daughter loves these.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of the Pueen plates at all, and I must say, I am SUPER IMPRESSED. The images are crisp, and etched a good depth. The thought process behind the design execution seems better than in other sets. (no super thin lines that don&#x27;t transfer, etc) The full nail bed plates seem to be a bit wider than the other sets I have purchased, which is helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried out 3 different plates so far, and I have to say the quality is MUCH better than the Shany or Red Angel plates. Every transfer seems nice and clear. Cannot say enough good things, want to buy the rest of everything they have put out!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the white leatherette case was a super nice touch, trying to figure out if I have a use for it, since I keep my plates in a plate holder book.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife for Christmas. She&#x27;d heard about this from a Reddit thread and was infatuated. This set of plates was a great way to get started with nail stamping. You&#x27;re going to need a pretty decent quality stamper, which I bought separately from Amazon. It takes some experimentation and getting used to, but you&#x27;ll be stamping professionally in no time. One thing to watch out for is that the blueness of the plates is a protective film -- peel that off before you get started.</li>
            <li> The images are beautiful and original, and they stamp crisply and cleanly on the nail! I haven&#x27;t had any issues yet. I love both Pueen sets!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend these. These r the best plates I have come by so far. I love most of the images which is rare for stamping plates I usually only like maybe half</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic quality! So many amazing images to choose from. This is definitely the set I reach for most often.</li>
            <li> The pueen 2013 images are bigger than the gal 2013 images. It is a very useful tool for a nail salon! My clients love them. I will definitely buy more from this seller. Very quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Very nice designs, but the designs are to short. I have long stilleto nails so I stamp the top first, then pick up more of the image a stamp the tip.</li>
            <li> Awesome quality. Nice designs. Good price.</li>
            <li> I usually only buy Konad because other plates often have problems with the etching being not deep enough. But I heard that Pueen makes great stamping plates so I decided to give it a try because I love their designs. I&#x27;m glad I did. The images transfer very clearly and the plates are well made. I like that a case is included as well.</li>
            <li> So many images to choose from! Can&#x27;t wait to try them</li>
            <li> In love with this image plates!! Work great and love the variety!</li>
            <li> Boy this is nice!  I love infinity plates</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very pretty, unfortunately I don&#x27;t use this set as much as I thought I would. The images are etched very well, and the designs are interesting and varied.</li>
            <li> A few of the plates have images that aren&#x27;t etched deep enough to hold polish.</li>
            <li> Nothing else indicated as needed so this item was useless by itself! And I didn&#x27;t know what was needed!</li>
            <li> fast shipping - great quality</li>
            <li> Item as described, love these plates!</li>
            <li> These plates are one of the better plate sets I own. The full nail designs are big enough to fit my thumbs (yay!) and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with them not transferring.</li>
            <li> I have many stamping plates and this is a great product, with images bigger than other plates, designs very crispy and original. One of my favorite stamping sets ever!</li>
            <li> So far pueen seems to be my favorite brand of stamp plates. I have ordered tons of others from amazon , but these all work great! and wonderful designs.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work.  Period.</li>
            <li> I have loved all the ones I have tried so far and I love the case for them.</li>
            <li> The stamps are all beautiful and came in an awesome storage case! I loved them all from photos but the designs are even better in person! Now I want to buy the next set they&#x27;ve got!</li>
            <li> I love these plates! They stamp beautifully and they are elegant and fun designs. The holder that comes with them is ok... the sleeves are very flimsy and stick together... I thought that there weren&#x27;t enough holders for all the plates but I just had to go back and find where they had stuck together.</li>
            <li> Unable to determine if it works due to the stamper bought separately from the same company does not work</li>
            <li> I am not a nail expert but I am intelligent enough to figure this out with the help of a few tutorials. However some of these stamps do not work. I can get some of them without any problem but some work half the time and some do not work at all. I have some official Konad plates and they have never not worked for me so it is not my skill level that is the problem. I would also say that I got these to do my nieces nails and some friends and they were not thrilled with this set of stamps. They much preferred the little pictures to the full nail decorations and the pictures are the ones that I have the hardest time with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price this product is not bad but expect some not to work.</li>
            <li> Love the plates but edges are very sharp..  it cut my thumb pretty bad</li>
            <li> Great fun for my daughter. Works well!</li>
            <li> I like all the designs on the plates the only problem is all but maybe 6 plates have deep gouges through the images and various other scratches all over the plates straight out of the package.</li>
            <li> Love he different designs.. Will definitely buy more in the future. A++++</li>
            <li> Another of my nail plates that is very good, and the designs come out very clean and crisp.  I&#x27;m so glad I purchased them.  I have short nails and small nail beds, and these work very well.</li>
            <li> A lot of the plates aren&#x27;t deep enough so the stamps don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality nail stamping plate kit. I&#x27;ve tested some of them with great results. The plastic bags inside the holder feel somehow weak, like they will tear any minute but the plates are GREAT.</li>
            <li> Really liked the stamping plates, as a beginner, they are really easy to use. The came before the estimated time and in great conditions. Waiting to get my next set.</li>
            <li> Really nicely etched plates cute designs stamp well using a variety of polish and either type of stamper&lt;br /&gt;storage case is cutesy but I dont use it</li>
            <li> I love the Love Elements collection.  With all the heart, stars and butterflies, it&#x27;s very feminine. An awesome collection and must have if you use nail stamping plates.</li>
            <li> its everything i hoped for!!</li>
            <li> Some of the stamps are to fine and they dont transfer to the stamper as mucho as you try and try</li>
            <li> The plate are wonderful and the quality is there. Love that they come with a protective case and that is wonderful. Nothing else out there like this. THE BEST DEAL!!!</li>
            <li> Love these plates. Was a little disappointed when I got them I expected them to be bigger images, but I have to tell ya they work amazing. They have nice crisp lines and actually do fit my finger except for my middle finger and thumb so I use those as accent nails. Couldn&#x27;t be happier I chose these.</li>
            <li> these plates to anyone I just started using nail art stamps and these are the first plates i bought and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. quick shipping as well!! I love the little leather case it comes with</li>
            <li> Great plates, they stamp perfectly! I will be using this set often. Lots of combinations to come up with for outstanding manis.</li>
            <li> I love  pueen  plates. Stamps perfectly and the designs are very cute.</li>
            <li> I tend to have long nails and I have wide nail beds and I&#x27;m able to pretty much to cover my nail beds and look professional.</li>
            <li> Great stamps for nail art.. love them ..</li>
            <li> Another winning collection from Pueen.  Plates are etched perfectly, I never have problems picking up the design even with a hard stamper.</li>
            <li> This are great stamp plates . Love them , I can only recommend them. The heart collection is impressive but it also has a little bit of everything,the majority is hearts so .</li>
            <li> Love the quality and the images</li>
            <li> disappointed with this. The cut outs are so very cute but I was only able to get one out of each plate to work. I tried and tried and just couldn&#x27;t. I use this idea with other brands and couldn&#x27;t get this one to work. So I returned it very disappointed. I tried Cheeky jumbo plate and that one has worked great. I think the designs on this are just not deep enough.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, even though doesn&#x27;t come in with instructions went through (u tube) I really enjoy using it...</li>
            <li> unable to get stamper to work</li>
            <li> So many cute designs!  I love them!  Delivery was quick and order is as expected.</li>
            <li> I bought the first set of Pueen plates &amp; was not too happy with them, and hesitated on buying these. I am very happy with these plates, they stamp much better than the other set &amp; have beautiful designs. I would recommend these for anyone who loves to have pretty nails!</li>
            <li> Beautiful set of stamping plates! I am so glad that I purchased these! They stamp clear and transfer on to nails wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This plates is amazing. The designs are gorgeous. This pack is better than the first pack of Pueen. I really recommend.</li>
            <li> These plates are of course very famous and popular, and I love them too. There is a nice range of very feminine styles, from floral lace to butterflies and other stuff like that. They stamp well and come in their own little organizer.</li>
            <li> I really like this set. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. They stamp well and I excited to add them to my collection. They came with a holder, but I removed them and placed them in my Bundle Monster plate case. The fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> With so many different brands out, I wasn&#x27;t sure which to buy.  These came in a nice case to hold them all.  So far all of the designs we&#x27;ve used have stamped well.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> Such a nice product!  I am still learning but cant wait to try all the fabulous stamp art.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I really like the variety of the designs and the handy case.</li>
            <li> I have many sets of stamping plates and I have to say that my favorites hands down are the Pueen!  They are not thin and flimsy like others I have and they work the best with the least amount of effort.  Picking up the image with any stamper is a breeze and they clean easily.  I have 4 sets of this brand and I will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> For the first time someone packaged some plates in a super cute leather like case where you can pull out each of the plates and show them before deciding which one you want to use. convenient and innovative. I wound up buying another case and there bigger case that houses I think 132 plates! in Hot Pink. Great Deal</li>
            <li> Came very fast, images pick up well..easy to use!</li>
            <li> Came very quickly and I&#x27;m very happy with my order.</li>
            <li> I have several stamping plate sets -- BM, Red Angel, Mash &amp; Winstonia -- and while I like them as well, these Pueen plates are the best out of all of them. Both this set and their original are great, I love most of the designs and they stamp very well. Definitely recommend them!</li>
            <li> I love these plates! I am brand new to stamping. I also ordered the Konad double stamper, which works great. I watched several you tube videos, and was able to pick it up right away. Only certain nail polishes will work (opaque ones). I have done a mani using the owls and a paisley-type design. They turned out great. I would recommend watching you tube tutorials first and googling which polishes will work, or ordering special stamping polishes. There are so many cute desins, I will be experimenting for a long time</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them. All the designs on the plates are well cut and aligned. The images are clear and even if you use a thin nail polish they are well picked. Also, they are really pretty and original. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Every design that I&#x27;ve tried has worked beautifully. Great image sizes that are big enough to fit my thumb nail.  Mine came with a slightly different case than shown. Mine was light blue and round.  Love it just the same and am very happy with this purchase.  Will be looking forward to more plates from Pueen in the future.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like writing negative reviews, but hopefully this will help someone who is new to nail stamping.&lt;br /&gt;I really didn&#x27;t know much about stamping so I ordered this with stamper and scrapper set (different brand). For some reason I could not get the stamping procedure to work for me. After a little research and more trail and error, I discovered that these discs are just not the quality needed to get a clear stamp on the nail. The disc may look like all of the others, but I don&#x27;t believe the etching is deep enough to get a clear stamp.&lt;br /&gt;I threw these out after purchasing a Konad set (and new scrapper/stamper set) and finally got a perfect result!</li>
            <li> I love these plates!  There are so many cute designs!  It definitely takes a lot of practice to get the transfer process just right though.  This is a great product if you are efficient in nail stamping already or if you are willing to take the time to learn.  My friend and I spent a little over two hours playing around with these, but I do feel I&#x27;m getting better at it and am overall satisfied with my purchase.  It came with a cute leather case they were all filed so neatly in, I was impressed by that.  The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I feel like the designs could have been etched into the plates a little deeper, some of them are pretty shallow and I have a hard time getting the picture to transfer.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations on this product, when I tried to do the transfer from the plates to the nail, the nail polish didn&#x27;t stick at all on the plates or the rubber stamp. Won&#x27;t recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I got this set specifically for one of the star designs, its hard to use the other plates in this set and my other plates I own because I just love the stars so much! But this set has very nice full nail designs, prettier than most.  I have incorporated them into MANY designs, especially over gradients it looks incredible.The designs on this set are really nice, there&#x27;s lots of generic hearts you can use whenever not just Valentine&#x27;s Day which is great, I like hearts year round, right now my nails are stamped with one of the heart designs from this set and there are a few specifically for Valentine&#x27;s Day like they have words written into the design, the plates stamp decent, the designs are deep enough, they pick up well, etc. When I ordered it, mine even came with a free case which was really nice and better than what other companies offer. I would buy this brand again if there&#x27;s another set with designs I like.</li>
            <li> happy with all the designs, theres a lot of them, good quality, fast delivery, i just loved them, i&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love them all but there were many that I did love. They worked as needed with a stamping set. This would be a perfect gift for girls that love to do their nails. I am a 26 year old woman who loves nails and I have found a few creative ways to make beautiful nails with this set.</li>
            <li> I love this set, the images are all so pretty and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any defects/problems that actually affect the stamp (though there was some discoloration on a few plates). I haven&#x27;t tried out all of the images, but the ones that I have tried have all been easy to use and stamp.</li>
            <li> Loved the price but stamps don&#x27;t come out clearly and some don&#x27;t work at all not a consistent product all the time</li>
            <li> Awful product does not work at all. The nail polish wont even transfer to stamper. biggest waste of money ever.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about trying yet another stamping company, but these images are clear, easy to stamp, and there&#x27;s something for everyone in this set! The case that comes with the set takes a bit getting used to, I am used to having my plates displayed side-by-side, but it&#x27;s a great solution for travel, and keeping them in an easy, compact and organized place.  I will try to upload a photo of my latest mani using one of these plates.</li>
            <li> None of the plates are deep enough to hold paint and stamp. Waisted my money on this one,don&#x27;t buy this product</li>
            <li> I love these plates. they stamp smoothly and the designs are very unique. I highly recommend these for anyone collecting stamping plates!</li>
            <li> Came on time. Love the designs. Totally recommend!!</li>
            <li> I love the variety of patterns included here, and the plates hold up very well to repeated use.  These stamp plates mostly feature designs that cover that ar4e made to cover the nail so if your looking for cute little designs this is not the collection for you.</li>
            <li> This nail art is fun for all but I&#x27;m having a really hard time transferring the designs from the plates to my nails. But the plates are amazing and beautiful. I love all the choices of hearts and butterflies and roses and think the plates are really beautifully designed. It&#x27;s a real bonus that they came in a nice leather case with a large snap holding it together. I recommend this product if you have the time to perfect the art of nail stamping.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for new plate sets, and this one is nice.  It has a lot of different designs and most of them are nice.</li>
            <li> Works great, quality stamping plates. I like the variety of designs in this collection, very feminine and cute. Quick shipping also. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Took awhile to get the hang of it, but after watching a few videos on youtube and some practice I love it.</li>
            <li> I am new in stamping nail art, and this set is the first for me. Purchased it with  PUEEN Nail Art Super Soft Squishy Silicone Stamper it came in one week. I cleaned them both with acetone remover and got the image transfered on my second try on the Stamper and on the nail, just need some more practice. I used one simple nail polish that has thicker consistency.&lt;br /&gt;So much exited I was to receive this purchase, and it did not let me down, thank you Pueen and Amazon, definitely going to extend my collection of plates.  : )</li>
            <li> My sister does nail art for a living but she is super busy and our schedules dont work.  I wanted to get nail art done for my daughters and myself, but didnt want to spend a fortune.  I ordered these with low expectations.  Boy was I surprised!  They are well made and there are SO many designs to choose from.  We had a blast painting and stamping our nails.  It took a few tries to get but once we got it down we were able to finish each hand in under 5 minutes.  We can now have beautiful nail art without visiting a salon!!  Perfect!</li>
            <li> Ordered these with a gift card, very satisfied. Great designs, although I have a hard time with the case, it&#x27;s not a deal breaker. I just don&#x27;t use it. All transfer well.</li>
            <li> Love them and they work well</li>
            <li> It is a nice set, but many plates were scratched before they placed the blue plastic.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with these plates. The images are unique and crisp. I would recommend these plates to everyone.</li>
            <li> but the price is pretty high.</li>
            <li> So far these plates are awesome. I love the variety of images and the price is great. I use plastic razor blades for scraping because the metal one I have seems to scratch these more than the Konad plates. Not as clean of an image sometimes but I don&#x27;t want to ruin my plates. You could also use an old credit card too which I did before a got the blades.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about how these would be but there were a few images I had to have so I got this set and have been very happy, no issues with anything at all, a wide variety and they stamp well</li>
            <li> This is a very cute collection comes with a great holding case at a great price many cute designs .</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved my nail designs with these. They&#x27;re great designs. The plates scratch easily though. The plastic backing erodes off in one use with acetone, but the glue says on - yuck. The protective film coating removed easily - easier than other brands. I like the storage case. Nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s summer break and I have a lot of time so I decided to try stamping and they are AWESOME! works great!</li>
            <li> So nice and love how it comes with a case. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> From my wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The etchings on the plates are very, very shallow.  It&#x27;s difficult to get the polish to stay in the design while scraping hard enough to get the surface of the plate clean.  The images that you can get to work, mainly the small, single images, are very light.  The patterns with the more intricate details are so shallow that the polish dries before you can get it onto the stamp and then your nails. The stamp that goes with this, broke on the first use so I would also not recommend Pueen brand stampers.  That&#x27;s another review though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates are made of a nice metal and comes covered in blue cellophane, which came off easily.  The provided case makes for an excellent looking product upon first sight.  The designs themselves are beautiful and there is a nice variety.  I just wish the images were cut deeper into the plate so that you can get a nice design every time.  I watched several videos on stamping and used other suggestions like scraping with different items and at varying angles and several different polish brands.  Quick dry polish of any kind is impossible to use with these plates.</li>
            <li> i just started stamping and these plates are awesome!!! there is so much variety that it will take a while for me to use all the images :)</li>
            <li> Love these plates work wonderful love them.</li>
            <li> Sturdy plates, nice designs and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this order. I ordered this and the Pureen Buffet stamping set at the same time. I got them quickly. They seem to be etched well except for 1 image on 1 plate. From what I&#x27;ve seen of others who have used that image, they have had issues with etching on that one too. The details are so fine, I think it&#x27;s just hard to etch it deep enough without making it too deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase. This was my first from Pureen and I will order from them again if/when they have more new plates.</li>
            <li> I just got my pueen set and one of my plate was bent but love the plate they come out clear.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet. I am looking very forward to start decorating nails with them. My friends can&#x27;t wait, either.</li>
            <li> Love the designs, and so far everything comes out very clear!</li>
            <li> Such a good combo of plates!  Love the case will keep for a long time!</li>
            <li> so much fun to use. a lot of wonderful stamps to make your nail look great.</li>
            <li> These are great! I received 24 nail stamping plates in a nice leather organizer.  The stamps are highly detailed with large images.  I&#x27;m greatly pleased.  They are just as good in quality as my konad plates.</li>
            <li> These plates are really good! They work just as well as the Konad brand and are much cheaper. I&#x27;ve bought other &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; brands of image plates and some images will work well, others won&#x27;t work at all, and some will transfer onto the nail very lightly. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with these. I will definitely be buying more image plates from this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, well packaged.  I love this set. Very cute, durable, has the backing so no possible cuts. Stamps very clear cut deep enough for full detail even the tiniest detail works well.  Would recommend. 5 stars and have used!</li>
            <li> This is the first set of stamp stamping plates that I brought and I absolutely love them</li>
            <li> Great set and nice case. Love all the designs. Good quality and love playing with them</li>
            <li> Wife and daughter get plenty of use out of these. They love them</li>
            <li> All of the plates were already in the case, but still had their protective blue wrappers on them, so everything was unharmed.  The images are fantastic and stamp really well.  I would recommend these, especially to beginners.  Since it comes with storage and lots of variety, you will get a kick out of it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used all of them yet but the ones I used worked good</li>
            <li> I tried using these last night. I had a hard time picking an image, lot of nice designs.&lt;br /&gt;I had a hard time picking up a few images, but I think that&#x27;s because of the worn out stamper and not the plates.</li>
            <li> Awesome plates and case. There are so many design choices. Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my collection.  It was easier to get the hang of it once I started using the correct type of polish.  Two thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> It takes time and practice, some of the designs do not work, other are very small (like for your pinky nail)  - after you master it, it is cool</li>
            <li> First the caveat. My set arrived missing two plates (33 &amp; 44) which after contacting customer service they were unable to replace. They did offer a generous discount due to the missing plates but it is a disappointment not to have the full set I ordered and few choices to replace them. So be aware this may happen to you as well and decide if its worth it to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the plates I do have. Though I haven&#x27;t had a chance to play with very many of them yet what I have used has transferred well. My \\&quot;gold standard\\&quot; stamping polish is A-England Excalibur (the original version) when testing plates. For my stamper I use either a Born Pretty Store or the small end of the Salon Express duo if that helps any of you. The images with larger voids scrape better with a metal scraper otherwise an expired gift card works best for me. This is my second full set of stamping plates (I started out buying singles till I was sure I could do it) and I look forward to many fun manicures ahead.</li>
            <li> While they aren&#x27;t konad(the best!), they work pretty well and I still get lots of compliments.  For the price you really can&#x27;t beat them</li>
            <li> This plates are great, they are unique and the price is right and images get picked up well with any nail polish</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Lots of design to do for endless designs...</li>
            <li> Use the templates and got so many compliments on my nails.</li>
            <li> I can not figure out how to contact the seller. plates 47, 45, 31, 26 each have images on them that do not pick up. The one I am most concerned about is pueen 47. the music notes is the reason I purchased this plate set.&lt;br /&gt;all other images I tried stamped beautifully,  I was hoping to have at least pueen 47 image replaced.</li>
            <li> Fabulous collection!!! So many wonderful designs, all come off easily, and are bigger than needed to allow for perfect coverage on the entire nail. They came in this cute book-style case with individual plastic sleeves that&#x27;s super handy for looking through the plates, and easy to store as well.</li>
            <li> Tested and proved efforless.</li>
            <li> I am new to stamping and these are so much fun to use!!!  I really like them, and have found that the designs are, on the whole, the right size for my nails.  Very nice and easy to store as they arrived in their own little leather-like pouch.</li>
            <li> I really was excited to get these. I think these plates are cool and had lots of fun designs - even holiday specific! It definitely depends on what nail polish you use with these. You can use any polish for the base, but to use on the plate, you need a more expensive polish. The 1.99 revlon did not work I would slide it across and try to get it on my stamp and nothing. Wouldn&#x27;t even pick up or it was super patchy and didn&#x27;t catch the whole design. I don&#x27;t think you need to get the &amp;#34;nail plate polish&amp;#34; but use a thicker richer polish if you want a nice print. I love American Apparel. Their polishes are like Paint. Work so well.</li>
            <li> No need to double stamp my thumb!  Be sure to measure your nail beds before ordering.  This will fit most.  I do exhaustive research before ordering and these plates rate very high in overall usefulness.  The patterns stamp clean and there are a variety of patterns ranging from light hearted to elegant.  Stamping takes practice.  Just scrape lighter on the images with more flooded areas to prevent scraping too much polish from the image.  Enjoy.</li>
            <li> I have ordered the pueen plates 1-25 and loves them so i wanted to get the love elements too! these have lots of lacey whimsical images. and a white holding case! this time there was paper at the end of the plastic so the leather didnt stain the plastic! (not like my other one) I got a white case of course, my favorite color! One of my places did have a scratch across it but thats okay because i didnt like those images anyway, also there was discoloration on one of my plates.. ill upload a pic.. Overall Amazing. This set is now added to my collection of Plates!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so great, I actually got another friend to buy this one. The designs all work very nicely-- even the thinner ones.</li>
            <li> I like the plates overall, but I definitely don&#x27;t like how a large number of images look when on the nail.&lt;br /&gt; I mostly got this set because it&#x27;s very reasonably priced. The little case it comes in is really cute.</li>
            <li> I want to give a higher rating because the designs look great, but I had quite a few plates that were really scratched up.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re nice and from what I tried last night, they work well.  That said, I got 2 of #31 and didn&#x27;t get #26.  Not a huge deal, but disappointing.  Could have been worse I&#x27;m sure!</li>
            <li> What a joy was to receive this Pueen set!  The Images from the Love Elements collection are beautiful!  All images are etched very well and come out sharp in stamping.  I have other sets from Pueen and am very happy with this one as well.  Highly recommend them for any nail art lover!</li>
            <li> fast shipping and I love it</li>
            <li> I love these, I bought these along with the Konad stamper and they&#x27;re great together.&lt;br /&gt;Love the pouch that it comes in!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to protect the plates.</li>
            <li> i have all 3 sets and i absolutely love them! great price for them and case together!!</li>
            <li> These image plates have a lot of beautiful designs,  Their whimsy and romantic style is for far more than just Valentines day! For never having heard of the pueen brand I am really pleased with the quality, they are paper backed which helps keep down the sharp edges, etched well and have the typical blue sticker that covers the plates, these come off with great ease unlike some other brands I&#x27;ve seen. The designs are plenty wide and I like that most of the images are for full nails, There aren&#x27;t any french manicure designs and only a few of the tiny ones.  My only complaint is that some of the designs are very busy and you don&#x27;t really realize just how busy they are until you have stamped them. I noticed this especially with one of the rose lace designs, the fish net style in the background made it a little hard to see exactly what it was once stamped.</li>
            <li> Another great set from Pueen! Little on the small side, but high quality.</li>
            <li> I love my plates. They have great designs.</li>
            <li> Love it! My new favorite thing!</li>
            <li> Ok, item not the easiest to use</li>
            <li> Very happy!!  Thank you</li>
            <li> This was a really fun collection.  It is taking a lot of patience and practice to get it right.  Mostly I think the trick is in the polish. Some polishes definitely work better than others.  I am glad I got the set. I had one plate from another brand. This collection was a good price and great selection of graceful designs.</li>
            <li> These are great nail stamps. They work very well and I really like the designs. I would recommend these to others that like to do nail stamping nail art</li>
            <li> The polish you use has to be just right for a good visible application because the imprint of the designs are not very deep.</li>
            <li> Images lift well. Some of these images are super useless to ME.. Some are great... I wish there were more hearts and stars and animal print, but they have other sets!!</li>
            <li> These plates had really nice images.i like the designs,they are so cute and pretty.I gave four stars because some plates have a lot of scratches.now it is so easy for me to give beautiful designs to the customers.This saves my time.These plates are good for long nails.</li>
            <li> Ten (10)plates were scratched but I&#x27;m hoping they will take it back and give an undamaged product because the designs are very cute and I love the small case. Will change rating if problem is resolved.</li>
            <li> reached perfectly, which is what I got paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good I will continue purchasing this product has been very good</li>
            <li> Such pretty design, will be ordering newer items.</li>
            <li> Wife is very happy with this item, fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> good . love it. well packaged.</li>
            <li> Worst thing I have ever bought on Amazon. Does not work at all, the stamp was not able to get a thing from it. Too shallow, so when you put the nail polish on the pattern - it dries out in seconds.</li>
            <li> I like these, because they are small enough to fit on the stamp, and the nail, it&#x27;s a great beginner set for this reason.  I have others that use the entire plate, and it can get confusing.. and messy.. this keeps the designs clear and easy to decide which ones to use.  You can easily to all nails the same with these, for this reason.  I like having both styles of plates to choose from.. these are a great variety of designs, I can&#x27;t wait to use them!  Case is cute, and compact.</li>
            <li> Been wanting stamps for a while desided to give these a try, really good stamps. Lots of diff designs, easy to clean, love the pouch they come in.</li>
            <li> These plates are very beautiful with lots of original images. They arrived very quickly in the new case by Pueen. Plate 43 was off center ,but, after contacting the seller they shipped me a new one with no muss or fuss Very happy. The Plates stamp beautifully. You will be very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> These were just as they seem. Nice prints and they worked very well. I will be buying more as soon as new ones are offered.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful set of images. Well etched. I have not had any issues transferring these images to my nails. The full size images will fit even the largest of nail beds. These are really unique plates that I have not seen anywhere else so you are sure not to get duplicates from other kits/manufacturers. Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> WIFE- I just started doing my nails so I am no expert but this is a fun way to start! These plates are really good! The designs are very nice and they have a huge variety. It bought all the plates in a really cute case. The plates were also protected by a blue plastic film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a stamper separately (Konad Nail Art Double Ended Stamper and Scraper) and it works great; the double ended transfer tool is super helpful. The only thing I would recommend is getting a plastic scraper so you don’t scratch your plates because mine scratched a bit with the metal scrapper and I am now using an old credit card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven’t had any problems transferring the polish onto the nail so I haven’t had the need to by any type of special nail polish for this. This is a great way to get really distinct looks in your nails without really doing that much work. I am really enjoying experimenting with colors! It does take a bit of practice but it is not difficult to get started. I have gotten a lot of compliments on my nails!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect for little finger</li>
            <li> Awesome plates! Came in a cute vinyl case with clear sachets for each of the plates! Nice WIDE images which I love! I have big/wide nail beds (especially my thumbs) Nice etching and amazing designs! I stamp every 2 days so I&#x27;m so giddy to use these babys!! It&#x27;s odd I haven&#x27;t heard of this brand before and I own all the plates by all the different makers. Might be one of the best kept secretes! Excited to upload some pictures soon!</li>
            <li> Everythin is good and the shipment in it best condition, thanks 👌</li>
            <li> Nice large sized full nail stamps. They transfer to the nail quite well and have a wide variety of unique designs. Definitely will be buying other PUEEN stamping collections. Prefer them over Konad in quality and in price.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus, they come in a cute little case and shipping is quick.</li>
            <li> I have never had a Pueen plate before but, despite wanting one so bad I decided to wait. When I finally gathered enough courage to get it I had to wait,even further because only this set was available (and not the one I originally wanted) so once both of them were available (1-49) I jumped right one and I am happy that I did! This set was far beyond what I expected and the case it came in was so convenient. I had heard that persons said in other brands that some plates might not stamp well so I decided to test every last image and it stamped excellently! But, that still didn&#x27;t stop me from slicing my finger open. I didn&#x27;t know what it was that sharp but I am meticulous when it comes with cleaning the plates after use so that might have been my doing but, just a fair warning, be careful with the edges. Aside from that, I am pleasantly pleases with it and I use it every two weeks when I change my pedicure. The images are the biggest I have seen (I have the first generation Winstonia as well as Pueen Plate 1-25) and I was so happy because I have medium-long nails and, when I tested them out, they fit better than I expected (only tried Winstonia at the time). I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time, crappy stencils. Polish comes out of stencil when scraped.</li>
            <li> plates are beautiful as always the only reason I am giving a lower review is 4 of them were scratched through the designs, visibly enough to show up after removing the blue film and one was dented luckily not in on image.</li>
            <li> I love that these plates have large designs and a lot of variety. I have had no difficulty in transferring images from the plates. I highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li> An amazing set for an affordable price... Delicate images that stamp flawlessly for everyday nail art... Thank you Pueen :)</li>
            <li> These plates are excellent and high quality.  They need to be used with a high quality nail stamping paint, I use konad special paint. The base coat can be any color or brand. The top clear coat should be a high quality pain for best results.</li>
            <li> Nice plates. Great to use during Valentine&#x27;s Day or any day.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Easy to do and it was excatly what I was looking for. Transfer came off easily.</li>
            <li> Good, but it requires a lot of practice.</li>
            <li> The images r bit small for my nails because I have really long nails bt it can fit short to medium length nails perfectly. The images stamp perfectly fine n crisp. Im really happy with this new addition to my nailart stash</li>
            <li> I have the first set of pueen plates as well. This manufacture has it figured out. This second set works great just like the first. Although this set is more feminine than the other one. The full nail designs are large but they do not have the moon shape at the bottom for French tips like their first set. Images transfer beautifully comparable to Konad. It also comes it a cute case. If you love nail art like me, it is a must for your collection. Check out my nail art slide show.&lt;br /&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;8mI6RWODtc0&amp;feature&#x3D;youtube_gdata_player</li>
            <li> This is the first nail stamping set I have used, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands.  However, after only a couple of minutes of figuring things out I was able to stamp crisp, beautiful images.</li>
            <li> I love these plates. The images stamp very nice and clean. They are large enough to cover my whole nail. There is also a large variety of unique designs. I love the cute little case they came in as well. I can easily say that this brand has become my favorite as far as stamping plates go.&lt;br /&gt;Other brands that i have purchased had designs that were way too small to use on any of my nails and that were repeated on other plates and even other brands. The images on these other brands stamped very sloppily or not at all.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that I did not receive plate #45. Instead, I got two #46 plates. I still plan on purchasing the other set of plates very soon.</li>
            <li> After using this set, I can say that the quality is wonderful and the variety of images is fresh and fun.  I will definitely be watching for new sets from this maker!</li>
            <li> I am super happy with my purchased. I really liked all the designs and they work really good. I have used them with the special nail stamping polish and regular nail polish and has work really good. I recommend this bundle of stamping plates</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying nail stamping and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These plates were easy to use when paired with Konad nail stamper and scraper. I like the designs and the full nail designs were big enough for all my fingers and even for my big toes. You can see this in the picture, but it doesn&#x27;t come with any french tip designs which I would have liked. The edges are NOT sharp, which I was worried about since I have heard that complaint for other cheap sets. This also comes with a great case that looks nice &amp; sturdy, holds all the pieces and is can be flipped through. It comes with a blue film that makes it hard to see the designs so I took off all the films right away- I recommend using a nail file to \\&quot;grab\\&quot; the edge of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value, I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love the designs. The plates are great quality. The designs are deep so the polish does not scrap off when scraping the excess polish. Very easy to use and it comes with an awesome case.</li>
            <li> the size of the designs is wonderful whereas other companies are very small and don&#x27;t cover the whole nail.  i love PUEEN and cant wait to buy more!</li>
            <li> Some designs pick up on my konad stamper while others don&#x27;t. I was trying to do mermaid nails but how ironic my mermaid plate won&#x27;t stamp. That&#x27;s the reason I got the plates and for other designs. But now I can&#x27;t do my mermaid design. Not happy and not @ all what I expected.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these!!  Probably her favorite gift.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed! Only 1-2 stamps on each plate works! It was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift. I love it. Works really well, just took about an hour of practice before I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Pueen really built on their strengths of their first set, and improved their techniques and style to deliver a great new set. The set is full of great, fun, and sophisticated designs, which are very well executed. In their older set, they tried to cram too much into too little space for a few designs, and the results were murky. With these, all of the designs are crisp while keeping some level of intricacy where needed. There is a nice wide range of styles in the set, and the full nail designs measure in at 1.5 x 2 cm, so will fit a lot of nails (those of us with bigger thumbs often have to get creative, but it&#x27;s easier with these). All of my plates are etched perfectly - deep enough but not too deep, and many are now my most favorite and most-used plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really looking forward to seeing what Pueen does next with stamping plates!</li>
            <li> I started doing art on my nails and was looking for plates to use. I&#x27;ve read through many reviews and decided that Pueen had pretty good reviews so I bought this set. I like the plates very much. They work great. That being said, the only problem I have is that I wish there was a way that you could buy individual plates. There are many plates in the pack that I would never use and I feel its such a waste of money. Great plates though and they definitely work great.</li>
            <li> I will give this a 10 star ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</li>
            <li> I love these stamps,they transfer very good. Great different designs comes with them in a nice case. I only had a few of other brands that cost much more and wasn&#x27;t sure the transfer would be good,but it does nicely..🎀</li>
            <li> Cute nail art! However, there should be a disclaimer that the stamp doesn&#x27;t come included just the actual art plates.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping. The item even came with the holding case. Worked great</li>
            <li> Beautiful and the designs are awesome...i&#x27;m about to use my Plates by tomorrow. I know it&#x27;s gonna turn out great</li>
            <li> These make some pretty fun designs and totally worth it as long as you have some patience! As stubborn as I am, I decided not to purchase the nail polish I am &amp;#34;Supposed&amp;#34; to be using, instead I am making sure that the nail polish I use in thick, that way it doesn&#x27;t dry so quick while im creating stamps.</li>
            <li> WOW, these are great quality. They stamp very well. the images are clear and the fine detail is great. You wont be disappointed with this set</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and loved that it came in its own little snap case!</li>
            <li> As much is i absolutely love this product there is one con: not ideal for really long nails (which i don&#x27;t have but plan on growing out my nails). Other than that there are so many designs on this plate for your heart&#x27;s desires. check out some youtube videos and you&#x27;ll see how amazing this product is.. also google some pictures. i also recommend nail striping tapes. pretty soon you&#x27;ll be making some awesome designs. highly recommend for average nail length and shorter.</li>
            <li> The selection and case of Pueen plates are very nice. I like them better than Konad plate selection and at least Pueen gives you a storage case. Pueen images are large enough to cover your whole nail.</li>
            <li> This was pleasing to the eyes for the fact that the presentation is so pretty. Different from the other plates I have collected which usually just come wrapped in plastic. The designs are very pretty on each and every plate. I wasn&#x27;t going to purchase any more plates but when I saw someone reviewing this collection on YouTube I caved in and got them. Didn&#x27;t have any problems with my order and I checked all the plates.</li>
            <li> I bought this set just for one specific image but they are all very nice and useful. There are a few cheesy images but it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;love elements&amp;#34; so that&#x27;s to be expected. All in all, a great buy and I would recommend it to any nail stamping lover.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work at all!!!!! I wasted sooooo much money!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great designs, work great. My first stamping set and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> Love these plates! All the images are beautiful and nicely etched. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more Pueen plates!</li>
            <li> They came early which was great, and I just love these! There are so many \\&quot;full nail\\&quot; images that are elegant and usable....</li>
            <li> These stamping plates from Pueen are nice. I love the designs on the image plates. When stamping the image transfers to the stamper nice and clean. Love the little booklet holder the plates fit into. Great for if you want to travel with your nail supplies.</li>
            <li> Having so much fun decorating my nails.</li>
            <li> Exelent quality! They stamp as Good as konad ones! I love them! I would like to buy the one I like and not the set because lot of them are not beautifull for me, but I think its not posible!  Realy nice quality! And big size to make it in any nail!</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife. I also have a Mash set of stampers. I love those, but I was looking and saw the designs on these and love them!!! So I got them. They took a few tries but I finally got the hang of it. But I will say my MASH set stamps a little better. I think the engravings are just a little bit deeper on those. But I really love this set. Just do it really fast or the polish will dry and give it a couple tries.</li>
            <li> These came in pretty quick, I had no problems with scratches on the plates or anything like that. They clean well and transfer well. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with half the image on the stamp and the other half on the plate. Good assortment of images to choose from.</li>
            <li> I love these stamp plates. I am new to stamping and these plates are so easy to use. They wipe clean very easily after use and have beautiful designs. Who would have thought I could have such beautiful nail designs done at home. I am on a very tight budget and find it hard to spend the money to have my nails done professionally. With these plates, I can have beautiful nail designs cheaply. They are a great value for the price and will last forever. I do recommend that you do not use a metal scraper on these as they will scratch. I use the pueen plastic scraper or any old gift card will also do the trick nicely. In addition to the plates, they come with a nice pouch with sleeves for each individual plate. This is wonderful to keep all the plates safe and together. This is a must have set. I love this set so much, I have even decided to do my nails myself next summer for my wedding along with my maid of honor and bridesmaids. So exciting. Thank you for an awesome product.</li>
            <li> Great addition to my collection of stamps.</li>
            <li> Very nice designs so many options..cheaper than konad</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for one of my daughters and she really likes the diversity of the stamping options. Among the images are flowers, stars, a cat, coffee mugs, floral patterns, lace, etc. Some of the images do not transfer very well but this problem might be fixed with a different stamper. The stamping plates came inside a white case and are individually covered with thin, blue plastic sheets to avoid scratching. Overall my daughter enjoyed this product and now has a different technique of doing nail art.</li>
            <li> Lots of different and cute designs! Very vert small slight scratch on surface of ONE plate but doesnt effect stamping!! Very satisfied and can&#x27;t wait to try all the designs.</li>
            <li> For a first time user I had to get the hang of it but now I have it. They are pretty good.</li>
            <li> Overall I like this set but one plate was off center to where the image was half off the plate. I am in a stamping group and someone else had the very same problem however hers was worse. My plate can still be used so I will not do a return or exchange but Im hoping they start inspecting the plates before sending them out.</li>
            <li> These plates are working very well, the images came out neatly. I didn&#x27;t have any problem transferring the images from the plates to the paper or the nails.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a lot of new images in this set, some are very unique and cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this new set from Pueen, I liked the quality and variety of designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complete review with pictures:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Got duplicates but still happy with product.</li>
            <li> I oove this brand and all the designs I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> So I have been doing this nail thing for 3 yrs now. I have just about every brand out there. So needless to say I have some good plates and So plates so badly done (image won&#x27;t stamp &amp;/or sharp edges) I also know about a good price to pay for plates. When I first saw these plates I thought the price was a little high. But it comes in a \\&quot;real\\&quot; case. Not a paper box stating it was a case but a real leather case with each plate is inside its own sheet protector. The image is so deeply edged in you can feel it completely with just your fingers. I also got the 1st set of Pueen plates (1-25) The plates are not as deeply edges but if you use a higher end or stamping polish you wont even know. I got one in a orange case (my 2nd fav color) and the other one is white. Outside of #34 plate having a really deep and large scratch in it (can&#x27;t use 2 images) the plates are sweet. The images are great. I&#x27;m waiting for the Ankh (an Egyptain Cross) and the Triquetra (a Celtic Trinity Knot) to be the new images on next set of plates to come out. The price is a little high but you are paying for what you get. You get high quality plates and a protective case to hold your plates in. Good buy. There should be a frequent customer discount or lighten up on the price for the next sets.</li>
            <li> check your records, I already reviewed this product.  Check your records, please, this is getting a tad annoying. I did this already</li>
            <li> I got this set super fast with the prime shipping. The nail plates come in the gorgeous, compact leather case. These designs are definitely the best ones out of the major brands that I already have. Designs transfer very clean. Ordering the other set today.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these nail stamps. They are perfectly etched and durable. One of my smartest buys. Definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the designs!!  They stamp clear and arrived sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> Great variety of designs</li>
            <li> I love these Pueen stamping plates!  The designs are great and I especially love that they come in their own storage/travel cases.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what designs they come out with next!</li>
            <li> There are a few of things I really like about this set: 1) The images are unique and not the same typical designs you find from one set to the next; 2) They are full size designs, meaning they don&#x27;t have the curved french tip built into them, which also means they fit longer nails; and 3) The images stamp fabulously!!! This was definitely a good buy for me and I look forward to seeing what else they come up with next!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE the new Love Elements stamp collection!  GREAT assortment shipped in a wonderful little case, perfect for storage!  Awesome number of designs!  Each plate has unique images which go tiogether wonderfully.  Both full-nail and single image designs included.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> I really love all the designs, so pretty &amp; interesting. They are different enough from other plates to inspire different looks easily. I love that they are larger than average &amp; cover my large nails nicely. I also love, love, love the case they came in. I wish all plates came with such a holder like this.</li>
            <li> Many cutes design, and really easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am in love with Pueen Plates! And love the cute case to store them in!</li>
            <li> these work great! I had some Konad stamping plates and didn&#x27;t like them that much, they just didn&#x27;t work well. But these transferred great and for the price you get a lot of beautiful and cute designs. I totally recommend!</li>
            <li> did not give 5 stars because not all images stamp perfectly. But overall very happy with this purchase. have bought more pueen stamp sets since.</li>
            <li> Only giving it three stars because I have not used it yet but I like the size of the stamps and the case for all the discs. I will recap on my review after I try a few.</li>
            <li> Great set of plates. Love that they come with a case. Good designs and crisp, clear images.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product was exactly as stated</li>
            <li> Received these today, and I already tried some plates out. They have really cute designs. I can&#x27;t wait to do my nails again</li>
            <li> had these stamps for some time now and all the stamps I&#x27;ve tried out all worked and came out perfectly. nice set.</li>
            <li> these are wonderful, all come out clean on the stamp...so many I just love them</li>
            <li> These are adorable designs and good quality designs if you have a good stamper!</li>
            <li> When I saw these plates I had to have them. I really liked all the images and having bought the first set of Pueen plates I didn&#x27;t think there would be any issues with the quality. I was right :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping time was reasonable, ordered on 8th May and received on 14th May. When the plates came, they came in a white plastic pueen envelope inside a bubble padded shipping envelope so they were well packaged to avoid damage. One of the plates the first one had a deep scrape across it (this had to have happened prior to shipping) but that was only on the plastic, the plate itself was undamaged.The case I got was white and it was perfectly fine no damage no discolouration and very cute. The little screw on the bottom was a bit loose but I understand that this can be tightened. The little plastic envelopes inside the case were quite flimsy, it felt like the slightest thing and they would tear but since I have something else to store my plates in that doesn&#x27;t matter to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates are the standard plate size but they are ever so slightly thinner than a Konad plate The edges are rounded so its not sharp like some others. There are different sized full nail images all of which are way bigger than the images on my other plates (used Konad M057 to compare). Most of the images are wide enough to just cover my nails but I do have wider nail beds so it will be more than large enough for most people. The images were all really nice, in fact out of all the plates there are probably one of two IMAGES that I might not use. The images are sharp and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all good quality plates, pretty images and a nice case.</li>
            <li> I love the variaty of designs in this set. The images come out crisp and clean everytime. I have this set as well as the first one and love them both!</li>
