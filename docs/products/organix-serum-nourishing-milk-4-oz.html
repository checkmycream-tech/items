    <ol>
            <li>Still like the CHI silk infusion the best  </li>
            <li>ends the best.</li>
            <li>ITS wonderful!</li>
            <li>I got this product at Walmart and wanted to share how awesome it was.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Excellent, excellent product!!!!</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful consistency.  </li>
            <li>This is just great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>Could tell it was a great product the moment it touched my hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter if this will make my hair look great or not.</li>
            <li>And it smells great, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This product is great for me.</li>
            <li>It smells great, too.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of an explanation as to why this is (insight/comments are welcome).</li>
            <li>It smells good too.</li>
            <li>You can use it before or after blowdrying your hair, smells good, and I&#x27;ve been using it for 1 1/2 weeks now and</li>
            <li>and I loved</li>
            <li>A great find, and quite addicting to want to keep touching my hair after I apply it.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Because I spend a lot of money for amazing highlights.</li>
            <li>Then I tried Jonathans Dirt product -- kind of worked but still got some fraying.</li>
            <li>and my hair visiably looks soooo much better.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put more than a drop or two on thought it will make hair oily.</li>
            <li>Better than Moroccan Oil-  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t want to invest a lot in a product that I wasn&#x27;t sure would work.)</li>
            <li>just love this stuff to control and relax my curls.</li>
            <li>This product will leave your hair, soft, sleek, straighter, no frizz, full of body, not greasy, smells great, and looking 110% healthier!</li>
            <li>excellent product for dry or brittle hair</li>
            <li>This works great to encourage my hair to be straighter, and it helps make my hair strong, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li>After distributing through my hair, I rub my hands on my knees and heels - the oil is light and not sticky.</li>
            <li>This product is the best serum I have ever used after reading a few</li>
            <li>The only pro is that it does smell amazing.</li>
            <li>Normally oil-based therapies work wonders on my dry, wavy hair but this stuff wasn&#x27;t so great.</li>
            <li>The jury is out on the true product abilities of the coconut oil, but I would recommend buying it at a local store for more quality assurance than through the Amazon distributors.</li>
            <li>An absolute god send!</li>
            <li>Maybe better for someone with coarse or curly hair.</li>
            <li>First I noticed my hair seemed to be thinning in spots and my scalp felt dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it- made my curly, frizzy hair silky, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not at all what a real keratin blowout would be like, but for me it has definitely made a positive difference!</li>
            <li>I have medium length lightly curly red hair.</li>
            <li>if I want it straight</li>
            <li>I blow it straight and sometimes fat iron.</li>
            <li>Just really unsightly.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>This in the humid Chicago summer air with hair that is very weather-sensitive.</li>
            <li>The product I received from this vendor has been filled with what seems like a 1:2 ratio of water and actual serum.</li>
            <li>I have type-3a fine, curly hair that I often blow dry</li>
            <li>I will still use this more for everyday use to not use my CHI product so fast  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I would imagine it is probably OK as a pre-flat iron serum for normal hair that is not color treated, and does not require deep conditioning on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I went a whole summer using this product, purchasing it from a local CVS for a slightly higher price</li>
            <li>I can live with that.</li>
            <li>still have that same Amazon bottle because I stopped using the product consistently.</li>
            <li>John Frieda brillian brunette worked ok but its impossible to find any more.</li>
            <li>I believe oil is known to fade color, but if so, this should be clearly stated somewhere on the packaging - that it is not recommended for color treated hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>and my natural highlights are showing through a bit, and I haven&#x27;t been in the sun at all--</li>
            <li>The results were shiny soft hair.</li>
            <li>leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I tried using just a tiny amount but even then, it was too much.</li>
            <li>The anti-breakage serum truly controls the frizz on my natural curls.</li>
            <li>It also relaxes them and makes my curls silky soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;have sensitive skin be ware that this product may cause hair lost and blister your scalp.</li>
            <li>I initially suspected this when I last purchased this product from them and it felt a little more like liquid than a serum.</li>
            <li>Instead of absorbing evenly and adding shine/moisture, this treatment clumped together and made my hair look oily and wet.</li>
            <li>This Brazilian Keratin Serum worked well for my med-thick normal to dry hair  </li>
            <li>This majorly fades color - brunette, red, toned blonde, over time.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s quite apparent to me that this particular vendor has been watering down their products.</li>
            <li>, I think you should alternate this product with heat protectant products because I thinks it dries out your hair with frequent use and will wear your hair down with frequent use.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s the only pre-blow dry treatment that works on my coarse short hair.</li>
            <li> As for STRAIGHTENING, I have tried this serum along with the flat-iron spray to flat-iron my hair and leave it straightened, however this does not leave my hair silky and glossy straight like it did when I got the $400 Coppola Brazilian Keratin treatment that lasted about 3 months and lengthened my hair past my bra-line(google before &amp; after pictures of the Coppola keratin treatment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product feels silky and it works well with flat ironing the hair and for keeping the hair feeling silky after blow drying.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so dry for so long as it is now, again, after using this product several times a week for several weeks in a row.</li>
            <li> Also, the bottle lasts a long time as once you put a dab on your hair it spreads alot.</li>
            <li> What a strange product.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s rated a 3/10 on the EWG Skin Deep website (the lower the score, the less potentially harmful to you and the environment.)</li>
            <li> works and lasts a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but before I dry it.</li>
            <li> I woke up this morning my hair dry now</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who is growing their hair out, has fizz, dry hair, fraying, or straightens their hair alot.</li>
            <li> I have very dry/damaged hair and this worked well used approximately 4 times a week for 3-4 weeks, but now my hair seems to be drier than it was before I started using it.</li>
            <li> I noticed a lot of people saying that it actually damaged or dried their hair out</li>
            <li> And lastly Vitamin E oil for the tips seemed to tame my split</li>
            <li> I noticed that it had a different consistency than I was used too- hard to describe, but was far too runny and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> WARNING: DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR!&lt;br /&gt;After purchasing this product from other vendors</li>
            <li> For all you ladies out there with, dry, frizzy, colored, chemically treated, or just plain over-processed hair- This product is your miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Obviously not worth it, though.</li>
            <li> My hair is stronger and is not weighed down as hair grease does.</li>
            <li> I still have a little fraying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the intention of this vendor is other than to make a profit off of their customers, but the fact remains--this vendor is cheating customers out of the product they are supposedly purchasing from them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got platinum blonde all the way to dirty blonde in my hair.</li>
            <li> I put it on towel dried hair like the directions said and waited.</li>
            <li> Usually I don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why, but all I can say is that I use it after straightening my hair to tame flyaway a and to add shine and it works wonders I get compliments on my hair all the time!</li>
            <li> a dirty blonde--</li>
            <li> I had noticed a lot of split ends and frizziness in my hair lately and my hair stylist recommended a Brazilian blowout.</li>
            <li> But all those products are messy and expensive.</li>
            <li> Give it a try; hard to go wrong with 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> I have thin, color-treated hair that drinks this stuff.  </li>
            <li> but I felt like I needed to this time due to all the bad ones..</li>
            <li> The worst offending ingredient is the fragrance because it&#x27;s a potential allergen (I have not had any type of negative reaction to it).</li>
            <li> It turns out it&#x27;s (a) quite expensive and (b) potentially terrible for you (in terms of chemical toxicity).</li>
            <li> I have been trying to grow my hair out after what was 2 HORRIFIC haircuts, and as a result have had split ends that curl and fray.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product feels silky and it works well with flat ironing the hair and for keeping the hair feeling silky after blow drying. But I don&#x27;t think you should use this product every time, I think you should alternate this product with heat protectant products because I thinks it dries out your hair with frequent use and will wear your hair down with frequent use.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and lover it. It makes my hair soft and shiny. It smells good too. I put it on after I wash my hair but before I dry it. I use a dime size amount. After I rub it into my hand I rub the residual from my hand unto my arms and all over my hands. I have medium length lightly curly red hair. I am not trying to straighten my hair. It I want my hair curly I use mousse and if I want it straight I blow it straight and sometimes fat iron.</li>
            <li> * This Brazilian Keratin Serum worked well for my med-thick normal to dry hair  * Still like the CHI silk infusion the best  * I will still use this more for everyday use to not use my CHI product so fast  * A great find, and quite addicting to want to keep touching my hair after I apply it.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to grow my hair out after what was 2 HORRIFIC haircuts, and as a result have had split ends that curl and fray. Just really unsightly. Uncontrollable is the word. I tried bed heads control freak-- didn&#x27;t really work. Then I tried Jonathans Dirt product -- kind of worked but still got some fraying. John Frieda brillian brunette worked ok but its impossible to find any more. And lastly Vitamin E oil for the tips seemed to tame my split ends the best. But all those products are messy and expensive. So I was traveling forgot my vitamin E and picked up the Brazilian Keratin Therapy up at the store to hold me over.  ITS wonderful! You can use it before or after blowdrying your hair, smells good, and I&#x27;ve been using it for 1 1/2 weeks now and last night I washed my hair (did not put in the serum bc I was going to sleep) I woke up this morning my hair dry now and my hair visiably looks soooo much better. I still have a little fraying but I can visually see a difference in the health of my hair!   I saw a comment that someone said it darkend their hair, I would actually say it lightened mine a bit, Im a dirty blonde-- and my natural highlights are showing through a bit, and I haven&#x27;t been in the sun at all-- I would say it might lighten a bit.   I would recommend this to anyone who is growing their hair out, has fizz, dry hair, fraying, or straightens their hair alot.</li>
            <li> I got this product at Walmart and wanted to share how awesome it was. I put it on towel dried hair like the directions said and waited. The results were shiny soft hair. Don&#x27;t put more than a drop or two on thought it will make hair oily.</li>
            <li> For all you ladies out there with, dry, frizzy, colored, chemically treated, or just plain over-processed hair- This product is your miracle in a bottle. An absolute god send! This product will leave your hair, soft, sleek, straighter, no frizz, full of body, not greasy, smells great, and looking 110% healthier! Better than Moroccan Oil-  And I am not over exaggerating. For this price point you&#x27;d be nuts not to try it.</li>
            <li> leaves hair soft and shiny. I love it. Could tell it was a great product the moment it touched my hair. would definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> excellent product for dry or brittle hair</li>
            <li> 2nd purchase &amp; still NOTHING has EVER worked on my hair except this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works and lasts a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent, excellent product!!!!</li>
            <li> I have thin, color-treated hair that drinks this stuff.  It is a wonderful consistency.  After distributing through my hair, I rub my hands on my knees and heels - the oil is light and not sticky.</li>
            <li> This works great to encourage my hair to be straighter, and it helps make my hair strong, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter if this will make my hair look great or not. Why? Because I spend a lot of money for amazing highlights. I&#x27;ve got platinum blonde all the way to dirty blonde in my hair. This product turned my hair brassy orange. No Joke. So what now, Is this going to take 30 days to get my blonde back? It looks like someone poured Peroxide on my head. This is just great! use this if ur a brunette.</li>
            <li> **This review is for the anti-breakage serum specifically.** I had noticed a lot of split ends and frizziness in my hair lately and my hair stylist recommended a Brazilian blowout. I had heard of this method but didn&#x27;t know a lot about it. It turns out it&#x27;s (a) quite expensive and (b) potentially terrible for you (in terms of chemical toxicity). So I vetoed that and started looking for alternatives. I have type-3a fine, curly hair that I often blow dry straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At my local chain drugstore (the 3-letter one) I came upon this Organix product for just 5 bucks with the store rewards card. (I didn&#x27;t want to invest a lot in a product that I wasn&#x27;t sure would work.) And I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not at all what a real keratin blowout would be like, but for me it has definitely made a positive difference! My hair feels stronger, looks shinier, has fewer flyaways and stays straighter longer. This in the humid Chicago summer air with hair that is very weather-sensitive. And it smells great, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also: It&#x27;s rated a 3/10 on the EWG Skin Deep website (the lower the score, the less potentially harmful to you and the environment.) The worst offending ingredient is the fragrance because it&#x27;s a potential allergen (I have not had any type of negative reaction to it). Everything else is a 3, 2, or 1-rated ingredient. I can live with that. Give it a try; hard to go wrong with 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> This product is great for me. I use a quarter size amount and rub on my hair. The shine last all day. My hair is stronger and is not weighed down as hair grease does. This is a reorder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only pre-blow dry treatment that works on my coarse short hair. Nothing else even comes close. It smells great, too.</li>
            <li> Normally oil-based therapies work wonders on my dry, wavy hair but this stuff wasn&#x27;t so great. Instead of absorbing evenly and adding shine/moisture, this treatment clumped together and made my hair look oily and wet. I tried using just a tiny amount but even then, it was too much. Maybe better for someone with coarse or curly hair.</li>
            <li> The anti-breakage serum truly controls the frizz on my natural curls. It reduces the frizz by 95%. It also relaxes them and makes my curls silky soft. Also, the bottle lasts a long time as once you put a dab on your hair it spreads alot. As for STRAIGHTENING, I have tried this serum along with the flat-iron spray to flat-iron my hair and leave it straightened, however this does not leave my hair silky and glossy straight like it did when I got the $400 Coppola Brazilian Keratin treatment that lasted about 3 months and lengthened my hair past my bra-line(google before &amp; after pictures of the Coppola keratin treatment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love this stuff to control and relax my curls. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> I have very dry/damaged hair and this worked well used approximately 4 times a week for 3-4 weeks, but now my hair seems to be drier than it was before I started using it. I can&#x27;t think of an explanation as to why this is (insight/comments are welcome). Additionally - as the 30 day treatment reviews mention - the serum also affects colored hair. This majorly fades color - brunette, red, toned blonde, over time. I believe oil is known to fade color, but if so, this should be clearly stated somewhere on the packaging - that it is not recommended for color treated hair. An anti-breakage serum, I assume, would contain ingredients to combat color-damaging properties from the added oil. Eh? I dunno. Anyway, I would imagine it is probably OK as a pre-flat iron serum for normal hair that is not color treated, and does not require deep conditioning on a regular basis. My hair has never been so dry for so long as it is now, again, after using this product several times a week for several weeks in a row. The only pro is that it does smell amazing. Obviously not worth it, though. What a strange product.</li>
            <li> WARNING: DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR!&lt;br /&gt;After purchasing this product from other vendors, it&#x27;s quite apparent to me that this particular vendor has been watering down their products. I initially suspected this when I last purchased this product from them and it felt a little more like liquid than a serum. I purchased this item from this vendor one last time while simultaneously purchasing it from another source only to confirm my theory: The product I received from this vendor has been filled with what seems like a 1:2 ratio of water and actual serum. I&#x27;m not sure what the intention of this vendor is other than to make a profit off of their customers, but the fact remains--this vendor is cheating customers out of the product they are supposedly purchasing from them.</li>
            <li> I used this product for three weeks.  First I noticed my hair seemed to be thinning in spots and my scalp felt dry.&lt;br /&gt;The increase dryness resulted in cellulitis and contact dermatitis, which had to be treated with antiboitics.  If you&lt;br /&gt;have sensitive skin be ware that this product may cause hair lost and blister your scalp.</li>
            <li> I went a whole summer using this product, purchasing it from a local CVS for a slightly higher price and I loved it- made my curly, frizzy hair silky, soft and smooth. However come fall, the one and only time I purchased it from Amazon I noticed that it had a different consistency than I was used too- hard to describe, but was far too runny and hard to apply. Did not get the same results either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have that same Amazon bottle because I stopped using the product consistently. The jury is out on the true product abilities of the coconut oil, but I would recommend buying it at a local store for more quality assurance than through the Amazon distributors.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Usually I don&#x27;t write reviews but I felt like I needed to this time due to all the bad ones.. This product is the best serum I have ever used after reading a few I noticed a lot of people saying that it actually damaged or dried their hair out I don&#x27;t understand why, but all I can say is that I use it after straightening my hair to tame flyaway a and to add shine and it works wonders I get compliments on my hair all the time! I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
