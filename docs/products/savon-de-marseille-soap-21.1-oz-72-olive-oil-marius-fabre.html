            <li>So, I remember a big block of marseille soap hanging out in the family bathroom once upon a time in my childhood, and it smelled awesome and cleaned like a champ.  </li>

            <li>I purchased it as a gift, but now I&#x27;m not so sure I want to part with it.</li>

            <li>love this soap, so the product will be fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Great product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so good - none of the things I mentioned seem like they ought to have this light, soapy fragrance - but it really does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gathered and make ball, but it&#x27;s easy to break again.</li>
            <li>Fortunately for us, our son is not allergic to olive oil</li>
            <li>I was not expecting this soap to be anywhere near as good as it is.</li>
            <li>It produces a rich lather, feels great on my skin and has a pleasant, subtle scent.  </li>
            <li>soap smells great, feels great, lathers well, and the giant block lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Mild, fragrance free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You ever get the feeling that we&#x27;re off track as a civilization, inventing ever newer and fancier ways to screw ourselves up, when the old tried and true standbys languish, available but abandoned on the march to ever more relentless consumer capitalism?</li>
            <li>I agree with all those that said it had a strange smell - essence of Halfords would be a good description.&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li>This particular bar of soap had a strong burnt smell to it.</li>
            <li>The Savon de Marseille soaps are well worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>This soap is almost too large, but since our family LOVES this soap, the size almost makes it fun!  </li>
            <li>Fabulous stuff, leave a block of it in a saucer next to the sink and dab the scrubbing in it to clean anything, also the gooey stuff that collects in the bottom of the saucer I use in the dish washer, fabulous stuff.</li>
            <li>Better than some other brands but had better olive soap.  </li>
            <li>This soap cures it right away.  </li>
            <li>A little large but great buy for the money</li>
            <li>One is 72% olive oil, like this one; a light green color; beautiful fragrance; and says \\&quot;72% Extra Pur\\&quot; stamped into the block of soap.  </li>
            <li>One is 72% olive oil, like this one; a light green color; beautiful fragrance; and says \\&quot;72% Extra Pur\\&quot; stamped into the block of soap.  </li>
            <li>So I was interested in learning about Castile soap, and that Wikipedia article led me to Marseille soap, and that led me here.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are only three companies in France still making this authentic Savon de Marseille</li>
            <li>My next bar was much better.</li>
            <li>However, it rinses off easily and quickly and leaves hair and skin supple and soft, not stripped of natural oils.</li>
            <li>so it works very well to help keeps the back of his hands &amp; top of his wrist from drying out.  </li>
            <li>The other kind has palm oil (sodium palmate is the ingredient on the label), does not say 72% extra pur, is tan colored, and smells different, not as nice.  </li>

            <li>so i used the same soap since i&#x27;m little and this savon de marseille is great to replace it.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on all the exposed mucous membranes of the body - it does sting if you get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li>After changing the clothes detergent, we did not see much difference.</li>
            <li>I am assuming they use the whole block which is what I would recommend.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li>aromatic, deep clean, gentle to allergic skin</li>
            <li>Next time I will try just putting the whole block in the shower---the soap is worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It might be pure and natural, but not all things pure and natural smell</li>
            <li>It is moisturizing, has a natural fragrance and the cube lasts and lasts  ---as long a certain someone (you know who you are) does not leave the soap in the bottom of the tub, where it gets soaked, and dissolves a little more quickly than it would...  </li>
            <li>Its absolutely moisturizing and smells so old world.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even know about this soap; I wouldn&#x27;t know about it, except that I visited central Spain a few months ago, and that area is famous for Castile soap, which as a physician, I know is one of the few things safe for use as an enema.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, in France the palm oil stuff is cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, in France the palm oil stuff is cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>My skin is soft, does not itch.</li>
            <li>There are only 3 Savon de Marseille manufactures left in the world, so our family will be putting our money behind this great product.  </li>
            <li>It permeates the whole house within hours and clings to the skin long after it&#x27;s washed off.  </li>
            <li>only a few compagnies, maybe 4 or 5 in the word still make the authentic one, by hand and actually taste it at the end.</li>
            <li>This particular one has olive oil added to help with his dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I had originally just been using it as a kitchen hand soap, but I took it into the shower a few days ago, though I worried it might dry my skin out.</li>

            <li> Long lasting and no allergic reaction!  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin dry and crackly in a way the oh-so-lowly detergent bars I&#x27;d been using hadn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I simply cut the bars in half.</li>
            <li> will buy another block in a few months, when this one is finally done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t understand why this soap, which never used to have an unpleasant odor, is now arriving with a strong, chemical stench.</li>
            <li> He would often break out with rashes when we use other soap.  </li>
            <li> There is no reason to pay for other soap which irritates our skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27; a mess.</li>
            <li> And it was Marius Fabre, there is a little flower on it, or the shape of a star.</li>
            <li> The packaging was messy and clouded, and soap crumbled.  </li>
            <li> This soap is harsh and burns my skin.  </li>
            <li> To put it to use, you have to cut it down, I guess, but cutting it down is hard to do without a fishing line or something similar.  </li>
            <li> No more flakey itching</li>
            <li> My mom told me people used to use it for everything in the past.</li>
            <li> Any knife is too thick of an instrument because it crumbled it and made the resulting piece uneven.  </li>
            <li> I use it for the face, body even hair and to remove stains that are hard to remove.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to order this from Amazon again and will be sourcing this soap locally where I can gauge the smell before buying!</li>
            <li> Just a guy who has some skin trouble, is tired of every synthetic thing under the sun, wanted to try something tried and true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it, other than the smell, so we haven&#x27;t returned it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin from age diabetes and cold weather.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten the palm oil soap at least once when what I ordered was the olive oil soap; so, buyer beware!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very hard to find for sale  in the USA.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the last few orders I&#x27;ve placed through Amazon have resulted in soap that smells horrible.</li>
            <li> I tried cutting it with a knife.  </li>
            <li> It does not lather well and has an unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> Take a look at the website, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Soap has a terrible chemical smell to it.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This soap works perfectly on all my clothes, I love it! It takes out most stains and I like that is a biodegradable &amp; has no perfume.</li>
            <li> love this soap, so the product will be fine for me.  but hoping to give it as gifts, and arrived too battered.  The packaging was messy and clouded, and soap crumbled.  needs better packaging.</li>
            <li> Great soap.  Long lasting and no allergic reaction!  So nice to find a good soap without perfumes.</li>
            <li> Not a soap connoisseur here. Just a guy who has some skin trouble, is tired of every synthetic thing under the sun, wanted to try something tried and true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap smells great, feels great, lathers well, and the giant block lasts a long time. It is a touch drying, but despite that my skin loves it. I was not expecting this soap to be anywhere near as good as it is. Ingredients are 72% olive oil and some coconut oil, saponified with vegetable-ash lye; sea salt; and water. I don&#x27;t know why it smells so good - none of the things I mentioned seem like they ought to have this light, soapy fragrance - but it really does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy another block in a few months, when this one is finally done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I am updating this review to reflect my increasing pleasure and joy in using this soap. I already gave the product 5 stars; I wish I could give it 6. I had originally just been using it as a kitchen hand soap, but I took it into the shower a few days ago, though I worried it might dry my skin out. Nope - it works perfectly well as a body soap, conditioner, and shampoo. It is gentle on all the exposed mucous membranes of the body - it does sting if you get it in your eyes. However, it rinses off easily and quickly and leaves hair and skin supple and soft, not stripped of natural oils. I have occasionally used olive oil as a skin moisturizer and this soap leaves my skin feeling the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer endorsed this soap because she didn&#x27;t want to be applying \\&quot;someone&#x27;s chemistry experiment\\&quot; to her skin. I have come along to feeling the same way. I didn&#x27;t even know about this soap; I wouldn&#x27;t know about it, except that I visited central Spain a few months ago, and that area is famous for Castile soap, which as a physician, I know is one of the few things safe for use as an enema. So I was interested in learning about Castile soap, and that Wikipedia article led me to Marseille soap, and that led me here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You ever get the feeling that we&#x27;re off track as a civilization, inventing ever newer and fancier ways to screw ourselves up, when the old tried and true standbys languish, available but abandoned on the march to ever more relentless consumer capitalism? No? OK, just me then. Get some of this soap anyway. It&#x27;s totally excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 2:  I&#x27;ve learned that Marseille soap made by Marius Fabre comes in two recipes.  One is 72% olive oil, like this one; a light green color; beautiful fragrance; and says \\&quot;72% Extra Pur\\&quot; stamped into the block of soap.  The other kind has palm oil (sodium palmate is the ingredient on the label), does not say 72% extra pur, is tan colored, and smells different, not as nice.  The palm oil soap is also more drying on the skin and I can&#x27;t use it - Fabre themselves recommend it as a laundry soap.  As far as I can tell, in France the palm oil stuff is cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten the palm oil soap at least once when what I ordered was the olive oil soap; so, buyer beware!the feeling that we&#x27;re off track as a civilization, inventing ever newer and fancier ways to screw ourselves up, when the old tried and true standbys languish, available but abandoned on the march to ever more relentless consumer capitalism?

            <li> This soap simply the best.  I have very dry skin from age diabetes and cold weather.  This soap cures it right away.  No more flakey itching</li>
            <li> I bought a different brand in Arles.  It produces a rich lather, feels great on my skin and has a pleasant, subtle scent.  I ordered this, thinking it is similar soap, but it is not.  This soap is harsh and burns my skin.  It does not lather well and has an unpleasant odor. I wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> contains 72% olive oil, and I use it for both my body and face. Its absolutely moisturizing and smells so old world.</li>
            <li> Great product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Fabulous stuff, leave a block of it in a saucer next to the sink and dab the scrubbing in it to clean anything, also the gooey stuff that collects in the bottom of the saucer I use in the dish washer, fabulous stuff.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap.  A little large but great buy for the money, I simply cut the bars in half. There are only three companies in France still making this authentic Savon de Marseille and it&#x27;s very hard to find for sale  in the USA.  So glad I found this</li>
            <li> So, I remember a big block of marseille soap hanging out in the family bathroom once upon a time in my childhood, and it smelled awesome and cleaned like a champ.  I thought I&#x27;d replace my grocery store soap with some fancy stuff for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: didn&#x27;t crumble!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The smell is abominable - something between bandaids, bovine colostrum and a petroleum spill.  It permeates the whole house within hours and clings to the skin long after it&#x27;s washed off.  It leaves my skin dry and crackly in a way the oh-so-lowly detergent bars I&#x27;d been using hadn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad batch or what, I don&#x27;t know... but this stuff belongs in a 55gal drum at the bottom of a landfill, not adorning someone&#x27;s shower stall.  Stay far far away.</li>
            <li> I am french and was looking for this soap everywhere. Thankfully, amazon had it. You have to know when you purchase a savon de marseille that there is no law in France or anywhere else that protects it so that&#x27;s why 90 percent of them are from China or Turkey...only a few compagnies, maybe 4 or 5 in the word still make the authentic one, by hand and actually taste it at the end. That&#x27;s a part of the process. My mother in law used it to remove a spot on my husband&#x27;s shirt and gave me a piece of it. She had this block for years because before her, it was her mom&#x27;s. And it was Marius Fabre, there is a little flower on it, or the shape of a star. I use it for the face, body even hair and to remove stains that are hard to remove. My mom told me people used to use it for everything in the past. It&#x27;ll last longer than a regular soap too. I have eczéma so i used the same soap since i&#x27;m little and this savon de marseille is great to replace it. My skin is soft, does not itch. And it is probably the only soap you can wash your face with. It is made of 5 ingrédients : sodium olivate, sodium cocoate, Aqua, sodium chloride and sodium hydroxide. Take a look at the website, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Excellent soap! Mild, fragrance free. A great bargain as well. I recommend it highly. I use it in the kitchen. One block will last one year !</li>
            <li> This particular bar of soap had a strong burnt smell to it. It was still excellent and I used it, but I didn&#x27;t like the smell. My next bar was much better.</li>
            <li> Soap has a terrible chemical smell to it.  I don&#x27;t know if I received a defective soap or not.  I had to throw the soap away.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> After using this soap, I never want to be without it! Beautiful, creamy lather. Feels great on the skin. Lasts forever. Great for sensitive skin. I love it!</li>
            <li> When I cut ,it crumbled . I gathered and make ball, but it&#x27;s easy to break again. It&#x27; a mess.</li>
            <li> This soap is almost too large, but since our family LOVES this soap, the size almost makes it fun!  It is moisturizing, has a natural fragrance and the cube lasts and lasts  ---as long a certain someone (you know who you are) does not leave the soap in the bottom of the tub, where it gets soaked, and dissolves a little more quickly than it would...  I LOVE THIS SOAP.</li>
            <li> I agree with all those that said it had a strange smell - essence of Halfords would be a good description.&lt;br /&gt;Such a shame, when you compare it to some of the examples I bought in France.&lt;br /&gt;It might be pure and natural, but not all things pure and natural smell good.&lt;br /&gt;Think I might spread it around the garden to keep the neighbour&#x27;s cat out.</li>
            <li> Savon de Marseille is the only type of soap which does not irritate our son&#x27;s skin.  He would often break out with rashes when we use other soap.  This particular one has olive oil added to help with his dry skin.  Fortunately for us, our son is not allergic to olive oil so it works very well to help keeps the back of his hands &amp; top of his wrist from drying out.  I also have a milder case of eczema and this is by far the best soap for me.  Both my wife and I used to think it was our clothes detergent that was causing everyone in the family to scratch and have irritated skin.  After changing the clothes detergent, we did not see much difference. It was not until we used Savon de Marseille that everyone&#x27;s skin problems stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that we have found Savon de Marseille on Amazon we will never buy a different type of soap again.  There are only 3 Savon de Marseille manufactures left in the world, so our family will be putting our money behind this great product.  The Savon de Marseille soaps are well worth every penny.  There is no reason to pay for other soap which irritates our skin.</li>
            <li> This is one big block of soap.  To put it to use, you have to cut it down, I guess, but cutting it down is hard to do without a fishing line or something similar.  I tried cutting it with a knife.  Any knife is too thick of an instrument because it crumbled it and made the resulting piece uneven.  How do the French use this.  I am assuming they use the whole block which is what I would recommend.  Next time I will try just putting the whole block in the shower---the soap is worth a try.  Good quality olive oil soap and scent.  Better than some other brands but had better olive soap.  I gave it an extra star for authenticity.  Purchasing it again may be necessary to properly evaluate it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased to have bought this lovely soap.  I purchased it as a gift, but now I&#x27;m not so sure I want to part with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap while in Marseille, France this summer.  I like everything about it!  I checked Amazon to see if I could find it in the U.S.  I sent a cube as a gift to my daughter.  Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love Savon De Marseille olive oil soap, we&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for over 10 years. Unfortunately, the last few orders I&#x27;ve placed through Amazon have resulted in soap that smells horrible. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it, other than the smell, so we haven&#x27;t returned it. But I don&#x27;t understand why this soap, which never used to have an unpleasant odor, is now arriving with a strong, chemical stench. I&#x27;m afraid to order this from Amazon again and will be sourcing this soap locally where I can gauge the smell before buying!</li>
            <li> aromatic, deep clean, gentle to allergic skin</li>
            <li> godd soap, but doesn&#x27;t smell good</li>
            <li> Great product.  We have been using this brand for years and quality is always excellent.  This is a good value for the size.</li>
