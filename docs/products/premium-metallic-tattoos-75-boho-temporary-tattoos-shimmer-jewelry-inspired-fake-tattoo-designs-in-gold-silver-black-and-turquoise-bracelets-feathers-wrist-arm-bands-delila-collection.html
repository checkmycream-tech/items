            <li>I also thought these would be great for her since they seem to have an American Indian theme to them.</li>

            <li>Easy application process and the shipping was fast!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think these are a lot of fun for a summer &amp;#34;accessory&amp;#34; or for a little girls party but don&#x27;t expect them to look perfect.</li>
            <li>think younger girls would have a lot of fun with these and this pack would be great for slumber party</li>
            <li>These arrived super fast!!!</li>
            <li>I think I would have liked this set more if there were more black tattoos vs</li>
            <li>Plus they&#x27;re really cool-</li>

            <li>The designs are also very cute and they stay on longer than most other temporary tattoos I&#x27;ve worn before.</li>
            <li>These are so fun they were originally for my oldest Daugher</li>
            <li>so pretty and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Great for little girl sleep overs.</li>
            <li>I received a deep discount on this in exchange for honest feedback.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Removal was simple, with some soap and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are definitely worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right on trend for this summer.</li>
            <li>The second one she made sure it was good and dry</li>
            <li>My daughters also took small glitter pens and were able to trace out the design for a more 3D look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are really pretty shiny tattoos.</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>, it will most likely come off if you do that.</li>
            <li>These fun tattoos last a good few days.</li>
            <li>my granddaughter is very sparkly</li>
            <li>so the metallics don&#x27;t really pop on me.</li>
            <li>Very metallic.&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on product to test and share my review.</li>
            <li>I REALLY</li>
            <li>Thanks to the designs, there is a lot to choose from.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Putting them on is really easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tattoos are very easy to apply, but if you have any trouble or confusion, there is a set of instructions on the back of the package (Shown in the pictures) which were are easy to understand and follow.</li>
            <li>After that they start looking very old very fast.</li>
            <li>Overall they are very fun accessories.</li>
            <li>My daughter accidentally rubbed her new tattoo on her shirt and the whole picture came off in a crumble.</li>
            <li>The one I put on to try even mostly survived my shower until the second shower finished it off the next day.</li>
            <li>love the multiple, different metallic designs on each of the tattoos.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>remove plastic film, place image down on skin, get good and wet with a cloth, and peel paper</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to apply and long lasting!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They look nice, you apply them just like any other temporary tattoo, I might mention that you let them dry completely before doing anything.</li>
            <li>The tattoos are really close together, so you get more tattoos, but that also means they are a little more difficult to cut out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are great for summer activities like going to the beach or for anything else where it would be uncomfortable to wear actual jewelry</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My 11 year old has been drawing on herself with metallic sharpies for week.</li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive skin you might have issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I was surprised how big the sheets are and that there are 6 of them!</li>

            <li> Love these! Excellent service. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> got these for my daughter and she LOVES it! so pretty and goes on smoothly. great accessories for the summer!</li>
            <li> Beautiful tattoos, the color is great and the gold is so vibrant. Very easy to apply and they last longer than any other temp tattoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> These fun tattoos last a good few days. I placed one on my wrist that lasted four days and I wash my hands a lot!</li>
            <li> These. Are. Amaze. Tattoos are serious, they&#x27;re forever, so you should always think hard on what you want to get, where you want it. These are beautiful tattoos and perfect for placement ideas. Plus they&#x27;re really cool- gold! Easy application process and the shipping was fast!!</li>
            <li> great! my granddaughter is very sparkly lol</li>
            <li> Not in love with the designs or the way metallic transfers to skin. I&#x27;m wearing a gold one now on my wrist and it immediately was cracked and flaking.  Overall the tattoo is still on though, so I guess it has some staying power. I think I would have liked this set more if there were more black tattoos vs just metallic. I&#x27;m fair skinned so the metallics don&#x27;t really pop on me. I received a deep discount on this in exchange for honest feedback.</li>
            <li> My daughters LOVED these Metallic Tattoos!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We got them about a week ago and they were picking out their favorites within 5 minutes of opening.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;-They did stick and they did all apply evenly which is a problem with some other brands.&lt;br /&gt;-Removal was simple, with some soap and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;These did stay on for about 2/3 days easily on average. My daughters also took small glitter pens and were able to trace out the design for a more 3D look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are definitely worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I did receive this product for review. All opinions and thoughts are my own and honest.</li>
            <li> I got these tattoos for a review and they are awesome! Great for a spa day with the ladies. Great for little girl sleep overs. How about theme parties! Love love love them!</li>
            <li> This product was provided for review. These are great quality and went on with ease. They also stayed 7-10 days.</li>
            <li> These are so fun they were originally for my oldest Daugher but then I started stealing them and now my younger daughters are too. I think we may have started a craze here!  :)&lt;br /&gt;They are very simple to apply.  Just cut out the one you want, remove plastic film, place image down on skin, get good and wet with a cloth, and peel paper off.&lt;br /&gt;They look way nicer in person. Very metallic.&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on product to test and share my review.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE ALL SUPER CUTE TATTOOS!! I REALLY LIKE THAT THERE ARE ALL DIFFERENT STYLES FOR WHATEVER MOOD YOU ARE IN.</li>
            <li> These are really pretty shiny tattoos. I have a love/hate relationship with the papers. The tattoos are really close together, so you get more tattoos, but that also means they are a little more difficult to cut out. This is especially true on the bracelet sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They look nice, you apply them just like any other temporary tattoo, I might mention that you let them dry completely before doing anything. My daughter accidentally rubbed her new tattoo on her shirt and the whole picture came off in a crumble. The second one she made sure it was good and dry and there were no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tattoos come in resealable plastic packaging so you can keep them together and reasonably safe until they are ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> So awesome!! This is by far the best deal that I have purchased on Amazon. So many tattoos are perfect for festival season. My friends and I will be rocking the foil tats all summer long! They last for about a week if you take care of it. I have really sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t spark a reaction at all. Would highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;*i was given a discount on this item to review it, but was honest in my review of the product*</li>
            <li> My 11 year old has been drawing on herself with metallic sharpies for week. I never understood why until I saw these here on Amazon. There are so many tattoos in this pack and my daughters were thrilled!</li>
            <li> I Absolutely love these tattoos. I got this product in discount for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> some of the patterns on the first page are cracked, otherwise it looks nice, I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> The tattoos were easy to apply. You just put them face down and moisten the backs for a few seconds before peeling it off. The designs are also very cute and they stay on longer than most other temporary tattoos I&#x27;ve worn before. The one I put on to try even mostly survived my shower until the second shower finished it off the next day. And that&#x27;s without using any sort of liquid bandaid coating to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the multiple, different metallic designs on each of the tattoos. And I was very happy, and surprised that you get about 75+ designs at such an affordable price. The tattoos are very easy to apply, but if you have any trouble or confusion, there is a set of instructions on the back of the package (Shown in the pictures) which were are easy to understand and follow. It lasts for about 2-3 days, but if you&#x27;re constantly rubbing against it, or playing with the tattoo, it may wear off faster. I did not have any irritations with the tattoos, and I was completely happy with this product.</li>
            <li> My daughters loved these!  Great for teens/young adults...heck, even myself!</li>
            <li> These arrived super fast!!! And I was surprised how big the sheets are and that there are 6 of them! I tried one out just to see how well they work, and it instantly stuck to my skin in about a minute! Can&#x27;t wait to use these at Sturgis!</li>
            <li> I love these silver and gold tattoos. For the price you pay for them, they are a very good buy. Usually they last me about 2 days on my hands and 3 days on my lower back (on day 2 usually you start noticing tearing). There more rubbing from clothes, bras, hand washing you have, the more they chip and tear. Once they start looking ugly I take them off with coconut oil. These are perfect for a short evening or one day outing. After that they start looking very old very fast. Thanks to the designs, there is a lot to choose from. Overall they are very fun accessories. I am very thankful to the Terra Tattoos for providing me these Beautiful Metallic Tattoos at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback.</li>
            <li> **I received this product at a discount in exchange for my review**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked about the metallic tattoos:&lt;br /&gt;These tattoos are fun!&lt;br /&gt;They are great for summer activities like going to the beach or for anything else where it would be uncomfortable to wear actual jewelry but you still want to accessorize.&lt;br /&gt;I think younger girls would have a lot of fun with these and this pack would be great for slumber party fun.&lt;br /&gt;You get a lot of designs in this package so the price compared to what you would pay for one or two sheets in the store is actually quite good.&lt;br /&gt;Putting them on is really easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t care for:&lt;br /&gt;The metallic color can look wrinkly on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I had a problem with the black ink being smudged on some of mine.&lt;br /&gt;These can be a pain to remove which is common for any temporary tattoo but if you have sensitive skin you might have issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think these are a lot of fun for a summer &amp;#34;accessory&amp;#34; or for a little girls party but don&#x27;t expect them to look perfect.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a similar product for my niece before and she really enjoyed them so when I saw these beautiful metallic tattoos I just had to get it for her. The fact that we are Native American I also thought these would be great for her since they seem to have an American Indian theme to them. She absolutely loved this set of metallic tattoos and loved being able to pick from a range of different designs and sizes. We put a couple on and had a good time bonding while getting them on. These tattoos are absolutely beautiful and definitely stand out! I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured. Cute and fun tattoos to slice up your look or to wear instead of jewelry!</li>
            <li> These are great!  Right on trend for this summer. I was worried that they would wash off after a shower but I am on day 5 of wearing one  and  have taken a shower every day and it is still on. Mind you I have not scrubbed the area I put the tattoo with soap and water, it will most likely come off if you do that. Point being longer lasting then expected. Fast delivery, great product.</li>
            <li> Just got these and couldn&#x27;t wait to try them out!! They&#x27;re easy to apply and long lasting!! Super impressed!!  Thank you for exchanging your product for my review!</li>
            <li> These stay on great.&lt;br /&gt;Love the metallic color.&lt;br /&gt;Fun for all ages&lt;br /&gt;Good for a party or going out</li>
