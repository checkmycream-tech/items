            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>I love using this at home and will love it when I travel.</li>
            <li>The glittery eye shadows at the top don&#x27;t drip glitter onto your eye (my eyes water and itch when that happens).</li>
            <li>I do love the pallet and how they are organized, so I will be getting more.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>i love nyx products :) shadows are so soft, its really great product.</li>
            <li>The eye shadow colors are a good variety of shades and all are really pretty.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed!</li>
            <li>Good quality, good price, would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>They are more of a lightly pigmented lip color than a gloss, which I love and will be more useful to me than gloss would have.  </li>
            <li>The pallet is awesome due to</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth trying it as the quality seems pretty good for the price, but I think perhaps they should have added more vibrant, bright colors if you ask me.</li>
            <li>but it was a little pricey, this is a great deal!</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of NYX</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for traveling as well; but it&#x27;s not tiny by any means</li>
            <li>The colors are amazing and very pigmented.</li>
            <li>Overall very nice.</li>
            <li>nice little kit love love love</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lipglosses are highly pigmented and can be worn on their own as a lip color without lipstick underneath if desired.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed in this palette.</li>
            <li>I particularly love the eyeliner, as it is the first I have found that I can use for winged liner that doesn&#x27;t smudge in the crease of my eye.  </li>
            <li>A lot of deep colors, and the bonus eye primer and eyeliner are a good deal as well.</li>
            <li>I have NEVER used a better liquid liner in my entire life, and I have tried MANY liquid eyeliners over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The primer made my eyes look so much more vibrant.</li>
            <li>Bottom shadows are more muted, but still highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced for what you get!</li>
            <li>Yes, I love this palette, the colors are great and have a lot of coverage and last the same all day.  </li>
            <li>I have the NYX Moscow in Winter collection and for me, it is the perfect overall size to fit in my purse along with all my other stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the colors they are dark and seem to be a good pigmentation, the color stays on and doesn&#x27;t really fade off all day wear for me.  </li>
            <li>Also, the eyeliner that is included with the palette glides on nicely and is a very rich black (and also quite opaque).</li>
            <li>Book-like packaging is fun, and protects the product.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>In general, the darker colors have a better color-payoff than the lighter ones; and there is a matte brown color that works well as a contour color as well</li>
            <li>Really exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mixed top and bottom or used separately.</li>
            <li>thx much for this palette</li>
            <li>Comes with way more that i expected.</li>
            <li>The highlighter, I have gone through really fast because it&#x27;s great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was so much over my expectations.</li>
            <li>Nyx really put a lot of thought into this product</li>
            <li>I do there wasn&#x27;t so much fall out from the eye shadows</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t take this collection along in my purse, it would take up too much room.</li>
            <li>I really like that it includes everything for your face, except for foundation, primer and mascara.</li>
            <li>The eye shadow primer that is included works really well too.</li>
            <li>This arrived in under a week, was wrapped for shipping very well, and did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li>i think I just hyped myself up to much for this one.</li>
            <li>The eye shadows and the blushes are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>It was larger than what I had expected - It is larger than a typical pocket book - but the colors were very nice and my mom liked it very much.</li>
            <li>All are nicely pigmented and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>and I love that it is based on the movie \\&quot;Dark Shadows\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Purchased mainly to have a convenient carry along palette with everything I need when I&#x27;m on the go, mirror included.</li>
            <li>((there&#x27;s a bright red blush)), but there are everyday blushes</li>
            <li>one of the lip glosses and that was decent</li>
            <li>blushes are all highly pigmented and there are colors to compliment any skin tone.</li>
            <li>and I guess I was expecting a little more than I got.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mainly used the eye-shadows so far, and I can say that these work very well.</li>
            <li>Two sets of eye shadows - top is glittery, but not cheap feeling/looking.</li>
            <li>It was a bit bigger than I expected, but I can&#x27;t really complain about getting more bang for my buck.  </li>
            <li>Some look more dramatic for special occasions</li>
            <li>but it could just be me since I am still new</li>
            <li>The packaging is quite adorable, and this is a larger size than I expected, there is plenty of product.  </li>
            <li>I am a relative newbie to makeup and this is my first nyx purchase.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s from Dark Shadows, but the eye-shadows are nothing special.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shadows are all very pigmented and have different finishes to them.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow&#x27;s are in shimmer as well as matt shades in a wide variety of fun colors, so you can have a blast playing with your &#x27;canvas&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>It has so many great colors in it and comes with a little eye shadow base and liquid liner.  </li>
            <li>Eyeshadows are long wearing, highly pigmented and do NOT crease.</li>
            <li>There are 3 images of the women from the movie, unfortunately there are no instructions as to how to do the &#x27;look&#x27; which would have been handy and frankly something NYX should have thought of.  </li>
            <li>The primer is lovely, the colors are bold, and even though I&#x27;d read some bad reviews on the lip products, I quite like them.  </li>
            <li>The eye shadow palette is intriguing with some colors ranging in their degree of vividness, however the majority of it is neutrals (browns, black, white, etc).</li>

            <li> i think I just hyped myself up to much for this one.</li>
            <li> The eye shadows and the blushes are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> It was larger than what I had expected - It is larger than a typical pocket book - but the colors were very nice and my mom liked it very much.</li>
            <li> All are nicely pigmented and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> and I love that it is based on the movie \\&quot;Dark Shadows\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Purchased mainly to have a convenient carry along palette with everything I need when I&#x27;m on the go, mirror included.</li>
            <li> ((there&#x27;s a bright red blush)), but there are everyday blushes</li>
            <li> one of the lip glosses and that was decent</li>
            <li> blushes are all highly pigmented and there are colors to compliment any skin tone.</li>
            <li> and I guess I was expecting a little more than I got.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mainly used the eye-shadows so far, and I can say that these work very well.</li>
            <li> Two sets of eye shadows - top is glittery, but not cheap feeling/looking.</li>
            <li> It was a bit bigger than I expected, but I can&#x27;t really complain about getting more bang for my buck.  </li>
            <li> Some look more dramatic for special occasions</li>
            <li> but it could just be me since I am still new</li>
            <li> The packaging is quite adorable, and this is a larger size than I expected, there is plenty of product.  </li>
            <li> I am a relative newbie to makeup and this is my first nyx purchase.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s from Dark Shadows, but the eye-shadows are nothing special.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shadows are all very pigmented and have different finishes to them.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow&#x27;s are in shimmer as well as matt shades in a wide variety of fun colors, so you can have a blast playing with your &#x27;canvas&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> It has so many great colors in it and comes with a little eye shadow base and liquid liner.  </li>
            <li> Eyeshadows are long wearing, highly pigmented and do NOT crease.</li>
            <li> There are 3 images of the women from the movie, unfortunately there are no instructions as to how to do the &#x27;look&#x27; which would have been handy and frankly something NYX should have thought of.  </li>
            <li> The primer is lovely, the colors are bold, and even though I&#x27;d read some bad reviews on the lip products, I quite like them.  </li>
            <li> The eye shadow palette is intriguing with some colors ranging in their degree of vividness, however the majority of it is neutrals (browns, black, white, etc).</li>
            <li> I have pretty much only been buying NYX products lately because the quality is on par with fancier brands at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> This would&#x27;ve gotten 5 stars but the overall size is much Larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> The box is well made and larger than I expected, it does have a mirror and applicators.  </li>
            <li> I had been wanting this for a very long time</li>
            <li> The colors to the glosses do last, but the sheen goes down some over time, so you may need to bring a long a lip gloss for touch</li>
            <li> The eye shadow base, eyeliner, blushes, highlighter (illuminator), and lip colours are every bit as good - if not better than more expensive products.</li>
            <li> Limited edition so get this while you can</li>
            <li> gives you a brief little Story about there Characters.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s probably a little smaller than a VHS tape).</li>
            <li> not really any eyeliner</li>
            <li> I expected this to be a run of the mill, not quite cakey eyeshadow set.</li>
            <li> I just got my Crimson Amulet pallet from Nyx inspired by the Movie Dark Shadows.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to be a Dark Shadows fan.</li>
            <li> You also get eye lid primer and liner(in black) which I haven&#x27;t used.  </li>
            <li> has a little bit of everything: eye shadow, eye liner, blush, lipstick, and eye primer</li>
            <li> There is everything included to do a neutral everyday look to a playful look for the night too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this everyday, it fits like a book into all of my purses, even in class I put on makeup because my teacher thinks I am reading.</li>
            <li> the nyx Eye shadow Base seems about the same size you would recive if you were to order a regular size.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the eye shadow base was dried out when I got it.</li>
            <li> The highlighter is very hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed!</li>
            <li> It also includes liquid eyeliner and a &#x27;shadow base&#x27; which helps bring out the pigment in the shadow.</li>

            <li> Nice, nice product!  It came well packaged and in perfect condition from seller.  I was pleased with the color selections of eyeshadow, blushes and lip gloss.  All are nicely pigmented and long lasting.  You also get eye lid primer and liner(in black) which I haven&#x27;t used.  The primer is great!  The box is well made and larger than I expected, it does have a mirror and applicators.  There are 3 images of the women from the movie, unfortunately there are no instructions as to how to do the &#x27;look&#x27; which would have been handy and frankly something NYX should have thought of.  The eyeshadow&#x27;s are in shimmer as well as matt shades in a wide variety of fun colors, so you can have a blast playing with your &#x27;canvas&#x27;.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and I think you will be to!  Very reasonably priced for what you get!</li>
            <li> Purchased mainly to have a convenient carry along palette with everything I need when I&#x27;m on the go, mirror included. Really exceeded my expectations! Eyeshadows are long wearing, highly pigmented and do NOT crease. The eye shadow base, eyeliner, blushes, highlighter (illuminator), and lip colours are every bit as good - if not better than more expensive products. Wonderful performance, quality, and price. I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this. A lot of deep colors, and the bonus eye primer and eyeliner are a good deal as well. For the price, amazing.</li>
            <li> over the top! I absolutely love it, the colors are perfect for fall and winter and look great when you put it on :)</li>
            <li> Love everything about this palette! Shimmer and matte shades, day and night looks, and the packaging is awesome! Not to mention the quality of NYX!</li>
            <li> i love nyx products :) shadows are so soft, its really great product. i love all colors. thx much for this palette</li>
            <li> I have to give this five stars if you like nyx products or are just looking for a good value in makeup but never tried nyx this would be a great place to start also makes a great gift! Limited edition so get this while you can the is the cheapest I&#x27;ve seen this set so that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
            <li> I just got my Crimson Amulet pallet from Nyx inspired by the Movie Dark Shadows. I would say this pallet is about Medium Sized. Does not Give you a tutorial to the 3 vampire ladies looks only gives you a brief little Story about there Characters. not really any eyeliner the nyx Eye shadow Base seems about the same size you would recive if you were to order a regular size. there are Lots of eye shadows to Chose from the Blushes are all very Beautiful and Well pigmented for your Skin. I love the Fact that you Get a mirror with it.</li>
            <li> It was larger than what I had expected - It is larger than a typical pocket book - but the colors were very nice and my mom liked it very much. The only downside is it does not have a brush for the blushes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this palette wanting to try out a bunch of NYX products all at once without spending a lot. I must say I am sold, and I love this palette more than anything else in my makeup collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shadows are all very pigmented and have different finishes to them. There is everything included to do a neutral everyday look to a playful look for the night too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner and eye shadow primer are now staples in my collection. I definately will be ordering these again when I run out. I have NEVER used a better liquid liner in my entire life, and I have tried MANY liquid eyeliners over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blushes are all highly pigmented and there are colors to compliment any skin tone. Some look more dramatic for special occasions ((there&#x27;s a bright red blush)), but there are everyday blushes too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lipglosses are highly pigmented and can be worn on their own as a lip color without lipstick underneath if desired. The colors to the glosses do last, but the sheen goes down some over time, so you may need to bring a long a lip gloss for touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The illumenator/highlighter is one of the prettiest I have ever used. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall. I&#x27;m in love. Everything came in one piece in a couple days and in one piece. Will become one of your favorite palettes ever. Garenteed.</li>
            <li> I had heard mixed reviews about this palette from Amazon and various online blogs, but I figured I could buy it and try it out for myself. I am not disappointed! I love the colors for the blush (which I use as eye shadow) and the lip gloss. The eye shadow palette is intriguing with some colors ranging in their degree of vividness, however the majority of it is neutrals (browns, black, white, etc). It also includes liquid eyeliner and a &#x27;shadow base&#x27; which helps bring out the pigment in the shadow. All in all I think it&#x27;s worth trying it as the quality seems pretty good for the price, but I think perhaps they should have added more vibrant, bright colors if you ask me. However, I will probably order another one!</li>
            <li> I am in love with NYX, it is all I use! This palette is awesome. Great colors and I love that it is based on the movie \\&quot;Dark Shadows\\&quot;. I went to Ulta (beauty supply store) and almost got this same palette when the movie 1st came out but it was a little pricey, this is a great deal! I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am a relative newbie to makeup and this is my first nyx purchase. it is not as great as my too faced or UD eyeshadows, but it is well beyond drugstore eyeshadows i&#x27;ve tried. they work great with primer and the colors build up nicely. i bought it for the &#x27;josette&#x27; illuminated look and it&#x27;s fabulous. all the colors work with my skin tone. the illuminating powder is nice, and i love the lip glosses. great purchase!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this makeup kit.  There is a large selection of great colors.  Good quality, good price, would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Comes with way more that i expected. The quality of the product is amazing and the packaging is beautiful I am a huge fan of NYX</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shadows are high quality and beautiful. You get a nice combo of matte and shimmer shadows.&lt;br /&gt;The face products in it are amazing as well. I use it the palette every day. The highlighter, I have gone through really fast because it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed in this palette. It&#x27;s a must have! Best shadows I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend. :)</li>
            <li> The kit is amazing! The colors are fantastic! It even has a guide how to make your look like the characters in the movie! If your a fan you will love it! I&#x27;m obsessed!</li>
            <li> I expected this to be a run of the mill, not quite cakey eyeshadow set. I had been wanting this for a very long time and so I finally went ahead got it because I thought &#x27;why not&#x27;. I was waiting by the mail everyday, and it did ship quite fast. It was so much over my expectations. The shadow went on like butta!!! It was velvety. The primer made my eyes look so much more vibrant. I use this everyday, it fits like a book into all of my purses, even in class I put on makeup because my teacher thinks I am reading.</li>
            <li> Beautiful packaging...Nyx really put a lot of thought into this product and I just love it. I do there wasn&#x27;t so much fall out from the eye shadows though but it could just be me since I am still new to make-up. Everything else is amazing! :)</li>
            <li> I love the colors they are dark and seem to be a good pigmentation, the color stays on and doesn&#x27;t really fade off all day wear for me.  has a little bit of everything: eye shadow, eye liner, blush, lipstick, and eye primer nice little kit love love love</li>
            <li> This makeup palette is another good NYX product. I&#x27;ve mainly used the eye-shadows so far, and I can say that these work very well. Some of the colors are more pigmented than others; but you can get a lot of really nice looks out of this palette. In general, the darker colors have a better color-payoff than the lighter ones; and there is a matte brown color that works well as a contour color as well (I used it for the sides of my nose). Also, the eyeliner that is included with the palette glides on nicely and is a very rich black (and also quite opaque). I would recommend this palette to anyone. It&#x27;s great for traveling as well; but it&#x27;s not tiny by any means (it&#x27;s probably a little smaller than a VHS tape).</li>
            <li> This would&#x27;ve gotten 5 stars but the overall size is much Larger than I expected. The eye shadow colors are a good variety of shades and all are really pretty. I like to layer colors for an individualized look - this works perfectly for that. The blushes are so pretty - great for day and night. I haven&#x27;t tried the lip colors yet - at some point I will. I love using this at home and will love it when I travel. I can&#x27;t take this collection along in my purse, it would take up too much room. I have the NYX Moscow in Winter collection and for me, it is the perfect overall size to fit in my purse along with all my other stuff.</li>
            <li> Great colors for every eye color and face! Book-like packaging is fun, and protects the product. Two sets of eye shadows - top is glittery, but not cheap feeling/looking. Bottom shadows are more muted, but still highly pigmented. I&#x27;ve mixed top and bottom or used separately. The glittery eye shadows at the top don&#x27;t drip glitter onto your eye (my eyes water and itch when that happens). I really like that it includes everything for your face, except for foundation, primer and mascara. The eye shadow primer that is included works really well too.</li>
            <li> This arrived in under a week, was wrapped for shipping very well, and did not disappoint.  The primer is lovely, the colors are bold, and even though I&#x27;d read some bad reviews on the lip products, I quite like them.  They are more of a lightly pigmented lip color than a gloss, which I love and will be more useful to me than gloss would have.  The packaging is quite adorable, and this is a larger size than I expected, there is plenty of product.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting this pallet FOREVER. So I finally decided to order it. I couldn&#x27;t wait for it to get to me, as soon as it did I tore it open and I guess I was expecting a little more than I got. The pallet is awesome due to it&#x27;s from Dark Shadows, but the eye-shadows are nothing special. They do go on beautifully but the blushes and highlighting break off in powder when you put a brush to it. I do love the pallet and how they are organized, so I will be getting more. i think I just hyped myself up to much for this one.</li>
            <li> Great colors in this palette.  It was a bit bigger than I expected, but I can&#x27;t really complain about getting more bang for my buck.  I particularly love the eyeliner, as it is the first I have found that I can use for winged liner that doesn&#x27;t smudge in the crease of my eye.  My only complaint is that the eye shadow base was dried out when I got it.</li>
            <li> Good got it for my gf</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been wanting this palette since seeing it at my local Ulta store.  The colors are amazing and very pigmented. I&#x27;m not a fan of the shadow primer that comes with it as it is quite oily but the eyeliner is good.  I haven&#x27;t used but one of the lip glosses and that was decent but I never understood having a gloss or a lipstick in a palette. What do you do if you want to reapply?  You&#x27;re outta luck.  But the colors are nice.  I would definitely recommend this palette and you don&#x27;t have to be a Dark Shadows fan.</li>
            <li> Gave this for a Christmas present and it was a big hit.  It&#x27;s a great kit for someone who loves makeup.</li>
            <li> Yes, I love this palette, the colors are great and have a lot of coverage and last the same all day.  The shipment arrived on time and the package came perfectly, with a bubble plastic around it to prevent damage.  So, I am very pleased with this purchase.  I would recommend Blu Scandal and the collection as well.</li>
            <li> The eye shadows and the blushes are very pigmented. The highlighter is very hard. You must scrap at it. Overall very nice.</li>
            <li> This is a great palate.  I am so glad I bought this. It has so many great colors in it and comes with a little eye shadow base and liquid liner.  Great for traveling.</li>
            <li> The selection of colors is beautiful, there is a lot of variety, and the essentials are all there. I am so impressed with this brand and this product. I have pretty much only been buying NYX products lately because the quality is on par with fancier brands at a fraction of the price. I highly recommend this!</li>
