            <li>Great nice Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>I REALLY LOVE THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li>.. love the eye shadow..</li>
            <li>So many great items, they are all full size and high end.</li>
            <li>This Blockbuster is embarrassingly light.</li>
            <li>Pretty good i gave it as a present to my wife and she liked except the foundation</li>
            <li>The eye shadows are rich colors.</li>
            <li>Additionally there are 3 full sized lipsticks, a full size mascara, an eyeliner pencil, a full size bottle of eye makeup remover, fragrance, nail lacquer, and skin care items.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a big kit with nice serum and cream included.</li>
            <li>Nordstrum and Dillards, for example, were also recently offering a free gift with purchase of $55 or more (while supplies lasted).  </li>
            <li>gold faux croc companion bag, nice enough to use as a clutch.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping from seller!</li>
            <li>I purchase one of these offers to give to my daughter every Christmas and  am never disappointed.</li>
            <li>The 2014 collection offers a nicely designed train case in dark navy satin with a full zip closure and signature gold tone hardware.</li>
            <li>The cosmetics are pure luxury.</li>
            <li>The listed price is somewhat high compared to some department store prices (Macy&#x27;s, Dillards, Nordstrum), but the department stores normally require another purchase to qualify for their price.  </li>
            <li>Petty gold make up bag but barely large enough to hold the make up palette.</li>
            <li>There was barely anything in it.</li>
            <li>Love the mascara,it lengthens and thickens my thin short lashes.</li>

            <li> Gift for my wife she likes it.</li>
            <li> GREAT SELLER. I REALLY LOVE THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping from seller! Beautiful make up! Love the mascara,it lengthens and thickens my thin short lashes. The eye shadows are rich colors. I love the lip sticks and glosses also! It&#x27;s a big kit with nice serum and cream included. Petty gold make up bag but barely large enough to hold the make up palette. Very nice train case comes with it.</li>
            <li> Pretty good i gave it as a present to my wife and she liked except the foundation is missing</li>
            <li> EXCELENT FOR MOTHERS DAY OR CHRISTMAS!</li>
            <li> These are always a good gift item.  The listed price is somewhat high compared to some department store prices (Macy&#x27;s, Dillards, Nordstrum), but the department stores normally require another purchase to qualify for their price.  It pays to shop around.  Nordstrum and Dillards, for example, were also recently offering a free gift with purchase of $55 or more (while supplies lasted).  The contents are a good variety and are good value for the money.  I bought five of these to use as gifts.  Women friends look forward to such gifts.</li>
            <li> as described...great colors.. love the eye shadow..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know.  Gave it as gift. Person seemed to like it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t include half of the items described. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Everything perfect. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The seller was A+ in handling and delivery. I&#x27;ve been buying a Lauder Blockbuster for decades at Christmas. This Blockbuster is embarrassingly light. Where are all the eye shadows, brushes, pencils etc? This is the worst Blockbuster I&#x27;ve seen from Estee Lauder. There was barely anything in it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful !! I m so grat thanksss</li>
            <li> Great nice Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Wife loved it, thank you!</li>
            <li> I purchased one for myself and one to give to my daughter for Christmas, this is one of the best Estee Lauder has ever offered. So many great items, they are all full size and high end. I purchase one of these offers to give to my daughter every Christmas and  am never disappointed. My daughter was thrilled with this gift and so am I.</li>
            <li> An Estee Lauder Blockbuster is a set any woman would adore. The 2014 collection offers a nicely designed train case in dark navy satin with a full zip closure and signature gold tone hardware. The cosmetics are pure luxury. An array of versatile colors are included for day and night. I&#x27;m impressed with ALL. Included are the following:&lt;br /&gt;A gold faux croc companion bag, nice enough to use as a clutch. 2 Deluxe mirrored palettes designed in gold croc. One palette contains a collection of eye shadows and blush with applicators while the other houses 3 lip glosses (balm quality).&lt;br /&gt;But that is not all. Additionally there are 3 full sized lipsticks, a full size mascara, an eyeliner pencil, a full size bottle of eye makeup remover, fragrance, nail lacquer, and skin care items. It&#x27;s truly a value compared to what you could pay. The lipsticks alone retail for $26 each. I absolutely love it!</li>
