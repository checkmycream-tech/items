            <li>my pungent flavor.&lt;br /&gt;American Crew Nine does more than that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off spending another $15 for a better brand.</li>

            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a modern, unique scent - this cologne is not for you.</li>
            <li>work ask if I was wearing new cologne and they shook their heads when I answered them</li>

            <li> This smell is clean and fresh! I bought this for my husband but end up wearing it myself and I also spray it on my baby.</li>
            <li> A slightly strong cologne, but you can&#x27;t beat the price compared to the others out there.</li>
            <li> Bought this at SportsClips. I used their classic scent for a few years so I thought sure. It smelled alright at first, but I had a few women at work ask if I was wearing new cologne and they shook their heads when I answered them yes. Went to a store and let the wife buy it this time.</li>
            <li> I like the way it smells.  Nice and light and clean.  Nothing over powering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a smelly guy. I get home from work and I can smell myself. Hell, sometimes I get a whiff of my aroma getting out of the shower. I&#x27;ve spent years in search of something that could at least mask my pungent flavor.&lt;br /&gt;American Crew Nine does more than that.&lt;br /&gt;I put a little spray on my wrists and spread it across my chest and that&#x27;s all I can smell for the rest of the day. My sweat mixes with it to create the essence of man. This is my cologne of choice indefinitely.</li>
            <li> Strong, headache inducing scent that smells like every bad Christmas gift cologne from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. If you&#x27;re looking for a modern, unique scent - this cologne is not for you. You&#x27;re better off spending another $15 for a better brand.

            <li> Great cologne. Smells good and the seller got it to me very quickly. I would buy from this seller again</li>
