            <li>Best!</li>
            <li>The scent is delicious, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It is a volumizing conditioner, and an AWESOME one at that.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is AMAZING!!</li>

            <li>not that good.</li>
            <li>Also being allergic to sulphates in my shampoo, this product used in conjunction with their Superstar Sulphate Free Shampoo is the perfect hair care regime!</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner!</li>
            <li>It smells kind of like strawberries, but also like something else.</li>
            <li>I think there are many superior alternatives to the shampoo that are cheaper.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner and it smells just as amazing as the shampoo that goes with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had great success and no complaints.</li>
            <li>I tried so many shampoos that I can&#x27;t even tell...    </li>
            <li>This one is ok.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU BEDHEAD &amp; Amazong for the fantastic price!</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so healthy.  </li>
            <li>The matching shampoo and conditioner is simply magic.</li>
            <li>I love the pump on it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>Also, purchased the conditioner and love that too.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell...</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>just okay.</li>
            <li>It is very rich and creamy and does not contain sulfates.</li>
            <li>It lathered like a normal shampoo (which is impressive for being sulfate free) but didn&#x27;t do anything special for my hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is not the best, but the formula really does good on your hair and these bottles last FOREVER.</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job of moisturizing my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li>I like how it&#x27;s free of sulfate, so I gave it a try.    </li>
            <li>but I was hoping it might be paraben free.</li>
            <li>I bought this item to go along with the sulfate free shampoo I bought from bed head</li>
            <li>I enjoy bed head products all together...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard for me to put my finger on what, but it is a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and works well, but leaves my hair feeling heavy...</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so much more soft...  </li>
            <li>I only had this kind of problem once before with another product</li>
            <li>The first bottle I received was 1/3 of the way full.</li>
            <li>It took me a few days to get used to my hair not feeling as soft right out of the shower as a store-bought conditioner but the results are great!  </li>
            <li>My hair feels and looks the best it has in a long time and that means a lot coming from a girl with some long locks!!</li>
            <li>Gone is the dandruff which no other shampoo has EVER been able to remove.</li>
            <li>(exactly what I wanted).  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m constantly coming back for more :-)</li>
            <li>I have fine coloured hair, yet it is thick and gets knotted with many conditioners.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feelings like silk and very managable.</li>
            <li>and once I stop the use my hair stopped falling out so much.</li>
            <li>I would have like a more floral scent instead of the hinted strawberry, but I am not interested in buying this for the smell.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>but this particular shampoo and conditioner are among my favorites.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other brands of sulfate-free conditions and this one was by far the best and even adds a little bit of volume so my hair is not stick straight</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both this condition and the Superstar shampoo.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this one</li>
            <li>I have insanely fine hair and without any other product I can tell a difference.</li>
            <li>No build-up, soft, shiny, bouncin and behavin!</li>
            <li>The second bottle smelled rotten and the shampoo itself was thicker than the shampoo in the first bottle I received.</li>
            <li>This is a huge bottle, so it will last you a long while.</li>
            <li>I have dreadfully thick and easy tangle hair and this conditioner makes it very manageable.</li>
            <li>Its the only conditioner that has ever really worked on my hair.</li>
            <li>Hair soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>I ordered directly from Amazon and not another seller.</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft and it doesn&#x27;t seem as weighted down after I use this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long time fan of Superstar Shampoo and Conditioner and highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> I recommend using the conditioner only every other shampoo though, as conditioner can weigh you down just by the nature of the product.</li>
            <li> It made my hair a LOT softer than other conditioners I have tried.</li>
            <li> This works well on my thick, coarse, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> They say this is \\&quot;for Thick, Massive, Hair\\&quot;, but in reality it is to GIVE you \\&quot;Thick, Massive, Hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> B000XT89S8 TIGI Bed Head Superstar Conditioner for Thick Massive Hair, 25.36 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Bed Head&#x27;s \\&quot;Superstar\\&quot; line of products is for those needing a little lift and life to their hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works, year round.</li>
            <li> There was dried shampoo all over the bottle.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this, and I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> not sure what others think,</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells bad its the smell of a wet towel that never got dry correctly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I might be left bald.</li>
            <li> Well, and in other countries, where they are illegal.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick (and I mean REALLY thick, like honey!), and smells like strawberry cough syrup.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that it is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parabens are preservatives that are found in breast tumors (see ingredients such as: Methylparaben, Propylparaben, etc).</li>
            <li> The shampoo was still very thick, however.</li>
            <li> Sad because I&#x27;m gaga for the candy smell of Bed Head.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I do not recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> and I am completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am shocked!</li>
            <li> And thats not the worst of it after I immediately used it my hair was falling (I&#x27;m used to having a couple of hairs fall out when I shower</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This conditioner is the best I have ever tried. To me, Redkin doesn&#x27;t come close. I have a sulfate allergy, and this shampoo and conditioner set is heavenly. It leaves my hair feelings like silk and very managable. The scent is good, nothing great. I would have like a more floral scent instead of the hinted strawberry, but I am not interested in buying this for the smell. A little goes a long way with this, and I have very thick hair. Reccommended.</li>
            <li> It took me a few days to get used to my hair not feeling as soft right out of the shower as a store-bought conditioner but the results are great!  No build-up, soft, shiny, bouncin and behavin!</li>
            <li> I tried so many shampoos that I can&#x27;t even tell...    This one is ok. It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just... not that good. I like how it&#x27;s free of sulfate, so I gave it a try.    But when I&#x27;m finished with this bottle I&#x27;ll definitely going back to \\&quot;Yest to Carrots\\&quot; shampoo. It makes my hair so much more soft...  Sad because I&#x27;m gaga for the candy smell of Bed Head.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and it smells just as amazing as the shampoo that goes with it. My hair feels and looks the best it has in a long time and that means a lot coming from a girl with some long locks!! THANK YOU BEDHEAD &amp; Amazong for the fantastic price!</li>
            <li> This works well on my thick, coarse, wavy hair.  It is very rich and creamy and does not contain sulfates.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is AMAZING!! My hair has never felt so healthy.  I have not cut my hair in 4 month and I don&#x27;t have any split ends.  I wait 6 weeks to color my hair because it helps it not to fade!! The matching shampoo and conditioner is simply magic.</li>
            <li> I recently had my hair chemically straightened (Brazilian Blowout) and needed a sulfate-free shampoo and condition to protect the product.  I&#x27;ve tried several other brands of sulfate-free conditions and this one was by far the best and even adds a little bit of volume so my hair is not stick straight (exactly what I wanted).  I highly recommend both this condition and the Superstar shampoo.</li>
            <li> I personally think this stuff smells like Heaven. My hair is super soft and it doesn&#x27;t seem as weighted down after I use this conditioner. I have long, fine hair. This is a huge bottle, so it will last you a long while. I love the pump on it. A+ product.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!! Best! Its the only conditioner that has ever really worked on my hair. I am shocked!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time fan of Superstar Shampoo and Conditioner and highly recommend it. I have fine coloured hair, yet it is thick and gets knotted with many conditioners. This is one conditioner that makes my hair combable at the end without making is so silky it goes flat.  No sulfates in this too which is an extra bonus.  I LOVE the smell too - strawberries... delish! Highly recommend this one and I&#x27;m constantly coming back for more :-)</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner. I have dreadfully thick and easy tangle hair and this conditioner makes it very manageable. Also being allergic to sulphates in my shampoo, this product used in conjunction with their Superstar Sulphate Free Shampoo is the perfect hair care regime! Gone is the dandruff which no other shampoo has EVER been able to remove.</li>
            <li> Great product.....only one of a few that my daughter will use on a regular basis.  Hair soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> Bed Head&#x27;s \\&quot;Superstar\\&quot; line of products is for those needing a little lift and life to their hair. I have fine hair, but a lot of it. This conditioner works, year round. It does an excellent job of moisturizing my hair without weighing it down. The scent is delicious, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> They say this is \\&quot;for Thick, Massive, Hair\\&quot;, but in reality it is to GIVE you \\&quot;Thick, Massive, Hair\\&quot;. It is a volumizing conditioner, and an AWESOME one at that. I have insanely fine hair and without any other product I can tell a difference. I recommend using the conditioner only every other shampoo though, as conditioner can weigh you down just by the nature of the product.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Tigi products and recently switched from S-Factor to Bed Head products. The smell is great and works well, but leaves my hair feeling heavy... as if I need to strip my hair. The S-Factor never left my hair feeling like that. I remedied by using a much smaller amount of conditioner, which doesn&#x27;t work as well. All in all, a great product.</li>
            <li> Love it...great price, great product and smells great.  Will order again.  Also, purchased the conditioner and love that too.  I love the smell...not sure what others think, but I love it.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered this a long time ago and am just now writing a review.  I purchased from Amazon directly (not another seller) and had ordered this based on the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are not listed here but I was hoping it might be paraben free. I was disappointed to find that it is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parabens are preservatives that are found in breast tumors (see ingredients such as: Methylparaben, Propylparaben, etc). They are hormone disruptors, and our skin being our largest organ, this is a problem, in my book.  Well, and in other countries, where they are illegal.  It&#x27;s a shame, in my opinion, that they are in American products at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, off my soapbox.  Needless to say, I do not recommend this product.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to go along with the sulfate free shampoo I bought from bed head and I am completely disappointed. The conditioner smells bad its the smell of a wet towel that never got dry correctly. And thats not the worst of it after I immediately used it my hair was falling (I&#x27;m used to having a couple of hairs fall out when I shower but this was a lot!) out I thought maybe by the next time but after a week of use I refuse to use it again I&#x27;m afraid I might be left bald. I only had this kind of problem once before with another product and once I stop the use my hair stopped falling out so much. Buyer be ware the shampoo is great the conditioner not at all!</li>
            <li> TIGI Bed Head works just like it&#x27;s suppose to. I&#x27;ve always had great success and no complaints. [[ASIN:B000XT89S8 TIGI Bed Head Superstar Conditioner for Thick Massive Hair, 25.36 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! It controls the frizz and makes my hair soft without weighing it down. It&#x27;s the only conditioner I use.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner. It made my hair a LOT softer than other conditioners I have tried. It smells kind of like strawberries, but also like something else. It&#x27;s hard for me to put my finger on what, but it is a very pleasant smell. I would repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, the shampoo that goes with this conditioner is a completely different story. It&#x27;s thick (and I mean REALLY thick, like honey!), and smells like strawberry cough syrup. I ordered directly from Amazon and not another seller. The first bottle I received was 1/3 of the way full. There was dried shampoo all over the bottle. I didn&#x27;t bother opening it. The second bottle smelled rotten and the shampoo itself was thicker than the shampoo in the first bottle I received. The third bottle had thinner shampoo and smelled just okay. The shampoo was still very thick, however. It lathered like a normal shampoo (which is impressive for being sulfate free) but didn&#x27;t do anything special for my hair. I think there are many superior alternatives to the shampoo that are cheaper.</li>
            <li> I enjoy bed head products all together... but this particular shampoo and conditioner are among my favorites. The smell is not the best, but the formula really does good on your hair and these bottles last FOREVER.</li>
