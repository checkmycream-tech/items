            <li>happy customer!!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>best product ever.</li>
            <li>so I am happy!</li>
            <li>Always works perfect without a fault!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Now that that&#x27;s out of the way, the product itself is great.</li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>Great color, no need for bleach.</li>
            <li>Awesome and easy!</li>
            <li>I used it on my hair and it seemed to work semi-well but not as bright as it used to make my hair.</li>
            <li>In college, I remember a good friend having luck with the fuchsia version.</li>
            <li>I loved it since all you had to do was mix the colour developer and colour , brush the dye into your hair, wait 30 minutes and wash it out.</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>The color is amazing.</li>
            <li>though it looked amazing</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would give permanent color, unlike most bright colors on the market.</li>
            <li>This color shows amazingly everywhere.</li>
            <li>This color is amazing.</li>
            <li>However, it does contain peroxide, which for me was about 80% as effective in lightening my hair as bleach.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of these for sure!</li>
            <li>It always comes out a brilliant, bright red, and LASTS.</li>
            <li>It advertises as being a bright color without the use of bleach, which is true.</li>
            <li>: this covered the remaining blue perfectly and is super bright.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing is not having to bleach my hair with it.</li>
            <li>Would work better with bleached or virgin (not treated hair)</li>
            <li>Love this product, the best red on the market.</li>
            <li>Have I mentioned I love it?</li>
            <li>I never found anything better than this hair dye.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for someone who does not wash their hair as much as I do.</li>
            <li>and mine turned burgundy, which i love it even better.</li>
            <li>Then you have to wait 30 MORE minutes for that to seep in.</li>
            <li>I love this dye.</li>
            <li>Roots became more of a problem than fading.</li>
            <li>LOVE that there&#x27;s no bleach to damage hair :)</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find it here</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly the best red for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this hair dye, wish it was sold in stores again.</li>
            <li>and I love it. :)</li>
            <li>I love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it on my hair as all over color for years.</li>
            <li>Love it so much!!!!</li>
            <li>I used to be able to easily find this box at stores</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best true red</li>
            <li>Color lasts and lasts, 4-8 weeks EASY.</li>
            <li>Really easy</li>
            <li>(at first it looked really nice)</li>
            <li>I just wish it was sold in stores around me, luckily I can find it online!</li>
            <li>/&gt;And, of course, as so many people have mentioned, it is great to have single application instead of a separate bleaching process!</li>
            <li>The color didn&#x27;t do anything except bleach out my hair to a light brown.  </li>
            <li>so I had just come to the conclusion that I would never be able to dye my hair fun colors, until I tried this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product gives you the redest red out of any product I have ever used, it is a great coloring product.  </li>
            <li>This did a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>After I applied it and washed it out, I was surprised that it was so bright still.</li>
            <li>color was shimmering and vibrant, and the hair looked healthy and shiny - waaaaaaaaaaay better than what it looks like on the packaging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The color was definitely nice and vibrant until I washed it after the end of the week.</li>
            <li>so I went from 5 stars (original review) to 3 stars.  </li>
            <li>Original review</li>
            <li>a semipermanent dye like Special Effects or Manic Panic does.</li>
            <li>The red comes out bright</li>
            <li>It was cool while it lasted</li>
            <li>All in all, 6 months later its faded a bit but still looks damn good to be a home kit.</li>
            <li>I love this color so much.</li>
            <li>I was super stoked to find them</li>
            <li>The all-in-one application is super convenient, and the dye doesn&#x27;t rinse out or fade the way</li>
            <li>Which was actually pretty cool, it looked like my hair went from bright red and faded into</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for dark hair, one step, no bleaching process.</li>
            <li>Maybe the Fuchsia Flash was marginally more cool-toned, but it is definitely still a bright red.</li>
            <li>I liked only having to do one step for coloring.</li>
            <li>Possibly it was expired, as I didn&#x27;t find any kind of date on it, and I know that it&#x27;s a discontinued product?   </li>
            <li>Splat gives a nice colour, but it&#x27;s not significantly different from colour rays.</li>
            <li>very easy to use, super lasting</li>
            <li>/&gt;They arrived within a week of ordering, so pretty quick.</li>
            <li>If you want bright red, long lasting streaks or even a full head of red, this is the perfect dye!</li>
            <li>The bleach and color are all included and you just mix them together right before you apply it to your hair.  </li>
            <li>I used the fuschia one (which is a lot more pink than I consider fuschia to be, but that&#x27;s just me) and it really is easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a gel and will drip every where if your not careful.</li>
            <li>though it is for highlights I use it for my whole head, I love this red and it came at the right time, shipped promptly, Will buy from them again!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much longer it would&#x27;ve been there because I cut my hair, but this is by far the best hair dye I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>and they just turned a very light red</li>
            <li>I had missed my roots in my original bleaching attempt, but the highlighting wand got right into them and the blend is seamless.    </li>
            <li>Arrived so fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll tell you first and foremost that this product WILL PERMANENTLY LIGHTEN YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li>I really, really wanted to like this product!</li>
            <li>But recently I needed to re-dye my bangs since after about 4-5 weeks the colour fades and my roots stick out, but I wasn&#x27;t able to buy colour rays and had to buy Splat hair dye instead.</li>
            <li>I have dreads/locs and wanted something to pop on my African-American hair without bleaching it first.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I purchased both the red and the purple Loreal Colour rays from wal mart previously and LOVED these dyes!</li>
            <li>I have dark black-brown hair and the Red Rays showed up beautifully.</li>
            <li>No bleaching, no bleeding, it&#x27;s seriously the best red dye out there.</li>
            <li>Hers was light orange in a week or two, while mine stayed vibrant red, moving to a more orange red after a month or two.</li>
            <li>Honestly,  This is the only real true red that I can find that is perminant and doesnt fade to fusha or pink</li>
            <li>Really there is no product like this</li>
            <li>I needed 4 kits to do my whole head.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>however, the color is most definitely PINK.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fast and easier than using splat.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>always this color, It does wash out fast, so I wash my hair once a week.  </li>
            <li>It really stands out.</li>
            <li>And now I have pink-streaked hair, which is ok, except that I really don&#x27;t like the color pink.</li>
            <li>Maybe I got an expired product because normally this hair dye is amazing, even on very dark hair.</li>
            <li>It seems to last longer than most other red dyes and it goes on pretty easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found, works on dark hair (without having to use lightener, in fact don&#x27;t use lightener if you use this product, it won&#x27;t stay in as well) and doesn&#x27;t fade as quickly as most reds.</li>
            <li>ive used both colors and love them the red I think is my fav be warned tho it does &amp;#34;bleach out&amp;#34; or lighten your hair so when it fades my hair ends up being a blonde color</li>
            <li>would love to see magenta red or runaway red in this product.</li>
            <li>My FAVORITE hair color, its the only red I use and</li>
            <li>This seller is so lucky I have such fierce loyalty to this product!</li>
            <li>I used it five years ago without realizing this, and had to have my hair professionally dyed back to my original color before senior portraits at school.    </li>
            <li>and now it lookes like a light pink color.</li>
            <li>I was upset because it&#x27;s my favorite shade of red and the one that works the best on my dark hair (naturally black) with the least amount of hassle.</li>
            <li>Leave in longer for more vibrant &amp;#34;in-your-face&amp;#34; red, and leave in for just a few minutes for a really sexy, deep ruby red.</li>
            <li>I think my favorite part is that the rubber gloves they give you actually fit your hands with elastic, instead of being plastic bags vaguely in the shape of hands.</li>
            <li>is the only hair dye I have ever found that works without me having to bleach first.</li>
            <li>I first dyed my hair red about 4 years ago.</li>
            <li>When I mixed the chemicals together like I always do, the consistency seemed very off to me, it was thicker than normal, not as liquidy as it should have been.</li>
            <li>need more choices of red because this does not fade at all on naturally black hair.</li>
            <li>, red fades, that&#x27;s just how it is - but this this Color rays lasted as long as any red color I&#x27;ve tried, and faded out in really pretty shades - no ugly orangey/brassy</li>
            <li>After the times up you go and wash the colour out until the water runs clear.   </li>
            <li>Had no trouble using this product.</li>
            <li>I dyed my hair completely red with this a few times, and my hair stayed healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only  right shade of red for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have blond hair and the color look like a vibrant red.</li>
            <li>The first time I dyed it, my blonde friend put a streak of it in her hair at the same time.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone, but with the warning that their hair will never go back to normal afterward.</li>
            <li>I had used temp colors from hot topic before, but I hadn&#x27;t wanted to bleach my hair, so it just never really worked.</li>
            <li>I have naturally black hair and don&#x27;t want to bleach it because I already do enough damage as it is with dyeing and flat ironing, so I tried a bunch of different hair dyes that are supposed to be bright and vibrant on dark hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this exact product before, purchased in-store, and in the past it has turned my dark brown hair into a lovely shade of fire engine red, but not these boxes.  </li>
            <li>Maybe lay down newspapers or something first.</li>
            <li>Ok so i normally dye my hair black every other month but decided instead of black to use red colour rays.</li>
            <li>This is the only hair color that works on my daughters&#x27; jet black hair without having to bleach their hair first.</li>
            <li>Even with the contrast to dark hair mine came out brighter in some areas verses others and faded fast.</li>
            <li>I also have very dark hair and dont need to bleach it out first for it to make my hair red.</li>
            <li>I usually just buy two boxes, and these are cheap enough to not really be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have black mediterranean hair, very hard to bleach or color, this dye makes a vibrant red in one short, easy step.</li>

            <li> so I went from 5 stars (original review) to 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> Original review</li>
            <li> a semipermanent dye like Special Effects or Manic Panic does.</li>
            <li> The red comes out bright</li>
            <li> It was cool while it lasted</li>

            <li> Splat gives a nice colour, but it&#x27;s not significantly different from colour rays.</li>
            <li> very easy to use, super lasting</li>
            <li> /&gt;They arrived within a week of ordering, so pretty quick.</li>
            <li> If you want bright red, long lasting streaks or even a full head of red, this is the perfect dye!</li>
            <li> The bleach and color are all included and you just mix them together right before you apply it to your hair.  </li>
            <li> I used the fuschia one (which is a lot more pink than I consider fuschia to be, but that&#x27;s just me) and it really is easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a gel and will drip every where if your not careful.</li>
            <li> though it is for highlights I use it for my whole head, I love this red and it came at the right time, shipped promptly, Will buy from them again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much longer it would&#x27;ve been there because I cut my hair, but this is by far the best hair dye I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> and they just turned a very light red</li>
            <li> I had missed my roots in my original bleaching attempt, but the highlighting wand got right into them and the blend is seamless.    </li>
            <li> Arrived so fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll tell you first and foremost that this product WILL PERMANENTLY LIGHTEN YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to like this product!</li>
            <li> But recently I needed to re-dye my bangs since after about 4-5 weeks the colour fades and my roots stick out, but I wasn&#x27;t able to buy colour rays and had to buy Splat hair dye instead.</li>
            <li> I have dreads/locs and wanted something to pop on my African-American hair without bleaching it first.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I purchased both the red and the purple Loreal Colour rays from wal mart previously and LOVED these dyes!</li>
            <li> I have dark black-brown hair and the Red Rays showed up beautifully.</li>
            <li> No bleaching, no bleeding, it&#x27;s seriously the best red dye out there.</li>
            <li> Hers was light orange in a week or two, while mine stayed vibrant red, moving to a more orange red after a month or two.</li>
            <li> Honestly,  This is the only real true red that I can find that is perminant and doesnt fade to fusha or pink</li>
            <li> Really there is no product like this</li>
            <li> I needed 4 kits to do my whole head.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> however, the color is most definitely PINK.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s fast and easier than using splat.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> always this color, It does wash out fast, so I wash my hair once a week.  </li>
            <li> It really stands out.</li>
            <li> And now I have pink-streaked hair, which is ok, except that I really don&#x27;t like the color pink.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got an expired product because normally this hair dye is amazing, even on very dark hair.</li>
            <li> It seems to last longer than most other red dyes and it goes on pretty easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found, works on dark hair (without having to use lightener, in fact don&#x27;t use lightener if you use this product, it won&#x27;t stay in as well) and doesn&#x27;t fade as quickly as most reds.</li>
            <li> ive used both colors and love them the red I think is my fav be warned tho it does &amp;#34;bleach out&amp;#34; or lighten your hair so when it fades my hair ends up being a blonde color</li>
            <li> would love to see magenta red or runaway red in this product.</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE hair color, its the only red I use and</li>
            <li> This seller is so lucky I have such fierce loyalty to this product!</li>
            <li> I used it five years ago without realizing this, and had to have my hair professionally dyed back to my original color before senior portraits at school.    </li>
            <li> and now it lookes like a light pink color.</li>
            <li> I was upset because it&#x27;s my favorite shade of red and the one that works the best on my dark hair (naturally black) with the least amount of hassle.</li>
            <li> Leave in longer for more vibrant &amp;#34;in-your-face&amp;#34; red, and leave in for just a few minutes for a really sexy, deep ruby red.</li>
            <li> I think my favorite part is that the rubber gloves they give you actually fit your hands with elastic, instead of being plastic bags vaguely in the shape of hands.</li>
            <li> is the only hair dye I have ever found that works without me having to bleach first.</li>
            <li> I first dyed my hair red about 4 years ago.</li>
            <li> When I mixed the chemicals together like I always do, the consistency seemed very off to me, it was thicker than normal, not as liquidy as it should have been.</li>
            <li> need more choices of red because this does not fade at all on naturally black hair.</li>
            <li> , red fades, that&#x27;s just how it is - but this this Color rays lasted as long as any red color I&#x27;ve tried, and faded out in really pretty shades - no ugly orangey/brassy</li>
            <li> After the times up you go and wash the colour out until the water runs clear.   </li>
            <li> Had no trouble using this product.</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair completely red with this a few times, and my hair stayed healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only  right shade of red for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have blond hair and the color look like a vibrant red.</li>
            <li> The first time I dyed it, my blonde friend put a streak of it in her hair at the same time.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone, but with the warning that their hair will never go back to normal afterward.</li>
            <li> I had used temp colors from hot topic before, but I hadn&#x27;t wanted to bleach my hair, so it just never really worked.</li>
            <li> I have naturally black hair and don&#x27;t want to bleach it because I already do enough damage as it is with dyeing and flat ironing, so I tried a bunch of different hair dyes that are supposed to be bright and vibrant on dark hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this exact product before, purchased in-store, and in the past it has turned my dark brown hair into a lovely shade of fire engine red, but not these boxes.  </li>
            <li> Maybe lay down newspapers or something first.</li>
            <li> Ok so i normally dye my hair black every other month but decided instead of black to use red colour rays.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair color that works on my daughters&#x27; jet black hair without having to bleach their hair first.</li>
            <li> Even with the contrast to dark hair mine came out brighter in some areas verses others and faded fast.</li>
            <li> I also have very dark hair and dont need to bleach it out first for it to make my hair red.</li>
            <li> I usually just buy two boxes, and these are cheap enough to not really be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have black mediterranean hair, very hard to bleach or color, this dye makes a vibrant red in one short, easy step.</li>
            <li> (I am a natural dark brunette.)  </li>
            <li> I have a very dark brown natural hair color, so it was such a relief to find this product.</li>
            <li> I dip dyed the ends of my hair and left the rest dark, and the second time, I colored the entire head in streaks.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is so dark, typical reds that I find at the store don&#x27;t show much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian (black hair), and the &#x27;Colour Rays&#x27; products are the only off the shelf dyes that actually work without pre-bleaching and lasts for months.</li>
            <li> If you have rly dark coarse hair, though, you may want to keep it on for up to double the recommended time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I hope they continue to carry it for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like that it dosen&#x27;t stay in for long.</li>
            <li> Long hair will need to two boxes for all over color.</li>
            <li> The color is a dramatic red when I first apply it and as it fades until the next application it gradually softens to a pleasing pink color.  </li>
            <li> All the other boxes last maybe a week and are always some purple or brown shade.</li>
            <li> Will be using this product as long as I can get my hands on it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair red for the past 6 years with Red Rays, but noticed that the Red Rays started looking bronzey/orange on me for some reason.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a shampoo/conditioner so my bangs don&#x27;t dry out and frizz.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally dark red hair</li>
            <li> - this was not much of an issue for me, but if you want to hide grey, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : You gotta be careful with how long you leave this product in.</li>
            <li> Didnt bother with the wand since my hair isnt loose, just rubber gloves and assistance from my daughter.</li>
            <li> its the only color dye that turns my hair a color other than dark.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to anyone with dark hair!</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that there almost isn&#x27;t enough in one box to cover my hair.</li>
            <li> It has now been two months since i used colour rays and my hair is still rinsing pink in the shower</li>
            <li> Her hair turned pink.</li>
            <li> To the people complaining that it didn&#x27;t stay long enough on their dark hair, notice that everyone on the boxes has dark hair, and it is made specifically for people with dark hair.</li>
            <li> not like a block of red and then a block of black!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s red not orange and the color stays for a little while longer than other brands.  </li>
            <li> The product, both boxes purchased, was long, long past expiration.  </li>
            <li> This is the only hair color i have found to work on my dark brown hair without bleaching my hair!!</li>
            <li> I had previously bleached by hair and dyed it blue with Splat, and the color was looking pretty sad after a few weeks</li>
            <li> do have a few strands of grey though</li>
            <li> It DOES show up on dark hair (although brighter at the roots, which is to be expected)...</li>
            <li> and I only use this as a small highlight color</li>
            <li> My roots wash out into a less brassy-looking red after one or two washes, but just saying that I noticed a change over the past two years.</li>
            <li> (if you have dark hair like me) and then wash it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been adding this color as highlights to my dark brown hair for over a year.</li>
            <li> Getting the dye out of the tube was a little hard, but mixing it with the peroxide was simple.</li>
            <li> Did not color my black hair at all.</li>
            <li> Did ship quickly no problem there just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> so i dyed over it with black and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking with hottopic or something else, this came out of my hair in less then a week.</li>
            <li> In the end my bangs are red again, but they are dried out, my bathrooms a mess, and I&#x27;m annoyed.   </li>
            <li> What a waste of $20.</li>
            <li> Plus it was missing the wand to use to highlight and mix.</li>
            <li> I will probably darken it in two or three weeks, so basically this was a waste of time and money for me.</li>
            <li> so i though it would cover my dyed black hair..WRONG!</li>
            <li> black (yes faded!</li>
            <li> My hair dye days are long over, but back when I was a crazy teenager</li>
            <li> (And, yes, expired hair dye usually will not color the way that it&#x27;s intended to.)</li>
            <li> usually prefer coloring all of my hair as opposed to doing highlights or tips, so</li>
            <li> Splat comes with bleach and colour, the bleach is hard to mix since all they give you is a bottle to shake, you have to sit 30 minutes</li>
            <li> but I just find that hard to use.</li>
            <li> ALMOST no bleeding even after hard workouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to buy this all the time at wal*mart, and lately it has been gone from the shelves</li>
            <li> I use this to just touch up my roots now, but I feel like it sometimes looks a bit orange lately.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, thick hair.</li>
            <li> and when it fades out after a couple months, my hair goes back to brown rather than nasty blonde.</li>
            <li> When it fades, it fades to brown, not some crazy pink or something.</li>
            <li> but they were very weak, unlike before.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy with the turnout.</li>
            <li> So sad!</li>
            <li> The color was very faint, It was almost like using a temporary hair dye.</li>
            <li> This is horrible, dont buy any...</li>

            <li> The product, both boxes purchased, was long, long past expiration.  The color didn&#x27;t do anything except bleach out my hair to a light brown.  (I am a natural dark brunette.)  I&#x27;ve used this exact product before, purchased in-store, and in the past it has turned my dark brown hair into a lovely shade of fire engine red, but not these boxes.  Had I known that this seller was selling expired hair dye - and without noting it in the product description - I never would have purchased it.  What a waste of $20. (And, yes, expired hair dye usually will not color the way that it&#x27;s intended to.)</li>
            <li> I love these! I used to get them at Walmart, but for some reason Walmart stopped carrying them. I was super stoked to find them here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only hair dye I have ever found that works without me having to bleach first. I have a very dark brown natural hair color, so it was such a relief to find this product. Bleaching wrecks my hair so I had just come to the conclusion that I would never be able to dye my hair fun colors, until I tried this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually prefer coloring all of my hair as opposed to doing highlights or tips, so my only complaint is that there almost isn&#x27;t enough in one box to cover my hair. I have shoulder length, thick hair. I usually just buy two boxes, and these are cheap enough to not really be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrived within a week of ordering, so pretty quick. I will be ordering more of these for sure!</li>
            <li> I have brown hair and have used this product for 9 years. If you want bright red, long lasting streaks or even a full head of red, this is the perfect dye! My favorite thing is not having to bleach my hair with it. Basically somehow it bleaches and dyes my hair all at the same time and when it fades out after a couple months, my hair goes back to brown rather than nasty blonde. Really there is no product like this and I hope they continue to carry it for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> The color is amazing. I have blond hair and the color look like a vibrant red. I though it looked amazing but it started to fade and you could tell it was fading after about two weeks. It has been in my hair for about three weeks and now it lookes like a light pink color. I am definentaly redying my hair this color. I just don&#x27;t like that it dosen&#x27;t stay in for long.</li>
            <li> Arrived so fast! The amount of color in each Kit is not enough, maybe to highlight your bangs or a part of your hair. I needed 4 kits to do my whole head. Even with the contrast to dark hair mine came out brighter in some areas verses others and faded fast. I still like the product though. Would work better with bleached or virgin (not treated hair)</li>
            <li> Did not color my black hair at all. Did ship quickly no problem there just didn&#x27;t work. Plus it was missing the wand to use to highlight and mix.</li>
            <li> Ok so i normally dye my hair black every other month but decided instead of black to use red colour rays. It says on the box it covers all hair colors so i though it would cover my dyed black hair..WRONG! It only died my roots that had grown out from not being dyed in a month. Which was actually pretty cool, it looked like my hair went from bright red and faded into black (yes faded! not like a block of red and then a block of black!) It was cool while it lasted but then my roots started showing again so i dyed over it with black and the red still shows through!! It has now been two months since i used colour rays and my hair is still rinsing pink in the shower haha.</li>
            <li> this product gives you the redest red out of any product I have ever used, it is a great coloring product.  I have used it before and hope that it continues to be around, even tho it&#x27;s discontinued at stores.  I hope I can always find it online.</li>
            <li> Love this product, the best red on the market. Color lasts and lasts, 4-8 weeks EASY. I have black mediterranean hair, very hard to bleach or color, this dye makes a vibrant red in one short, easy step. Have I mentioned I love it? Long hair will need to two boxes for all over color.</li>
            <li> I purchased both the red and the purple Loreal Colour rays from wal mart previously and LOVED these dyes! When I couldnt find them in my local walmart I ordered them,... I dont know if they were expired or what the deal is but they were very weak, unlike before. The color was very faint, It was almost like using a temporary hair dye. I was unhappy with the turnout.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll tell you first and foremost that this product WILL PERMANENTLY LIGHTEN YOUR HAIR. It advertises as being a bright color without the use of bleach, which is true. However, it does contain peroxide, which for me was about 80% as effective in lightening my hair as bleach. When all the color washes out, your hair will be lighter where you used it. I used it five years ago without realizing this, and had to have my hair professionally dyed back to my original color before senior portraits at school.    Now that that&#x27;s out of the way, the product itself is great. I used the fuschia one (which is a lot more pink than I consider fuschia to be, but that&#x27;s just me) and it really is easy. Getting the dye out of the tube was a little hard, but mixing it with the peroxide was simple. I think my favorite part is that the rubber gloves they give you actually fit your hands with elastic, instead of being plastic bags vaguely in the shape of hands. I liked only having to do one step for coloring. I had previously bleached by hair and dyed it blue with Splat, and the color was looking pretty sad after a few weeks: this covered the remaining blue perfectly and is super bright. I had missed my roots in my original bleaching attempt, but the highlighting wand got right into them and the blend is seamless.    I would recommend this product to anyone, but with the warning that their hair will never go back to normal afterward.</li>
            <li> I have dark black-brown hair and the Red Rays showed up beautifully. If you have rly dark coarse hair, though, you may want to keep it on for up to double the recommended time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this twice - once I dip dyed the ends of my hair and left the rest dark, and the second time, I colored the entire head in streaks. Both turned out gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color was shimmering and vibrant, and the hair looked healthy and shiny - waaaaaaaaaaay better than what it looks like on the packaging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a few strands of grey though and they just turned a very light red - this was not much of an issue for me, but if you want to hide grey, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, red fades, that&#x27;s just how it is - but this this Color rays lasted as long as any red color I&#x27;ve tried, and faded out in really pretty shades - no ugly orangey/brassy tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, of course, as so many people have mentioned, it is great to have single application instead of a separate bleaching process!</li>
            <li> My hair dye days are long over, but back when I was a crazy teenager (so, 2011) I never found anything better than this hair dye. The all-in-one application is super convenient, and the dye doesn&#x27;t rinse out or fade the way a semipermanent dye like Special Effects or Manic Panic does. I never dyed my entire head with it, but I bet you could if you wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+</li>
            <li> I mix this with regular red color for longer lasting and redder highlights.  It&#x27;s  REAL RED and you do not want to spill the color on anything but your hair.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided to give this product a try. I used on the front of my hair on the bang area. The color was definitely nice and vibrant until I washed it after the end of the week. It&#x27;s a great product for someone who does not wash their hair as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to like this product! In college, I remember a good friend having luck with the fuchsia version. I wanted red streaks in my hair, so decided to try this.   It DOES show up on dark hair (although brighter at the roots, which is to be expected)...however, the color is most definitely PINK. Not red. At all. And yes, I checked the packaging, and they sent me red, not fuchsia. Possibly it was expired, as I didn&#x27;t find any kind of date on it, and I know that it&#x27;s a discontinued product?   And now I have pink-streaked hair, which is ok, except that I really don&#x27;t like the color pink. I will probably darken it in two or three weeks, so basically this was a waste of time and money for me. So sad!</li>
            <li> this is the only coloring I don&#x27;t have to bleach and wait forever to take in my hair ive used both colors and love them the red I think is my fav be warned tho it does &amp;#34;bleach out&amp;#34; or lighten your hair so when it fades my hair ends up being a blonde color I have naturally dark red hair and I only use this as a small highlight color so it never bugs me</li>
            <li> I was looking for a fushia color with one of my friends and she had blonde highlights and i had colored hair. Her hair turned pink. and mine turned burgundy, which i love it even better. its the only color dye that turns my hair a color other than dark. i wish they still sold at stores.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 12 years and I love it!  I use it for a red streak - not all over my head.  The color is a dramatic red when I first apply it and as it fades until the next application it gradually softens to a pleasing pink color.  (I get compliments on the color even when it has gone to the lighter shade.)  The bleach and color are all included and you just mix them together right before you apply it to your hair.  Really easy and, yes, it works!!!</li>
            <li> I started dyeing my bangs a while back and this is what I&#x27;ve always used. I loved it since all you had to do was mix the colour developer and colour , brush the dye into your hair, wait 30 minutes and wash it out. It also comes with a shampoo/conditioner so my bangs don&#x27;t dry out and frizz.  But recently I needed to re-dye my bangs since after about 4-5 weeks the colour fades and my roots stick out, but I wasn&#x27;t able to buy colour rays and had to buy Splat hair dye instead. Splat comes with bleach and colour, the bleach is hard to mix since all they give you is a bottle to shake, you have to sit 30 minutes (if you have dark hair like me) and then wash it out. After your hair dries, you then apply the colour. It&#x27;s more of a gel and will drip every where if your not careful. Then you have to wait 30 MORE minutes for that to seep in. After the times up you go and wash the colour out until the water runs clear.   Splat gives a nice colour, but it&#x27;s not significantly different from colour rays. Colour rays is a lot faster and cleaner.   In the end my bangs are red again, but they are dried out, my bathrooms a mess, and I&#x27;m annoyed.   Stick with colour rays, it&#x27;s fast and easier than using splat.</li>
            <li> fast shipping. great product. happy customer!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find in Walmart anymore. This is the only hair color that works on my daughters&#x27; jet black hair without having to bleach their hair first. Have used this product for 8 years. Each coloring lasts between 4 to 6 weeks with regular hair washing.</li>
            <li> it works for others but not for me.... I&#x27;m sticking with hottopic or something else, this came out of my hair in less then a week. (at first it looked really nice)</li>
            <li> this hair dye for years, always this color, It does wash out fast, so I wash my hair once a week.  Great color, no need for bleach.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this all the time at wal*mart, and lately it has been gone from the shelves so I ordered it off Amazon. When I mixed the chemicals together like I always do, the consistency seemed very off to me, it was thicker than normal, not as liquidy as it should have been. I used it on my hair and it seemed to work semi-well but not as bright as it used to make my hair. Maybe I got an expired product because normally this hair dye is amazing, even on very dark hair.</li>
            <li> I love this dye. I first dyed my hair red about 4 years ago. I was looking for something that would give permanent color, unlike most bright colors on the market. I had used temp colors from hot topic before, but I hadn&#x27;t wanted to bleach my hair, so it just never really worked. This stuff is great for dark hair, one step, no bleaching process. I dyed my hair completely red with this a few times, and my hair stayed healthy and shiny. The first time I dyed it, my blonde friend put a streak of it in her hair at the same time. Hers was light orange in a week or two, while mine stayed vibrant red, moving to a more orange red after a month or two. Roots became more of a problem than fading. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a funky color who doesn&#x27;t want to have to redye constantly. To the people complaining that it didn&#x27;t stay long enough on their dark hair, notice that everyone on the boxes has dark hair, and it is made specifically for people with dark hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome and easy! Had no trouble using this product. Great product! LOVE that there&#x27;s no bleach to damage hair :)</li>
            <li> need more choices of red because this does not fade at all on naturally black hair. would love to see magenta red or runaway red in this product. best product ever.</li>
            <li> This is horrible, dont buy any...save them for me! Honestly,  This is the only real true red that I can find that is perminant and doesnt fade to fusha or pink</li>
            <li> I have dreads/locs and wanted something to pop on my African-American hair without bleaching it first. This did a fantastic job. Be warned it doesnt have a lot in the box because its considered a highlight, so for larger heads of hair u may need 2 boxes. Didnt bother with the wand since my hair isnt loose, just rubber gloves and assistance from my daughter. Beware this stuff stains! Maybe lay down newspapers or something first. All in all, 6 months later its faded a bit but still looks damn good to be a home kit. Ordering them as often as possible now. Please keep making this L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al!</li>
            <li> I have naturally black hair and don&#x27;t want to bleach it because I already do enough damage as it is with dyeing and flat ironing, so I tried a bunch of different hair dyes that are supposed to be bright and vibrant on dark hair but none of them worked. Just when we were about to give up, I came across this one at the store. After I applied it and washed it out, I was surprised that it was so bright still. Two years passed and the color was still there, faded a lot, but still there. I&#x27;m not sure how much longer it would&#x27;ve been there because I cut my hair, but this is by far the best hair dye I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve only needed to use it twice in four years. Would definitely recommend to anyone with dark hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been adding this color as highlights to my dark brown hair for over a year. I love the color. Someone once described it as cranberry. Because my hair is so dark, typical reds that I find at the store don&#x27;t show much. Maybe in the sun, but not inside. This color shows amazingly everywhere. I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on it. It seems to last longer than most other red dyes and it goes on pretty easy. When it fades, it fades to brown, not some crazy pink or something. It doesn&#x27;t run. It comes with a highlighting tool but I just find that hard to use. I&#x27;ve done it with foil and I&#x27;ve done it with a highlighting cap. The cap was definitely easier. I used to get it at Walmart but no one seems to carry it anymore. They also used to have a purple one that they don&#x27;t seem to sell anymore. That&#x27;s a shame because I was finally put in a position where I could have the purple highlights and they stopped selling it!</li>
            <li> I love this color. ALMOST no bleeding even after hard workouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to be the only place I can find it now.....</li>
            <li> Brunette, blonde, it doesn&#x27;t matter. This color is amazing. It always comes out a brilliant, bright red, and LASTS. All the other boxes last maybe a week and are always some purple or brown shade. This is RED. I use two boxes and cover all my hair and CONSTANTLY get compliments on the shade. If you want truly red hair, this is IT. No bleaching, no bleeding, it&#x27;s seriously the best red dye out there. I can&#x27;t find it in stores here anymore, but Amazon&#x27;s price is about the same when the Walmart here carried it.</li>
            <li> My local Wal-Mart used to carry this and no longer does. I was upset because it&#x27;s my favorite shade of red and the one that works the best on my dark hair (naturally black) with the least amount of hassle. I was pleased to find it here and I hope it will remain in stock for the future!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly the best red for my hair.  It&#x27;s red not orange and the color stays for a little while longer than other brands.  I get complimented all the time on the color. I love it and I hope they never discontinue.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dye, wish it was sold in stores again. I get alot of compliments when I use this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian (black hair), and the &#x27;Colour Rays&#x27; products are the only off the shelf dyes that actually work without pre-bleaching and lasts for months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only  right shade of red for my hair. I love this color so much. It really stands out.</li>
            <li> luv it ty! don&#x27;t stain skin around the hairline or ur scalp! been using this since i was 13 im 27 now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product over and over! I also have very dark hair and dont need to bleach it out first for it to make my hair red. Absolutely love it! Just upset I cant find it in the stores anywhere.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair color i have found to work on my dark brown hair without bleaching my hair!! I used to be able to easily find this box at stores but recently it just disappeared. I wish I knew why! But it seems just as affordable through Amazon so I am happy! The red comes out bright and I love it. :)</li>
            <li> Always works perfect without a fault!</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love it so much!!!! I don&#x27;t have to bleach.</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE hair color, its the only red I use and though it is for highlights I use it for my whole head, I love this red and it came at the right time, shipped promptly, Will buy from them again!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it on my hair as all over color for years. It&#x27;s the best true red I&#x27;ve found, works on dark hair (without having to use lightener, in fact don&#x27;t use lightener if you use this product, it won&#x27;t stay in as well) and doesn&#x27;t fade as quickly as most reds. Will be using this product as long as I can get my hands on it! I just wish it was sold in stores around me, luckily I can find it online!</li>
            <li> Update: so I went from 5 stars (original review) to 3 stars.  I have tried both Red Rays and Fuchsia Flash now, and both products result in red. I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair red for the past 6 years with Red Rays, but noticed that the Red Rays started looking bronzey/orange on me for some reason. I decided to try the Fuchsia Flash instead, hoping for a cool-toned magenta color (like the box) but the results I got were nowhere as fuchsia/magenta as the model on the box showed. In fact, I still ended up with red hair. Maybe the Fuchsia Flash was marginally more cool-toned, but it is definitely still a bright red. (See photo of hair 2.5 weeks after dyeing with Fuchsia Flash.) Bottom line: whether you use Red Rays or Fuchsia Flash, you will get RED hair.  Original review: You gotta be careful with how long you leave this product in. Leave in longer for more vibrant &amp;#34;in-your-face&amp;#34; red, and leave in for just a few minutes for a really sexy, deep ruby red. I use this to just touch up my roots now, but I feel like it sometimes looks a bit orange lately. My roots wash out into a less brassy-looking red after one or two washes, but just saying that I noticed a change over the past two years. Still, this is the only product I use on my roots and refuse to use anything else - hence the 5 star review. Wish they would still stock this on the shelves. I think L&#x27;Oreal is going to discontinue this XP This seller is so lucky I have such fierce loyalty to this product!</li>
            <li> very easy to use, super lasting&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve been using it for years, it never disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;if you need red, looks no further</li>
