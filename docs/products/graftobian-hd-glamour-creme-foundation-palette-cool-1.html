            <li>excellent quality product ,</li>
            <li>The best concealer I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li>And, I also use the lightest color as a concealer, which works great!</li>
            <li>Perfect blending capacity, doesn&#x27;t come off, and is a great purchase.</li>
            <li>The coverage is great for under eyes.</li>
            <li>great palette&lt;br /&gt;cover</li>
            <li>Very happy with the purchase and will be ordering more in this and a darker palette.</li>
            <li>Good buyer product is very nice</li>
            <li>Graftobian is good forainly stage makeup.</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve like to have loved this</li>
            <li>so good</li>
            <li>I got cool 1 and its perfect to test out what colors you need.</li>
            <li>Great for mixes colors to get just that perfect shade for all cool, light skin tones.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation!</li>
            <li>my favorite concealer!</li>
            <li>Bout am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>I love this 5 color foundation palette!</li>
            <li>Love love love love this !!!</li>
            <li>So creamy and the coverage is amazing</li>
            <li>Works really nicely.</li>
            <li>Finished application looks soft and flawless.</li>
            <li>The pigmentation on this is very concentrated and works great for adding contours and highlights.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>This product was just okay.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but ever since i started using it my skin has broke out.</li>
            <li>This is nothing more than cream foundations that Re extremely light and oily.</li>
            <li>for me the 3rd works best and the 2nd as the next best option.</li>
            <li>Very creamy, smooth and easy to blend.  </li>
            <li>It was lighter on than I anticipated so I won&#x27;t be using the darkest color as a light bronzer, but you don&#x27;t need much of this creme and your face is amply</li>
            <li>Each color is smooth and creamy in texture...great for 40 plus skin with lines or wrinkles around the eyes, or, for anyone who wants the more natural, dewy look.</li>
            <li>I originally intended only to use it for my wedding, but I like it so much that I will purchase more to use as my every day foundation when I run out.</li>
            <li>I got it to have the palette range to highlight and contour my face and be able to use the same foundation in both summer and winter.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say how it would perform if it was fresh.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pretty decent.</li>
            <li>It covers very well and does not cake.</li>
            <li>I apply this blend a little and then hit with a light foundation for those special occasions or photos.  </li>
            <li>It does not brighten well like many other concealers do..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I barely need a finishing powder to absorb oil and my face is very oily!</li>
            <li>I have medium skin tone not too light not too medium dark.</li>
            <li>but the product was old.</li>
            <li>It was unopened, just smelled old.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li>covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also pleasantly surprised to find that this foundation is matte (maybe I didn&#x27;t read enough).</li>
            <li>I barely use it</li>
            <li>I am half asian and have light olive skin with pink undertones.</li>

            <li> Perfect palette.  Different tones for different spots!</li>
            <li> I like this pallette, especially under my eyes to cover dark circles.  It covers very well and does not cake.</li>
            <li> I have medium skin tone not too light not too medium dark. I got cool 1 and its perfect to test out what colors you need. for me the 3rd works best and the 2nd as the next best option. The coverage is great for under eyes. my favorite concealer!</li>
            <li> Terrible. I am an MUA and I have used every type of makeup line. Graftobian is good forainly stage makeup. I do have the banana powder by them that&#x27;s pretty decent. But this HD palette is awful. It does not brighten well like many other concealers do.. It is not HD at all. I barely use it and I even may toss it.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve like to have loved this but the product was old. I can&#x27;t really say how it would perform if it was fresh. It was unopened, just smelled old.</li>
            <li> I bought this make up because of a recommendation from a DYI bridal make-up video. I LOVE it. It goes on sheer and doesn&#x27;t look like my face is plastered with make up. I originally intended only to use it for my wedding, but I like it so much that I will purchase more to use as my every day foundation when I run out.</li>
            <li> This is nothing more than cream foundations that Re extremely light and oily. It does not give contour or highlight effects whatsoever. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> i might not be using this the right way,but it sucks.</li>
            <li> This product was just okay.</li>
            <li> excellent quality product , great palette&lt;br /&gt;cover so good dont have bad smell at all&lt;br /&gt;easy to wear under the makeup&lt;br /&gt;fast delivery</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this product over and over. The best concealer I&#x27;ve used to date. Perfect blending capacity, doesn&#x27;t come off, and is a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but ever since i started using it my skin has broke out. If you have sensitive skin i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> shades are perfect.coverage is awesome.creasing sucks.otherwise,i would have given this a 5.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried this makeup before, but had heard about it on a YouTube tutorial, and decided to give it a try. Bout am I glad I did! I love this 5 color foundation palette! Great for mixes colors to get just that perfect shade for all cool, light skin tones. And, I also use the lightest color as a concealer, which works great! Each color is smooth and creamy in texture...great for 40 plus skin with lines or wrinkles around the eyes, or, for anyone who wants the more natural, dewy look. Finished application looks soft and flawless. I highly recommend. (I suggest applying the foundation with either a beauty blender or stipple brush; I&#x27;ve used both. You&#x27;ll use less, which means you&#x27;ll waste less than if you use your fingers.)</li>
            <li> Love love love love this !!! So creamy and the coverage is amazing</li>
