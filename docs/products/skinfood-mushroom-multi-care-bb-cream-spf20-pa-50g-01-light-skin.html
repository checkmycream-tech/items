            <li>As for the product itself, I love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Lightweight, smooth, and great feel and look.</li>
            <li>Great for light skin..however I&#x27;m way too pale/white</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and fast delivery .  </li>
            <li>It was also has nice coverage.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin, but am still able to use this as a highlighter when contouring.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells good, easily apply.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and provides good coverage.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried most of the popular brands.</li>
            <li>Great for someone with fair, oily skin &amp; sensitive skin.</li>

            <li>Love Love Love.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad we found someone that sells Skin Food.</li>
            <li>, i love it , i will ordered again.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I often apply a bit of powder on top to set</li>
            <li>All and all a win/win! :-)</li>
            <li>in all, I love it.</li>
            <li>It has a great smell yet it absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>I will buy more from this company.</li>
            <li>Gives more of a powdery look</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>My favorite concealer.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love everything but the smell.</li>
            <li>great looks natural</li>
            <li>The amount I got was also much more than I originally thought.</li>
            <li>(EVERYTHING makes me breakout; my skincare routine has been true trial and error!)</li>
            <li>I ordered the Salmon Oil Dark Circle Concealer, and it layers perfectly underneath for a polished, bright, but very natural look.</li>
            <li>So smooth and covers remarkably well, yet natural looking.  </li>
            <li>Came out just fine</li>
            <li>My girls are 25 and 30, this make up looks fantastic on them.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and did I mention the smell?  </li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m always looking for the next great thing in BB/CC cream with the hopes of</li>
            <li>BB cream covers perfectly, evens and brightens my skin tone and moisturizes without feeling greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li>The color is too light for an olive skin person.</li>
            <li>Silky smooth, easy to apply, I&#x27;ve even replaced my foundation with this product for quick application during the work week.</li>
            <li>It feels fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product and makes your skin soft after every use.</li>
            <li>Luckly it fades quick.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this doesn&#x27;t make me more oily than I normally get.</li>
            <li>Light to medium coverage, velvety finish, actually IMPROVED the look of my makeup-free skin (texture and overall brightening, and I am 46), light pleasant fragrance (which does NOT bother my extremely sensitive skin at all), slightly water-resistant (great for warm weather, outdoor activities here in the south).</li>
            <li>Terrific result, love this product!</li>
            <li>and i know that everybody doesn&#x27;t have the same skin but for me works amazing</li>
            <li>This company does NOT test on animals and uses as many natural ingredients as it can.</li>
            <li>I bought this awhile back and really liked it.</li>
            <li>so I closed tube and shook it good.</li>
            <li>Kind of thick to put on but disappears after minute or two for nice finish.</li>
            <li>Never felt so fresh and it covered all my blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>This one is pretty good, but I find I have to mix it with a little moisturizer for it to spread smoothly over my face.  </li>
            <li>Let me give you a little background: Caucasian fair skin, some freckles that I don&#x27;t love covering with makeup, super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is 2014 right now.</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream and it looks very natural while also giving the coverage I need--but not too much coverage.</li>
            <li>This bb cream is sheer and very light weight.</li>
            <li>most other light BB creams or foundations do throughout the day.</li>
            <li>the first four months</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>and it makes my face feel so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and the seller!!</li>
            <li>I will try Skinfood Good Afternoon Peach Green Tea BB Cream</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how to chose the right product for my skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;The coverage is medium, you most definitely either want to prime or moisturize before using it (possibly both) to allow easy even spreading.</li>
            <li>very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>The cream color is much lighter than my skin but really does blend in well.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The light amount of color that this holds, lightens the red on my face from rosacea while softening and protecting me from UV rays.  </li>
            <li>and I do like it and will definitely order again if still available.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.</li>
            <li>I highly, highly, highly recommend both!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like wearing makeup during the summer</li>
            <li>I really like skinfoods products.</li>
            <li>Thanks for all the gifts package, I like them as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never been an every day makeup wearer, but after searching and trying so many tinted moisturizers, BB creams, and light cover-ups, I found this little GEM and have never turned back!</li>
            <li>When I first opened tube just a clear oil?</li>
            <li>Not really a bad smell, just different from how it was in the beginning.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, and this smells really nice!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more of a moisturizer and less of a foundation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t wash me out in photos quite as much as the Gold Label Skin79 (the BB cream I used for months before trying this  &amp; still love dearly) but the coverage isn&#x27;t quite as heavy, either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, after using this for about four months and having close to half the bottle left, I started to notice it smelling kind of... off.</li>
            <li>I am buying another one, waiting for my new package.</li>
            <li>It gives such a glow to my skin and covers blemishes pretty well without seeing the makeup.</li>
            <li>The first one last almost 3 months</li>
            <li>Saw this brand reviewed by one of my favorite beauty bloggers, pinksith, and decided to try this one since it seemed most-suited to my normal to dry skin (also costs HALF what the Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer I was using costs).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really think anything of it, until one morning as I went to do my makeup, I realized I suddenly had cystic pimples all over my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 47 yr old mom in SE Texas and it lasts hours, even in the humidity.</li>
            <li>I pass it on to my young adult daughters who introduced me to these product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not that sensitive</li>
            <li>Not only did I receive the product more than a week early, it also had little samples!</li>
            <li>and normally I have a hard time finding the right color because light makeup tends to look peach or pink on my skin.</li>
            <li>well absorbed and not much oily!</li>
            <li>now addicted to Skinfood, it&#x27;s my new favorite brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Hot Pink, Diamond and Gold Skin79.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it and now know that most western concoctions with SPF are no good for me.</li>
            <li>this was a unexpected result instantly!</li>
            <li>It is very light (which is good, because I might be able to be confused for printer paper in bad light), with an undertone that is neither too pink nor too yellow, which can be difficult to find.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy, and I love the fact that it&#x27;s got a little bit of sunblock in it.</li>
            <li>I like the anti aging, and although I&#x27;m pretty pale, I like the whitening for acne marks.</li>
            <li>i read the review, some good coment, some bad  </li>

            <li> I have never been an every day makeup wearer, but after searching and trying so many tinted moisturizers, BB creams, and light cover-ups, I found this little GEM and have never turned back!</li>
            <li> When I first opened tube just a clear oil?</li>
            <li> Not really a bad smell, just different from how it was in the beginning.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and this smells really nice!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s more of a moisturizer and less of a foundation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t wash me out in photos quite as much as the Gold Label Skin79 (the BB cream I used for months before trying this  &amp; still love dearly) but the coverage isn&#x27;t quite as heavy, either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, after using this for about four months and having close to half the bottle left, I started to notice it smelling kind of... off.</li>
            <li> I am buying another one, waiting for my new package.</li>
            <li> It gives such a glow to my skin and covers blemishes pretty well without seeing the makeup.</li>
            <li> The first one last almost 3 months</li>
            <li> Saw this brand reviewed by one of my favorite beauty bloggers, pinksith, and decided to try this one since it seemed most-suited to my normal to dry skin (also costs HALF what the Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer I was using costs).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really think anything of it, until one morning as I went to do my makeup, I realized I suddenly had cystic pimples all over my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 47 yr old mom in SE Texas and it lasts hours, even in the humidity.</li>
            <li> I pass it on to my young adult daughters who introduced me to these product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not that sensitive</li>
            <li> Not only did I receive the product more than a week early, it also had little samples!</li>
            <li> and normally I have a hard time finding the right color because light makeup tends to look peach or pink on my skin.</li>
            <li> well absorbed and not much oily!</li>
            <li> now addicted to Skinfood, it&#x27;s my new favorite brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Hot Pink, Diamond and Gold Skin79.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and now know that most western concoctions with SPF are no good for me.</li>
            <li> this was a unexpected result instantly!</li>
            <li> It is very light (which is good, because I might be able to be confused for printer paper in bad light), with an undertone that is neither too pink nor too yellow, which can be difficult to find.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy, and I love the fact that it&#x27;s got a little bit of sunblock in it.</li>
            <li> I like the anti aging, and although I&#x27;m pretty pale, I like the whitening for acne marks.</li>
            <li> i read the review, some good coment, some bad  </li>
            <li> (if you know what I mean) I am curious about the other products now as well. :)</li>
            <li> I feel my face so clean after applying a thin layer on it.</li>
            <li> Considering I hadn&#x27;t used anything out of the ordinary on my face, and that I hadn&#x27;t eaten too much junk food or taken any medications, I had my suspicions</li>
            <li> Using this BB cream I feel like my face is getting a little extra soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> It brightens my skin, and even if I don&#x27;t necessarily want to put on makeup, I will follow up with this after a bit of moisturizer (I get oily skin but will also still get dry peeling skin), and it brightens and evens my skin</li>
            <li> Every &#x27;foundation&#x27; type makeup I tried before was so heavy and made my skin feel so gross, I only wore them when I felt</li>
            <li> I have been trying various BB creams for about a year and a half now.  </li>
            <li> so it looks slightly odd but its not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale and white (cool-toned).</li>
            <li> Other than holika holika clearing petit bb cream this would have to be my fave.</li>
            <li> I have recently switched to Lioele Multicare BB Cream because it gives a thicker coverage in one application, but if you don&#x27;t have to cover up red acne marks (mine are worse bc</li>
            <li> dry patches in the winter, oily T-zone, small blemishes and acne scars.</li>
            <li> I typically buy 3 tubes at a time--</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something that matches my skin for YEARS and doesn&#x27;t make me look like an orange mess and doesn&#x27;t hide my freckles.</li>
            <li> The texture is too dry and sticky, hard to blend on the face.</li>
            <li> So I stopped using it, and the acne cleared up, then I used just a little bit on my shoulder, to test it.</li>
            <li> Not like thin american bb creams that made me look orange</li>
            <li> My everyday foundation that has sunscreen built in.</li>
            <li> Not sticky or heavy to wear.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Coverage is not great, i have few tiny brown spots but it didnt cover it.</li>
            <li> It provides enough coverage, and doesn&#x27;t turn that weird orange color</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> and I used it everyday!</li>
            <li> Takes about at least 15 minutes to oxidize.</li>
            <li> (diamond gave me serious acne)</li>
            <li> Y&#x27;all should really read up on the bad ingredients they put in SPF, too, including baby SPF lotions!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odd, but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> I am quite pale, but I hate wearing foundation.</li>
            <li> Very thin texture and somewhat oily feel, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I hate it and the color is not good and gets darker as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> Had used the maybeline bb cream and it wasn&#x27;t bad but after seeing these reviews I thought I might as well try this.</li>
            <li> I will say it does have one, but it fades and isn&#x27;t a bad smell.</li>
            <li> Smells so bad</li>
            <li> and I hate putting it on and its just not for me</li>
            <li> very bad product !!!</li>
            <li> i wouldnt recommend it to my worst enemy !!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely amazing! I have been looking for something that matches my skin for YEARS and doesn&#x27;t make me look like an orange mess and doesn&#x27;t hide my freckles. I&#x27;m a redhead and this stuff works wonders. It&#x27;s not too heavy, and I love the fact that it&#x27;s got a little bit of sunblock in it. It provides enough coverage, and doesn&#x27;t turn that weird orange color most other light BB creams or foundations do throughout the day. This company does NOT test on animals and uses as many natural ingredients as it can. I recommend this to anyone with fair skin!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love.  Amazing product. Suits my skin tone perfectly (cool &amp; fair).  Nice consistency, blends beautifully.  Not like thin american bb creams that made me look orange</li>
            <li> This BB cream is good while it lasts- but unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first four months I had this stuff, I wore it almost  every day. I have a lot of BB creams and foundations, but if I find one that I like I will switch to using it often instead of switching it up. It is very light (which is good, because I might be able to be confused for printer paper in bad light), with an undertone that is neither too pink nor too yellow, which can be difficult to find. The coverage is good for a BB cream- I&#x27;d compare it to medium-coverage foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, after using this for about four months and having close to half the bottle left, I started to notice it smelling kind of... off. Not really a bad smell, just different from how it was in the beginning. I didn&#x27;t really think anything of it, until one morning as I went to do my makeup, I realized I suddenly had cystic pimples all over my face. Considering I hadn&#x27;t used anything out of the ordinary on my face, and that I hadn&#x27;t eaten too much junk food or taken any medications, I had my suspicions it was this stuff. So I stopped using it, and the acne cleared up, then I used just a little bit on my shoulder, to test it. Sure enough, I ended up with a weird pimply rash on my shoulder where I&#x27;d swatched this stuff. The expiration date on the bottle is July 2016. It is 2014 right now. Maybe I just got a mislabeled tube, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Avesome! Thanks a lot! Super Great Seller! Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> My everyday foundation that has sunscreen built in. I have been using for over a year. Lightweight, smooth, and great feel and look.</li>
            <li> I bought this awhile back and really liked it.</li>
            <li> Had used the maybeline bb cream and it wasn&#x27;t bad but after seeing these reviews I thought I might as well try this. The cream color is much lighter than my skin but really does blend in well. It gives such a glow to my skin and covers blemishes pretty well without seeing the makeup. (if you know what I mean) I am curious about the other products now as well. :)</li>
            <li> I am so glad we found someone that sells Skin Food. My girls are 25 and 30, this make up looks fantastic on them. It does what it says it does. My oldest was in Korea for two years and discovered this product now they cant do without their Skin Food. Thanks.</li>
            <li> this was a unexpected result instantly! So smooth and covers remarkably well, yet natural looking.  Every skin product, I have tried is exceptional!</li>
            <li> I love it!!! It&#x27;s smells great looks natural and it&#x27;s not oily at all!! I have fair skin and it looks great!!!</li>
            <li> I have been trying various BB creams for about a year and a half now.  This one is pretty good, but I find I have to mix it with a little moisturizer for it to spread smoothly over my face.  I have not noticed any skin improvement since using it.  I will use it till it&#x27;s gone, but will probably try something else next time.</li>
            <li> Using this BB cream I feel like my face is getting a little extra soft and moisturized.  The light amount of color that this holds, lightens the red on my face from rosacea while softening and protecting me from UV rays.  It&#x27;s the perfect replacement to makeup foundation.</li>
            <li> very bad product !!! i wouldnt recommend it to my worst enemy !!</li>
            <li> This bb cream is wonderful! I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a try!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and this smells really nice!  No complaints here!  Goes on smooth and did I mention the smell?  It&#x27;s a good smell.</li>
            <li> Tried this morning and I suggest that you shake the tube before using. Very thin texture and somewhat oily feel, but not greasy. I bought shade #1 and it&#x27;s more of a moisturizer and less of a foundation. I purchased because it has adenosine which is a smoothing agent.</li>
            <li> i read the review, some good coment, some bad  and i know that everybody doesn&#x27;t have the same skin but for me works amazing , i love it , i will ordered again.</li>
            <li> When I first opened tube just a clear oil? came out so I closed tube and shook it good. Came out just fine and as I&#x27;ve been using it - it has thickened up and I do like it and will definitely order again if still available. I chose shade #1. Smells good, goes on light, spreads easy with fingertips without caking.</li>
            <li> Love it. Kind of thick to put on but disappears after minute or two for nice finish. Not sticky or heavy to wear. I use both Egg White Pore Foam before application and they do decrease pores and even tone. Nice.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fast delivery .  Will boy again.  Recommened.</li>
            <li> it is lighter than my skin</li>
            <li> I have combo/oily skin so I was hesitant to try a BB cream as the U.S. versions are just greasy tinted moisturizers. Skinfood BB cream is a horse of a different color. Silky smooth, easy to apply, I&#x27;ve even replaced my foundation with this product for quick application during the work week. I often apply a bit of powder on top to set but I find it stays almost all day.</li>
            <li> Not only did I receive the product more than a week early, it also had little samples! It came well packaged and undamaged. As for the product itself, I love it! I am quite pale, but I hate wearing foundation. Plus, basically every BB cream I&#x27;ve ever used is too orange. This is the perfect shade. It was also has nice coverage. I also noticed some reviewers didn&#x27;t like the smell. I will say it does have one, but it fades and isn&#x27;t a bad smell. It&#x27;s odd, but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. The amount I got was also much more than I originally thought. All-in-all, it&#x27;s wonderful. Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. It goes on smoothly and provides good coverage. It&#x27;s non-greasy and smells very lovely too! All and all a win/win! :-)</li>
            <li> I dont know whats the hype of this foundation. The texture is too dry and sticky, hard to blend on the face. Coverage is not great, i have few tiny brown spots but it didnt cover it. The color is too white. The only thing i like is... It feels like i dont have anything on my face.</li>
            <li> Let me give you a little background: Caucasian fair skin, some freckles that I don&#x27;t love covering with makeup, super sensitive skin (EVERYTHING makes me breakout; my skincare routine has been true trial and error!) dry patches in the winter, oily T-zone, small blemishes and acne scars. I&#x27;ve tried Hot Pink, Diamond and Gold Skin79. (diamond gave me serious acne) Holika Holika peach girl (just a sample) and Physicians Formula CC (love)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coverage is medium, you most definitely either want to prime or moisturize before using it (possibly both) to allow easy even spreading. I found this looks best when applied with my hands vs a brush or sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t wash me out in photos quite as much as the Gold Label Skin79 (the BB cream I used for months before trying this  &amp; still love dearly) but the coverage isn&#x27;t quite as heavy, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love it. I&#x27;m almost out. I would buy it again but i&#x27;m always looking for the next great thing in BB/CC cream with the hopes of it not causing a thousand pimples to pop up.</li>
            <li> This bb cream is sheer and very light weight. It has a great smell yet it absorbs fast. I will buy more from this company.</li>
            <li> Great BB cream! Moisturizes wonderfully and applies smoothly without drying out over the day.</li>
            <li> Gives more of a powdery look than I like so I mix it with moisturizer.  I love it&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> My favorite BB cream!! It feels fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> My favorite concealer. I have fair skin, but am still able to use this as a highlighter when contouring. I typically buy 3 tubes at a time-- it&#x27;s great :)</li>
            <li> I have never been an every day makeup wearer, but after searching and trying so many tinted moisturizers, BB creams, and light cover-ups, I found this little GEM and have never turned back! Every &#x27;foundation&#x27; type makeup I tried before was so heavy and made my skin feel so gross, I only wore them when I felt like I had to.&lt;br /&gt;This BB cream covers perfectly, evens and brightens my skin tone and moisturizes without feeling greasy or heavy. I use 2 tiny pea-sized dabs, it blends perfectly (I had my less-fair-toned friend try it and we discovered it oxidizes to match, it&#x27;s amazing!) and it makes my face feel so soft and smooth, I have started wearing it every day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now addicted to Skinfood, it&#x27;s my new favorite brand. I ordered the Salmon Oil Dark Circle Concealer, and it layers perfectly underneath for a polished, bright, but very natural look. I highly, highly, highly recommend both!</li>
            <li> Terrific result, love this product!</li>
            <li> Saw this brand reviewed by one of my favorite beauty bloggers, pinksith, and decided to try this one since it seemed most-suited to my normal to dry skin (also costs HALF what the Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer I was using costs). This is perfect! Light to medium coverage, velvety finish, actually IMPROVED the look of my makeup-free skin (texture and overall brightening, and I am 46), light pleasant fragrance (which does NOT bother my extremely sensitive skin at all), slightly water-resistant (great for warm weather, outdoor activities here in the south). I&#x27;ve used it for a month now, and will definitely purchase again. The seller, seoulglamour, was also excellent: it arrived in about 10 days from South Korea, with a nice sample as well. Highly recommend this product and the seller!!</li>
            <li> This product is great! I&#x27;m a 47 yr old mom in SE Texas and it lasts hours, even in the humidity. Love the smell, and the #1 is great for my fair skin tone. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> The color is too light for an olive skin person.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product and makes your skin soft after every use. I don&#x27;t really like wearing makeup during the summer but this is alright. Takes about at least 15 minutes to oxidize. Great for light skin..however I&#x27;m way too pale/white so it looks slightly odd but its not a big deal. I really like skinfoods products. I will use them in the future. I will try Skinfood Good Afternoon Peach Green Tea BB Cream next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall&#x3D; I&#x27;ll buy again&lt;br /&gt;personally great for spring/autumn&lt;br /&gt;^^</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I am back for my 2nd bottle. The first one last almost 3 months and I used it everyday! I am very fair and normally I have a hard time finding the right color because light makeup tends to look peach or pink on my skin. This color blended perfectly and I even let my sister try it, she has a more olive toned skin, and it blended with her skin as well.</li>
            <li> This has the strongest smell ever.  The ingredient list is not in English, so who knows what you are putting on your face.  This is going in the garbage!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale and white (cool-toned). This works perfectly for me. Not a hint of orange here! I like the anti aging, and although I&#x27;m pretty pale, I like the whitening for acne marks. I also like that the SPF in this doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily or break out. I used to use Olay 7in1 anti aging cream with SPF, but I became a pimply grease ball. I stopped using it and now know that most western concoctions with SPF are no good for me. Y&#x27;all should really read up on the bad ingredients they put in SPF, too, including baby SPF lotions! Anyway, this doesn&#x27;t make me more oily than I normally get. It brightens my skin, and even if I don&#x27;t necessarily want to put on makeup, I will follow up with this after a bit of moisturizer (I get oily skin but will also still get dry peeling skin), and it brightens and evens my skin so I don&#x27;t look &amp;#34;sick.&amp;#34;  I have recently switched to Lioele Multicare BB Cream because it gives a thicker coverage in one application, but if you don&#x27;t have to cover up red acne marks (mine are worse bc I pick) then the Mushroom care BB cream is a great choice! If it weren&#x27;t for my hormones shifting and causing me to break out to a point where I needed two applications of the Mushroom care, I would have bought another bottle of it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how to chose the right product for my skin so I try different things.  If I don&#x27;t like it I pass it on to my young adult daughters who introduced me to these product.</li>
            <li> I have never found a foundation/concealer/cream that fits my skin color so flawlessly. I love this BB cream and it looks very natural while also giving the coverage I need--but not too much coverage. I can&#x27;t see the product after it soaks into my skin!</li>
            <li> well absorbed and not much oily!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the second time I bought this bb cream. I absolutely love it. That was a present for my Mom and I&#x27;m going to get another one for myself!</li>
            <li> Ive been on a Korean bb cream kick and I&#x27;ve tried most of the popular brands. Other than holika holika clearing petit bb cream this would have to be my fave. I love everything but the smell. Luckly it fades quick. Great for someone with fair, oily skin &amp; sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Thanks for all the gifts package, I like them as well.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good, easily apply. Looks nature and feels like wearing nothing. I combine this product with the Skinfood tomato sun cream. Both of them works well! I am buying another one, waiting for my new package.</li>
            <li> Smells so bad and I&#x27;m not that sensitive I don&#x27;t think and I hate putting it on and its just not for me I hate it and the color is not good and gets darker as the day goes on. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I feel my face so clean after applying a thin layer on it. Never felt so fresh and it covered all my blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely continue using it.</li>
