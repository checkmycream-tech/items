            <li>I love this device!!</li>
            <li>I did have a problem with one of the electrodes breaking but the manufacturer (not the seller) was very kind to offer a replacement.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Customer Service is amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m most impressed about</li>
            <li>I paid $10 for shipping, which I thought was fair, and it arrived in great working condition, no questions asked.  </li>

            <li>Exquisite Goods has an outstanding customer service.  </li>
            <li>wish the instructions would go more in depth on how use the Lift Wand, but I went on-line and read some of the reviews and watched a you tube instruction and got help that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY happy when the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>

            <li>It was packaged well, and that&#x27;s a good thing, as the wands themselves are glass.</li>
            <li>tingles, and feels really good to me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am hoping the results are as good as I think they will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>br /&gt;Would of liked more information on products use</li>
            <li>I can also say that the product is clearly one of excellent quality.</li>
            <li>I love love love the Lift wand!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and very effective.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference in my with the first use, it is a great for toning, lymph drainage and skin outbreaks for the price</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel very safe to get too cheap &amp;amp; use it for my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in just a couple of months!</li>
            <li>I would love to try the Lift Wand to see if it works.  </li>
            <li>As a guy, I was a bit hesitant to purchase it for &amp;#34;Guy Reasons&amp;#34;, but glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>Glad that I made the purchase, as it has made a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>I love this device.</li>
            <li>and I was satisfied with it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I find it help my products work better too.</li>
            <li>and I think I get a better result with those products when used with the Lift wand.</li>
            <li>My jaw line is more defined.</li>
            <li>love the Lift Wand</li>
            <li>and I am glad I bought</li>
            <li>love the Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li>found more of the Argan oil at Sprouts Farmers market here in</li>
            <li>but, I&#x27;ll keep it for travelling as it&#x27;s more durable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s meant more to even skin tone/texture.</li>
            <li>I have read you only want to buy this from Exquisite Goods on Amazon..</li>
            <li>I love this, I am 64</li>
            <li>and I love the way my face feels after a treatment.  </li>
            <li>My skin is more toned and the skin around my eyes has tightened.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that I got this product and would recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad I did, looking forward to getting my replacement.  </li>
            <li>But I love this product.</li>
            <li>The one with a teardrop shape with a point on the end feels like the energy is more targeted</li>
            <li>You should use a moisturizing oil, argon oil, olive oil, or moisturizing lotion just before you use the wand to help it glide over the face and also to hydrate your face and allow the cells to absorb the moisture more efficiently while they are stimulated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why</li>
            <li>and I bought in hopes that it would be like a magical beauty wand.  </li>
            <li>It feels more moisturized, with elasticity that I havent had for years,</li>
            <li>more healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;skin</li>
            <li>feel better about how my skin looks</li>
            <li>I was like, &amp;#34;I KNEW you would love it!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were most helpful.  </li>
            <li>Enjoyed using it from day one.</li>
            <li>thanks joy Hitt</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not my favorite scent).</li>
            <li>It seems to have a more concentrated out put</li>
            <li>I hope this company makes more items than just the lift wand.  </li>
            <li>I really love the glass wands that come with this product it smoothes out  the crinkles</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more at this point!&lt;br /&gt;t</li>
            <li>I wish they would have included more instructions with this.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li>Do not expect overnight miracles, or any magical results.</li>
            <li>This could be a result of having oily skin most of my life.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love how this makes the room smell too.</li>
            <li>I love my Lift Wand.</li>
            <li>The Lift Wand is a better buy, has better reviews and to me</li>
            <li>a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it helps diminish my wrinkles.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Purchase ONLY from Exquisite Goods.</li>
            <li>and i lost the top crown of my hair in a car accident more than 20 yrs ago</li>
            <li>I really love this item, it stimulates my face and makes it tingle.</li>
            <li>got it from amazon love it buy it not</li>
            <li>the derma wand lift wand sooo much better</li>
            <li>The bottom line is I just don&#x27;t feel safe in continuing to use this product</li>
            <li>there are so many on the market to choose</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>They both love it.</li>
            <li>and they get good results fast!</li>
            <li>it comes with and most importantly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great professional unit.  </li>
            <li>but I am planning on ordering some more of it because it makes your skin really smooth.</li>
            <li>I used the product for about a month and saw no visible results; but, more importantly I have safety concerns about this product.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have much hope, but I am delighted.  </li>
            <li>The Lift Care people were very understanding about the problem and helped me find a good resolution.  </li>
            <li>However they still agreed to send me new electrodes FREE to keep me as a happy customer.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m still working on it, fast shipping, easy to use, good quality</li>
            <li>I was using Derma Wand and this is a Far Better machine!!</li>
            <li>The most significant improvement and this is why I am leaving this review is to my hair growth.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough good about this!</li>
            <li>The company cautioned against buying their product through any seller other than Exquisite Goods who is an authorized seller.  </li>
            <li>I plan on continuing to use the Lift Wand and am excited to see how much more improvement I will continue to see.  </li>
            <li>This is without a doubt the best money I ever spent!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is too soon to see results but it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>The Lift Wand is the most incredible high frequency machine you can get without being a trained professional!</li>
            <li>I no longer have all that fine wrinkly drapey skin on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Its light weight and its easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I originally ordered this product from a seller other than Exquisite Goods</li>
            <li>After the 1st two weeks, hair is fuller and growing longer (I have baby fine hair</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s suppose to reduce age spots and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>if you stick with it and don&#x27;t expect a overnight miracle you will see awesome results!!azing, you won&#x27;t be disappointed if you stick with it and don&#x27;t expect a overnight miracle you will see awesome results!!</li>
            <li>After we clear the issue, he was completely pleasant in addressing the issue and providing a solution.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super upset!</li>
            <li>Primarily, it is hands down the best device to use if you have any sort of acne.</li>
            <li>So far I love this product, I haven&#x27;t had a lot of time using it yet , but it seems easy to use and I  intend to use it more in the days ahead!</li>
            <li>In closing lift wand customer support has offered to send me the replacement wands free of charge...</li>
            <li>but I wanted somethig more powerful as the Dermawand  </li>
            <li>But I enjoy using it</li>
            <li>but now I really enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>but I believe this device is more powerful coz</li>
            <li>it has been upgraded to 20W device with improved internals and it should have more powerful treatment.</li>
            <li>My skin looks smooth.</li>
            <li>When one of the wands broke, they sent a replacement immediately free of charge.  </li>
            <li>but I enjoy using it as a treat to my skin when I have time to pamper myself.</li>
            <li>I started using Jergens Skin Firming Lotion and added a few drops of the argon oil to that before applying to my face, works perfect.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product, and would recommend it as part of a healthy skin maintenance program, along with proper exfoliation, moisturizing, and a good sun block.</li>
            <li>Great entry level option until your ready for the real shock.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy to use and easy to care for.</li>
            <li>Even after first treatment I saw the difference!!</li>
            <li>The argan oil is very healthy for the skin, so if I use it at night, I will just leave the oil on my face for the full absorption of the high concentration of Vitamin E that it has.  </li>
            <li>I chose the Lift Wand for 2 main reasons, I liked all the attachments (electrodes)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, doesn&#x27;t take much time and as I say when I do use it, I notice a difference.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell whether it is effective, but it is easy to use</li>
            <li>from that I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant changes.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased and surprised.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely worth trying  2 thumbs up all the way !</li>
            <li>Original review  </li>
            <li>I am adding some information, after the company read this review, they did email me saying they had responded to my original email.</li>
            <li>And the sent the original response .</li>
            <li>I also tried on some stretch marks and they have diminished significantly.</li>
            <li>, so I&#x27;m very positive about this product, when I see the results I&#x27;ll make another revew!</li>
            <li>I have been in contact with the manufacturer and they have kindly agreed to send me a new Lift Wand.</li>
            <li>I want to first state that I have not been able to fully use this product to truely rate it.  </li>
            <li>If you run out, the good thing is, you can use any other oil of your choice, no need to order more Argan oil from the Lift Wand</li>
            <li>Thanks to Exquisite goods for a prompt replacement of a broken wand with cheerful attitude!!</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy using it and highly recommend it to anyone in search of a more youthful</li>
            <li>The device works amazing on keeping your skin clear.</li>
            <li>The wand came quicker than I expected which was great.</li>
            <li>Pretty good so far.  </li>
            <li>I thought, if the Lift Wand works this good on the lowest setting just on my eyelids, think about what it will be able to do for my whole face over the next 2 -3 months!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do realize that I will have to wait longer to get the full effect that I want, then do a maintenance program to keep it going.</li>
            <li>Love the Argon Oil, very healing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You will not find anything that will give you more promising</li>
            <li>I want to tell you that several years ago I Bouvet the derma wand and gave me good results.</li>
            <li>The smaller tipped applicators are supposed to be used for zapping zits and I haven&#x27;t gotten this particular product to safely use under my eyes as none of the electrodes feel good under my eye even on the lowest settings  </li>
            <li>I was amazed as to how quickly my shipment arrived.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know that they stand behind their product and strive to keep their users happy.</li>
            <li>I was also impressed by the customer service of the company as they responded to my request to purchase an additional electrode that I had accidentally broken within 24 hours and instead of telling me puchasing details they offered to replace for free.  </li>
            <li>I point that out to say that with this device on the highest setting seems somewhat mild in comparison.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I built up tolerance to that degree so quickly.</li>
            <li>My skin is brighter, firmer and more vibrant.  </li>
            <li>Awesome instantly shrunk my big pores on my nose with just a couple of zaps and helped with caring for pimples</li>
            <li>It doesn’t happen quickly, but keep at it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure younger women would notice even more of a change.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect a quick fix, this takes time and patience for the results you want</li>
            <li>I love the product and highly recommend it (and no, I&#x27;m not being paid for this review).</li>
            <li>Based on the results, the price and the fact that this isn&#x27;t some chemical magic potion that I&#x27;m going to run out of in 60 days, I highly recommend this item.which</li>
            <li>Based on the results, the price and the fact that this isn&#x27;t some chemical magic potion that I&#x27;m going to run out of in 60 days, I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>be writing a full review once I get to use the new one more.</li>
            <li>I am keeping both products because in my opinion the lift wand is great for larger areas and the derma wand is better for smaller areas.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Lift Wand after hearing of many of the new techniques being done by professionals that cost a lot of money.  </li>
            <li>switch cover is easily to fall off issue and CSR was very responsive and helped me to solve the issue even though i&#x27;ve got the wand a year ago.  </li>
            <li>If you use it consistently you will see results in a matter of weeks!</li>
            <li>I can tell that my fine lines are fading and makeup goes on much smoother.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Someone left a product review saying that it was too powerful for around the eye area, I don&#x27;t agree, it is perfect for me at the lowest setting, but other areas like my neck and cheeks, I use full power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So in 90 days I am going to come back and post a more accurate review of my results.  </li>
            <li>This is a rare breed of customer service.  </li>
            <li>Be careful with changing out the electrodes twist in and twist out-be sure you don&#x27;t jam them in from the top.</li>
            <li>It did not help tighten the skin on my neck however, but still definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>I am careful to take good care of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a license cosmetoloist and this tool is well worth it.</li>
            <li>but it was too powerful for me even though I&#x27;ve set it to the lowest power, so</li>
            <li>and I rarely get one or two.  </li>
            <li>So far I love the product -</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I am 53 years old and beginning to show on my face the years, but since I use lift my wrinkles have diminished and my friends have told me that my face looks better.</li>
            <li>However, they were kind enough to help me out and will exchange the product for me, as it could also be a safety issue.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, please be careful of unauthorized sellers (only Exquisite goods is authorized seller)</li>
            <li>Do not expect overnight success, but stick with it.</li>
            <li>, my ends felt like they had a fresh cut -</li>
            <li>but well worth the wait, for a younger person not really showing the signs of age yet is perfect for maintaining a youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>I accidentally broke one of the glass wands the first time I used the device, and when I e-mailed the company to tell them what had happened, they promptly agreed to send me another wand free of charge since it was my first time using the device</li>
            <li>Thanks soooo much!!!</li>
            <li>This is great, more useful than other similar product.</li>
            <li>Large pores have significantly reduced in size and wrinkles have diminished in their appearance.  </li>
            <li>Without any questions, they said they were shipping a replacement right out.</li>
            <li>so am giving 4 stars for that right now</li>
            <li>A couple of blemishes that I had have cleared right up after treating them.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the customer service person and was sent a replacement right away.  </li>
            <li>I give the company FIVE stars for trying to make things right.   </li>
            <li>The face wand broke right away.</li>
            <li>One of my electrodes came apart and I contacted the company and they agreed to send me another one right away.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Verdict is out right now as too soon to tell if going to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time to use this kind of facial device though.</li>
            <li>In 4 days my facial skin feels firmer and more refined, impressive or should I say addicted?</li>
            <li>The first day it had a continuous steady sound.</li>
            <li>Good results take a little time but it is so worth it.  </li>
            <li>There seems to be many to choose from, the Derma Wand being very well known, and many other brands.</li>
            <li>So far I think it does a good job of reducing acne when it pops up and has helped improve the overall look of my skin.</li>
            <li>It appears that facial products are better absorbed by using this product.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much to the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>the derma wand and the white camellia oil is what I think helped the most since it&#x27;s very light and enough just to glide the electrodes across my face.</li>
            <li>I think it might possibly be a little more effective in keeping and preserving what you naturally have been given, as well as improving the quality of your existing condition of skin, than reversing the damage of life and genetics.</li>
            <li>However, the first time using it, I used the circular wand for the face</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I am overall exceedingly pleased with my experience with this device and customer support team.</li>
            <li>First I used Dermawand</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not regimen with the use of this product, but the first uses I did notice lighter sun spot.  </li>
            <li>Also saw 50% improvement in the skin above my top lip (skin changes from menopause).  </li>
            <li>Love this, my skin has definitely gotten better and it totally works on helping to minimize/get rid of zits</li>
            <li>first, I was looking for another one, it did not have the one time purchase price listed, just the trial price, so</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller and my skin looks much better.</li>
            <li>and you can definitely feel it more.  </li>
            <li>This is the one I have used daily after experimenting with the different probes because I tend to believe that the more you can feel it the more it must be working.  </li>
            <li>My skin has so much more of the snap back bounce that it use to</li>
            <li>, this is the first time we had a customer</li>
            <li>haha!)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!  </li>
            <li>Instead of taking the tablet orally I just puncture it and apply the oil directly to my face which helps the attachments slide smoothly.  </li>
            <li>So I turned up the dial to a higher frequency</li>
            <li>The cheaper one I purchased here on Amazon was a bit higher in intensity, but eventually shorted out.</li>
            <li>First tool I have got.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product on Amazon evidently from an unauthorized seller.  </li>
            <li>I read the instructions more than once, watch several videos on you tube before trying on my face.</li>
            <li>More likely a defective device.  </li>
            <li>The manufacturer was willing to replace the Lift wand even though it was purchased from an unauthorized seller.</li>
            <li>Will update later on it more.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not even using it consistently.</li>
            <li>I like the product it works very well for what it says it will do!</li>
            <li>I have definitely noticed an improved texture and plumpness to my skin, and the crepey skin under my eyes is looking much better.  </li>
            <li>I needed an electode replaced as it came broken ( as I said, my shipping box came opened) but, they were happy to replace it, responed quickly</li>
            <li>I had looked at the Derma Wand first and decided against it, Lift Wand better price, extra attachments, positive reviews</li>
            <li>Also, completely cures any breakouts over night!!!!</li>
            <li>and it does get warm if not consistently moving.</li>
            <li>Great way to cause serious even fatal injury.</li>
            <li>Nice product, but no matter how careful you are, the wands break...be ready to replace them.  </li>
            <li>I used the smallest electrode and the lowest setting and just went over my upper eyelids for a good 5 minutes, and I was astonished, immediately I noticed that the amount of extra skin had diminished substantially.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy to choose this device &amp;amp; I&#x27;ll keep using it for my face to see obvious outcome such as my dark circles area. :)</li>
            <li>On days that I have more time I use the medium attachment on high and on days I am running short of time</li>
            <li>but,MUCH less effective.</li>
            <li>I went from low to medium settings (which caused a somewhat strong tingling sensation, indicative of something happening).</li>
            <li>As for me who has oily skin and large pores I did see an almost immediate result.</li>
            <li>After the first couple uses my skin had such a nice overall glow</li>
            <li>It does the same and is very sturdy and you can travel with it easily.</li>
            <li>Secondly, I have not seen a huge change in my under eye bags but am certain the device is \\&quot;helping\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be happy to come back in 3 months with an update on my progress, I am hoping to firm up some sagging skin around my chin and cheeks and see if I can soften my 11&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this almost daily for 3 weeks and can tell a huge difference....</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel that is enough time to write an accurate review.  </li>
            <li>very nice!&lt;br</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I bought this as part of a combo deal from the website, the Lift wand really does do wonders.</li>
            <li>Since I could not find a order number and really just wanted replacements</li>
            <li>I was curious if I would be able to purchase them through the company.</li>
            <li>so I ordered it straight away.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>Works as advertised will see if it really works on wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>I got it very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really notice much of a difference, you can feel it burn or sting.  </li>
            <li>It is very healing.  </li>
            <li>I contacted them because the second day the unit started making a pulsing sound .</li>
            <li>is much smoother.  </li>
            <li>and it is to much for me to use it on high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know if it works because I used it for two weeks.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot of money to find out that it was a gimmick or ineffective.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t do anything and the oil wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>I had to get a different kind of oil to use with this product (white camellia oil) because the argan oil was too much for my face &amp; made me break out.</li>
            <li>then it worked much nicer.</li>
            <li>, it felt tighter, and thanks to the 100% Argan Oil it healed rapidly.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the oil that comes with this item</li>
            <li>Using the Mary Kay cream helps the wand glide over my face much easier.</li>
            <li>I need to use it longer and regualry to see if it really does work.</li>
            <li>After 4 weeks, I can really notice a difference .</li>
            <li>no broken wands.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li>The oil is organic and certified which is what you need to look for real argon oil.</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>That means Lift Wand co will stand behind unit only if sold by Exquisite Goods i guess...</li>
            <li>and the only thing i see so far is smaller pores which is a good thing</li>
            <li>The wand doesn&#x27;t hurt but if your really sensitive you can break the current by touching the end of the wand with your finger before putting it on your face</li>
            <li>(just remember to try low power first!!</li>
            <li>I am editing this from the top of my review but have not removed the initial review below: the company is sending me a new unit so I am upgrading the review to a three star until I get to use the new unit .</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d have to repack it in it&#x27;s original box, which is very big.  </li>
            <li>This following is my original review.</li>
            <li>it can rejuvenate the glow to the face &amp;amp; soften the skin (however, I use my other favorite lotion/serum</li>
            <li>you run out of the Argon oil that comes with the Lift Wand you can use any other oil of your choice, no need to order more oil from the Lift Wand</li>
            <li>I was unaware of this type problem but will be more aware in the future-</li>
            <li>This particular unit works very well and does what it says.</li>
            <li>My main reason for trying this product is, very baggy lower eyes.</li>
            <li>30 days use wasn&#x27;t long enough for a honest review.</li>
            <li>I saw some high frequency devices are much cheaper</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend  this product to anyone who wants to instill changes in their skin without high costs of dermatological visits.</li>
            <li>Not sure if its effective,</li>
            <li>Just okay, not really worth the money.</li>
            <li>nice product, not magic,</li>
            <li>This lift wand arrived on time and was new and packed well!</li>
            <li>I think I can see a slight lifting around my jaw line that I am hoping will get even better with time.  </li>
            <li>For comparison, most brands have only 5 or 10 watts of power and the Derma Wand has only 1.5 watts.  </li>
            <li>Funny cause those wrinkles were definitely there when I first ordered the product (which was about one month ago)</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s quite the gray market for this particular device.</li>
            <li>Many people have said that I look younger now than I did several years ago.  </li>
            <li>you push it all the way in, you will be able to feel that it is in tightly.  </li>
            <li>All said and done I highly recommend this device</li>
            <li>so I decided to buy a High Frequency device for home use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get how they say this helps with acne when it made me look like I was in high school again.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes after reading some favorable reviews.</li>
            <li>Why make a high powered device with no ground?</li>
            <li>but I give the company high marks for working with me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li>I had been researching for a high frequency wand &amp;#34;since</li>
            <li>:-)&lt;br /&gt;There is a little instruction booklet that comes with it.  </li>
            <li>I had a very positive experience with high frequency&#x27;s facial treatment in a beauty salon</li>
            <li>It got to a point that I was disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find time to use it - the oil is fantastic and my skin feels great</li>
            <li>and my skin normally looks washed out.</li>
            <li>but within two days was right back to normal.</li>
            <li>I started using the hair wand and am already seeing positive results, I totally love this product it is amazing, you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li>I have only been using my Wand for a month now, but I can already tell a difference...a positive one!  </li>
            <li>Oh and if you&#x27;ve ever had a GOOD Professional Facial, they do this at the end of the facial in order to kill any bacteria transfered to the skin do to possible use of bare hands on skin.</li>
            <li>hopefully my new replacement wand&#x27;s on/off</li>
            <li>can live without the ear probe.</li>
            <li>I bought my new product in June</li>
            <li>when done with my treatment I follow with a glycolic toner then follow with OZ naturals Vit C serum, awaiting Serum CL which is new.</li>
            <li>and they said they&#x27;d send a new one.</li>
            <li>I started using the Lift Wand on 12/6/14, waited to write a review because new skin cells change every 90 or so days and felt</li>
            <li>I had such a fantastic experience with their customer service (they resolved an issue for me in one email)that I would suggest only buying from them anyway.</li>
            <li>Maybe, one might notice more if she or he has profound wrinkles and uneven skin tones on thier faces.  </li>
            <li>ok this is not working only after several uses I need to send it back</li>
            <li>First, let it be known this is not going to get rid of wrinkles or provide an actual lift like this product and Dermawand</li>
            <li>having people think I&#x27;m my 31 year old daughter&#x27;s sister, works for me!</li>
            <li>I purchased this last week and used it for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>I have been using the wand consistently for two weeks and have definitely noticed improvements to my skin.  </li>
            <li>the frown line between my eyes has faded completely, and my skin is glowing!</li>
            <li>It tingles a bit when you use it, but actually feels pretty invigorating.</li>
            <li>I read not only Amazon reviews, but articles from many other resources before I purchased.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the slight warming effect it has on my skin.  </li>
            <li>also based my decision on the price, when I purchased it, it cost less than the Derma Wand and far less than the most powerful one I saw offered at $140 that had up to 25 watts of power.</li>
            <li>The wand gave a tingling feeling, I only used half power but will apply more after extended use.</li>
            <li>Also the text on their box and in the instructions seems to have been translated and not proof read by someone who speaks English (meaning absolutely no offense to anyone as the situation could as easily be reversed).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a older woman and noticed a thinning upper lip, bagging around my eyes and some jowl dropping that made me look older than I felt.</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t have much time to go to the Beauty spa to have facial that often...don&#x27;t wanna pay much for the professional high frequency treatment outside.</li>
            <li>I do notice though that when i use one adapter, i have to jiggle it a little to make the light work, but i didn&#x27;t call to return it.</li>
            <li>I have broke 3 wands thus far.</li>
            <li>All of my emails were answered and in a timely professional manner and replacement  wands were offered.</li>
            <li>so far.</li>
            <li>My 62 year old friend came for a visit in October</li>
            <li>Just think it can&#x27;t compete with professional services.</li>
            <li>My husband looked much younger within a week, the liver spots on his face were much lighter.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>And wow even with just a week of using my brown spots are fading and a cystic zit that had been there  and NOTHING helped is now going away.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t expect miracles, but this has so far had visible results.</li>
            <li>Has far as tightening and wrinkles its to soon to tell.</li>
            <li>See no difference so far.</li>
            <li>It also comes with the 100% natural &amp;amp; organic Argan oil from Morocco...</li>
            <li>Before I purchased this product I went for a professional treatment that I had purchased on Groupon.  </li>
            <li>The cost of these treatments would be up near $900.00</li>
            <li>I know that the machine used at the professional treatment is a lot stronger than the Lift Wand</li>
            <li>far as results go, I have had no compliments and no one has asked me what I am doing</li>
            <li>I wrote to the manufacturer directly</li>
            <li>I have been using the Lift Wand for 3 months and, WOW, what a difference.  </li>
            <li>The lines around my mouth are nearly all gone.  </li>
            <li>Useless.&lt;br /&gt;Preys on our desire to look young.</li>
            <li>So far like it.</li>
            <li>I really like it, I have only had it for about a month</li>
            <li>I used this for a few weeks on a lower setting  and haven&#x27;t seen any significant results.</li>
            <li>I spent 15 years with my past career in the cosmetics industry and love to try new anti aging products, in my 50&#x27;s but before putting anything on my face I need to know more, so my purchase was heavily weigh upon reviews such as mine.</li>
            <li>This is a bonus that I can do high frequency facial at home by myself!</li>
            <li>Overall I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It came unattached and although it comes with four different probes, I didn&#x27;t have trouble with any of the others,  just the larger probe I used the most.</li>
            <li>It was a little intimidating at 1st, but after the 1st time that quickly went away.</li>
            <li>At first the noise and overall experience scared me because I was wondering if it was goig to shock me but with the flat probe I could barely feel anything!  </li>
            <li>Very powerful and skin stimulator to reduce small wrinkles</li>
            <li>I would just recommend not using the device over a tile floor since the chances are good that the glass wands will break on the hard surface if they are not securely inserted.</li>
            <li>so I am looking forward to receiving my new one shortly.  </li>
            <li>The ringing in my right ear has also become less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Aside from the fact that Lift Wand leaves your skin glow naturally just like the other reviews stated, I want to emphasize how much they care about customer satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>I am not expecting miracles and if all this did was to keep my skin in the condition it is in right now over the next 20 years I would be extremely happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also noticed my skin in general just looked healthier.</li>
            <li>I have to say I noticed some differences, skin tightening, and quality of skin in general has improved.</li>
            <li>You then turn the knob to a low setting to start and you will see a pinkish red electrical current that glows through the probe, when you touch it on your skin, scalp, hand or whatever part of the skin you are treating, the electrical buzzing sound gets louder and the pink electrical current in the probe gets brighter as it makes the connection with the skin.  </li>
            <li>(derma wand is gentiler  for under eye usage but the lift wand is too aggressive for it) when my derma wand came with clear instructions, I used this wand similar to the movements I used with the derma wand</li>
            <li>I clearly can see my pores are much smaller, under eye</li>
            <li>and she saw such an improvement to her pores and old acne scars.</li>
            <li>The last broke when not inserted completely and turned on..it literally exploded.</li>
            <li>I am 51 years old and it is definitely starting to show.</li>
            <li>I was starting to get some jowls which made me look way to old.</li>
            <li>my pores appear to be smaller and my skin is extremely soft.  </li>
            <li>I an 66 years old and have been using the lift wand for several months.  </li>
            <li>One of the electrodes was broken when I received it, but the product seems okay</li>
            <li>So within the first few days - acne cleared up (and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING from OTC products, antibiotics, home remedies and bamm - always with the bumps, sure that other stuff may have helped a little, but they always returned, under the skin bumps too).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was just my luck...!&lt;br /&gt;After two months of sheer bliss with my new wand and receiving several compliments about my complexion from my peers at work....</li>
            <li>I used on an ingrown zit, it was stinging a little more than a little but by the next day it was almost gone and within two days it was completely</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a single blemish since I&#x27;ve been using this, and all the old acne scars have faded completely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 40 year old male with Native American combination skin, who often is told that I look 35.</li>
            <li>now refer my clients to Lift wand, especially when I&#x27;m asked what I&#x27;m doing differently for my 50 year old</li>
            <li>I apply Skinceuticles first then a little Argan Oil when I use it.</li>
            <li>At first i felt a little bit scared to see the orange electrodes, but i&#x27;ve read all the instruction</li>
            <li>Overall I was just noticing general stuff that happens when your skin ages</li>
            <li>have only used it twice so far, but I have to tell you, I have some extra skin above one of my eyelids, and it bugs me.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t think it will completely get rid of lines that I&#x27;ve had for a long time, I can say they have improved.  </li>
            <li>but the cost is literally pennies per day compared to the hundreds of dollars spent month after monthtrying new product that doesn&#x27;t perform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I now can use it on high with my other face products.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments on my skin in the past few weeks.</li>
            <li>That being stated I must report several good and bad issues with this device.</li>

            <li> This product works great when you use it in the morning</li>
            <li> I am happy with this purchase and would recommend the Lift Wand.</li>
            <li> This has been a great product for me-</li>

            <li> want to take this time to share my great experience using my lift wand.</li>
            <li> What caught my attention was their great customer service.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s where I received GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE from the manufacturer who took care of this issue for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> great customer</li>
            <li> I love this device!!</li>
            <li> I did have a problem with one of the electrodes breaking but the manufacturer (not the seller) was very kind to offer a replacement.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Customer Service is amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m most impressed about</li>
            <li> I paid $10 for shipping, which I thought was fair, and it arrived in great working condition, no questions asked.  </li>
            <li> It is so effective, it plumps your skin, shrinks pores, and improves circulation and skins elasticity!</li>
            <li> Exquisite Goods has an outstanding customer service.  </li>
            <li> wish the instructions would go more in depth on how use the Lift Wand, but I went on-line and read some of the reviews and watched a you tube instruction and got help that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY happy when the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>
            <li> and I do  see the stimulation of circulation which is always good.  </li>
            <li> It is not a spa grade machine but for the price I think it does a good job.</li>
            <li> It was packaged well, and that&#x27;s a good thing, as the wands themselves are glass.</li>
            <li> tingles, and feels really good to me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am hoping the results are as good as I think they will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It is very easy and pleasant to operate.</li>
            <li> the Amazon merchant, Exquisite Goods, who I bought my Lift Wand from has been great to deal with, very excellent customer service, very prompt responses to my email inquiries, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> works great, but don&#x27;t see any significant results, will keep trying!</li>
            <li> An amazing product with great customer service, who could ask for anything more?</li>

            <li> I purchased this and started loving it from day one.  </li>

            <li> It turned off spontaneously and I had to wait for almost 30 minutes for it to start again.</li>
            <li> Both the derma wand and this product give off a nice scent.</li>
            <li> It feels nice while your doing it to.  </li>
            <li> I actually happen to be a licensed aesthetician AND certifies laser tech, and this is the best machine of its kind  I have used!</li>
            <li> About two weeks after I got it I had problems with the power output it went from great to barely any output at all, so I contacted amazon and that day Exquisite Goods replied and shipped me a replacement which was great because I really like the device, before I bought the wand I had researched it and</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use &amp;amp; it makes my skin healthier.&lt;br</li>

            <li> br /&gt;Would of liked more information on products use</li>
            <li> I can also say that the product is clearly one of excellent quality.</li>
            <li> I love love love the Lift wand!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and very effective.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in my with the first use, it is a great for toning, lymph drainage and skin outbreaks for the price</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel very safe to get too cheap &amp;amp; use it for my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in just a couple of months!</li>
            <li> I would love to try the Lift Wand to see if it works.  </li>
            <li> As a guy, I was a bit hesitant to purchase it for &amp;#34;Guy Reasons&amp;#34;, but glad that I did.  </li>
            <li> Glad that I made the purchase, as it has made a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I love this device.</li>
            <li> and I was satisfied with it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I find it help my products work better too.</li>
            <li> and I think I get a better result with those products when used with the Lift wand.</li>
            <li> My jaw line is more defined.</li>
            <li> love the Lift Wand</li>
            <li> and I am glad I bought</li>
            <li> love the Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li> found more of the Argan oil at Sprouts Farmers market here in</li>
            <li> but, I&#x27;ll keep it for travelling as it&#x27;s more durable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s meant more to even skin tone/texture.</li>
            <li> I have read you only want to buy this from Exquisite Goods on Amazon..</li>
            <li> I love this, I am 64</li>
            <li> and I love the way my face feels after a treatment.  </li>
            <li> My skin is more toned and the skin around my eyes has tightened.  </li>
            <li> I am glad that I got this product and would recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li> and I am glad I did, looking forward to getting my replacement.  </li>
            <li> But I love this product.</li>
            <li> The one with a teardrop shape with a point on the end feels like the energy is more targeted</li>
            <li> You should use a moisturizing oil, argon oil, olive oil, or moisturizing lotion just before you use the wand to help it glide over the face and also to hydrate your face and allow the cells to absorb the moisture more efficiently while they are stimulated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why</li>
            <li> and I bought in hopes that it would be like a magical beauty wand.  </li>
            <li> It feels more moisturized, with elasticity that I havent had for years,</li>
            <li> more healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;skin</li>
            <li> feel better about how my skin looks</li>
            <li> I was like, &amp;#34;I KNEW you would love it!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were most helpful.  </li>
            <li> Enjoyed using it from day one.</li>
            <li> thanks joy Hitt</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not my favorite scent).</li>
            <li> It seems to have a more concentrated out put</li>
            <li> I hope this company makes more items than just the lift wand.  </li>
            <li> I really love the glass wands that come with this product it smoothes out  the crinkles</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more at this point!&lt;br /&gt;t</li>
            <li> I wish they would have included more instructions with this.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> Do not expect overnight miracles, or any magical results.</li>
            <li> This could be a result of having oily skin most of my life.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love how this makes the room smell too.</li>
            <li> I love my Lift Wand.</li>
            <li> The Lift Wand is a better buy, has better reviews and to me</li>
            <li> a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it helps diminish my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Purchase ONLY from Exquisite Goods.</li>
            <li> and i lost the top crown of my hair in a car accident more than 20 yrs ago</li>
            <li> I really love this item, it stimulates my face and makes it tingle.</li>
            <li> got it from amazon love it buy it not</li>
            <li> the derma wand lift wand sooo much better</li>
            <li> The bottom line is I just don&#x27;t feel safe in continuing to use this product</li>
            <li> there are so many on the market to choose</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> They both love it.</li>
            <li> and they get good results fast!</li>
            <li> it comes with and most importantly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great professional unit.  </li>
            <li> but I am planning on ordering some more of it because it makes your skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> I used the product for about a month and saw no visible results; but, more importantly I have safety concerns about this product.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have much hope, but I am delighted.  </li>
            <li> The Lift Care people were very understanding about the problem and helped me find a good resolution.  </li>
            <li> However they still agreed to send me new electrodes FREE to keep me as a happy customer.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m still working on it, fast shipping, easy to use, good quality</li>
            <li> I was using Derma Wand and this is a Far Better machine!!</li>
            <li> The most significant improvement and this is why I am leaving this review is to my hair growth.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough good about this!</li>
            <li> The company cautioned against buying their product through any seller other than Exquisite Goods who is an authorized seller.  </li>
            <li> I plan on continuing to use the Lift Wand and am excited to see how much more improvement I will continue to see.  </li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best money I ever spent!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is too soon to see results but it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> The Lift Wand is the most incredible high frequency machine you can get without being a trained professional!</li>
            <li> I no longer have all that fine wrinkly drapey skin on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Its light weight and its easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this product from a seller other than Exquisite Goods</li>
            <li> After the 1st two weeks, hair is fuller and growing longer (I have baby fine hair</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s suppose to reduce age spots and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> if you stick with it and don&#x27;t expect a overnight miracle you will see awesome results!!azing, you won&#x27;t be disappointed if you stick with it and don&#x27;t expect a overnight miracle you will see awesome results!!</li>
            <li> After we clear the issue, he was completely pleasant in addressing the issue and providing a solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super upset!</li>
            <li> Primarily, it is hands down the best device to use if you have any sort of acne.</li>
            <li> So far I love this product, I haven&#x27;t had a lot of time using it yet , but it seems easy to use and I  intend to use it more in the days ahead!</li>
            <li> In closing lift wand customer support has offered to send me the replacement wands free of charge...</li>
            <li> but I wanted somethig more powerful as the Dermawand  </li>
            <li> But I enjoy using it</li>
            <li> but now I really enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> but I believe this device is more powerful coz</li>
            <li> it has been upgraded to 20W device with improved internals and it should have more powerful treatment.</li>
            <li> My skin looks smooth.</li>
            <li> When one of the wands broke, they sent a replacement immediately free of charge.  </li>
            <li> but I enjoy using it as a treat to my skin when I have time to pamper myself.</li>
            <li> I started using Jergens Skin Firming Lotion and added a few drops of the argon oil to that before applying to my face, works perfect.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, and would recommend it as part of a healthy skin maintenance program, along with proper exfoliation, moisturizing, and a good sun block.</li>
            <li> Great entry level option until your ready for the real shock.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, easy to use and easy to care for.</li>
            <li> Even after first treatment I saw the difference!!</li>
            <li> The argan oil is very healthy for the skin, so if I use it at night, I will just leave the oil on my face for the full absorption of the high concentration of Vitamin E that it has.  </li>
            <li> I chose the Lift Wand for 2 main reasons, I liked all the attachments (electrodes)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, doesn&#x27;t take much time and as I say when I do use it, I notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell whether it is effective, but it is easy to use</li>
            <li> from that I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant changes.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased and surprised.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely worth trying  2 thumbs up all the way !</li>
            <li> Original review  </li>
            <li> I am adding some information, after the company read this review, they did email me saying they had responded to my original email.</li>
            <li> And the sent the original response .</li>
            <li> I also tried on some stretch marks and they have diminished significantly.</li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;m very positive about this product, when I see the results I&#x27;ll make another revew!</li>
            <li> I have been in contact with the manufacturer and they have kindly agreed to send me a new Lift Wand.</li>
            <li> I want to first state that I have not been able to fully use this product to truely rate it.  </li>
            <li> If you run out, the good thing is, you can use any other oil of your choice, no need to order more Argan oil from the Lift Wand</li>
            <li> Thanks to Exquisite goods for a prompt replacement of a broken wand with cheerful attitude!!</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy using it and highly recommend it to anyone in search of a more youthful</li>
            <li> The device works amazing on keeping your skin clear.</li>
            <li> The wand came quicker than I expected which was great.</li>
            <li> Pretty good so far.  </li>
            <li> I thought, if the Lift Wand works this good on the lowest setting just on my eyelids, think about what it will be able to do for my whole face over the next 2 -3 months!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do realize that I will have to wait longer to get the full effect that I want, then do a maintenance program to keep it going.</li>
            <li> Love the Argon Oil, very healing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will not find anything that will give you more promising</li>
            <li> I want to tell you that several years ago I Bouvet the derma wand and gave me good results.</li>
            <li> The smaller tipped applicators are supposed to be used for zapping zits and I haven&#x27;t gotten this particular product to safely use under my eyes as none of the electrodes feel good under my eye even on the lowest settings  </li>
            <li> I was amazed as to how quickly my shipment arrived.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know that they stand behind their product and strive to keep their users happy.</li>
            <li> I was also impressed by the customer service of the company as they responded to my request to purchase an additional electrode that I had accidentally broken within 24 hours and instead of telling me puchasing details they offered to replace for free.  </li>
            <li> I point that out to say that with this device on the highest setting seems somewhat mild in comparison.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I built up tolerance to that degree so quickly.</li>
            <li> My skin is brighter, firmer and more vibrant.  </li>
            <li> Awesome instantly shrunk my big pores on my nose with just a couple of zaps and helped with caring for pimples</li>
            <li> It doesn’t happen quickly, but keep at it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure younger women would notice even more of a change.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect a quick fix, this takes time and patience for the results you want</li>
            <li> I love the product and highly recommend it (and no, I&#x27;m not being paid for this review).</li>
            <li> Based on the results, the price and the fact that this isn&#x27;t some chemical magic potion that I&#x27;m going to run out of in 60 days, I highly recommend this item.which</li>
            <li> Based on the results, the price and the fact that this isn&#x27;t some chemical magic potion that I&#x27;m going to run out of in 60 days, I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> be writing a full review once I get to use the new one more.</li>
            <li> I am keeping both products because in my opinion the lift wand is great for larger areas and the derma wand is better for smaller areas.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Lift Wand after hearing of many of the new techniques being done by professionals that cost a lot of money.  </li>
            <li> switch cover is easily to fall off issue and CSR was very responsive and helped me to solve the issue even though i&#x27;ve got the wand a year ago.  </li>
            <li> If you use it consistently you will see results in a matter of weeks!</li>
            <li> I can tell that my fine lines are fading and makeup goes on much smoother.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Someone left a product review saying that it was too powerful for around the eye area, I don&#x27;t agree, it is perfect for me at the lowest setting, but other areas like my neck and cheeks, I use full power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So in 90 days I am going to come back and post a more accurate review of my results.  </li>
            <li> This is a rare breed of customer service.  </li>
            <li> Be careful with changing out the electrodes twist in and twist out-be sure you don&#x27;t jam them in from the top.</li>
            <li> It did not help tighten the skin on my neck however, but still definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> I am careful to take good care of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a license cosmetoloist and this tool is well worth it.</li>
            <li> but it was too powerful for me even though I&#x27;ve set it to the lowest power, so</li>
            <li> and I rarely get one or two.  </li>
            <li> So far I love the product -</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am 53 years old and beginning to show on my face the years, but since I use lift my wrinkles have diminished and my friends have told me that my face looks better.</li>
            <li> However, they were kind enough to help me out and will exchange the product for me, as it could also be a safety issue.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, please be careful of unauthorized sellers (only Exquisite goods is authorized seller)</li>
            <li> Do not expect overnight success, but stick with it.</li>
            <li> , my ends felt like they had a fresh cut -</li>
            <li> but well worth the wait, for a younger person not really showing the signs of age yet is perfect for maintaining a youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> I accidentally broke one of the glass wands the first time I used the device, and when I e-mailed the company to tell them what had happened, they promptly agreed to send me another wand free of charge since it was my first time using the device</li>
            <li> Thanks soooo much!!!</li>
            <li> This is great, more useful than other similar product.</li>
            <li> Large pores have significantly reduced in size and wrinkles have diminished in their appearance.  </li>
            <li> Without any questions, they said they were shipping a replacement right out.</li>
            <li> so am giving 4 stars for that right now</li>
            <li> A couple of blemishes that I had have cleared right up after treating them.  </li>
            <li> I contacted the customer service person and was sent a replacement right away.  </li>
            <li> I give the company FIVE stars for trying to make things right.   </li>
            <li> The face wand broke right away.</li>
            <li> One of my electrodes came apart and I contacted the company and they agreed to send me another one right away.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Verdict is out right now as too soon to tell if going to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time to use this kind of facial device though.</li>
            <li> In 4 days my facial skin feels firmer and more refined, impressive or should I say addicted?</li>
            <li> The first day it had a continuous steady sound.</li>
            <li> Good results take a little time but it is so worth it.  </li>
            <li> There seems to be many to choose from, the Derma Wand being very well known, and many other brands.</li>
            <li> So far I think it does a good job of reducing acne when it pops up and has helped improve the overall look of my skin.</li>
            <li> It appears that facial products are better absorbed by using this product.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much to the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> the derma wand and the white camellia oil is what I think helped the most since it&#x27;s very light and enough just to glide the electrodes across my face.</li>
            <li> I think it might possibly be a little more effective in keeping and preserving what you naturally have been given, as well as improving the quality of your existing condition of skin, than reversing the damage of life and genetics.</li>
            <li> However, the first time using it, I used the circular wand for the face</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am overall exceedingly pleased with my experience with this device and customer support team.</li>
            <li> First I used Dermawand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not regimen with the use of this product, but the first uses I did notice lighter sun spot.  </li>
            <li> Also saw 50% improvement in the skin above my top lip (skin changes from menopause).  </li>
            <li> Love this, my skin has definitely gotten better and it totally works on helping to minimize/get rid of zits</li>
            <li> first, I was looking for another one, it did not have the one time purchase price listed, just the trial price, so</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller and my skin looks much better.</li>
            <li> and you can definitely feel it more.  </li>
            <li> This is the one I have used daily after experimenting with the different probes because I tend to believe that the more you can feel it the more it must be working.  </li>
            <li> My skin has so much more of the snap back bounce that it use to</li>
            <li> , this is the first time we had a customer</li>
            <li> haha!)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!  </li>
            <li> Instead of taking the tablet orally I just puncture it and apply the oil directly to my face which helps the attachments slide smoothly.  </li>
            <li> So I turned up the dial to a higher frequency</li>
            <li> The cheaper one I purchased here on Amazon was a bit higher in intensity, but eventually shorted out.</li>
            <li> First tool I have got.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product on Amazon evidently from an unauthorized seller.  </li>
            <li> I read the instructions more than once, watch several videos on you tube before trying on my face.</li>
            <li> More likely a defective device.  </li>
            <li> The manufacturer was willing to replace the Lift wand even though it was purchased from an unauthorized seller.</li>
            <li> Will update later on it more.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not even using it consistently.</li>
            <li> I like the product it works very well for what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed an improved texture and plumpness to my skin, and the crepey skin under my eyes is looking much better.  </li>
            <li> I needed an electode replaced as it came broken ( as I said, my shipping box came opened) but, they were happy to replace it, responed quickly</li>
            <li> I had looked at the Derma Wand first and decided against it, Lift Wand better price, extra attachments, positive reviews</li>
            <li> Also, completely cures any breakouts over night!!!!</li>
            <li> and it does get warm if not consistently moving.</li>
            <li> Great way to cause serious even fatal injury.</li>
            <li> Nice product, but no matter how careful you are, the wands break...be ready to replace them.  </li>
            <li> I used the smallest electrode and the lowest setting and just went over my upper eyelids for a good 5 minutes, and I was astonished, immediately I noticed that the amount of extra skin had diminished substantially.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to choose this device &amp;amp; I&#x27;ll keep using it for my face to see obvious outcome such as my dark circles area. :)</li>
            <li> On days that I have more time I use the medium attachment on high and on days I am running short of time</li>
            <li> but,MUCH less effective.</li>
            <li> I went from low to medium settings (which caused a somewhat strong tingling sensation, indicative of something happening).</li>
            <li> As for me who has oily skin and large pores I did see an almost immediate result.</li>
            <li> After the first couple uses my skin had such a nice overall glow</li>
            <li> It does the same and is very sturdy and you can travel with it easily.</li>
            <li> Secondly, I have not seen a huge change in my under eye bags but am certain the device is \\&quot;helping\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be happy to come back in 3 months with an update on my progress, I am hoping to firm up some sagging skin around my chin and cheeks and see if I can soften my 11&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this almost daily for 3 weeks and can tell a huge difference....</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel that is enough time to write an accurate review.  </li>
            <li> very nice!&lt;br</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I bought this as part of a combo deal from the website, the Lift wand really does do wonders.</li>
            <li> Since I could not find a order number and really just wanted replacements</li>
            <li> I was curious if I would be able to purchase them through the company.</li>
            <li> so I ordered it straight away.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised will see if it really works on wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> I got it very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really notice much of a difference, you can feel it burn or sting.  </li>
            <li> It is very healing.  </li>
            <li> I contacted them because the second day the unit started making a pulsing sound .</li>
            <li> is much smoother.  </li>
            <li> and it is to much for me to use it on high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if it works because I used it for two weeks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot of money to find out that it was a gimmick or ineffective.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t do anything and the oil wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> I had to get a different kind of oil to use with this product (white camellia oil) because the argan oil was too much for my face &amp; made me break out.</li>
            <li> then it worked much nicer.</li>
            <li> , it felt tighter, and thanks to the 100% Argan Oil it healed rapidly.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the oil that comes with this item</li>
            <li> Using the Mary Kay cream helps the wand glide over my face much easier.</li>
            <li> I need to use it longer and regualry to see if it really does work.</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks, I can really notice a difference .</li>
            <li> no broken wands.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li> The oil is organic and certified which is what you need to look for real argon oil.</li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> That means Lift Wand co will stand behind unit only if sold by Exquisite Goods i guess...</li>
            <li> and the only thing i see so far is smaller pores which is a good thing</li>
            <li> The wand doesn&#x27;t hurt but if your really sensitive you can break the current by touching the end of the wand with your finger before putting it on your face</li>
            <li> (just remember to try low power first!!</li>
            <li> I am editing this from the top of my review but have not removed the initial review below: the company is sending me a new unit so I am upgrading the review to a three star until I get to use the new unit .</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to repack it in it&#x27;s original box, which is very big.  </li>
            <li> This following is my original review.</li>
            <li> it can rejuvenate the glow to the face &amp;amp; soften the skin (however, I use my other favorite lotion/serum</li>
            <li> you run out of the Argon oil that comes with the Lift Wand you can use any other oil of your choice, no need to order more oil from the Lift Wand</li>
            <li> I was unaware of this type problem but will be more aware in the future-</li>
            <li> This particular unit works very well and does what it says.</li>
            <li> My main reason for trying this product is, very baggy lower eyes.</li>
            <li> 30 days use wasn&#x27;t long enough for a honest review.</li>
            <li> I saw some high frequency devices are much cheaper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend  this product to anyone who wants to instill changes in their skin without high costs of dermatological visits.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its effective,</li>
            <li> Just okay, not really worth the money.</li>
            <li> nice product, not magic,</li>
            <li> This lift wand arrived on time and was new and packed well!</li>
            <li> I think I can see a slight lifting around my jaw line that I am hoping will get even better with time.  </li>
            <li> For comparison, most brands have only 5 or 10 watts of power and the Derma Wand has only 1.5 watts.  </li>
            <li> Funny cause those wrinkles were definitely there when I first ordered the product (which was about one month ago)</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s quite the gray market for this particular device.</li>
            <li> Many people have said that I look younger now than I did several years ago.  </li>
            <li> you push it all the way in, you will be able to feel that it is in tightly.  </li>
            <li> All said and done I highly recommend this device</li>
            <li> so I decided to buy a High Frequency device for home use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get how they say this helps with acne when it made me look like I was in high school again.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes after reading some favorable reviews.</li>
            <li> Why make a high powered device with no ground?</li>
            <li> but I give the company high marks for working with me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> I had been researching for a high frequency wand &amp;#34;since</li>
            <li> :-)&lt;br /&gt;There is a little instruction booklet that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> I had a very positive experience with high frequency&#x27;s facial treatment in a beauty salon</li>
            <li> It got to a point that I was disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find time to use it - the oil is fantastic and my skin feels great</li>
            <li> and my skin normally looks washed out.</li>
            <li> but within two days was right back to normal.</li>
            <li> I started using the hair wand and am already seeing positive results, I totally love this product it is amazing, you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> I have only been using my Wand for a month now, but I can already tell a difference...a positive one!  </li>
            <li> Oh and if you&#x27;ve ever had a GOOD Professional Facial, they do this at the end of the facial in order to kill any bacteria transfered to the skin do to possible use of bare hands on skin.</li>
            <li> hopefully my new replacement wand&#x27;s on/off</li>
            <li> can live without the ear probe.</li>
            <li> I bought my new product in June</li>
            <li> when done with my treatment I follow with a glycolic toner then follow with OZ naturals Vit C serum, awaiting Serum CL which is new.</li>
            <li> and they said they&#x27;d send a new one.</li>
            <li> I started using the Lift Wand on 12/6/14, waited to write a review because new skin cells change every 90 or so days and felt</li>
            <li> I had such a fantastic experience with their customer service (they resolved an issue for me in one email)that I would suggest only buying from them anyway.</li>
            <li> Maybe, one might notice more if she or he has profound wrinkles and uneven skin tones on thier faces.  </li>
            <li> ok this is not working only after several uses I need to send it back</li>
            <li> First, let it be known this is not going to get rid of wrinkles or provide an actual lift like this product and Dermawand</li>
            <li> having people think I&#x27;m my 31 year old daughter&#x27;s sister, works for me!</li>
            <li> I purchased this last week and used it for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li> I have been using the wand consistently for two weeks and have definitely noticed improvements to my skin.  </li>
            <li> the frown line between my eyes has faded completely, and my skin is glowing!</li>
            <li> It tingles a bit when you use it, but actually feels pretty invigorating.</li>
            <li> I read not only Amazon reviews, but articles from many other resources before I purchased.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy the slight warming effect it has on my skin.  </li>
            <li> also based my decision on the price, when I purchased it, it cost less than the Derma Wand and far less than the most powerful one I saw offered at $140 that had up to 25 watts of power.</li>
            <li> The wand gave a tingling feeling, I only used half power but will apply more after extended use.</li>
            <li> Also the text on their box and in the instructions seems to have been translated and not proof read by someone who speaks English (meaning absolutely no offense to anyone as the situation could as easily be reversed).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a older woman and noticed a thinning upper lip, bagging around my eyes and some jowl dropping that made me look older than I felt.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t have much time to go to the Beauty spa to have facial that often...don&#x27;t wanna pay much for the professional high frequency treatment outside.</li>
            <li> I do notice though that when i use one adapter, i have to jiggle it a little to make the light work, but i didn&#x27;t call to return it.</li>
            <li> I have broke 3 wands thus far.</li>
            <li> All of my emails were answered and in a timely professional manner and replacement  wands were offered.</li>
            <li> so far.</li>
            <li> My 62 year old friend came for a visit in October</li>
            <li> Just think it can&#x27;t compete with professional services.</li>
            <li> My husband looked much younger within a week, the liver spots on his face were much lighter.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> And wow even with just a week of using my brown spots are fading and a cystic zit that had been there  and NOTHING helped is now going away.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t expect miracles, but this has so far had visible results.</li>
            <li> Has far as tightening and wrinkles its to soon to tell.</li>
            <li> See no difference so far.</li>
            <li> It also comes with the 100% natural &amp;amp; organic Argan oil from Morocco...</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this product I went for a professional treatment that I had purchased on Groupon.  </li>
            <li> The cost of these treatments would be up near $900.00</li>
            <li> I know that the machine used at the professional treatment is a lot stronger than the Lift Wand</li>
            <li> far as results go, I have had no compliments and no one has asked me what I am doing</li>
            <li> I wrote to the manufacturer directly</li>
            <li> I have been using the Lift Wand for 3 months and, WOW, what a difference.  </li>
            <li> The lines around my mouth are nearly all gone.  </li>
            <li> Useless.&lt;br /&gt;Preys on our desire to look young.</li>
            <li> So far like it.</li>
            <li> I really like it, I have only had it for about a month</li>
            <li> I used this for a few weeks on a lower setting  and haven&#x27;t seen any significant results.</li>
            <li> I spent 15 years with my past career in the cosmetics industry and love to try new anti aging products, in my 50&#x27;s but before putting anything on my face I need to know more, so my purchase was heavily weigh upon reviews such as mine.</li>
            <li> This is a bonus that I can do high frequency facial at home by myself!</li>
            <li> Overall I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It came unattached and although it comes with four different probes, I didn&#x27;t have trouble with any of the others,  just the larger probe I used the most.</li>
            <li> It was a little intimidating at 1st, but after the 1st time that quickly went away.</li>
            <li> At first the noise and overall experience scared me because I was wondering if it was goig to shock me but with the flat probe I could barely feel anything!  </li>
            <li> Very powerful and skin stimulator to reduce small wrinkles</li>
            <li> I would just recommend not using the device over a tile floor since the chances are good that the glass wands will break on the hard surface if they are not securely inserted.</li>
            <li> so I am looking forward to receiving my new one shortly.  </li>
            <li> The ringing in my right ear has also become less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the fact that Lift Wand leaves your skin glow naturally just like the other reviews stated, I want to emphasize how much they care about customer satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> I am not expecting miracles and if all this did was to keep my skin in the condition it is in right now over the next 20 years I would be extremely happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also noticed my skin in general just looked healthier.</li>
            <li> I have to say I noticed some differences, skin tightening, and quality of skin in general has improved.</li>
            <li> You then turn the knob to a low setting to start and you will see a pinkish red electrical current that glows through the probe, when you touch it on your skin, scalp, hand or whatever part of the skin you are treating, the electrical buzzing sound gets louder and the pink electrical current in the probe gets brighter as it makes the connection with the skin.  </li>
            <li> (derma wand is gentiler  for under eye usage but the lift wand is too aggressive for it) when my derma wand came with clear instructions, I used this wand similar to the movements I used with the derma wand</li>
            <li> I clearly can see my pores are much smaller, under eye</li>
            <li> and she saw such an improvement to her pores and old acne scars.</li>
            <li> The last broke when not inserted completely and turned on..it literally exploded.</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and it is definitely starting to show.</li>
            <li> I was starting to get some jowls which made me look way to old.</li>
            <li> my pores appear to be smaller and my skin is extremely soft.  </li>
            <li> I an 66 years old and have been using the lift wand for several months.  </li>
            <li> One of the electrodes was broken when I received it, but the product seems okay</li>
            <li> So within the first few days - acne cleared up (and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING from OTC products, antibiotics, home remedies and bamm - always with the bumps, sure that other stuff may have helped a little, but they always returned, under the skin bumps too).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was just my luck...!&lt;br /&gt;After two months of sheer bliss with my new wand and receiving several compliments about my complexion from my peers at work....</li>
            <li> I used on an ingrown zit, it was stinging a little more than a little but by the next day it was almost gone and within two days it was completely</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single blemish since I&#x27;ve been using this, and all the old acne scars have faded completely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 40 year old male with Native American combination skin, who often is told that I look 35.</li>
            <li> now refer my clients to Lift wand, especially when I&#x27;m asked what I&#x27;m doing differently for my 50 year old</li>
            <li> I apply Skinceuticles first then a little Argan Oil when I use it.</li>
            <li> At first i felt a little bit scared to see the orange electrodes, but i&#x27;ve read all the instruction</li>
            <li> Overall I was just noticing general stuff that happens when your skin ages</li>
            <li> have only used it twice so far, but I have to tell you, I have some extra skin above one of my eyelids, and it bugs me.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t think it will completely get rid of lines that I&#x27;ve had for a long time, I can say they have improved.  </li>
            <li> but the cost is literally pennies per day compared to the hundreds of dollars spent month after monthtrying new product that doesn&#x27;t perform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I now can use it on high with my other face products.</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments on my skin in the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> That being stated I must report several good and bad issues with this device.</li>
            <li> New lines that have recently appeared were less visible after only one week.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I would not recommend using the included oil due to possible breakouts.</li>
            <li> Been using this at least once a day on top of my usual skin regimen.</li>
            <li> I have  little wrinkles  around my eyes and slight laugh lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li> I suffer from sebaceous acne and was hoping this device would help clear some of the scars from previous breakouts (I have my acne under control prior to purchasing this device), and was hoping it would help with sagging skin around my eyes and cheek bones.</li>
            <li> I have seen Dawn Amador&#x27;s YouTube videos and I am really anxious to see if the Lift Wand really works.      </li>
            <li> , usually I&#x27;m a skeptic but this really did work for me as I had acne problems for years.</li>
            <li> It really does what it says it will do, if not more.</li>
            <li> enough instruction with product on how often an how long you should use ?&lt;</li>
            <li> I am 45 years old and felt like my skin was starting to sag I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a month</li>
            <li> dry skin looks and feels younger.  </li>
            <li> much less puffy, jowl line disappearing, neck firm and smooth, lips getting a little fuller.</li>
            <li> One major factor is to take the wand and slide it over the area your concerned with but to then slide it to the side of your face and down to the lymphiods to drain the cells.</li>
            <li> switch cover will last long!!!</li>
            <li> Also , I had pretty bad headaches for about a week which I rarely get and asked them if there might be a connection.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;-We are sorry to hear your glass electrode broke, we can replace that for you free of charge.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> as long as you use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used to that long.</li>
            <li> They are not completely gone but there is</li>
            <li> but I was curious to get this facial device because it seems functional &amp;amp; I want to get some device to rejuvenate my skin.</li>
            <li> Wish I had found this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I like what I see so far in the few days</li>
            <li> I contacted the Lift Care people and discovered the defective Lift Wand was sold by a grey market reseller and that it was not covered under warranty.  </li>
            <li> It has given my skin a radiance that it has not had for a long time.  </li>
            <li> How  long do you use the wand on a daily basis and do you use it with any  other ointments or serums?</li>
            <li> It only comes up for the other products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Over time this device, if used every other day will improve the overall quality of your skin.</li>
            <li> and I can see some improved it, but I only used once every other day.</li>
            <li> I have not had the lift wand very long, not even a month.</li>
            <li> Like I have said, I have not had it very long</li>
            <li> I have not had a chance to use the Lift Wand for very long yet</li>
            <li> If I am having really dry skin in the winter</li>
            <li> but, I&#x27;m dry so.)  </li>
            <li> am in my late 30&#x27;s and with the last couple pregnancies I developed skin discoloration, or hyper pigmentation all over my forehead and face that I had been trying skin lighteners to diminish them, after seeing no results I thought I would give this a whirl.  </li>
            <li> There has not been one single sign of improvement.</li>
            <li> Now I didn&#x27;t do it every single day...</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed when two electrodes became defective but Lift Wand quickly restored my loyalty by showing how much they care even for an order from an unauthorized merchant.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed  it came loose.</li>
            <li> They were loose and wobbly because  the metal mechanism that holds them in place was loose.</li>
            <li> loose pcs inside the wand from the electrode.</li>
            <li> (I do almost my entire body so about a half hour to 45 mins)</li>
            <li> I used the Argon oil that was supplied, first it&#x27;s expensive, second after 5 weeks of use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had skin tightening treatments before, but I&#x27;m amazed at how this little thing seems to be doing the trick and it costs far less than one skin tightening treatment does at a doctor&#x27;s office, or even through specials on Groupon,</li>
            <li> she still used it another week trying to figure out what she was doing wrong, in other words we tried all the troubleshooting instructions first but still could not get it to work properly.</li>
            <li> The pain has been a total constant, but now I hardly notice it.  </li>
            <li> I could have spent the price of the wand for 2 bottles of product.</li>
            <li> I like to use the round shape one for my entire face and the comb for my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely careful when handling the wand to prevent breakage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve notice my pores are getting smaller and a few lines have reduced quite a bit.</li>
            <li> from.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also a firm believer in personal experience</li>
            <li> Just be patient and use it everyday or as often as possible.  </li>
            <li> Certainly no &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34</li>
            <li> But again the previous device made some strange noises and literally &amp;#34;popped&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Please let them know that I think the problem should be fixed before someone gets seriously hurt.</li>
            <li> I use my other face products under the organ oil.</li>
            <li> You should absolutely not get headaches from using the lift wand!</li>
            <li> Looking forward to other improvements with continued use.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s too soon to report on its effectiveness, but I have my fingers crossed after reading all the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Some days I use it for 15 minutes and other days</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading other&#x27;s comments about the Argon Oil</li>
            <li> I was not aware of that at the time of purchase so other buyers be careful!</li>
            <li> No perfumy smell like with other argan oils sometimes have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh also, my hair would always feel rough on the ends, split ends are gone!</li>
            <li> other people</li>
            <li> , so I usually turn to read reviews with peoples personal experiences for help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much like a lot of you, I was skeptical, but I thought, hey if it&#x27;s less the cost of one of my dermatologists treatments, what do I have to loose.</li>
            <li> appealed to me was it had much higher power and was less expensive than the one advertised on T. V.</li>
            <li> Not right for me</li>
            <li> Was not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have to mention that after I complained I received $$$$ back, however wish I could have a chance to check how it works</li>
            <li> I appreciate my buying experience with Amazon, if something goes wrong they are very responsive.</li>
            <li> I used to suffer from cystic, painful acne, and the lift wand has delivered more results than anything I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> may have lightened sun spots using less than one moth</li>
            <li> after less then a month use one of the electrodes broke, the bottom metal came off and now the device itself isn&#x27;t working...</li>
            <li> There is a slight tingle</li>
            <li> I would like to add some information to my previous review.</li>
            <li> you put the probe of your choice into the black bottom part</li>
            <li> Yes, there is slight discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I had previously purchased one of the cheaper ones here just to get an intro.</li>
            <li> and I had less puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Just like they took &amp;#34;great care of the previous one star</li>
            <li> I also used the spoon shaped one for my eyes to eliminate my little dark circles.</li>
            <li> No more break outs, but also no real difference in skin texture, wrinkles or tone yet either.  </li>
            <li> I also have noticed puffy eyes, and saggy eyelids and just dull dry skin.  </li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have a pace maker, I do have a metal post bridge and the 1st few times, I could feel it a little, just turn the frequency down, it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have a pace maker, I do have a metal post bridge and the 1st few times, I could feel it a little, just turn the frequency down, it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately after 5 years the tip of the glass broke and I started looking on amazon to order it again, but when looking I discovered this new product Lift Wand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by explaining what this product is because I was a little unsure of what it was</li>
            <li> Had a little bump in the road when one of the metal ends came off from one of the wands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a little over a week and haven&#x27;t received anything yet.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I was on highest setting and felt little or nothing.</li>
            <li> I think the secret is using it constantly to see results.</li>
            <li> I next tried the thin probe shaped wand, but then it broke and the metal part got stuck inside the Lift Wand.  </li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this P.O.S.</li>
            <li> Hopefully in a few months I will see finer lines and firmer skin - that is my hope.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that after only 2 uses, the power has decreased dramatically.</li>
            <li> To read my full review go to: [...]</li>
            <li> They obviously stand behind their product.  </li>
            <li> This item arrived broken and looks VERY fragile.  </li>
            <li> but after a few days I notice my skin looking &amp;#34;less fresh&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful when placing the electrodes in as they are delicate and can break</li>
            <li> :  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it a few times after I got this product.</li>
            <li> and so far I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> One of the wands would not light up.  </li>
            <li> it over dried it a bit -</li>
            <li> so I use a heavy cream from Mary Kay</li>
            <li> I would suggest to anyone who would like to firm up their face to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble sleeping</li>
            <li> and I faithfully use the liftwand everyday.</li>
            <li> If your not seeing results ( you do have to do this daily at least or results will fade, so don&#x27;t be lazy!)</li>
            <li> I have hated them, and they are becoming less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I will spend way less on fillers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50, had severe health issues in the past that lead to dramatic weight loss and left my skin dry, lined and dull</li>
            <li> The small wand I have been using behind my ears on the scars from two surgeries last year.  </li>
            <li> small electrode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In one week I already see a difference in my forehead (no more Botox for me)</li>
            <li> ; I was not satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Sadly my lift wand seem to not work properly.</li>
            <li> I just noticed this past week</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I initially had a problem with the product and after posting my disappointment I got a surprise call from a company representative a few days after.</li>
            <li> The english grammar in the instruction manual (which is very minimal) is so poorly written it is almost indecipherable.</li>
            <li> hardly any there</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, and she suffers from poly cystic ovarian syndrome, which causes her to have massive break outs and scarring around her face along the chin.</li>
            <li> Now for the negative.</li>
            <li> just wish is were not so delicate.</li>
            <li> but I would suggest to use the spoon shaped for delicate eyes area</li>
            <li> One of the things I found out was that I would need a 45 minute treatment at least once a week for approx.</li>
            <li> but I figure if I can get in at least 50 minutes a week that will be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is my opinion that the Lift Wand should be used for at least 90 days before making a decision about the product.  </li>
            <li> at least mine had no instructions)</li>
            <li> Shoddy.</li>
            <li> It works slowly to regenerate the skin and tighten it.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately one of the pieces was broken and the other stopped working within a few days.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure if the intensity was a result of the product being defective and led to the demise of that device or if the intensity was intended and of poor quality.</li>
            <li> I would appreciate if the manufacturer would send me a new base.</li>
            <li> In the beginning I was a bit tense using it</li>
            <li> - The glass probes did not fit properly in the base.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much of a difference yet but one thing I did notice is the oil that it comes with made my face break out so bad I forgot about wrinkles for a week!</li>
            <li> Even my husband, who was a little skeptical in the beginning, has had to admit that my skin looks</li>
            <li> It beats the expensive creams hands down!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed I wrote the amazon distributor,  but I&#x27;m still waiting to hear back from them just to see if I could replace the probe.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> scary to say the least.</li>
            <li> In addition to everything mentioned here regarding the broken wands, I contacted lift wand to inquire about replacements for the 2 which broke while in use.</li>
            <li> I like it when a company stands behind their product like that</li>
            <li> got my attention was, the fact that I could also do my scalp with the scalp electrode, and behind  my ears, with the behind the ears electrode.  </li>
            <li> I have never heard of doing behind your ear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The behind the ear electrode was broken, I e-mailed them, and in  about 2 hour&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I did what they needed,  and  they shipped me another one, and I did not have to return the broken one.  </li>
            <li> The manufacturer replaced the broken wand</li>
            <li> I like it when a manufacturer stands behind their products.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; or any adverse affects even on the highest setting.  </li>
            <li> Also concerning the power output of the wand, is there any broken or  </li>
            <li> Feel nothing even at highest level except with the behind the ear probe.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Today even though I&#x27;m tired and exhausted my skin looks awake.</li>
            <li> Half my pieces don&#x27;t work!!!!</li>
            <li> Please let the manufacturer know that this problem could cause the glass probes to break and cause very serious injury.</li>
            <li> Wasted money :(</li>
            <li> So sadly we have to return it</li>
            <li> and you will never be sorry you did........</li>
            <li> This made me uncomfortable because to me it could be a used unit, a defective product returned and resold or a company that just does not care about their packaging.</li>
            <li> 2 of the glass wands have broken after a couple of uses and there wasn&#x27;t any oil in the bottle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m baffled that the information put out about the product is somewhat vague.</li>
            <li> Obsessed.</li>
            <li> Some difficultly getting it together</li>
            <li> Argon oil is expensive if you go to Swanson Vitamins and search their site</li>
            <li> This product is crazy.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong at this price!</li>
            <li> Also, it would be impossible to travel with.  </li>
            <li> Started to get bad break outs</li>
            <li> electrodes are  glass, and, is very thin, so, I remove it at the base, and insert from the base, no problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am planning to buy my wife another one because i do believe it was the defected tube that caused the base to lose strength.</li>
            <li> I emailed the company who immediately sent me another base for the machine.  </li>
            <li> The base may be defective and needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> cause I hate having pimples and don&#x27;t want to see people when I do.</li>
            <li> And as a result has even helped prevent those horrible scars you can get from cysts and bad acne.</li>
            <li> I am so very disappointed .    </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the Lift Wand.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed, it&#x27;s been 8 weeks</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is great, more useful than other similar product. I think the secret is using it constantly to see results.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, and she suffers from poly cystic ovarian syndrome, which causes her to have massive break outs and scarring around her face along the chin. She used it once a day and she saw such an improvement to her pores and old acne scars. and to her surprise she has not had a breakout since. She has tried everything for here acne but nothing seemed to work. This product was great, but it seemed to lose power after two weeks and i noticed it had a defect with one of the tubes. she still used it another week trying to figure out what she was doing wrong, in other words we tried all the troubleshooting instructions first but still could not get it to work properly. So sadly we have to return it and i am hoping we get a refund in a timely manner. I am planning to buy my wife another one because i do believe it was the defected tube that caused the base to lose strength.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works well but unfortunately one of the pieces was broken and the other stopped working within a few days. I emailed them, they responded promptly and  are sending out replacement parts along with an additional piece at no extra charge!</li>
            <li> The Lift Wand Unit made my wife look 15 years younger ( in my eyes and mind and hers as well, and that is what is matters!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this device and you will never be sorry you did........as long as you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also impressed with this company, because when I had a service issue with the Lift Wand, they immediately replaced it without any problem or delay - very nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TG (Michele&#x27;s Husband)</li>
            <li> I want to first state that I have not been able to fully use this product to truely rate it.  I would like a replacement Lift Wand sent to me instead of having to return it for a refund, since it is now more expensive than what I paid.      I would love to try the Lift Wand to see if it works.  However, the first time using it, I used the circular wand for the face and I did not feel anything even on the highest setting.  I next tried the thin probe shaped wand, but then it broke and the metal part got stuck inside the Lift Wand.  Can I please have a different replacement Lift Wand sent to me instead of getting a refund?    I have seen Dawn Amador&#x27;s YouTube videos and I am really anxious to see if the Lift Wand really works.      Will somebody contact me ASAP?  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I noticed immediate results using the Lift Wand.  My skin was noticeably tighter and my complexion had somewhat of a glow to it.  As a guy, I was a bit hesitant to purchase it for &amp;#34;Guy Reasons&amp;#34;, but glad that I did.  I don&#x27;t always use it daily, but definitely before I go on a date, or when I want to look polished before a meeting.  The argan oil is very healthy for the skin, so if I use it at night, I will just leave the oil on my face for the full absorption of the high concentration of Vitamin E that it has.  Glad that I made the purchase, as it has made a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I received damaged wands and no response from the seller. I wasted my money on this P.O.S. It stopped working after 4 uses. Please invest your money in another brand.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I bought this as part of a combo deal from the website, the Lift wand really does do wonders. I used it for 2 weeks and notice my pores were smaller as well as the acne on my face. I was amazed how soon I saw the results from this , usually I&#x27;m a skeptic but this really did work for me as I had acne problems for years.</li>
            <li> I love this device. That being stated I must report several good and bad issues with this device. I purchased this device to use on my under eye bags and to improve the texture/quality of my skin. Firstly the device has impressed me for a variety of reasons. Primarily, it is hands down the best device to use if you have any sort of acne. The device works amazing on keeping your skin clear. Secondly, I have not seen a huge change in my under eye bags but am certain the device is \\&quot;helping\\&quot;. The most significant improvement and this is why I am leaving this review is to my hair growth. The device is simply amazing for stimulating hair growth. Now for the negative. I purchased and have used this device religiously for 3 months or so twice a day for 10 minutes each session. I have broke 3 wands thus far. There is a design flaw in my opinion or the glass simply wears out after repeated use. One stem broke while inserting into the unit and punctured my hand. The second broke while in use by my daughter...scary to say the least. The last broke when not inserted completely and turned on..it literally exploded. All said and done I highly recommend this device just wish is were not so delicate. I am on the search for replacement wands as I will continue to use this faithfully. In addition to everything mentioned here regarding the broken wands, I contacted lift wand to inquire about replacements for the 2 which broke while in use. Since I could not find a order number and really just wanted replacements I was curious if I would be able to purchase them through the company. All of my emails were answered and in a timely professional manner and replacement  wands were offered. I cant say enough about this device and also the customer support team in place for questions and help. In closing lift wand customer support has offered to send me the replacement wands free of charge...I am overall exceedingly pleased with my experience with this device and customer support team.</li>
            <li> I had a very positive experience with high frequency&#x27;s facial treatment in a beauty salon so I decided to buy a High Frequency device for home use. First I used Dermawand and I was satisfied with it but I wanted somethig more powerful as the Dermawand  is only 1.5 watts. Tthen I found out about Lift wand and its 20 watts so I ordered it straight away. The lift wand arrived in great working condition and I was very happy with this device and would use it daily with the argan oil that is included&lt;br /&gt;I Want to thank the Liftcare&#x27;s customer service because after some uses  I felt that that power had decreased, so I contacted the customer service and they answered me within hours, offering to send me another one free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be writing a full review once I get to use the new one more.Thanks a lot.Love this gadget!!!.</li>
            <li> The unit actually burned out while I was using it.  I could have had a fire.  The Metal part of the Probe melted away.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the Company TWICE explaining what happened, no one responded to me. If pictures are needed, I will supply them.</li>
            <li> This thing works amazing. Even after first treatment I saw the difference!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if its effective, but then I used it only a once.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell whether it is effective, but it is easy to use and I do  see the stimulation of circulation which is always good.  Hopefully in a few months I will see finer lines and firmer skin - that is my hope.</li>
            <li> One of the electrodes was broken when I received it, but the product seems okay so far. I have noticed that after only 2 uses, the power has decreased dramatically.</li>
            <li> I got it a week ago, so to see the results it takes 2 weeks so I&#x27;m still working on it, fast shipping, easy to use, good quality, I drop one electrode the 1st day jumped everywhere and didn&#x27;t break thank god, so I&#x27;m very positive about this product, when I see the results I&#x27;ll make another revew!</li>
            <li> Very powerful and skin stimulator to reduce small wrinkles</li>
            <li> ok this is not working only after several uses I need to send it back</li>
            <li> Works as advertised will see if it really works on wrinkles.</li>
            <li> may have lightened sun spots using less than one moth</li>
            <li> Was not worth the money. Low quality.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing anything for my skin yet. Haven&#x27;t used to that long. But I enjoy using it it feels great</li>
            <li> Have had this wand for awhile now but to tell the truth I havent used it enough to evaluate it. Will try and update later.</li>
            <li> works great, but don&#x27;t see any significant results, will keep trying!</li>
            <li> I love this device!! It&#x27;s powerful and very effective. You can&#x27;t go wrong at this price! To read my full review go to: [...]&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to looking so much younger than my 55 years!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this and started loving it from day one.  The left-over tingle is a reminder that circulation has been stimulated.  It got to a point that I was disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find time to use it - the oil is fantastic and my skin feels great (I bought a second bottle of the oil from the company).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m most impressed about is the Liftcare&#x27;s customer service.  For some reason one day the power was reduced (i.e., it would not go to maximum).  I emailed the company who immediately sent me another base for the machine.  I paid $10 for shipping, which I thought was fair, and it arrived in great working condition, no questions asked.  This is a rare breed of customer service.  They obviously stand behind their product.  I love the product and highly recommend it (and no, I&#x27;m not being paid for this review).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not regimen with the use of this product, but the first uses I did notice lighter sun spot.  I use it periodically so not the best advice. I do notice though that when i use one adapter, i have to jiggle it a little to make the light work, but i didn&#x27;t call to return it. It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> LOVE the Lift Wand!  If you use it consistently you will see results in a matter of weeks!</li>
            <li> Great product, used the included Argan oil and applied the wand my skin felt incredibly smooth and shiny afterwards. The wand gave a tingling feeling, I only used half power but will apply more after extended use. Great buy!</li>
            <li> This item arrived broken and looks VERY fragile.  I&#x27;ve asked for a refund and sent it back.  I&#x27;m waiting on the refund.  Also, it would be impossible to travel with.  You&#x27;d have to repack it in it&#x27;s original box, which is very big.  I had a derma wand years ago.  It does the same and is very sturdy and you can travel with it easily.</li>
            <li> I use this regularly and have noticed a difference. It&#x27;s very easy to use, doesn&#x27;t take much time and as I say when I do use it, I notice a difference. I sometimes get out of the habit of using it but after a few days I notice my skin looking &amp;#34;less fresh&amp;#34;. I also use a derma roller, between the two I have noticed my skin looks healthier.</li>
            <li> I think this product does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. Be careful with changing out the electrodes twist in and twist out-be sure you don&#x27;t jam them in from the top. So far I think it does a good job of reducing acne when it pops up and has helped improve the overall look of my skin. It is not a spa grade machine but for the price I think it does a good job. I would recommend to a friend and already have!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased at the results from using this product.  After 5 weeks of use, I noticed a reduction in the lines around my eyes (others noticed too!). Also saw 50% improvement in the skin above my top lip (skin changes from menopause).  It did not help tighten the skin on my neck however, but still definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> This really works. I am 58 and the lines around my mouth and eyes are greatly reduced. My turkey neck is also improved. I apply Skinceuticles first then a little Argan Oil when I use it. I saw an improvement in a couple of days. In 3 weeks I am amazed.  Almost a year later. I have been using the Lift Wand for almost a year now. I don&#x27;t have time to use it daily. I have had times when I went several weeks without using it. At one point I had about 2 months when I didn&#x27;t use it. I went back to using it as directed for a couple minutes a  day and saw instant improvement. I now can use it on high with my other face products. In the beginning I was a bit tense using it but now I really enjoy it.  My 62 year old friend came for a visit in October and I let her use it (3 times) while she was here. She was amazed at how lifted her face was. When she got back to Indiana her sister wanted to know if I treated her to a dermatology visit. This works; and even if you get a time in your life when you can&#x27;t squeeze it in don&#x27;t worry. Just a couple of short sessions with it and your skin is lifted again. I find it help my products work better too. If I am having really dry skin in the winter I use my other face products under the organ oil. It really helps get the best out of my products and moisturize my skin. I also use this after peels and masks and I think I get a better result with those products when used with the Lift wand. I no longer have all that fine wrinkly drapey skin on my cheeks. My () are gone. My jaw line is more defined. I could have spent the price of the wand for 2 bottles of product. I  will have the wand for years I hope. I am careful to take good care of it. The lift wand is on my list of favorite things to own because it works for pennies for each treatment.</li>
            <li> Love this, my skin has definitely gotten better and it totally works on helping to minimize/get rid of zits</li>
            <li> The lift wand has done wonders for my acne prone chin. It helps eliminate the break outs the next day. It also helps with my eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> I was amazed as to how quickly my shipment arrived. It was packaged well, and that&#x27;s a good thing, as the wands themselves are glass. I have only been using my Wand for a month now, but I can already tell a difference...a positive one!  I actually enjoy using it and highly recommend it to anyone in search of a more youthful look.&lt;br /&gt;Also, FYI, I accidentally broke one of the wands. I notified Lift Care and they responded to me by the very next morning. Without any questions, they said they were shipping a replacement right out. I like it when a company stands behind their product like that, so I&#x27;m looking forward to doing some future orders with Life Care...I&#x27;ve already got my eye on some things.</li>
            <li> Update: editing my review.  after less then a month use one of the electrodes broke, the bottom metal came off and now the device itself isn&#x27;t working...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;aside from that I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant changes.</li>
            <li> Nice product, but no matter how careful you are, the wands break...be ready to replace them.  My broke within 30 days and after contacting the seller about it, still no response.</li>
            <li> The Lift Wand did everything I anticipated it would do.  Its light weight and its easy to handle. Great product</li>
            <li> I have  used it 3 times  and I noticed  it came loose. I called  to see if it can be  replaced but instead  was credited  for  return.</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and it is definitely starting to show. Not being able to afford expensive skin care treatments, I decided to invest in this device. There seems to be many to choose from, the Derma Wand being very well known, and many other brands. I chose the Lift Wand for 2 main reasons, I liked all the attachments (electrodes) it comes with and most importantly, I like that it has 20 watts of power. For comparison, most brands have only 5 or 10 watts of power and the Derma Wand has only 1.5 watts.  Also the Derma Wand has only one gas bulb attached to it, so you are stuck with that one small electrode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also based my decision on the price, when I purchased it, it cost less than the Derma Wand and far less than the most powerful one I saw offered at $140 that had up to 25 watts of power. So for 20 watts of power, I was convinced that it was a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it twice so far, but I have to tell you, I have some extra skin above one of my eyelids, and it bugs me. I used the smallest electrode and the lowest setting and just went over my upper eyelids for a good 5 minutes, and I was astonished, immediately I noticed that the amount of extra skin had diminished substantially. I thought, if the Lift Wand works this good on the lowest setting just on my eyelids, think about what it will be able to do for my whole face over the next 2 -3 months!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone left a product review saying that it was too powerful for around the eye area, I don&#x27;t agree, it is perfect for me at the lowest setting, but other areas like my neck and cheeks, I use full power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Lift Wand and I am glad I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be happy to come back in 3 months with an update on my progress, I am hoping to firm up some sagging skin around my chin and cheeks and see if I can soften my 11&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the Amazon merchant, Exquisite Goods, who I bought my Lift Wand from has been great to deal with, very excellent customer service, very prompt responses to my email inquiries, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This thing is the nuts! I haven&#x27;t had botox since last December and my skin looks smoother then ever. I just turned 50 shhhhh I will enclose untouched pic I took today July 2015</li>
            <li> This Lift Wand is great.  It works for me.&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was looking for another one, it did not have the one time purchase price listed, just the trial price, so, I saw this one, and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;What got my attention was, the fact that I could also do my scalp with the scalp electrode, and behind  my ears, with the behind the ears electrode.  I have never heard of doing behind your ear.&lt;br /&gt;The electrodes are  glass, and, is very thin, so, I remove it at the base, and insert from the base, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;It tingles, and feels really good to me.&lt;br /&gt;I love the Argan Oil.  If you run out, the good thing is, you can use any other oil of your choice, no need to order more Argan oil from the Lift Wand people.&lt;br /&gt;I found more of the Argan oil at Sprouts Farmers market here in CA.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy that I chose to purchase this one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it about 4 or 5 times, and yes, I can see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Different people will of course, have different response times.  I do realize that I will have to wait longer to get the full effect that I want, then do a maintenance program to keep it going. :-)&lt;br /&gt;There is a little instruction booklet that comes with it.  After reading it, I went to YouTube, to watch a video.&lt;br /&gt;The customer service is great.  The behind the ear electrode was broken, I e-mailed them, and in  about 2 hour&#x27;s I got a response.  I did what they needed,  and  they shipped me another one, and I did not have to return the broken one.  I was very pleased and surprised.  I got it very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I hope that this review will help you.</li>
            <li> Ordered it a month ago, used once and it stopped working. Got replacement immediately but.... It was defective. I have to mention that after I complained I received $$$$ back, however wish I could have a chance to check how it works</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It&#x27;s not like poof the wrinkles are gone but I do see a difference. I was starting to get some jowls which made me look way to old. But since I have been using the Lift Wand there has been a noticeable difference in my skin. I am totally happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really notice much of a difference, you can feel it burn or sting.  Just think it can&#x27;t compete with professional services.</li>
            <li> DID NOT WORK .. HAD NO SUCTION &amp; ONLY GAVE OFF A BURNING SMELL. DEFECTIVE PRODUCT!!!  I  SENT IT BACK</li>
            <li> I love love love the Lift wand! I was using Derma Wand and this is a Far Better machine!! Prof. Grade. And I saw results immediately over night! I&#x27;m 50, had severe health issues in the past that lead to dramatic weight loss and left my skin dry, lined and dull and I&#x27;ve just started to get circles under my eye&#x27;s ( never in my life!)  and this Lift Wand has made a dramatice difference in my appearance! Love the Argon Oil, very healing. I wash my face w/gentle cleanser, derma roll, apply serums, oil then use the Lift Wand, I leave the oil on (some wash it off but, I&#x27;m dry so.)  and after Lift Wand, I apply my intensive moisturizer, eye cream and I awake with beautiful skin in the am!  (I do almost my entire body so about a half hour to 45 mins) But, I do it prior to bed while watching TV. You do have to be careful when placing the electrodes in as they are delicate and can break but, this is a life saver! I will spend way less on fillers! Also, completely cures any breakouts over night!!!! No picking at your face any more!&lt;br /&gt;Customer Service is amazing! I needed an electode replaced as it came broken ( as I said, my shipping box came opened) but, they were happy to replace it, responed quickly and I wish I could send the Derma Wand back but, I&#x27;ll keep it for travelling as it&#x27;s more durable but,MUCH less effective. Oh and if you&#x27;ve ever had a GOOD Professional Facial, they do this at the end of the facial in order to kill any bacteria transfered to the skin do to possible use of bare hands on skin. There is a slight tingle but, I love it! Don&#x27;t over do, bring the frequency up in increments and no complaning about pain, stinging or not seeing results! If your not seeing results ( you do have to do this daily at least or results will fade, so don&#x27;t be lazy!) If your not seeing results, your not using this machine correctly! Hats off to Lift Wand!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Lift Wand after hearing of many of the new techniques being done by professionals that cost a lot of money.  When I read the reviews I decided to try this out and see if it could deliver instead of going to the professionals.  Didn&#x27;t have much hope, but I am delighted.  My husband looked much younger within a week, the liver spots on his face were much lighter.&lt;br /&gt;For myself, I see a definite improvement in the lines around my mouth and by my chin.  I have hated them, and they are becoming less noticeable.  The small wand I have been using behind my ears on the scars from two surgeries last year.  The pain has been a total constant, but now I hardly notice it.  The ringing in my right ear has also become less noticeable.  I think it may be a life saver.</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed with this device. First, let it be known this is not going to get rid of wrinkles or provide an actual lift like this product and Dermawand advertise. Currently there is no miracle cure for that. It&#x27;s meant more to even skin tone/texture. So those who do not suffer from these problems will not see any sort of results as it would only be acting as a preventive measure. As for me who has oily skin and large pores I did see an almost immediate result. My pores seemed to diminish quite a bit (but not fully) and my skin&#x27;s oil production was reduced (which could have been a placebo affect). I also noticed my skin in general just looked healthier. What I did not like was the product arrived without any type of seal. This made me uncomfortable because to me it could be a used unit, a defective product returned and resold or a company that just does not care about their packaging. Also the text on their box and in the instructions seems to have been translated and not proof read by someone who speaks English (meaning absolutely no offense to anyone as the situation could as easily be reversed). I&#x27;d recommend this product especially if they began properly sealing the box.</li>
            <li> I have read you only want to buy this from Exquisite Goods on Amazon..They are the ONLY authorized seller of Lift wand on Amazon..That means Lift Wand co will stand behind unit only if sold by Exquisite Goods i guess...I see they are not even a option to buy from them as of today..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used mine 2 x and the only thing i see so far is smaller pores which is a good thing so am giving 4 stars for that right now..I will update later as to  any firming and lifting i might see.</li>
            <li> Sadlty  had to return it  Not right for me</li>
            <li> luv da lift wand price and service thks lorenzo</li>
            <li> Great product and great customer service. Thanks to Exquisite goods for a prompt replacement of a broken wand with cheerful attitude!! And wow even with just a week of using my brown spots are fading and a cystic zit that had been there  and NOTHING helped is now going away.  My lips are fuller too. How is that possible? Who cares it works.  Absolutely worth trying  2 thumbs up all the way !</li>
            <li> I love this, I am 64 and I don&#x27;t expect miracles, but this has so far had visible results. Great</li>
            <li> I have been using it for just over a week now and I love the way my face feels after a treatment.  My skin is more toned and the skin around my eyes has tightened.  A couple of blemishes that I had have cleared right up after treating them.  I am glad that I got this product and would recommend it to anyone.  It beats the expensive creams hands down!</li>
            <li> The manufacturer replaced the broken wand and I use the product every day for 10 minutes and I can see a big change already. Great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to make look 25 again, but I DO see an improvement.</li>
            <li> A joke. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Original review  - The glass probes did not fit properly in the base. They were loose and wobbly because  the metal mechanism that holds them in place was loose. There wasn&#x27;t any way of tightening it. The base may be defective and needs to be replaced. Please let the manufacturer know that this problem could cause the glass probes to break and cause very serious injury. Please let them know that I think the problem should be fixed before someone gets seriously hurt. I would appreciate if the manufacturer would send me a new base. Thank you&lt;br /&gt;9/3/2015 I would like to add some information to my previous review. I have been in contact with the manufacturer and they have kindly agreed to send me a new Lift Wand. My device may have been defective so I am looking forward to receiving my new one shortly.  I like it when a manufacturer stands behind their products. 5 stars</li>
            <li> The wand came quicker than I expected which was great. About two weeks after I got it I had problems with the power output it went from great to barely any output at all, so I contacted amazon and that day Exquisite Goods replied and shipped me a replacement which was great because I really like the device, before I bought the wand I had researched it and Exquisite Goods&#x27; name kept coming up as the company to buy from and I am glad I did, looking forward to getting my replacement.  Thanks soooo much!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the lift wand for about 3 weeks now.  My pores are smaller and my skin looks much better. Has far as tightening and wrinkles its to soon to tell. But I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is everything I hoped it would be. I have been using it for a few weeks and my skin looks so much betteer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this almost daily for 3 weeks and can tell a huge difference....my husband has even noticed.  New lines that have recently appeared were less visible after only one week.  Although I don&#x27;t think it will completely get rid of lines that I&#x27;ve had for a long time, I can say they have improved.  I even use it on the back of my hands from time to time as I think they are beginning to look &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;, with pleasing results.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in my with the first use, it is a great for toning, lymph drainage and skin outbreaks for the price it is the best. I&#x27;m a license cosmetoloist and this tool is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by explaining what this product is because I was a little unsure of what it was I was getting but it had great reviews.&lt;br /&gt; It is a handheld machine that emits electrical frequency that stimulates the skin cells to perk them up.  It has the 4 probes and each of them feel different on the face.  The one with a teardrop shape with a point on the end feels like the energy is more targeted and you can definitely feel it more.  This is the one I have used daily after experimenting with the different probes because I tend to believe that the more you can feel it the more it must be working.  (This may not be the case but IT IS working!)&lt;br /&gt;When you put the probe of your choice into the black bottom part you push it all the way in, you will be able to feel that it is in tightly.  You then turn the knob to a low setting to start and you will see a pinkish red electrical current that glows through the probe, when you touch it on your skin, scalp, hand or whatever part of the skin you are treating, the electrical buzzing sound gets louder and the pink electrical current in the probe gets brighter as it makes the connection with the skin.  It&#x27;s like something out of a sci-fi movie!  At first the noise and overall experience scared me because I was wondering if it was goig to shock me but with the flat probe I could barely feel anything!  I changed to the pointy probe and now use it on the highest setting and YES I can feel it!  Yes, there is slight discomfort.  I used on an ingrown zit, it was stinging a little more than a little but by the next day it was almost gone and within two days it was completely gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It creates ozone, which kills bacteria etc. besides stimulating the skin cells.  You should use a moisturizing oil, argon oil, olive oil, or moisturizing lotion just before you use the wand to help it glide over the face and also to hydrate your face and allow the cells to absorb the moisture more efficiently while they are stimulated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why did I buy this?&lt;br /&gt;I am in my late 30&#x27;s and with the last couple pregnancies I developed skin discoloration, or hyper pigmentation all over my forehead and face that I had been trying skin lighteners to diminish them, after seeing no results I thought I would give this a whirl.  I also have noticed puffy eyes, and saggy eyelids and just dull dry skin.  Overall I was just noticing general stuff that happens when your skin ages and I bought in hopes that it would be like a magical beauty wand.  For me, it kind of is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results I have seen so far.&lt;br /&gt;Dull dry skin looks and feels younger.  It feels more moisturized, with elasticity that I havent had for years, more healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;skin discolorations are fading!  Faster than any lightening cream I&#x27;ve used.  They are not completely gone but there is a noticeable fading.&lt;br /&gt;The overall feel of my skin is beyond belief!  My skin has so much more of the snap back bounce that it use to and it&#x27;s only been about a month since I&#x27;ve been using this.  These results do not happen overnight, it is a gradual improvement but what I have noticed is if you do it daily you get the results if you don&#x27;t, you won&#x27;t.  After 30 days of doing it there is 30 days of improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I feel better about how my skin looks and I have told and showed all my friends and husband this thing.  Even my husband was like, &amp;#34;WHOAHH  this thing is SOOO cool!&amp;#34;  I was like, &amp;#34;I KNEW you would love it!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOOOOVE THIS THING!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not find anything that will give you more promising results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt mask your problems it regenerates your skin from the inside out! IT IS AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are anything like me and are buying all kinds of stuff that isn&#x27;t working, stop wasting your money and spend the money to get this!  You will still need moisturizer or even just olive oil but the cost is literally pennies per day compared to the hundreds of dollars spent month after monthtrying new product that doesn&#x27;t perform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good about this!</li>
            <li> Had it about a month. See no difference so far.NNot giving up use it twice a day around 3 to 4 days a week.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  It is very healing.  I&#x27;m using it tone but also for occasional break-outs.  My skin feels great when I use it.  I have never experienced &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; or any adverse affects even on the highest setting.  It only warms the skin.  One of the electrodes did not function properly.  I contacted the customer service person and was sent a replacement right away.  They were most helpful.  You will not regret your purchase.  This particular unit works very well and does what it says.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I initially had a problem with the product and after posting my disappointment I got a surprise call from a company representative a few days after. After we clear the issue, he was completely pleasant in addressing the issue and providing a solution. After one week of the conversation I received a replacement product, which up to date is working great..&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am editing this from the top of my review but have not removed the initial review below: the company is sending me a new unit so I am upgrading the review to a three star until I get to use the new unit . They believe my unit is faulty. I give the company FIVE stars for trying to make things right.   This following is my original review.:  Don&#x27;t waste your money. I would give this a zero star if I could. I have had this device for over a month and have used it 15 to 20 minutes every day. There has not been one single sign of improvement. Waste of money and time.   I also wanted to say , I emailed the company twice without hearing back . I contacted them because the second day the unit started making a pulsing sound . The first day it had a continuous steady sound. I wondered if it was faulty. I never heard back from them. Also , I had pretty bad headaches for about a week which I rarely get and asked them if there might be a connection. No response . The headaches have stopped so I do not think there is a connection.   I would definitely not recommend this product to a friend. I am so very disappointed .    I am adding some information, after the company read this review, they did email me saying they had responded to my original email. And the sent the original response . However , I did not ever receive said email in my spam or email location. So I do not know what happened there. They did address my questions .    Here is the response:    You should absolutely not get headaches from using the lift wand! How  long do you use the wand on a daily basis and do you use it with any  other ointments or serums? Also do you have any allergic reaction or  illness, this is the first time we had a customer had a reaction to the  wand in the form of headaches. I would recommend you stop use until we  confirm what the issue is.    Also concerning the power output of the wand, is there any broken or  loose pcs inside the wand from the electrode. If not, please try  plugging wand into another power outlet,  faulty outlets will not  powerup the wand correctly.</li>
            <li> I have not had the lift wand very long, not even a month. Enjoyed using it from day one. Had a little bump in the road when one of the metal ends came off from one of the wands. So I emailed lift care with the problem. With in two days it was replaced. The service was outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;I can see the difference in the tone, an glow of my face. Looking forward to other improvements with continued use. My main reason for trying this product is, very baggy lower eyes. Like I have said, I have not had it very long but there is a difference under my eyes. Can&#x27;t wait to see the changes. I am so happy with this Lift Wand, I am now odering two more as gifts.</li>
            <li> I have not had a chance to use the Lift Wand for very long yet so it&#x27;s too soon to report on its effectiveness, but I have my fingers crossed after reading all the other reviews.  It is very easy to use and I enjoy the slight warming effect it has on my skin.  I did have a problem with one of the electrodes breaking but the manufacturer (not the seller) was very kind to offer a replacement.  It&#x27;s nice to know that they stand behind their product and strive to keep their users happy.</li>
            <li> I ordered I his lift wand 2 months and gave it a five star rating however was loving the results I was getting. This morning I could not get the tools in the machine. This comes with 30 money back grant ire . I either need another one or my money thanks joy Hitt</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have wrinkles, acne or any scars but I was curious to get this facial device because it seems functional &amp;amp; I want to get some device to rejuvenate my skin. Also, I don&#x27;t have much time to go to the Beauty spa to have facial that often...don&#x27;t wanna pay much for the professional high frequency treatment outside. This is a bonus that I can do high frequency facial at home by myself! It&#x27;s my first time to use this kind of facial device though. The Lift Wand comes with 4 different electrodes, one is for the entire face &amp;amp; body (mushroom shape/round shape one), One is for under the eye area, One is for target spot area. One is for the hair and scalp. It also comes with the 100% natural &amp;amp; organic Argan oil from Morocco...it can rejuvenate the glow to the face &amp;amp; soften the skin (however, I use my other favorite lotion/serum instead coz it&#x27;s not my favorite scent). I saw some high frequency devices are much cheaper but I believe this device is more powerful coz it has been upgraded to 20W device with improved internals and it should have more powerful treatment. I don&#x27;t feel very safe to get too cheap &amp;amp; use it for my face. At first i felt a little bit scared to see the orange electrodes, but i&#x27;ve read all the instruction and I also researched it before, so I knew how to use it. Surprisingly it was quite comfortable to use &amp;amp; I didn&#x27;t feel any pain at all! (just remember to try low power first!! haha!) I like to use the round shape one for my entire face and the comb for my scalp.  I also used the spoon shaped one for my eyes to eliminate my little dark circles. (I tried to use the smallest one for the eyes area but it was too powerful for me even though I&#x27;ve set it to the lowest power, so I don&#x27;t recommend anyone to use the smallest one but I would suggest to use the spoon shaped for delicate eyes area instead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it a few times after I got this product. It&#x27;s very easy to use &amp;amp; it makes my skin healthier.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to choose this device &amp;amp; I&#x27;ll keep using it for my face to see obvious outcome such as my dark circles area. :)&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;12/11/2015 updated: AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! I just sent them an email regarding the lift wand on/off switch cover is easily to fall off issue and CSR was very responsive and helped me to solve the issue even though i&#x27;ve got the wand a year ago.  I&#x27;m really impressed by their good customer service!!!! hopefully my new replacement wand&#x27;s on/off switch cover will last long!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great professional unit.  So far it works great!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! In one week I already see a difference in my forehead (no more Botox for me) that&#x27;s how great it is!!! My skin looks smooth. I also tried on some stretch marks and they have diminished significantly. Easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t hurt.  I highly recommend!!  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  Very glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with how well the Lift Wand works, so far.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily (at the highest level) for two weeks now, and I&#x27;ve already noticed improvements in the lines and wrinkles around my eyes, neck, forehead, and the overall appearance of my skin is much smoother.  I&#x27;ve had skin tightening treatments before, but I&#x27;m amazed at how this little thing seems to be doing the trick and it costs far less than one skin tightening treatment does at a doctor&#x27;s office, or even through specials on Groupon, etc.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like after a month.  Hey -- I&#x27;ll be 55 in May, so having people think I&#x27;m my 31 year old daughter&#x27;s sister, works for me!</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this product I went for a professional treatment that I had purchased on Groupon.  The reason for this was so that I could ask questions and get information.  One of the things I found out was that I would need a 45 minute treatment at least once a week for approx. 10 weeks before I would see any results.  The cost of these treatments would be up near $900.00 and I definitely did not want to pay $900 so I decided to order the Lift Wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had the wand for about a month but have only been using it for about 3 weeks.  I decided that I would use it daily for 10 to 15 minutes; but that hasn&#x27;t worked out the way I planned.  Some days I use it for 15 minutes and other days I use it for 10 and a couple days a week I don&#x27;t use it at all.  I know that the machine used at the professional treatment is a lot stronger than the Lift Wand but I figure if I can get in at least 50 minutes a week that will be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading other&#x27;s comments about the Argon Oil I decided not to use it.  Instead I have been using Life Extension Skin Restoring Phytoceramides w/ Lipowheat 30 caps.  Instead of taking the tablet orally I just puncture it and apply the oil directly to my face which helps the attachments slide smoothly.  On days that I have more time I use the medium attachment on high and on days I am running short of time I use the smaller attachment on a low level.  It seems to have a more concentrated out put and it is to much for me to use it on high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as results go, I have had no compliments and no one has asked me what I am doing but I feel that it is working gradually.  If nothing else my pores appear to be smaller and my skin is extremely soft.  I think I can see a slight lifting around my jaw line that I am hoping will get even better with time.  I am not expecting miracles and if all this did was to keep my skin in the condition it is in right now over the next 20 years I would be extremely happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said I have only been using the product for about 3 weeks and I don&#x27;t feel that is enough time to write an accurate review.  It is my opinion that the Lift Wand should be used for at least 90 days before making a decision about the product.  So in 90 days I am going to come back and post a more accurate review of my results.  I am hoping the results are as good as I think they will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I do like this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this last week and used it for the first time yesterday. The face wand broke right away. I am trying to find a customer service to call but there is none listed on the web site and there is not contact information on the pamphlet that came with the Lift Wand. How do we contact the company?????</li>
            <li> What a great product.  Quckly after using the product I noticed a visable difference in the texture of my skin.  It appears that facial products are better absorbed by using this product.  I was also impressed by the customer service of the company as they responded to my request to purchase an additional electrode that I had accidentally broken within 24 hours and instead of telling me puchasing details they offered to replace for free.  I hope this company makes more items than just the lift wand.  Reviews of this product is what made me choose it over the dermawand.</li>
            <li> I used this for a few weeks on a lower setting  and haven&#x27;t seen any significant results. So I turned up the dial to a higher frequency and I broke out all over my face. Literally have about 30 pimples and I rarely get one or two.  I don&#x27;t get how they say this helps with acne when it made me look like I was in high school again.  Probably won&#x27;t ever use this now cause I hate having pimples and don&#x27;t want to see people when I do.</li>
            <li> Half my pieces don&#x27;t work!!!! I&#x27;m super upset! Will be returning!</li>
            <li> This lift wand arrived on time and was new and packed well! It runs well but, I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet!</li>
            <li> One use and is already broke, I am returning the lift wand&lt;br /&gt;Lo use una vez y ya se dano, lo voy a devolver</li>
            <li> Had the unit for one month.  Like the results. But, I accidentally broke the &#x27;ear&#x27; glass probes.  Contacted lift-wand.com customer service -  was told I could order a replacement from lift-wand.com/store.  However, that site does not come up for the &#x27;replacement&#x27; probes.  It only comes up for the other products.&lt;br /&gt;I can live without the ear probe.</li>
            <li> I really love the glass wands that come with this product it smoothes out  the crinkles&lt;br /&gt;and give my face a lift!</li>
            <li> This product works as promised. It is too soon to see results but it is easy to use. I bought this unit because of the reviews on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;What appealed to me was it had much higher power and was less expensive than the one advertised on T. V. I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> 2 of the glass wands have broken after a couple of uses and there wasn&#x27;t any oil in the bottle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it fir couple weeks and so far I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> So far I love the product - only been a week but looking forward to seeing the results - then will up this to 5 Stars!  Exquisite Goods is the company to buy from!  I had one issue and they resolved it immediately!  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more at this point!&lt;br /&gt;t</li>
            <li> I had to return this product because; I was not satisfied with the results. It may work for others but did not work for me!</li>
            <li> I wish they would have included more instructions with this.&lt;br /&gt;Most similar product include a DVD.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if it works because I used it for two weeks. It did not come with instructions manual or dvd and after two weeks the unit was having an electrical problem. It turned off spontaneously and I had to wait for almost 30 minutes for it to start again. I send it back and I was fully refunded. I appreciate my buying experience with Amazon, if something goes wrong they are very responsive. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased one of the cheaper ones here just to get an intro. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot of money to find out that it was a gimmick or ineffective. I have to say I noticed some differences, skin tightening, and quality of skin in general has improved. I suffer from sebaceous acne and was hoping this device would help clear some of the scars from previous breakouts (I have my acne under control prior to purchasing this device), and was hoping it would help with sagging skin around my eyes and cheek bones. Do not expect overnight miracles, or any magical results. Over time this device, if used every other day will improve the overall quality of your skin. It will revitalize and improve circulation and makes skin feel a bit tighter. If you have sensitive skin, I would not recommend using the included oil due to possible breakouts. The cheaper one I purchased here on Amazon was a bit higher in intensity, but eventually shorted out. So I&#x27;m not sure if the intensity was a result of the product being defective and led to the demise of that device or if the intensity was intended and of poor quality. I point that out to say that with this device on the highest setting seems somewhat mild in comparison. But again the previous device made some strange noises and literally &amp;#34;popped&amp;#34; when it died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 40 year old male with Native American combination skin, who often is told that I look 35. This could be a result of having oily skin most of my life. I would recommend this product, and would recommend it as part of a healthy skin maintenance program, along with proper exfoliation, moisturizing, and a good sun block. I think it might possibly be a little more effective in keeping and preserving what you naturally have been given, as well as improving the quality of your existing condition of skin, than reversing the damage of life and genetics. Sometimes you just can&#x27;t escape what mom and dad have passed onto you.</li>
            <li> Great entry level option until your ready for the real shock.</li>
            <li> So far I love this product, I haven&#x27;t had a lot of time using it yet , but it seems easy to use and I  intend to use it more in the days ahead!</li>
            <li> One of the wands would not light up.  I shipped the item back for a refund.</li>
            <li> First tool I have got.  Pretty good so far.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that the device works as promised. It firms your skin and clears up blemishes. Well worth the money. Wish I had found this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the Lift Wand.  It really didn&#x27;t do anything and the oil wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I want to tell you that several years ago I Bouvet the derma wand and gave me good results. but unfortunately after 5 years the tip of the glass broke and I started looking on amazon to order it again, but when looking I discovered this new product Lift Wand and I decided to try it because it includes several tools for different parts of the face and body. I bought my new product in June and I&#x27;ve been using it 4 months. what good is that when you buy it, also includes Argan oil has dropped nicely to my skin. I am very happy with the quick results. I am 53 years old and beginning to show on my face the years, but since I use lift my wrinkles have diminished and my friends have told me that my face looks better. I definitely recommend</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:ee4a32f4c8628ebe847cdfb48c658ee9]] The Lift Wand is the most incredible high frequency machine you can get without being a trained professional! I actually happen to be a licensed aesthetician AND certifies laser tech, and this is the best machine of its kind  I have used! It is so effective, it plumps your skin, shrinks pores, and improves circulation and skins elasticity!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Easy to use.  Exquisite Goods has an outstanding customer service.  When one of the wands broke, they sent a replacement immediately free of charge.  Overall I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on Amazon evidently from an unauthorized seller.  The product was defective.  I wrote to the manufacturer directly and they explained that because I did not buy it directly from them, they were not supposed to be liable for the defective device.  However, they were kind enough to help me out and will exchange the product for me, as it could also be a safety issue.  Thank you very much to the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I keep googling is it a LASOR? I&#x27;ve had LASOR treatments and this has many similarities to what I have experienced without being as aggressive. I read the instructions more than once, watch several videos on you tube before trying on my face. I&#x27;m baffled that the information put out about the product is somewhat vague. I spent 15 years with my past career in the cosmetics industry and love to try new anti aging products, in my 50&#x27;s but before putting anything on my face I need to know more, so my purchase was heavily weigh upon reviews such as mine. I want to maximize results so this week I&#x27;m not traveling and I&#x27;m using the wand am/pm several minutes per session. I would like to travel with wand and have contacted company about travel case for the glass probes. I like what I see so far in the few days I&#x27;ve used it. I&#x27;ve always been reluctant about oil on my face because thank god I&#x27;m still combination at my age but I used it according to directions on face and throat because you do need the wand to glide across those areas tried a different product for variety but did not get enough slip and wand keep sticking and it does get warm if not consistently moving. The oil does make my skin feel great and when done with my treatment I follow with a glycolic toner then follow with OZ naturals Vit C serum, awaiting Serum CL which is new. In 4 days my facial skin feels firmer and more refined, impressive or should I say addicted?</li>
            <li> The plug is very low quality and won&#x27;t stay in outlet</li>
            <li> Just okay, not really worth the money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much of a difference yet but one thing I did notice is the oil that it comes with made my face break out so bad I forgot about wrinkles for a week!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes after reading some favorable reviews. I used the device every day for almost a month. Seemed to lose its potency rapidly. I went from low to medium settings (which caused a somewhat strong tingling sensation, indicative of something happening). After a few weeks, I was on highest setting and felt little or nothing. And no noticeable improvement in my complexion. I don&#x27;t think I built up tolerance to that degree so quickly. More likely a defective device.  I wrote to the manufacturer and they said they&#x27;d send a new one. It&#x27;s been a little over a week and haven&#x27;t received anything yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Lift Wand for 3 months and, WOW, what a difference.  My skin is brighter, firmer and more vibrant.  Even my husband, who was a little skeptical in the beginning, has had to admit that my skin looks AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also very pleased with the customer service.  One of my electrodes came apart and I contacted the company and they agreed to send me another one right away.  An amazing product with great customer service, who could ask for anything more?</li>
            <li> Obsessed. I started using it twice a day, now only do it every morning. I haven&#x27;t popped a zit since using it, and others are noticing my complexion. I used to suffer from cystic, painful acne, and the lift wand has delivered more results than anything I&#x27;ve tried in the past. I would recommend again, and again, and again.</li>
            <li> ONE OF THE WANDS BROKE AFTER 4 USES.</li>
            <li> Awesome instantly shrunk my big pores on my nose with just a couple of zaps and helped with caring for pimples</li>
            <li> I had to get a different kind of oil to use with this product (white camellia oil) because the argan oil was too much for my face &amp; made me break out. The product works wonders, however it has no instructions (or at least mine had no instructions) so until I had bought a different wand that basically does the same  thing I wasn&#x27;t using it properly. The smaller tipped applicators are supposed to be used for zapping zits and I haven&#x27;t gotten this particular product to safely use under my eyes as none of the electrodes feel good under my eye even on the lowest settings  (derma wand is gentiler  for under eye usage but the lift wand is too aggressive for it) when my derma wand came with clear instructions, I used this wand similar to the movements I used with the derma wand then it worked much nicer. I am keeping both products because in my opinion the lift wand is great for larger areas and the derma wand is better for smaller areas. Recently I went into visit an aesthetician and was told I have virtually no wrinkles and she also said I look about 9 years younger than I actually am. Lol. Funny cause those wrinkles were definitely there when I first ordered the product (which was about one month ago) I use this product every day twice a day with the derma wand and the white camellia oil is what I think helped the most since it&#x27;s very light and enough just to glide the electrodes across my face. After I do that I put my face cream on. The lines around my mouth are nearly all gone.  Crows feet hardly any there :) I love how this makes the room smell too. Both the derma wand and this product give off a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell if it works.</li>
            <li> It really does what it says it will do, if not more. After the first couple uses my skin had such a nice overall glow, it felt tighter, and thanks to the 100% Argan Oil it healed rapidly.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. See no improvements. Wasted money :(</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS. I am embarrassed that I did so. It does nothing. Useless.&lt;br /&gt;Preys on our desire to look young. If my mistake can save anyone from&lt;br /&gt;being ripped off.ll</li>
            <li> I love my Lift Wand. I have been using it for three weeks and my skin seems smoother and I had less puffiness under my eyes. Sadly my lift wand seem to not work properly. The manufacturer was willing to replace the Lift wand even though it was purchased from an unauthorized seller. I was not aware of that at the time of purchase so other buyers be careful!</li>
            <li> This product is crazy. The plug is male, female and NO ground. Great way to cause serious even fatal injury. Why make a high powered device with no ground? This has to be a knock off.</li>
            <li> For one of my Christmas presents, in 2014, I requested the Lift Wand and happy to say that I got what I requested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had done research on The Lift Wand verses the Dermawand. The Lift Wand is a better buy, has better reviews and to me a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a difference in my skin tone and so have others. I have bags under my eyes and have noticed a change to that. It doesn’t happen quickly, but keep at it and you WILL see a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you run out of the Argon oil that comes with the Lift Wand you can use any other oil of your choice, no need to order more oil from the Lift Wand Company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the instructions would go more in depth on how use the Lift Wand, but I went on-line and read some of the reviews and watched a you tube instruction and got help that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY happy when the results.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this lift wand! My aesthetician recommended it and so glad she did! I have been using it several months and it has helped with my oily skin and get rid of those big cysts I get in my t-zone by killing the bacteria. And as a result has even helped prevent those horrible scars you can get from cysts and bad acne. I also love the fact that it helps diminish my wrinkles. I would recommend anybody wanting clearer, youthful skin use this! I would be lost without it!</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this product from a seller other than Exquisite Goods and it didn&#x27;t work.  I contacted the Lift Care people and discovered the defective Lift Wand was sold by a grey market reseller and that it was not covered under warranty.  The company cautioned against buying their product through any seller other than Exquisite Goods who is an authorized seller.  I was unaware of this type problem but will be more aware in the future-I guess I didn&#x27;t realize this could be an issue ordering through Amazon..  The Lift Care people were very understanding about the problem and helped me find a good resolution.  I haven&#x27;t received my replacement wand so I can&#x27;t comment on how it does or doesn&#x27;t work but I give the company high marks for working with me.</li>
            <li> I was looking at purchasing the dermawand and stumbled upon this product while doing some research. I decided to give it a try and I absolutely love it. I am 45 years old and felt like my skin was starting to sag I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a month and my skin looks radiant and youthful. It is also excellent for blemishes and it makes your skin extremely soft. I ran out of the oil it comes with but I am planning on ordering some more of it because it makes your skin really smooth. For now I am using my personal moisturizer which works well too. This product works great when you use it in the morning I have gotten so many compliments on my skin in the past few weeks. I am currently serving in the US Navy and on deployment so this product is a life saver for me!</li>
            <li> Started 2 weeks ago. So far like it. Seems to make skin firmer.</li>
            <li> I have been using the wand consistently for two weeks and have definitely noticed improvements to my skin.  Large pores have significantly reduced in size and wrinkles have diminished in their appearance.  I am assuming you must be diligent in your use of the wand (I use it at the same time of day for about 15 minutes) with noticeable results.  I am extremely careful when handling the wand to prevent breakage.  I am happy with this purchase and would recommend the Lift Wand.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get the DVD so no instructions how to use or how often.  Feel nothing even at highest level except with the behind the ear probe.&lt;br /&gt;Verdict is out right now as too soon to tell if going to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Have used now for a month.  Started to get bad break outs so stopped using the oil and just use my night cream from R&amp;F.  No more break outs, but also no real difference in skin texture, wrinkles or tone yet either.  Certainly no &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34;  results.  I am going to keep on using it for couple months before I decide yea or nay....</li>
            <li> This has been a great product for me- I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in just a couple of months! the frown line between my eyes has faded completely, and my skin is glowing! I&#x27;m prone to breakouts on my chin and neck. I haven&#x27;t had a single blemish since I&#x27;ve been using this, and all the old acne scars have faded completely. It tingles a bit when you use it, but actually feels pretty invigorating. The argan oil is wonderful too and leaves my skin really soft. No perfumy smell like with other argan oils sometimes have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a head&#x27;s up when you decide to purchase. I did a lot of research on the Lift Wand. I read not only Amazon reviews, but articles from many other resources before I purchased. It seems there are a lot of sellers offering the Lift Wand and there&#x27;s quite the gray market for this particular device. There&#x27;s a lot of stories about nightmare sellers. Purchase ONLY from Exquisite Goods. I had such a fantastic experience with their customer service (they resolved an issue for me in one email)that I would suggest only buying from them anyway.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, please be careful of unauthorized sellers (only Exquisite goods is authorized seller)</li>
            <li> It works slowly to regenerate the skin and tighten it.  Do not expect overnight success, but stick with it.</li>
            <li> This thing is AWESOME!!!! Much like a lot of you, I was skeptical, but I thought, hey if it&#x27;s less the cost of one of my dermatologists treatments, what do I have to loose. After watching some youtube vids, I decided to give it a try. It was a little intimidating at 1st, but after the 1st time that quickly went away. I was concerned about what one user said about her cat...this does not have any effect on my cats. So within the first few days - acne cleared up (and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING from OTC products, antibiotics, home remedies and bamm - always with the bumps, sure that other stuff may have helped a little, but they always returned, under the skin bumps too). The good thing about this after 1 month of use - they acne hasn&#x27;t returned!  After the 1st two weeks, hair is fuller and growing longer (I have baby fine hair and i lost the top crown of my hair in a car accident more than 20 yrs ago, this thing is making it grow back!), and acne scares and hyper pigmentation fading. Oh also, my hair would always feel rough on the ends, split ends are gone! I don&#x27;t use any product in my hair - NONE! I just noticed this past week, my ends felt like they had a fresh cut - but I haven&#x27;t cut my hair in two months. When I run the hair wand through my ends I touch the wand with my hand so that the frequency is getting to the ends - now I don&#x27;t know if that matters - but no split ends after a month and other people I see notice the difference in my hair and skin - that&#x27;s enough proof for me. Now I didn&#x27;t do it every single day...I may have skipped a day or two within the 1st month. It&#x27;s quick, easy to use and easy to care for. Just follow the instructions!!! Don&#x27;t over do it!!! I did that on a spot and it over dried it a bit - but within two days was right back to normal. I can tell that my fine lines are fading and makeup goes on much smoother. Now I&#x27;ve only used this for 1 month and I can&#x27;t wait to see what improvements I get with the upcoming months. Oh in the instructions  - which they should list on their item before you buy it, does say you shouldn&#x27;t use this if you have a pace maker or metal in your mouth. While I don&#x27;t have a pace maker, I do have a metal post bridge and the 1st few times, I could feel it a little, just turn the frequency down, it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Based on the results, the price and the fact that this isn&#x27;t some chemical magic potion that I&#x27;m going to run out of in 60 days, I highly recommend this item.which they should list on their item before you buy it, does say you shouldn&#x27;t use this if you have a pace maker or metal in your mouth.

            <li> I really love this item, it stimulates my face and makes it tingle. I&#x27;ve notice my pores are getting smaller and a few lines have reduced quite a bit. I really don&#x27;t like the oil that comes with this item so I use a heavy cream from Mary Kay that&#x27;s suppose to reduce age spots and fine lines.  Using the Mary Kay cream helps the wand glide over my face much easier.</li>
            <li> Been using this at least once a day on top of my usual skin regimen. It helps heal random pimples I get during my monthly cycle within a couple of days, my pores are noticeably smaller and skin is more supple.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, it&#x27;s been 8 weeks</li>
            <li> I have used it a couple of times a week for about 2 weeks and have not seen any difference on my skin. I have  little wrinkles  around my eyes and slight laugh lines around my mouth. Maybe, one might notice more if she or he has profound wrinkles and uneven skin tones on thier faces.  I need to use it longer and regualry to see if it really does work. Will update later on it more.</li>
            <li> got it from amazon love it buy it not the derma wand lift wand sooo much better</li>
            <li> Some difficultly getting it together&lt;br /&gt;Wands didn&#x27;t go in easily.&lt;br /&gt;Not enough instruction with product on how often an how long you should use ?&lt;br /&gt;Would of liked more information on products use</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I am 60, and have have been using the Lifter for about two months. The pores on my face are smaller, the acne on my chin is cleared up, and the skin on my neck is tighter.</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks, I can really notice a difference . Of course at 65 , they aren&#x27;t gone, but definitely softened. I&#x27;m sure younger women would notice even more of a change.</li>
            <li> No doubt this product is not going to do everything it claims it&#x27;s going to do my scars have already started to diminish and I&#x27;m not even using it consistently. The firmness and tightness I feel each time I use it is incredible I highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> I used the product for about a month and saw no visible results; but, more importantly I have safety concerns about this product.  The plug is not a standard safety plug and does not have the larger left sided prong (both prongs are the same size). No where on the packaging or on the product itself does it say where the product is made. The english grammar in the instruction manual (which is very minimal) is so poorly written it is almost indecipherable. The product is delivering electricity to your skin and the unit crackles and pops.  The bottom line is I just don&#x27;t feel safe in continuing to use this product so I returned it.</li>
            <li> Aside from the fact that Lift Wand leaves your skin glow naturally just like the other reviews stated, I want to emphasize how much they care about customer satisfaction.  Two of the electrodes I received stopped working after 40 days.  I contacted Lift Wand and asked for advice.  They said my order thru Amazon was actually from an unauthorized dealer, and the electrodes were defective to begin with.  However they still agreed to send me new electrodes FREE to keep me as a happy customer.  I was a bit disappointed when two electrodes became defective but Lift Wand quickly restored my loyalty by showing how much they care even for an order from an unauthorized merchant.  Way to go Lift Wand!!!</li>
            <li> One of my wands broke and customer service was great at helping me get a replacement.  I like the product it works very well for what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> Shout out!&lt;br /&gt;I want to take this time to share my great experience using my lift wand. I had been researching for a high frequency wand &amp;#34;since there are so many on the market to choose from.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also a firm believer in personal experience, so I usually turn to read reviews with peoples personal experiences for help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work in a spa but I didn&#x27;t want anything that was as big and bulky as the one at work. Yet I didn&#x27;t want anything that I wouldn&#x27;t benefit from either. So...I  bought this wand based on its excellent reviews and cost . I even read the one star review to see the cons about this product and I&#x27;m so glad I did. This one star review seemed to encounter the one faulty wand. HOWEVER! What caught my attention was their great customer service. This stuck with me! I&#x27;ll tell you why.&lt;br /&gt;It was just my luck...!&lt;br /&gt;After two months of sheer bliss with my new wand and receiving several compliments about my complexion from my peers at work....I ended up breaking one of the larger probes. It came unattached and although it comes with four different probes, I didn&#x27;t have trouble with any of the others,  just the larger probe I used the most. I was so disappointed I wrote the amazon distributor,  but I&#x27;m still waiting to hear back from them just to see if I could replace the probe.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s where I received GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE from the manufacturer who took care of this issue for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what they wrote and did for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;-We are sorry to hear your glass electrode broke, we can replace that for you free of charge.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this is GREAT customer service! Just like they took &amp;#34;great care of the previous one star review.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They now have my loyalty....!&lt;br /&gt;1) because their  product works!&lt;br /&gt;2) great customer care!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now refer my clients to Lift wand, especially when I&#x27;m asked what I&#x27;m doing differently for my 50 year old complexion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you &amp;#34;LiftWand Team!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the great work!</li>
            <li> This definitely works but mine broke after only two months. Shoddy. Get the dermawand instead.</li>
            <li> I use this item daily and I am hopeful to see results increase with continued use.  It is very easy and pleasant to operate.</li>
            <li> I an 66 years old and have been using the lift wand for several months.  I am very happy with the results.  I do not expect to look 40 again but this product definitely has helped my skin.  The biggest problem was the fact that I was getting jowels.  the lift wand has definitely helped.  Not totally gone, but what an improvement.  Many people have said that I look younger now than I did several years ago.  I think I do to.  I would suggest to anyone who would like to firm up their face to give this a try.  Just be patient and use it everyday or as often as possible.  Good results take a little time but it is so worth it.  It feels nice while your doing it to.  Good luck ladies.</li>
            <li> My Lift Wand was delivered in good condition...no broken wands.  I have used the Lift Wand daily for 1 1/2 months. I have definitely noticed an improved texture and plumpness to my skin, and the crepey skin under my eyes is looking much better.  It has given my skin a radiance that it has not had for a long time.  I plan on continuing to use the Lift Wand and am excited to see how much more improvement I will continue to see.  Good product for an a great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product twice and I can see a visible difference in how &amp;#34;refreshed&amp;#34; my skin looks. I have trouble sleeping and my skin normally looks washed out. Today even though I&#x27;m tired and exhausted my skin looks awake. I can&#x27;t wait to see what an extended period of time will do for my skin. The customer service is prompt and accomodating. I&#x27;d recommend  this product to anyone who wants to instill changes in their skin without high costs of dermatological visits.</li>
            <li> nice product, not magic, but I enjoy using it as a treat to my skin when I have time to pamper myself.</li>
            <li> Loved it but did break, planning in getting another</li>
            <li> I really like it, I have only had it for about a month and I can see some improved it, but I only used once every other day.</li>
            <li> I started using the Lift Wand on 12/6/14, waited to write a review because new skin cells change every 90 or so days and felt 30 days use wasn&#x27;t long enough for a honest review. This is without a doubt the best money I ever spent! I had looked at the Derma Wand first and decided against it, Lift Wand better price, extra attachments, positive reviews but we know how reviews go! I&#x27;m a older woman and noticed a thinning upper lip, bagging around my eyes and some jowl dropping that made me look older than I felt. I used the Argon oil that was supplied, first it&#x27;s expensive, second after 5 weeks of use I noticed my skin was drying out, the oil doesn&#x27;t absorb into your skin that well. I started using Jergens Skin Firming Lotion and added a few drops of the argon oil to that before applying to my face, works perfect. You need the oil to glide the wands over your face, I use the wand twice a day morning &amp; night after 3 months of use I clearly can see my pores are much smaller, under eye much less puffy, jowl line disappearing, neck firm and smooth, lips getting a little fuller. I&#x27;m thrilled! Don&#x27;t expect a quick fix, this takes time and patience for the results you want but well worth the wait, for a younger person not really showing the signs of age yet is perfect for maintaining a youthful appearance. I wish I bought this years ago! One major factor is to take the wand and slide it over the area your concerned with but to then slide it to the side of your face and down to the lymphiods to drain the cells. The wand doesn&#x27;t hurt but if your really sensitive you can break the current by touching the end of the wand with your finger before putting it on your face this breaks the current.  Argon oil is expensive if you go to Swanson Vitamins and search their site the oil it&#x27;s much cheaper. The oil is organic and certified which is what you need to look for real argon oil. I started using the hair wand and am already seeing positive results, I totally love this product it is amazing, you won&#x27;t be disappointed if you stick with it and don&#x27;t expect a overnight miracle you will see awesome results!!azing, you won&#x27;t be disappointed if you stick with it and don&#x27;t expect a overnight miracle you will see awesome results!!</li>
            <li> Tore up after one week. But sent it back for refund.</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars both for its performance and for customer service. I accidentally broke one of the glass wands the first time I used the device, and when I e-mailed the company to tell them what had happened, they promptly agreed to send me another wand free of charge since it was my first time using the device and I had probably not gotten the attachment set securely enough in the handle. I was very impressed! I can also say that the product is clearly one of excellent quality. I would just recommend not using the device over a tile floor since the chances are good that the glass wands will break on the hard surface if they are not securely inserted.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister in law. My wife has one as well. They both love it. Easy to use and they get good results fast!</li>
            <li> I really like the product. But in 3 weeks I have not noticed any difference yet and I faithfully use the liftwand everyday.</li>
