            <li>A lovely feminine scent.</li>
            <li>I like scents with more citrus/wood notes and this fits that well.</li>
            <li>I bought this because another reviewer compared it to my favorite perfume, Maybe Baby by Benefit.</li>
            <li>Bottle design is cute.</li>
            <li>What more do you want?</li>

            <li>I love this scent and have been using it for years now.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance and it has been discontinued</li>

            <li>I love this perfume</li>

            <li>Wonderful price for the smaller bottle!!</li>
            <li>perfume I purchased from the seller was authentic.</li>
            <li>My favorite for years.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I ordered two and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this perfume, I&#x27;m glad to have found it here on Amazon</li>
            <li>Love Gwen Stefani, and love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>smells so good and was very reasonably priced</li>
            <li>The first time I wore it a stranger literally followed me around for 20 minutes telling me how good I smelled.  </li>
            <li>I loved this when I first encountered it five years ago</li>
            <li>smell clean sexy must have.....</li>
            <li>Clean and refreshing....</li>
            <li>I was so happy I was able to find it again here and the package came fast and with lots of extra freebies, which I LOVE!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and clean, refreshing.</li>
            <li>Just love the smell and was so quick and easy to get.</li>
            <li>A new favorite for sure!</li>
            <li>Such a great scent...</li>
            <li>This perfume smells fantastic, and every time I wear it</li>
            <li>But I loved that perfume back then, and I love this now, so I am giving it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just so much more soapy-smelling, sweet, mild...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I will still be cautious buying perfume but way more comfortable if it is from this exact company.</li>
            <li>This was my favorite perfume when it first came out</li>
            <li>it is clean and unique.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on the fragrance and the price is very affordable.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and authentic product</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell much floral, more fruity?</li>
            <li>I spray it on my sheets occasionally, and my bed smells wonderful for hours and hours, sometimes even the next morning I can smell it on my pillows.  </li>
            <li>say enough how much I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It smelled exactly like the one I bought in stores!  </li>
            <li>Great everyday wear.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>would describe this scent as citrus with a tiny hint of warm and woodsy.</li>
            <li>Just the right about of &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;, not too fruity &amp; not too floral.</li>
            <li>I love it, it&#x27;s such a sweet smelling sensation.</li>
            <li>I was beyond happy with the product and it smelled and looked exactly like the ones I usually bought from retail stores.</li>
            <li>Everything was sealed up and shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy it again, but I&#x27;m not sorry that I bought it once ...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last all day but it does most of the day.</li>
            <li>First off, it smells almost exactly like Benefit&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not into all the hoity toity top note, mid note etc.</li>
            <li>This has been my go-to fragrance since Gwen Stefani&#x27;s perfume first came out about 7 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s happy, doesn&#x27;t seem to take itself seriously.</li>
            <li>This fragrance isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it&#x27;s not my least favorite either ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s floral/fruity, but not too floral or old lady floral and has a more masculine undertone to it.  </li>
            <li>So fresh and so clean, I&#x27;ve always been a big fan.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong when it&#x27;s initially applied, but wears well throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Price is very reasonable, particularly for perfume.</li>
            <li>Thank You for having at a reasonable purchase price</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>Smelt very spoiled when I got it</li>
            <li>Hours later, I can still smell it on myself, which is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very brownish-bronzy, not feminine at all.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>Maybe Baby, but a little better.  </li>
            <li>This was one of my favorite perfumes a few years ago.</li>
            <li>I love that I can still order it online, as it&#x27;s no longer in the stores, and for a lot less!  </li>
            <li>Also worthy of 5 stars - it STAYS with you for a long time.  </li>
            <li>and now I have a new bottle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think  I can live without this perfume.</li>
            <li>im pleased, plus i order just the perfume and got a gift set in stead which i don&#x27;t mind at all, and other samples and coupons from fragrance net ,</li>
            <li>so I was ecstatic to find it at such a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>This bottle smells old!</li>
            <li>the scent is a little strong</li>
            <li>It makes me kind of sad, because the bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li>The price is a little high, but so worth it!</li>
            <li>I was really surprised by this perfume.  </li>
            <li>Surprised it was discontinued.</li>
            <li>Kinda old ladyish.</li>
            <li>It smelled exactly the same as my last bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice big bottle too, and wasn&#x27;t terribly expensive.  </li>
            <li>It is less expensive and still a good perfume</li>
    </ol>

            <li> it is clean and unique.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on the fragrance and the price is very affordable.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and authentic product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell much floral, more fruity?</li>
            <li> I spray it on my sheets occasionally, and my bed smells wonderful for hours and hours, sometimes even the next morning I can smell it on my pillows.  </li>
            <li> say enough how much I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It smelled exactly like the one I bought in stores!  </li>
            <li> Great everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> would describe this scent as citrus with a tiny hint of warm and woodsy.</li>
            <li> Just the right about of &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;, not too fruity &amp; not too floral.</li>
            <li> I love it, it&#x27;s such a sweet smelling sensation.</li>
            <li> I was beyond happy with the product and it smelled and looked exactly like the ones I usually bought from retail stores.</li>
            <li> Everything was sealed up and shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t buy it again, but I&#x27;m not sorry that I bought it once ...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last all day but it does most of the day.</li>
            <li> First off, it smells almost exactly like Benefit&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into all the hoity toity top note, mid note etc.</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to fragrance since Gwen Stefani&#x27;s perfume first came out about 7 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s happy, doesn&#x27;t seem to take itself seriously.</li>
            <li> This fragrance isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it&#x27;s not my least favorite either ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s floral/fruity, but not too floral or old lady floral and has a more masculine undertone to it.  </li>
            <li> So fresh and so clean, I&#x27;ve always been a big fan.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong when it&#x27;s initially applied, but wears well throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Price is very reasonable, particularly for perfume.</li>
            <li> Thank You for having at a reasonable purchase price</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> Smelt very spoiled when I got it</li>
            <li> Hours later, I can still smell it on myself, which is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very brownish-bronzy, not feminine at all.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> Maybe Baby, but a little better.  </li>
            <li> This was one of my favorite perfumes a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I love that I can still order it online, as it&#x27;s no longer in the stores, and for a lot less!  </li>
            <li> Also worthy of 5 stars - it STAYS with you for a long time.  </li>
            <li> and now I have a new bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think  I can live without this perfume.</li>
            <li> im pleased, plus i order just the perfume and got a gift set in stead which i don&#x27;t mind at all, and other samples and coupons from fragrance net ,</li>
            <li> so I was ecstatic to find it at such a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> This bottle smells old!</li>
            <li> the scent is a little strong</li>
            <li> It makes me kind of sad, because the bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li> The price is a little high, but so worth it!</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by this perfume.  </li>
            <li> Surprised it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> Kinda old ladyish.</li>
            <li> It smelled exactly the same as my last bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice big bottle too, and wasn&#x27;t terribly expensive.  </li>
            <li> It is less expensive and still a good perfume</li>
            <li> Very similar to Bobbi Browns Beach fragrance which does not last very long.</li>
            <li> it reminded me of White Shoulders - a perfume from a long time ago that one of my mother&#x27;s friends wore.  </li>
            <li> I really had a hard time looking for this product.</li>
            <li> The scent is beachy and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for a few years and it never gets old.</li>
            <li> it had to go back the other day ,</li>
            <li> While this perfume is reminiscent of Maybe Baby, it has an edge to the scent, where Maybe Baby is soft and subtle.</li>
            <li> Order came just as I expected.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t what I would have expected from Gwen Stefani.  </li>
            <li> The perfume smelled as expected.</li>
            <li> wish they use ups or fedex, but other than that</li>
            <li> Purchased on a whim due to reviews.  </li>
            <li> This is an awsome light scented perfume, it&#x27;s to bad</li>
            <li> and I have even had companies take down my reviews if I gave them 2-3 stars.</li>
            <li> I always need stalk and am forever hunting this down.</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars, because this is not an everyday scent for me.</li>
            <li> and I can usually still smell it on pulse points when I get home.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to spray</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find this mixture as it tends to be on the musky side, which I also don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding the perfume in stores in my area.  </li>
            <li> On me it smelled like hairspray, weird alcohol-like notes and all.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of buying online</li>
            <li> This was a gift for someone who was very difficult to shop for.</li>
            <li> Some may see that as a bad thing, but I don&#x27;t mind a perfume fading by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to change perfumes every couple of years, but this one is still on my countertop as my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> Love the smell however the spray nozzle sticks so it&#x27;s hard to spray Gwen u have lots of money get a better spray bottle it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> This fragrance isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it&#x27;s not my least favorite either ... so I&#x27;d say it is O.K. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again, but I&#x27;m not sorry that I bought it once ... if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> smells so good and was very reasonably priced</li>
            <li> I love this scent but can&#x27;t find it in most stores...it&#x27;s not that popular but still one of my favorites. Such a great scent...so underrated</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful floral scent.  I get nothing but compliments on it, and it seems to be a big hit with the males.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. ..it is clean and unique.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume since 2007 I wear it a lot and keep running out of it everyone Always asks me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing since it does linger all day, it&#x27;s a bit musky, and floral the scent is a little strong but it&#x27;s not overpowering where you get headaches it&#x27;s just perfect!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite scent. Clean and refreshing....plus the company is great</li>
            <li> I always need stalk and am forever hunting this down. I get stopped and everyone associates it with me.&lt;br /&gt;The bottles often have spray issues but I always manage. I love love love LAMB</li>
            <li> Oh, I have been hooked on this perfume since it came out. It smells amazing. Just the right about of &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;, not too fruity &amp; not too floral. It&#x27;s hard to find this mixture as it tends to be on the musky side, which I also don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t say enough how much I love this stuff! lol</li>
            <li> Great price, love this perfume</li>
            <li> love it!! it smells great and the bottle is so cute</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!! Not as musky as I&#x27;d thought it would be--which is great!! Surprisingly light! A new favorite for sure!</li>
            <li> I really had a hard time looking for this product. This was a gift for someone who was very difficult to shop for. My friend lives in the Netherlands and was on a vacation to the USA and I wanted to get her this parfum only none of the stores carried it. All the shopping malls I had visited were either out of this or no longer restocking. Amazon came through in record time.</li>
            <li> Not for me! Not for me at all! On me it smelled like hairspray, weird alcohol-like notes and all. This was a perfume I had to wash off. Nope, nope, nope. It makes me kind of sad, because the bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li> Got it as a gift for my friend because she Said that she couldn&#x27;t find that perfume anymore. She loved it!</li>
            <li> My daughter loved her perfume she loves the scent I hope they never stop making it.  Thank You for having at a reasonable purchase price</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite perfume forever. I was skeptical of buying online but it&#x27;s the real deal. Everything was sealed up and shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> Has been my go-to parfum for many years. Great everyday wear. It doesn&#x27;t last all day but it does most of the day. It&#x27;s light and clean, refreshing.</li>
            <li> This was one of my favorite perfumes a few years ago. I was so happy to find it on Amazon as it is no longer sold in stores. Smells just as great as I remember &amp; for a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite perfume!  So happy I have it again.</li>
            <li> Love, love this perfume!!! And a excellent price!!!</li>
            <li> Order came just as I expected. I was very pleased with my order.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by this perfume.  First off, it smells almost exactly like Benefit&#x27;s Maybe Baby, but a little better.  It&#x27;s floral/fruity, but not too floral or old lady floral and has a more masculine undertone to it.  I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it.  The first time I wore it a stranger literally followed me around for 20 minutes telling me how good I smelled.  It also doesn&#x27;t have that alcohol smell so popular in many cheaper perfumes.  Surprised it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> Love it and will continue to order this product</li>
            <li> A lovely feminine scent. I loved this when I first encountered it five years ago and I still do.  Staying power.</li>
            <li> Smelt very spoiled when I got it</li>
            <li> This is an awsome light scented perfume, it&#x27;s to bad they discontinued it!😊</li>
            <li> I love it, it&#x27;s such a sweet smelling sensation.</li>
            <li> Great scent. I like scents with more citrus/wood notes and this fits that well. It is still feminine and it lasts all day! I work 12 hour days and I can usually still smell it on pulse points when I get home. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this because another reviewer compared it to my favorite perfume, Maybe Baby by Benefit. While this perfume is reminiscent of Maybe Baby, it has an edge to the scent, where Maybe Baby is soft and subtle. It is less expensive and still a good perfume but I will go back to my Maybe Baby.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding the perfume in stores in my area.  Great scent, so happy to have it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this perfume anymore and now I have a new bottle. Just love the smell and was so quick and easy to get.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t what I would have expected from Gwen Stefani.  I don&#x27;t know why.  It&#x27;s just so much more soapy-smelling, sweet, mild... it reminded me of White Shoulders - a perfume from a long time ago that one of my mother&#x27;s friends wore.  But I loved that perfume back then, and I love this now, so I am giving it 5 stars.  Also worthy of 5 stars - it STAYS with you for a long time.  Hours later, I can still smell it on myself, which is fabulous.  It&#x27;s a nice big bottle too, and wasn&#x27;t terribly expensive.  I spray it on my sheets occasionally, and my bed smells wonderful for hours and hours, sometimes even the next morning I can smell it on my pillows.  I agree with one reviewer who said the bottle is kind of masculine-looking.  It&#x27;s very brownish-bronzy, not feminine at all.  But the perfume is very good; I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This perfume has the most wonderful smell.  I can&#x27;t get enough of it!  The price is a little high, but so worth it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great price! I&#x27;ve this perfume for a while and as always the body cream is eternal so I decide to get just this. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it! Will be ordering more soon!</li>
            <li> DIdn&#x27;t like the scent. Kinda old ladyish.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the service and item!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a light, pleasant fragrance. I&#x27;m not into all the hoity toity top note, mid note etc. way of reviewing. Instead, I rate a fragrance on several things. 1, does it make me nauseous? Nope, no nausea at all. 2, does it give me a headache? No headache here. 3, Do I feel I&#x27;m being smothered by poisonous gases? Again, no. Family and friends like it, I like it. It&#x27;s happy, doesn&#x27;t seem to take itself seriously. Bottle design is cute. What more do you want?</li>
            <li> best perfume iv&#x27;e ever orderd&lt;br /&gt;best quality</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this perfume! It&#x27;s amazing. If I can still find it I will buy it again. I bought two bottles and my best friend smelled it and was like OMG...I need this! Good thing I got two! This was my favorite perfume when it first came out and they no longer sell it in stores so I was thrilled when I found it here.</li>
            <li> Love this scent, and love L.A.M.B. This value is awesome, and the seller is super prompt. I&#x27;m very happy with this order and product. (:&lt;br /&gt;I would describe this scent as citrus with a tiny hint of warm and woodsy. It&#x27;s a very fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loved it!!! Amazon is a life saver once again!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! It&#x27;s fresh and delightful.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and have been using it for years now. Finding it on Amazon at such a good price was great!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this fragrance.  I get so many compliments and it lasts all day.  I&#x27;ve been wearing this for a few years and it never gets old.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast. The perfume smelled as expected. I was happy with the product I received. This is my second time purchasing this scent. So, as far as the scent is concerned, I think it&#x27;s beautiful and is perfect for all seasons. It&#x27;s strong when it&#x27;s initially applied, but wears well throughout the day. I gave 4 stars, because this is not an everyday scent for me. However, it&#x27;s a scent to keep in rotation that will get you compliments.</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to fragrance since Gwen Stefani&#x27;s perfume first came out about 7 years ago.  I love that I can still order it online, as it&#x27;s no longer in the stores, and for a lot less!  This perfume smells fantastic, and every time I wear it someone asks what perfume I&#x27;m wearing because they like it, too...</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and it has been discontinued so I was ecstatic to find it at such a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Arrived before the estimated date :). Happy camper</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for! This bottle smells old!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume it was amazing!  It smelled exactly like the one I bought in stores!  I love this smell</li>
            <li> Wonderful price for the smaller bottle!! Love the smell!!</li>
            <li> This is the most beautiful smell ever. So fresh and so clean, I&#x27;ve always been a big fan. I was so happy I was able to find it again here and the package came fast and with lots of extra freebies, which I LOVE! i will never order perfume anywhere else again. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this perfume on Amazon since it has been discontinued and is no longer for sale in department stores.&lt;br /&gt;The perfume I purchased from the seller was authentic. It smelled exactly the same as my last bottle. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances - its so unfortunate that it is being discontinued - so if you like it, stock up on it now while its still around</li>
            <li> My favorite for years.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume. I ordered two and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this perfume, I&#x27;m glad to have found it here on Amazon</li>
            <li> great perfume would buy it again</li>
            <li> Purchased on a whim due to reviews.  My wife loves it and is very happy with the product. If my wife is happy with it I am happy.  Price is very reasonable, particularly for perfume.</li>
            <li> I wish this was still sold in the stores but I was able to find online for a excellent price. I don&#x27;t think  I can live without this perfume.</li>
            <li> Love Gwen Stefani, and love this perfume.  I would tell you what it smells like, but it changes on me throughout the day.  I don&#x27;t smell much floral, more fruity? It is a lighter smelling perfume, and it doesn&#x27;t linger.  Some may see that as a bad thing, but I don&#x27;t mind a perfume fading by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to change perfumes every couple of years, but this one is still on my countertop as my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; fragrance.  I hope it is never discontinued.</li>
