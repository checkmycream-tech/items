            <li>Yes it smells ok</li>
            <li>I have loved this smell since the first day i walked into the store but could never see my  self paying $75 for the in store bottle.</li>
            <li>This was a good price for how much cologne you get, and there is a review that says that it isn&#x27;t so cal cologne</li>
            <li>Loved by I thought that the bottle will be bigger, any way the fragrance is great and fresh, not too strong</li>
            <li>So happy I am able to get this item in such a quick delivery time at such a great price!</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for making it so easy to find products we value</li>
            <li>The best way to discribe it is a warm, coconut scent mixed with original scent old spice.</li>
            <li>Overall, I say this is a great price.</li>
            <li>WHEN I SMELLED IT FILLED THE ROOM.</li>

            <li>Great price and exact same thing.</li>
            <li>Defenetly worth the money n</li>
            <li>The seller is a small vender and was very, very nice.</li>

            <li>but it&#x27;s not the real cologne.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what you would buy in store but the price was a little better.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would say negitive about this is it is unboxed, but that really doesn&#x27;t effect much unless it&#x27;s a gift.</li>
            <li>My 15 year old grandson loves this cologne.  </li>
            <li>Being able to purchase and receive this product overseas where it is not available give me the luxury of being back home in the States!  </li>

            <li> My gilfreind&#x27;s favorite</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cologne!  It is the men&#x27;s scent but I am actually wearing it. lol  And the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.  Purchased the larger bottle for the same price as the smaller bottle in the store.</li>
            <li> My 17 year old son loves this cologne!!!!</li>
            <li> If you have never had a chance to smell this scent in store; I must say it&#x27;s an amazing summer smell. The best way to discribe it is a warm, coconut scent mixed with original scent old spice. It can be strong, and typically lasts 4-5 hours, so use moderately. This is NOT a knock-off, it&#x27;s the real deal. (this coming from a person who use to buy it in-store). The seller is a small vender and was very, very nice. After a mix up in the sending address, he offered to drive 45 minutes just to drop it off to me! I say that&#x27;s good service. The only thing I would say negitive about this is it is unboxed, but that really doesn&#x27;t effect much unless it&#x27;s a gift. Overall, I say this is a great price. It&#x27;ll save you at least 20$ if you were to buy in store.</li>
