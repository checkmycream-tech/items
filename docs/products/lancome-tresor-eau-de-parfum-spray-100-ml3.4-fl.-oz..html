            <li>Great price and awesome parfum!</li>
            <li>Great stuff have used it for years</li>
            <li>I was worried I would miss the Baby Phat as it was my favorite fragrance when I found it.</li>
            <li>This is the sexiest, most feminine, intoxicating fragrance I have come across since Obsession, and I can&#x27;t use that since my sister already does.</li>
            <li>On top of it they will not accept returns.  </li>
            <li>Actually the company should be buyng this for me just because of the built -in vulnerability of the bottle no matter how attractive it may be.</li>
            <li>DO NOT OLRDER UNLESS YOU&#x27;RE LOOKING FOR A KNOCK OFF VERSION OF THE REAL TRESOR.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing the real Tresor by Lancôme for over 10 years</li>
            <li>The latest purchase was necessitated by the breakage the previous purchase.  </li>
            <li>I normally spray Tresor in the early morning around 7am and the fragrance is still there when I get ready for bed.  </li>

            <li> Looks not good, It looks like made in China not France, box was damaged, it rattles.</li>
            <li> The spelling is wrong on the box &amp;#34;TrésorL&#x27;eau De Parfum&amp;#34; although it says made in Paris France.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all FAKE, FAKE, FAKE!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A FAKE!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great stuff have used it for years</li>
            <li> Product as described. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I had just purchased a bottle of Baby Phat perfume when I stumbled upon this fragrance. It took over a year to use that perfume before I ordered Tresor. I was worried I would miss the Baby Phat as it was my favorite fragrance when I found it. Baby who? This is the sexiest, most feminine, intoxicating fragrance I have come across since Obsession, and I can&#x27;t use that since my sister already does. People constantly ask me what I am wearing when I am out.</li>
            <li> Looks not good, It looks like made in China not France, box was damaged, it rattles. Hopefully it is still perfume, my wife will tell me later, when she&#x27;ll open it for her birthday ...</li>
            <li> The perfume package was open when we opened the brown box.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A FAKE! DO NOT OLRDER UNLESS YOU&#x27;RE LOOKING FOR A KNOCK OFF VERSION OF THE REAL TRESOR.  I sprayed the scent on my arm and it lasted less than 2 minutes.  I&#x27;ve been wearing the real Tresor by Lancôme for over 10 years and I have never had a fragrance fade on my skin after use.  I normally spray Tresor in the early morning around 7am and the fragrance is still there when I get ready for bed.  This product didn&#x27;t last after I test prayed on my arm after opening the box.  Buyer be ware. Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you.  The spelling is wrong on the box &amp;#34;TrésorL&#x27;eau De Parfum&amp;#34; although it says made in Paris France. It&#x27;s all FAKE, FAKE, FAKE! On top of it they will not accept returns.  I&#x27;m contacting Amazon customer service for assistance.</li>
            <li> Great price and awesome parfum!</li>
            <li> Excellent my wife love,s it</li>
            <li> It was a gift and My Mother was very happy.</li>
            <li> It is the only perfume my wife buys.  The latest purchase was necessitated by the breakage the previous purchase.  Notice the shape of the bottle which has built in instability.  Actually the company should be buyng this for me just because of the built -in vulnerability of the bottle no matter how attractive it may be.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Best scent EVER&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;!!!</li>
