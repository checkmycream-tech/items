            <li>Perfect for my 30 something skin!</li>
            <li>the best cleanser I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>the best part is that this company do not test her products on animals which is great.</li>
            <li>Great for all skin types.</li>
            <li>This is a great product......</li>
            <li>I was dedicated to finding the perfect pregnancy safe product</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I then tried the honey cleansing method after hearing amazing things about it</li>
            <li>This cleanser also works as a gentle exfoiliator, especially great for the summer.  </li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love.</li>
            <li>I could wear strapless shirts again :)  </li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial cleanser on the market.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I was having trouble finding it and was so happy that I was able to find it on Amazon.com at a really good price!  </li>
            <li>So gentle yet amazing results!  </li>
            <li>and I get an even better clean that trying to splash off a cleanser in the sink.</li>
            <li>Fortunately a friend gave me a jar of Basq&#x27;s cleanser</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>It is a must have tool to clean your skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean the skin thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to it now, and it&#x27;s actually not so bad.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>My husband and I are trying to get pregnant</li>
            <li>It helps TREMENDOUSLY, however, I can&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
            <li>The creamy texture with light micro exfoliators is very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>So after learning about more natural ways to clean my face I decided to try the oil cleansing method.  </li>
            <li>I tried this and didn&#x27;t have amazing results initially.</li>
            <li>I initially loved this cleanser because it seemed to soak into my skin and left it really moisturized.</li>
            <li>I will buy more when I run out because it improves the texture of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>And yes, I like it better than that old salicylic acid scrub.</li>
            <li>I started using it during my first trimester when I was super sensitive to smells, and I have to say I don&#x27;t love the scent.</li>
            <li>I started using it when I was pregnant with my first baby.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since I became pregnant with my first child.</li>
            <li>I started using this in 2012 when I was pregnant with my first child.</li>
            <li>It works much better and costs only $6.</li>
            <li>I love that it takes away makeup and dirt and moisturizes at the same time.</li>
            <li>I love Basq facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I used it though my first pregnancy and kept using it</li>
            <li>So, I just use a face wash gel/soap from Simple which seems to be ok on my days</li>
            <li>I wanted to clean my face while preventing wrinkles naturally.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, just some Bare Minerals light foundation and powder.</li>
            <li>never used such a good facial cleaner, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses it.  </li>
            <li>I think for my skin it was to emolient and it might have been better for someone with dry or normal</li>
            <li>It is the only soap that keeps my face looking well when I&#x27;m pregnant.</li>
            <li>I have been suffering with black/white heads since my teen years, I bought this product when I got pregnant and it helped a lot</li>
            <li>At this price I definitely don&#x27;t think it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to know there is a cleanser that will soothe and cleanse my sensitive and unpredictable skin.</li>
            <li>and now that I&#x27;m pregnant again I&#x27;m still using it and plan to for a long time.</li>
            <li>It started to make my face feel very sensitive.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle for my sensitive skin especially during pregnancy.</li>
            <li>My skin is clear now and I will reorder the derma-e very clear cleanser and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Anyways, this stuff smelled a little funny to me the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I have never had this clear of skin in my life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve continued to use and my skin is always clear.</li>
            <li>I have oily sensitive skin with hormonal breakouts.</li>
            <li>I started using this during my pregnancy because of acne issues, and it completely cleared up my skin.</li>
            <li>(My skin is too sensitive for a wash cloth etc.)</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this cleanser does the trick.</li>
            <li>I also use the eucerin q10 anti wrinkle sensitive skin cream to moisturize.</li>
            <li>It really exfoliates well, which is why I can&#x27;t use it daily or twice a day like the directions state.</li>
            <li>If my skins starts to look rough with pimples/blackheads and dead skin, I use this, and I look nice and glowy again.</li>
            <li>It would be super greasy and dry &amp; flaky all at the same time.</li>
            <li>was purging until it I got small bumps all over my face with two or more bigger ones under the skin.</li>
            <li>it contains small rub materials and can clean face very clearly.</li>
            <li>Plus in the shower it&#x27;s easy to use a little on my neck, back, chest, etc.</li>
            <li>I noticed that if I forgot to use it I would definitely pay the price in new blemishes, but it didn&#x27;t seem to clear the existing blemishes.</li>
            <li>I went back to using Cetaphil for normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates and cleanses just enough, never making skin tight or itchy (which is a huge problem for me).  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this product (I used it not only on my face but on my shoulders, back, and chest as well)!!!</li>
            <li>I tried bp, fresh lemons,  raw acv, bentonite clay,  honey and cinnamon mask.  </li>
            <li>Although I outgrew these problems as an adult, they seemed to be coming back with a vengeance after having my second daughter and the glow of pregnancy wore off.  </li>
            <li>I first used the Rebalancing Facial Cleanser after having my second child and hormones were making my skin very unpredictable.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and a half and my skin is clear except for 2 almost healed pimples.</li>
            <li> I use now the derma-e very clear which doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals or harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that only breaks out a couple small pimples during my cycle.  </li>
            <li> I think I will continue to use it for a long time after pregnancy,</li>
            <li> as i received it ,some cream leaked out, like used item, not new.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, actually keeps my skin slightly moisturized (if I forget to use mine).</li>
            <li> My skin already seems to be improving, and no new zits!</li>
            <li> During my pregnancy I suffered from pregnancy acne and was very limited on the products I could use on my skin, when I started using this product I immediately noticed a change and reduction of the acne, after a month using it</li>
            <li> Try it once and you will never use any other product.</li>
            <li> This was the only product that got rid of all the small bumps.  </li>
            <li> I now use it even when not pregnant.</li>
            <li> I think it not suitable for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am now in the process of weaning my 1-year-old from nursing and am already in the throes of another round of hormonal upheaval.  </li>
            <li> I grew up with terrible eczema and very sensitive skin, unable to use many make-up and skin care products.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been pregnant, my skin has been truly awful: dry and flaky, with every sort of blemish imaginable, and the newest addition is a series of cysts.</li>
            <li> Incredibly painful, but also really embarrassing.</li>
            <li> About two weeks into using it I started getting small pimples all over my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li> A small difference</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this cleanser but have been disappointed.</li>
            <li> My skin looked HORRIBLE after I got pregnant.</li>
            <li> After two months of horrible skin I ordered and received this cleanser and noticed a difference even after the first night.  </li>
            <li> Well after two weeks my face broke out worse than ever before.  </li>
            <li> I have a loooong history of horrible skin and acne and had been using a facial scrub with salicylic acid for acne.</li>
            <li> I also find the fragrance to be very unappealing.</li>
            <li> i&#x27; m really disappointed on this one.</li>
            <li> and I figured I was in for 9+ months of horrible skin.</li>
            <li> and it was horrible not knowing how to fix it.  </li>

            <li> I have oily sensitive skin with hormonal breakouts. I initially loved this cleanser because it seemed to soak into my skin and left it really moisturized. About two weeks into using it I started getting small pimples all over my cheeks and chin. I used it for another 2 weeks and decided to stop because the pimples were now getting bigger. I think for my skin it was to emolient and it might have been better for someone with dry or normal skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps. I use now the derma-e very clear which doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals or harsh ingredients. My skin is clear now and I will reorder the derma-e very clear cleanser and moisturizer. Oh and I bought the clairsonic mia brush. It is a must have tool to clean your skin. I think every woman should have one.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! Not oily not drying! Perfect for my 30 something skin! So gentle yet amazing results!  Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this cleanser but have been disappointed. It doesn&#x27;t clean the skin thoroughly. After washing my face I used my toner and noticed that there was makeup on the cotton ball - meaning the cleanser didn&#x27;t even remove my makeup. And I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, just some Bare Minerals light foundation and powder. I also find the fragrance to be very unappealing. At this price I definitely don&#x27;t think it is worth it. I went back to using Cetaphil for normal to oily skin. It works much better and costs only $6.</li>
            <li> I have never had this clear of skin in my life. I started using this during my pregnancy because of acne issues, and it completely cleared up my skin. I now use it even when not pregnant. I love that it takes away makeup and dirt and moisturizes at the same time. Love the product. Great for all skin types. It is a must have.</li>
            <li> as i received it ,some cream leaked out, like used item, not new. i&#x27; m really disappointed on this one.</li>
            <li> This is a great product......the best cleanser I have ever used.  I was having trouble finding it and was so happy that I was able to find it on Amazon.com at a really good price!  I will buy more when I run out because it improves the texture of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love Basq facial cleanser. I started using it when I was pregnant with my first baby. I have a loooong history of horrible skin and acne and had been using a facial scrub with salicylic acid for acne. Well, of course, you can&#x27;t use salicylic acid during pregnancy and I figured I was in for 9+ months of horrible skin. Fortunately a friend gave me a jar of Basq&#x27;s cleanser and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. I started using it during my first trimester when I was super sensitive to smells, and I have to say I don&#x27;t love the scent. I even considered giving it up, but then I tried it in the shower. Awesome! The scent doesn&#x27;t bother me at all and I get an even better clean that trying to splash off a cleanser in the sink. (My skin is too sensitive for a wash cloth etc.) Plus in the shower it&#x27;s easy to use a little on my neck, back, chest, etc. that might need some help. (I like the extra exfoliation for peeling sun burns too.) I used it though my first pregnancy and kept using it and now that I&#x27;m pregnant again I&#x27;m still using it and plan to for a long time. And yes, I like it better than that old salicylic acid scrub. It works just as well for acne without the drying of salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love. I have sensitive skin and this cleanser does the trick. It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. I use before bed and again in the morning. The creamy texture with light micro exfoliators is very gentle on my skin. I only trust my skin to basq;s Rebalancing Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I like the texture and smell of this facial scrub. It is very gentle for my sensitive skin especially during pregnancy. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This cleanser also works as a gentle exfoiliator, especially great for the summer.  I keep mine in the shower so I use it daily.  Never had any problems with irritations.  Not greasy, actually keeps my skin slightly moisturized (if I forget to use mine).</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after I saw it in a maternity store. During my pregnancy I suffered from pregnancy acne and was very limited on the products I could use on my skin, when I started using this product I immediately noticed a change and reduction of the acne, after a month using it I could wear strapless shirts again :)  Not only did the product help with my acne but the best part is that this company do not test her products on animals which is great. I really recommend this product (I used it not only on my face but on my shoulders, back, and chest as well)!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I became pregnant with my first child. It does help balance skin.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It is the only soap that keeps my face looking well when I&#x27;m pregnant.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser on the market.  It&#x27;s light, smooth and silky.  I absolutely love it.  It&#x27;s a must for all skin.  My whole family uses it.  Try it once and you will never use any other product.</li>

Like others have mentioned, I noticed I would still have makeup left on my face after washing with basq and I wondered if that may have Bern part of the problem. I&#x27;ve started using a washcloth with the cleanser to help wash off the makeup and I am seeing a BIG difference. My skin already seems to be improving, and no new zits! If you don&#x27;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never done a review before but I have to for this cleanser!  My husband and I are trying to get pregnant and I&#x27;ve decided to cut out all chemicals as much as possible.  I&#x27;ve always used Mary Kay Timewise cleanser and I know it contains parabens.  So after learning about more natural ways to clean my face I decided to try the oil cleansing method.  I wanted to clean my face while preventing wrinkles naturally. Well after two weeks my face broke out worse than ever before.  I have sensitive skin that only breaks out a couple small pimples during my cycle.  It looked like by skin was purging until it I got small bumps all over my face with two or more bigger ones under the skin. I then tried the honey cleansing method after hearing amazing things about it but it just got worse.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to go anywhere and it was horrible not knowing how to fix it.  I even went back to my timewise cleanser but now my face looked burnt too.&lt;br /&gt;Then I read about this Basq cleanser and I thought I may as well.  After two months of horrible skin I ordered and received this cleanser and noticed a difference even after the first night.  A small difference but any difference meant hope.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and a half and my skin is clear except for 2 almost healed pimples. This was the only product that got rid of all the small bumps.  I tried bp, fresh lemons,  raw acv, bentonite clay,  honey and cinnamon mask.  I was dedicated to finding the perfect pregnancy safe product and I did!  Even my forehead lines are appearing smaller. Hopefully this will work for everyone like it does me! I also use the eucerin q10 anti wrinkle sensitive skin cream to moisturize.</li>
            <li> I first used the Rebalancing Facial Cleanser after having my second child and hormones were making my skin very unpredictable.  I grew up with terrible eczema and very sensitive skin, unable to use many make-up and skin care products.  Although I outgrew these problems as an adult, they seemed to be coming back with a vengeance after having my second daughter and the glow of pregnancy wore off.  The scent is wonderful and not overpowering.  It exfoliates and cleanses just enough, never making skin tight or itchy (which is a huge problem for me).  I am extremely impressed with this product and missed it terribly after running out and needing to use a drugstore substitute.  I am now in the process of weaning my 1-year-old from nursing and am already in the throes of another round of hormonal upheaval.  I&#x27;m glad to know there is a cleanser that will soothe and cleanse my sensitive and unpredictable skin.</li>
            <li> My skin looked HORRIBLE after I got pregnant. It would be super greasy and dry &amp; flaky all at the same time. I also started breaking out like a teenager again. Oh, the joys of hormone changes! Anyways, this stuff smelled a little funny to me the first time I used it. I&#x27;m used to it now, and it&#x27;s actually not so bad. It helps TREMENDOUSLY, however, I can&#x27;t use it every day. It really exfoliates well, which is why I can&#x27;t use it daily or twice a day like the directions state. It started to make my face feel very sensitive. So, I just use a face wash gel/soap from Simple which seems to be ok on my days I don&#x27;t need exfoliating. If my skins starts to look rough with pimples/blackheads and dead skin, I use this, and I look nice and glowy again. I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering with black/white heads since my teen years, I bought this product when I got pregnant and it helped a lot I think I will continue to use it for a long time after pregnancy, never used such a good facial cleaner, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> it contains small rub materials and can clean face very clearly. But no sign of skin whitening after use. I think it not suitable for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I started using this in 2012 when I was pregnant with my first child. I&#x27;ve continued to use and my skin is always clear.</li>
