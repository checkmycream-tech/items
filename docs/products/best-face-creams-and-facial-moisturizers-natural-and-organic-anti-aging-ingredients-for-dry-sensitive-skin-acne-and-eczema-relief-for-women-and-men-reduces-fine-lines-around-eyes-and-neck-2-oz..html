            <li>This company prides itself on being Paraben Free, Fragrance Free, Cruelty Free, which is one of the reasons why I love their products so much.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s rich like a night cream but doesn&#x27;t impact day-time make-up.</li>
            <li>Love this natural moisturizer :)</li>
            <li>It has somewhat of a light odor, but it fades quickly after application.</li>
            <li>Honestly this is amazing facial lotion, and I love that the ingredients are so natural.</li>
            <li>greater than some very high priced creams.</li>
            <li>Another reason why I love this company &amp; their products so much is because they donate 1% of their annual revenue to 1% FOR THE PLANET.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product so much.</li>
            <li>Although, some of them have natural elements added for a nice scent.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing at making my skin feel nourished and refreshed, which is a plus since especially during these winter months my skin dries out quickly!</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:6292312b14857834c20b60d3c0c29e82]]I have used this 2 oz daily moisturizer face cream several times my face infused/hydrated with it perfectly</li>
            <li>I have tried other moisturizers and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Weight: 1.6 ounces and came Super fast plus is Courtesy of&lt;br /&gt;Mee Beauty !!</li>
            <li>good bye dry skin😊&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:Not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this Purely Mee face cream because it&#x27;s not greasey</li>
            <li>I notice a distinct difference when I use it...</li>
            <li>In spite of the fact that coconut oil is one of the first ingredients, it doesn’t have a sweet smell, but rather</li>
            <li>I love the natural honey like scent.</li>
            <li>The opinions stated above are my own, but may differ from yours.</li>
            <li>, right ?)...</li>
            <li>My foundation goes on much smoother - seems like I use less which is great.</li>
            <li>my skin is able to absorb it very well and stay hydrated because of its soft and lustrous texture</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several weeks now and have to say that I love the results I am getting on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am now starting to change my mind about that and being more focused about taking care of my skin.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing with coconut oil and bee hive!  </li>
            <li>However I do recommend doing it first thing in the morning to allow for it to soak into your skin before applying makeup.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many moisturizers in the past.</li>
            <li>That, combined with the fact that it is virtually paraben and chemical free completely sold me on this product.</li>
            <li>I was using a similar priced product from Olay but this product is so much better for my skin.</li>
            <li>I live in Wyoming - a very dry climate - so good moisturizers are a must.</li>
            <li>Of course this is a special preparation for making the skin soft and supple, something it does</li>
            <li>really wish this didn&#x27;t cost so much!</li>

            <li>i really like the smell and texture of this facial lotion.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to someone looking for a natural face</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this product and can really tell the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combination skin.  </li>
            <li>This has been the only face cream to really help my skin.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, it comes in a pretty pink and white container that makes you feel girly and pretty when you open it.</li>
            <li>it smells very natural and not chemically like some of my old facial lotions.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this cream for a few days but it makes my skin feel so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It has helped my skin a lot when my normal body lotion fell short.</li>
            <li>and there is definitely a major change.</li>
            <li>After looking at the promising reviews from this product I decided to give it a shot I had nothing else to loose.</li>
            <li>With this positive experience I will be looking at other products in this  brand.</li>
            <li>I have dry patches on my face that won&#x27;t go away with lotion, this cream, however, remedied them and made my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>It feels heavy at first</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin that is also very sensitive to castor oil and propylene glycol.  </li>

            <li> After a few minutes I begin with applying foundation which gives me awesome results.</li>
            <li> No sticky residue, and my skin feels so smooth.  </li>
            <li> Light and clean smelling.</li>

            <li> , it&#x27;s rich like a night cream but doesn&#x27;t impact day-time make-up.</li>
            <li> Love this natural moisturizer :)</li>
            <li> It has somewhat of a light odor, but it fades quickly after application.</li>
            <li> Honestly this is amazing facial lotion, and I love that the ingredients are so natural.</li>
            <li> greater than some very high priced creams.</li>

            <li> I enjoy using this Purely Mee face cream because it&#x27;s not greasey</li>
            <li> I notice a distinct difference when I use it...</li>
            <li> In spite of the fact that coconut oil is one of the first ingredients, it doesn’t have a sweet smell, but rather</li>

            <li> My foundation goes on much smoother - seems like I use less which is great.</li>
            <li> my skin is able to absorb it very well and stay hydrated because of its soft and lustrous texture</li>

            <li> Very moisturizing with coconut oil and bee hive!  </li>
            <li> However I do recommend doing it first thing in the morning to allow for it to soak into your skin before applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many moisturizers in the past.</li>
            <li> That, combined with the fact that it is virtually paraben and chemical free completely sold me on this product.</li>

            <li> /&gt;First, it comes in a pretty pink and white container that makes you feel girly and pretty when you open it.</li>
            <li> it smells very natural and not chemically like some of my old facial lotions.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this cream for a few days but it makes my skin feel so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It has helped my skin a lot when my normal body lotion fell short.</li>
            <li> and there is definitely a major change.</li>
            <li> After looking at the promising reviews from this product I decided to give it a shot I had nothing else to loose.</li>
            <li> With this positive experience I will be looking at other products in this  brand.</li>
            <li> I have dry patches on my face that won&#x27;t go away with lotion, this cream, however, remedied them and made my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> It feels heavy at first</li>

            <li> I have very dry skin and am sensitive to a variety of ingredients, this is the first moisturizer I&#x27;ve used that takes care of the dry, flaky skin I usually wake up with.</li>
            <li> I understand that natural creams and other products do not have deodorants, or any additives,</li>
            <li> I simply used a small amount because it didn’t take much.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few days so way too early to say what results are or whether I will order again.</li>
            <li> is a loose creamy and when left on the skin  not too greasy either like some  products out their today .&lt;br</li>
            <li> a dab goes a long way for both .The holidays are here</li>
            <li> buy for self or if you know some sensitive skin people get as a few gifts to hand out .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months and my skin seems to stay hydrated all day long.</li>
            <li> The brand that I&#x27;ve been using left my face really dry and on top of that it was very expensive</li>
            <li> only a minimal amount is needed!</li>
            <li> I suffer from extremely dry skin to the point where my nose looks like its peeling from a sun burn.</li>
            <li> I don’t have either dry or oily skin, but feel that this type of cream would work well for dry.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft all day long no more dry periods and the flaking on my nose is 90% reduced.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> But, the good news, since I did try it when it was really bad, it helped to add moisture to my skin!</li>
            <li> My skin is insanely dry, especially in the harsh winter weather.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t smell like honey (it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent), but it&#x27;s definitely one of the nicest face creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Minimal preservatives.  </li>
            <li> I had to apply it a few times throughout the day, but I know that&#x27;s mostly due to the excessive dryness of my skin, and I didn&#x27;t feel guilty for doing so, knowing it is safe of chemicals!&lt;br</li>
            <li> body&#x27;s reaction may differ from any other user of this</li>
            <li> it was like any other treatment I tried.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> It is rather concentrated, but not extra thick by any means.&lt;br</li>
            <li> when I put it upside down some of the cream slips forward  </li>
            <li> Since using Bee Hydrated Face Moisturizer day cream for the past 2 months I&#x27;ve had no problem with dry, flaky cracked skin.</li>
            <li> I did notice a slight change in my skin it did feel softer for longer.</li>
            <li> This is a very small amount of cream (two ounces), but should go a long way.  </li>
            <li> The jar is also very small, but the cream spreads a long way on the face, a small dab will cover just about half of your face.</li>
            <li> It stung for just a few seconds and then the stinging went away.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
            <li> The winter is very hard on my naturally dry skin.</li>
            <li> Small container,  2 oz, but</li>
            <li> Some fragrances actually can make people ill</li>
            <li> Unfortunately a lot of companies use parabens and other toxic chemicals that can leave your skin in worse condition than it was before you used the product.</li>
            <li> I actually applied this during a bad eczema break out ( I know,</li>
            <li> probably a dumb idea</li>
            <li> Hydrated day cream isn’t very thick, but quite luxurious feeling on the skin.  </li>
            <li> so I am always skeptical about skin care promises.  </li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve chosen to use it when my eczema wasn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> However, it made my skin break out badly :-(</li>

            <li> Love this natural moisturizer :)</li>
            <li> I live in Wyoming - a very dry climate - so good moisturizers are a must. I&#x27;ve already gone through two jars of this one. It feels great, is not greasy, and my face is in great condition. Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t smell like honey (it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent), but it&#x27;s definitely one of the nicest face creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have very dry skin and this moisturizes all day. I want to try more of their creams.</li>

            <li> I have been using this for several weeks now and have to say that I love the results I am getting on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;As I have approached my 50th birthday, I have noticed a big difference in my skin.  I have to admit, I have never been really faithful with a skin care regimen.  I am now starting to change my mind about that and being more focused about taking care of my skin. This is perfect for me, because it is an easy skin care regimen.  I simply wash my face, and apply a dab into the palm of my hand.  I then rub it into my face and neck and walk away.  I tend to allow it to absorb into my skin before applying my makeup, but I have to say that I have not noticed any difference in how my make up looks or reacts, with having this lotion underneath it.  I was worried my face would be greasy feeling, but no worries!&lt;br /&gt;Since using this Daily Moisturizer, I have noticed a big difference in my skin, especially in my neck, which seems to be my problem area with my skin.  I used to have a rough feeling on my neck, but now when I feel along the lines of my neck, it is nice and soft.  I am really impressed with this Day Cream moisturizer and have since started using the Night Cream.  Both of which I love.  I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review  and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
            <li> All natural ingredients,  especially important for a product I&#x27;m putting on my face. Very moisturizing with coconut oil and bee hive!  Creamy consistency.  Doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  Face is super soft.  Small container,  2 oz, but only a minimal amount is needed! Scent free.  Minimal preservatives.  My face has my if a glow after using this cream!</li>
            <li> I have dry patches on my face that won&#x27;t go away with lotion, this cream, however, remedied them and made my skin very soft. It has somewhat of a light odor, but it fades quickly after application. The jar is also very small, but the cream spreads a long way on the face, a small dab will cover just about half of your face.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! Light and clean smelling. I&#x27;ll be back in the fall for the night cream to use as my winter moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice cream. I notice a distinct difference when I use it... greater than some very high priced creams. It has a luscious consistency and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> So smooth, and refreshing is what this stuff is to me. I enjoy the way my skin feels after application. However I do recommend doing it first thing in the morning to allow for it to soak into your skin before applying makeup. This stuff is amazing at making my skin feel nourished and refreshed, which is a plus since especially during these winter months my skin dries out quickly! I have recently passed this over to my daughter to use, because she needs something as wonderful as this to add to her morning ritual. She&#x27;s only 14, but we start to lose our elasticity at the age of 15 so I want her to get in the habit of taking care to her skin. In my opinion this is the perfect product to get her started on, so she can feel, and see the difference and follow in my advice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*My body&#x27;s reaction may differ from any other user of this product.&lt;br /&gt;*Take note: The date(s) I choose to place a review on Amazon, may not reflect date(s) item was reviewed in real time.</li>
            <li> I suffer from extremely dry skin to the point where my nose looks like its peeling from a sun burn. After looking at the promising reviews from this product I decided to give it a shot I had nothing else to loose. Day 1 it was like any other treatment I tried. I applied in the morning and at night. It has a non greasy feeling I really like very comparable to my body lotion I like. Day 2 I did notice a slight change in my skin it did feel softer for longer. I have been using it for 9 days religiously now and there is definitely a major change. My skin feels soft all day long no more dry periods and the flaking on my nose is 90% reduced. It has helped my skin a lot when my normal body lotion fell short. Great product!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of mee beauty products because they are made with all natural pure honey and organic coconut oil. This company prides itself on being Paraben Free, Fragrance Free, Cruelty Free, which is one of the reasons why I love their products so much. They are also beekeepers and use their own pure, unrefined, unheated honey in every product. Another reason why I love this company &amp; their products so much is because they donate 1% of their annual revenue to 1% FOR THE PLANET. I love companies that pay it forward!</li>
            <li> I looooooove this cream! My skin looks fabulous and is so soft, plump and young looking!</li>
            <li> Excellent , my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> I do like lotions and creams that have those nice light flowery scents like honeysuckle and lavender, but fragrance-free is a necessity for some people.  Some fragrances actually can make people ill and I’ve seen this happen with one friend.  The Mee Beauty Bee Hydrated day cream does have a scent, but it’s from the actual blend of the ingredients.  In spite of the fact that coconut oil is one of the first ingredients, it doesn’t have a sweet smell, but rather an earthy one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mee Beautry Bee Hydrated day cream isn’t very thick, but quite luxurious feeling on the skin.  It’s a great way to moisturize and coconut oil is certainly a favorite with many people.  It’s not just for cooking, but also great for the body, including the face an hair.  Of course this is a special preparation for making the skin soft and supple, something it does perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the day cream the skin on my face did feel soft and silky.  I don’t have either dry or oily skin, but feel that this type of cream would work well for dry.  I simply used a small amount because it didn’t take much.  This is a very small amount of cream (two ounces), but should go a long way.  It is rather concentrated, but not extra thick by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;☼  Paraben Free&lt;br /&gt;☼  Fragrance Free&lt;br /&gt;☼  Dye Free&lt;br /&gt;☼  Cruelty Free&lt;br /&gt;☼  All Natural Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;☼  Coconut Oil&lt;br /&gt;☼  Pure Honey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not seeing an objectionable ingredients.  I do like to read about a company and check out mission statements, especially when the products are derived from animals or insects.  The company states that:  “We are first and foremost beekeepers tending to our bees and making sure they are happy and healthy. We use natural beekeeping methods without pesticides or chemicals.”  This, along with a high-quality makes it quite nice.  I especially like the addition of the organic coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aqua (Water), Cocos nucifera (Organic Coconut) Oil, Emulsifying Wax, Pure Honey, Palm Stearic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrasodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum (Polysaccharide Gum), Butyrospermum Parkii ( Shea Butter - Naturally refined), Citric Acid, Lecithin &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MEE BEAUTY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BSWLOR2 Best Night Cream Moisturizer for Dry Skin By Mee Beauty with Avocado Oil, Shea Butter &amp; Pure Honey]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BSHAYGY Daily Moisturizer - Face Cream By Mee Beauty - Made with Pure Honey &amp; Organic Coconut Oil - Bee Hydrated]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BS1SP2U Daily Moisturizer Body Lotion for Dry Skin By Mee Beauty with Natural &amp; Organic Ingredients]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00GKTSKKM Moisturizing Body Wash By Mee Beauty Infused with Premium Pure Honey, Organic Aloe Vera, &amp; Green Tea]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review./&gt;Aqua (Water), Cocos nucifera (Organic Coconut) Oil, Emulsifying Wax, Pure Honey, Palm Stearic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrasodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum (Polysaccharide Gum), Butyrospermum Parkii ( Shea Butter - Naturally refined), Citric Acid, Lecithin &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MEE BEAUTY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BSWLOR2 Best Night Cream Moisturizer for Dry Skin By Mee Beauty with Avocado Oil, Shea Butter &amp; Pure Honey]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BSHAYGY Daily Moisturizer - Face Cream By Mee Beauty - Made with Pure Honey &amp; Organic Coconut Oil - Bee Hydrated]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BS1SP2U Daily Moisturizer Body Lotion for Dry Skin By Mee Beauty with Natural &amp; Organic Ingredients]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00GKTSKKM Moisturizing Body Wash By Mee Beauty Infused with Premium Pure Honey, Organic Aloe Vera, &amp; Green Tea]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many moisturizers in the past. This one is the best! I love how it makes my skin feel. I love the natural honey like scent. It is not greasy or sticky. I use it morning and at bedtime and find my skin looking much better than before I used it. Being an older woman my skin is drier than when I was younger. This product is ideal for me.</li>
            <li> It feels heavy at first but I love the feeling on my skin afterwards. I live in the Midwest so I need nice face lotion. And does the trick</li>
            <li> My skin is insanely dry, especially in the harsh winter weather. I saw this product in one of the ipsy subscription bags, but it was before I was a subscription member, so I didn&#x27;t receive it. So many people had great things to say about it, so I was happy to have the opportunity to try it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it comes in a pretty pink and white container that makes you feel girly and pretty when you open it. And it&#x27;s infused with honey! Honey is a natural ingredient that is so good for your skin! That, combined with the fact that it is virtually paraben and chemical free completely sold me on this product. Unfortunately a lot of companies use parabens and other toxic chemicals that can leave your skin in worse condition than it was before you used the product. I&#x27;m glad this product is not that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light fragrance and a fluffy, whipped texture that feels soft on the skin. I actually applied this during a bad eczema break out ( I know, probably a dumb idea, right ?)... It stung for just a few seconds and then the stinging went away. I don&#x27;t think this would irritate most people&#x27;s skin, so don&#x27;t be too concerned about that. I should&#x27;ve chosen to use it when my eczema wasn&#x27;t as bad. But, the good news, since I did try it when it was really bad, it helped to add moisture to my skin! I really like it on my face. I had to apply it a few times throughout the day, but I know that&#x27;s mostly due to the excessive dryness of my skin, and I didn&#x27;t feel guilty for doing so, knowing it is safe of chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. The opinions stated above are my own, but may differ from yours.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this cream for a few days but it makes my skin feel so smooth and soft. I find using it at night has the best effect for me. I love the healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li> The cream is very pleasant to use. I have only used it for a few days so way too early to say what results are or whether I will order again.</li>
            <li> i really like the smell and texture of this facial lotion. it smells very natural and not chemically like some of my old facial lotions. my skin is able to absorb it very well and stay hydrated because of its soft and lustrous texture</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product so much. However, it made my skin break out badly :-(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months and my skin seems to stay hydrated all day long.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin that is also very sensitive to castor oil and propylene glycol.  To be able to find a cream moisturizer that does not contain those item, does not clog my pores and really moisturizes my face had been impossible until I tried this cream.  It is wonderful.  My face loves it.</li>
            <li> Honestly this is amazing facial lotion, and I love that the ingredients are so natural. It does not leave my face oily and I have a glow to my face when I use this!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I love using honey products.  I have not used it yet, but I look forward to using it.  It smelled great.</li>
            <li> I understand that natural creams and other products do not have deodorants, or any additives, that is why they are organic. Although, some of them have natural elements added for a nice scent. This one does not... It is better to apply it before going to bed.</li>
            <li> Amazingly smooth and silky face moisturizer, it has a faint but good smell to it, that isnt overwhelming like some other facial moisturizers I have tried. Comes in a tiny container, but a little bit of it seems to go a long way, so it is a good value. I would recommend this to someone looking for a natural face moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product and can really tell the difference in my skin. I was using a similar priced product from Olay but this product is so much better for my skin. I will be buying this product from now on. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have tried other moisturizers and this one is by far the best. I love that it is made with honey. I will be ordering more soon for gifts.</li>
            <li> The winter is very hard on my naturally dry skin. Since using Bee Hydrated Face Moisturizer day cream for the past 2 months I&#x27;ve had no problem with dry, flaky cracked skin. It&#x27;s truly a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I really like this.... I even gave up my Olay Regenerist for it!</li>
            <li> The best day/night cream for dry skin!!!!</li>
            <li> Smooth, the perfect day time moisturizer . Wish it came in squeeze tube, so I can easily carry with me.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cream that I&#x27;ve used. The brand that I&#x27;ve been using left my face really dry and on top of that it was very expensive so I thought I&#x27;d try something else. As soon as I get low on the jar Purely Mee&#x27;s cream that I have I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Wonderful daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this Purely Mee face cream because it&#x27;s not greasey and it&#x27;s not too heavy. I&#x27;ve included this product into my makeup prep by lightly rubbing the cream in circular motions and also lifting up. After a few minutes I begin with applying foundation which gives me awesome results. My foundation goes on much smoother - seems like I use less which is great. There&#x27;s a faint odor that&#x27;s neither smelly nor appealing - almost clean if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;I received a discounted price for this item in exchange for my honest review.  With this positive experience I will be looking at other products in this  brand.</li>
            <li> Does the job as a moisturizer, but I really don&#x27;t care for the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product. Did I mention I love it?  Well, I do. Light, whipped cream and so delicious on my skin.  No sticky residue, and my skin feels so smooth.  I am 72 so I am always skeptical about skin care promises.  I have sensitive, combination skin.  I would love to apply this throughout the day, because it just feels that yummy.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s natural and makes my skin feel soft, smooth and moisturized.  Quick shipping, will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I am 62 years of age. My face has large pores with a tendency for white heads and yes I still get acne. This has been the only face cream to really help my skin. A little bit goes a very long way. It does not look greasy. My skin is at peace.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and am sensitive to a variety of ingredients, this is the first moisturizer I&#x27;ve used that takes care of the dry, flaky skin I usually wake up with. I wear it day and night, it&#x27;s rich like a night cream but doesn&#x27;t impact day-time make-up. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> really wish this didn&#x27;t cost so much! i am in love with it...need the night cream now.</li>
