            <li>This is a great product for anyone experiencing hair loss.  </li>

            <li>Love this produc!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice shampoo, smells good, i&#x27;ve heard great reviews that it is good for thinning hair</li>
            <li>I have been looing for a good deal on this product.</li>
            <li>It feeds my thyroid and it&#x27;s good for growing hair too.</li>
            <li>Would purchase again as a good shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received more compliments on my hair since I began using this product!  </li>
            <li>However it is a nice product for the care of your hair</li>
            <li>I just wished this product had a more pleasant, refreshing smell.</li>
            <li>love the way hair looks great clean non flowery smell hair  </li>
            <li>I have tried them all and this shampoo and conditioner are by far the best of any line of shampoo and coditioner.</li>
            <li>but maybe it is helping to stop from losing more hair.</li>
            <li>I use the cleanser more than the conditioner</li>
            <li>I LOVE the cleanser and scalp therapy (conditioner) for the peppermint scent and the tingling sensation.  </li>
            <li>and I love it also.</li>
            <li>They now carry another brand, but I like Nioxin better, so I had to find somewhere else to purchase them.</li>
            <li>I have used Nioxin for many years and won&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
            <li>It is had to find on the shelves and love being able to get it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Love these products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a lot of compliments on how healthy my hair is looking.</li>
            <li>The brush was full of my hair!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference</li>
            <li>This is not the original product.  </li>
            <li>full everytime</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s rare</li>
            <li>It is growing long, strong and healthy.  </li>
            <li>When I started using Nioxin I noticed a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>I knew right away by the consistency of the shampoo that something was fishy.</li>
            <li>have mentioned that there is a sticker placed on the bottles instead of being printed right on the bottle.</li>
            <li>I have been using Nioxin for 3 years now and without this product I would most likely be bold with the number of perms I get.</li>
            <li>But, I did not use this after giving birth to my 2nd child and noticed that I lost WAY more hair.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I needed and came promptly.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I left this product on my hair for more than 5 minutes and still no minty/cool sensation.</li>
            <li>Now, after about two years of using Nioxin my hair is in a lot better condition and this is the only shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ll ever use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had thin, fine and brittle hair but not any more!  </li>
            <li>While using the gold capped Nioxin I was able to see actual new hair growth on a continual bases.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it did all that much to improve my hair, but I&#x27;d buy it again, just to see if continued use works.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>They conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem to detangle very well</li>
            <li>The real product makes my hair grow and keeps it from falling off.  </li>
            <li>It make my hair shiny and very managable.  </li>
            <li>Really help with hair loss</li>
            <li>I really like the changes I am seeing with using this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is thicker and really growing faster.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the combination of all have helped me bring HAIR back to this old misshapen head.</li>
            <li>I brought from Costco a bottle of Omega-3 made from Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil-Cold pressed, Extra Virgin and Mercury Free.</li>
            <li>These bottle are pretty pricey but they are big and since I don&#x27;t have much hair I don&#x27;t seem to use much.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t like any gels or anything like that in my hair.</li>
            <li>and I could see new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>Live and learn</li>
            <li>It smells like the real product, but you don&#x27;t get the same tingly feeling as you do with the real thing.  </li>
            <li>My family, friends, and hair stylist notice that I have more hair, and it is now the longest it has ever been in my life, which is past my midback.  </li>
            <li>After using it one week I noticed that my hair had stopped falling out completely!</li>
            <li>What used to be a fantastic product is now not  worth</li>
            <li>I am 27 years old</li>
            <li>I have been using Nioxin for a month now and already has completely stopped my hair fall 100%.</li>
            <li>The potential risks that come with Nioxin are that some people are too sensitive or allergic to various ingredients to tolerate usage, and rarely users say they do not think this product makes their hair thicker or longer.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR ABT 1 MO, SO FAR NO CHANGES, BUT IM TOLD IT TAKES AWHILE</li>
            <li>THUS FAR</li>
            <li>That really wasn&#x27;t a big deal...</li>
            <li>My hair is getting back to normal and I plan to keep using this product.</li>
            <li>From my experience, Nioxin took a while to increase hair growth, but using it daily (or almost) has certainly made a big difference.  </li>
            <li>Normally it should give you a minty and cool sensation once you apply and leave it on your wet hair/scalp while in the shower, it should work in less than 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>BUT it definitely makes my hair really soft -</li>

            <li> I am not sure if I got the real thing.  </li>

            <li> And normally after you rinsed it, it should leave a slight minty smell and cool sensation - this product failed to do it</li>
            <li> I have long colored hair and been dealing with hair loss for a year now.</li>
            <li> Nioxin really cleanses the hair, gives it all day volume, shine and hair feels thick</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t it&#x27;s pretty tough to brush out after I towel dry it.</li>
            <li> Not one single hair on the brush!</li>
            <li> With the black cap Nioxin I see no new hair growth and my hair is getting thinner and thinner.  </li>
            <li> A few years ago I was losing a lot of hair due to chemo treatments.  </li>
            <li> Finally, Nioxin is expensive if you buy it from a salon or at retail prices, so you will definitely save money buying it online!</li>
            <li> The picture showed the Nioxin with the gold caps, I received Nioxin with the black caps.  </li>
            <li> If you are a senior and your hair is starting to thin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39 and have been having hair loss for the past year and a half</li>
            <li> and this product has seemed to slow it down.  </li>
            <li> No more lotions or lipsticks with Soy.</li>
            <li> No more creal or gum or even Tuna pack in water with Soy.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product at a beauty store.  </li>
            <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist and usually purchased them from a beauty supplier, but they quit carrying them.  </li>
            <li> the problem I had was that it made my hair a tangly, gluey mess.</li>
            <li> If companies are watering down, or replacing the real thing with fake stuff, that is pathetic.</li>
            <li> BUT I&#x27;m not sure if the seller made a fake Nioxin and made profit?</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it worked because my hair was still so thin.</li>
            <li> my thyroid and PCOS has caused my hair to thin quite a bit.</li>
            <li> but this product is kinda of weird because I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to not smell like a mint?!</li>
            <li> Soy is bad for your thyroid if it&#x27;s already struggling.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this produc!! I am 27 years old I have long colored hair and been dealing with hair loss for a year now. I have been using Nioxin for a month now and already has completely stopped my hair fall 100%. Nioxin really cleanses the hair, gives it all day volume, shine and hair feels thick and I like the mint scent, it gives my scalp a cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice shampoo, smells good, i&#x27;ve heard great reviews that it is good for thinning hair so I keep using it. I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference but maybe it is helping to stop from losing more hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone experiencing hair loss.  I&#x27;m 39 and have been having hair loss for the past year and a half and this product has seemed to slow it down.  Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin System 4 for over a year and I&#x27;m happy with it. The product doesn&#x27;t make my hair thicker, but it looks and feels thicker.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it did all that much to improve my hair, but I&#x27;d buy it again, just to see if continued use works.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin for 3 years now and without this product I would most likely be bold with the number of perms I get. After my second pregnancy my hair stated to fall out a lot, I would get chunks of hair in my brush not just strains of hair. 1 week after starting Nioxin the hair loss reduced. The bottle says that it also re-grows hair, I have not experience this but it does reduce the thinning of the hair by a noticeable amount.  I use the cleanser more than the conditioner so I would but one bottle of conditioner and 2 bottles of the cleanser.</li>
            <li> Since 2005, I&#x27;d been using System #3, up until this year when I switched to System #4.  I LOVE the cleanser and scalp therapy (conditioner) for the peppermint scent and the tingling sensation.  From my experience, Nioxin took a while to increase hair growth, but using it daily (or almost) has certainly made a big difference.  My family, friends, and hair stylist notice that I have more hair, and it is now the longest it has ever been in my life, which is past my midback.  The potential risks that come with Nioxin are that some people are too sensitive or allergic to various ingredients to tolerate usage, and rarely users say they do not think this product makes their hair thicker or longer.  Finally, Nioxin is expensive if you buy it from a salon or at retail prices, so you will definitely save money buying it online!</li>
            <li> I used this after having my 1st child because I noticed hair loss about 4 months after giving birth. I didn&#x27;t think it worked because my hair was still so thin. But, I did not use this after giving birth to my 2nd child and noticed that I lost WAY more hair. So, I started using Nioxin again and can say that it actually has made a difference. My hair is getting back to normal and I plan to keep using this product.</li>
            <li> I like products . Thanks</li>
            <li> I have been looing for a good deal on this product. It was exactly what I needed and came promptly. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I used Nioxin before and it works but this product is kinda of weird because I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to not smell like a mint?! Normally it should give you a minty and cool sensation once you apply and leave it on your wet hair/scalp while in the shower, it should work in less than 30 seconds. I left this product on my hair for more than 5 minutes and still no minty/cool sensation. And normally after you rinsed it, it should leave a slight minty smell and cool sensation - this product failed to do it BUT it definitely makes my hair really soft - BUT I&#x27;m not sure if the seller made a fake Nioxin and made profit? or this is how it&#x27;s supposed to be for this Nioxin level?! I tried all the levels except this one before. BTW, I got a dandruff using this and it&#x27;s rare cuz I never had one before using Nioxin that I bought from Salon retailers.</li>
            <li> Nioxin has done wonders for my hair.  I&#x27;ve received more compliments on my hair since I began using this product!  I&#x27;ve always had thin, fine and brittle hair but not any more!  It is growing long, strong and healthy.  Thank you</li>
            <li> A few years ago I was losing a lot of hair due to chemo treatments.  After shampooing I would always finding a big clump of hair around the drain screen in the tub or sink.  When I started using Nioxin I noticed a difference right away.  The clumps of hair weren&#x27;t as big and I could see new hair growth.  Now, after about two years of using Nioxin my hair is in a lot better condition and this is the only shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ll ever use.  It smells great and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m coming up on 50 this year and besides the obvious MEOPAUSE my thyroid and PCOS has caused my hair to thin quite a bit. I eat a heart and hair health diet but my hair was still falling out by the hand full everytime I took a shower or brushed my hair. The brush was full of my hair! I bet I lost 1/2 to 3/4 of my hair in about 4 months. I started using Nioxin #4 after the gal that cuts my hair suggested it. She had also noticed my hair had thinned quite a bit. I started with one of the kits. After using it one week I noticed that my hair had stopped falling out completely! Not one single hair on the brush! I&#x27;m about 6 weeks in now and I do have pin feathers all over my head. I also just tried the Volumizing Refectives Thicking Spray Gel by Nioxin and I love it also. I normally don&#x27;t like any gels or anything like that in my hair. They alway make my hair feel funny or dull but not this one. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s all because of the Nioxin. I also gave up 98% of all soy products. No more lotions or lipsticks with Soy. No more creal or gum or even Tuna pack in water with Soy. Soy is bad for your thyroid if it&#x27;s already struggling. I even had to give up my pre-seasoned cast iron because they use soy. UGH! I brought from Costco a bottle of Omega-3 made from Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil-Cold pressed, Extra Virgin and Mercury Free. Made in the USA. It feeds my thyroid and it&#x27;s good for growing hair too. I&#x27;m sure the combination of all have helped me bring HAIR back to this old misshapen head. I&#x27;m going to keep using the Nioxin. These bottle are pretty pricey but they are big and since I don&#x27;t have much hair I don&#x27;t seem to use much. HA HA! So they should last a long time. They conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem to detangle very well so I comb through my hair with the conditioner in as I am rinsing it. If I don&#x27;t it&#x27;s pretty tough to brush out after I towel dry it. I don&#x27;t want to pull out hair I have left! I&#x27;m keep these ones.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I got the real thing.  I usually buy this product at a beauty store.  The once that I get at a store smells different.</li>
            <li> Would purchase again as a good shampoo and conditioner.  Does not regrow your hair, I have used it for 3 years.  However it is a nice product for the care of your hair</li>
            <li> This is not the original product.  Even the labels are different.  The real product makes my hair grow and keeps it from falling off.  This product makes my hair fall apart.</li>
            <li> been using this for years. love the way hair looks great clean non flowery smell hair  feels great  plus it make my thinning hair fuller. I think it has prevented further hair loss for me.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR ABT 1 MO, SO FAR NO CHANGES, BUT IM TOLD IT TAKES AWHILE AND PEOPLE SWEAR BY IT., I WILL KEEP USING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LIKE THE PRODUCT ITSELF THUS FAR</li>
            <li> The picture showed the Nioxin with the gold caps, I received Nioxin with the black caps.  The gold capped Nioxin is made in USA and is thicker. It must be a different formula than the new Nioxin with the black caps.  While using the gold capped Nioxin I was able to see actual new hair growth on a continual bases.  With the black cap Nioxin I see no new hair growth and my hair is getting thinner and thinner.  What used to be a fantastic product is now not  worth&lt;br /&gt;purchasing.</li>
            <li> I have used nioxin  products for about 6 or 7 years now.  I am a licensed cosmetologist and usually purchased them from a beauty supplier, but they quit carrying them.  They now carry another brand, but I like Nioxin better, so I had to find somewhere else to purchase them.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all and this shampoo and conditioner are by far the best of any line of shampoo and coditioner.</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin for many years and won&#x27;t use anything else.  It is had to find on the shelves and love being able to get it through Amazon.  It make my hair shiny and very managable.  If you are a senior and your hair is starting to thin I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Love these products. Really help with hair loss</li>
            <li> I knew right away by the consistency of the shampoo that something was fishy. I figured that they had just changed up the formula, so decided to give it a try anyway. It smells like the real product, but you don&#x27;t get the same tingly feeling as you do with the real thing.  That really wasn&#x27;t a big deal...the problem I had was that it made my hair a tangly, gluey mess. Ive used Nioxin for years, and this was just not the product that I was used to. I noticed like others have mentioned that there is a sticker placed on the bottles instead of being printed right on the bottle. I took a picture of the ingredients, and i plan on comparing them to bottles i buy in a salon. If companies are watering down, or replacing the real thing with fake stuff, that is pathetic. Now I understand the disclaimer about buying from salons only. Live and learn I guess.</li>
            <li> I really like the changes I am seeing with using this product. My hair is thicker and really growing faster. Of course I am also taking the Ultra Hair Vitamins too. I&#x27;ve got a lot of compliments on how healthy my hair is looking. I just wished this product had a more pleasant, refreshing smell.</li>
