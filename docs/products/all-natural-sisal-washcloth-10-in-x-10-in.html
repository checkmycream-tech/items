            <li>Been using these for awhile, love them.  </li>
            <li>Well most of it has holes</li>
            <li>I switched to this washcloth and it seems be made of better material</li>
            <li>I still prefer more abrasive wash cloths but this works well.  </li>

            <li>This washcloth has such an awesome texture.</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed it and the shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>It does not leave being any thread residue like tissue paper and has good scrubbing action</li>
            <li>Apart from using it as a bath scrub,  can be used to clean cast iron utensils with some oil.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite word SISAL...</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of friction for the whole body</li>
            <li>This sisal wash rag was much needed.</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>Really like this sisal...</li>
            <li>but too much SISAL would ruin the SISAL experience</li>
            <li>but it gets soft with use and isn&#x27;t any better than a regular wash cloth</li>
            <li>I have tried other cloths, and this one is my favorite by far!</li>
            <li>I wanted to get away from plastic loofahs that pollute and don&#x27;t last, but I wanted something more exfoliating than a regular washcloth.</li>
            <li>Love the texture not too hard not too soft...</li>
            <li>This cloth is too soft to do what I need it to do.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different wash cloths and soap sacks and haven&#x27;t had much luck with them lasting more than 2 to 3 months.  </li>
            <li>The exfoliating side is not too soft.  </li>
            <li>It really shrunk down with just use -- before I even washed it the first time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but very small.  </li>
            <li>Only one has done that so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s barely wider than my hand now...</li>
            <li>Its really thick to clean ears</li>

            <li> These are durable, but they end up smelling like bad mildew after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I like the cloth, but the shrinkage is annoying.  </li>

            <li> Apart from using it as a bath scrub,  can be used to clean cast iron utensils with some oil.  It does not leave being any thread residue like tissue paper and has good scrubbing action</li>
            <li> This sisal wash rag was much needed. The last one I had has lasted years and years and was worn thin. I had forgotten what a thick sisal cloth felt like. It has a very nice defoliating texture to it. I&#x27;d buy it again but I suspect it will last for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I did not care for this this wash cloth. Bought it for exfoliating but it gets soft with use and isn&#x27;t any better than a regular wash cloth</li>
            <li> Been using these for awhile, love them.  Great quality.  One of them I bought came apart so I just stitched the binding back on and no problem.  Only one has done that so far.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  Glad I purchased it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but very small.  It really shrunk down with just use -- before I even washed it the first time.  It&#x27;s barely wider than my hand now...</li>
            <li> Really good washcloth, perfect size and material is strong. Its really thick to clean ears so I use a thinner one.</li>
            <li> I just got these but have had cloths like these before and this seems to be a great product.</li>
            <li> Serves it&#x27;s purpose. I have really enjoyed it and the shipping was quick. I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> I love this cloth, it is a great way to soap up and it feels so enjoyable on the skin. I have tried other cloths, and this one is my favorite by far!</li>
            <li> love them!! they exfoliate great</li>
            <li> I wanted to get away from plastic loofahs that pollute and don&#x27;t last, but I wanted something more exfoliating than a regular washcloth. This works perfectly. I only wish it hadn&#x27;t come in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> A few uses, the cloth shrunk down to 8&amp;#34; x 8&amp;#34;.  I like the cloth, but the shrinkage is annoying.  It&#x27;s the size of a potholder now.</li>
            <li> Really like this sisal... My new favorite word SISAL... This has soap in it? I was using it like a wash cloth.. Will see next bath. Love the texture not too hard not too soft... This is a bit smaller then a regular wash cloth but it&#x27;s perfect in ever way.. You see the picture? Well most of it has holes but too much SISAL would ruin the SISAL experience</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of friction for the whole body</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.  This cloth is too soft to do what I need it to do.  The search for a good exfoliating wash cloth continues</li>
            <li> These are durable, but they end up smelling like bad mildew after a few uses. Even though I rinsed it out thoroughly. I use Neutrogena Rainbath body wash so I can&#x27;t imagine it&#x27;s the soup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different wash cloths and soap sacks and haven&#x27;t had much luck with them lasting more than 2 to 3 months.  I switched to this washcloth and it seems be made of better material and I expect it to last awhile.  I still prefer more abrasive wash cloths but this works well.  They could also be a little larger to handle larger bars of soap</li>
            <li> Remember this is made from &amp;#34;rope&amp;#34;. It doesn&#x27;t hold moisture well and is just a sort of wet sander.</li>
            <li> Great quality. I just ordered more.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect wash cloths.  The best of  both worlds!  The exfoliating side is not too soft.  And, I think it makes a great gift!</li>
            <li> This washcloth has such an awesome texture. It&#x27;s well-priced and well-made. For those who want a washcloth with a little exfoliation built in, this product is it. Not to rough, and nor too soft. Feels awesome on my skin.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Dries slowly.</li>
