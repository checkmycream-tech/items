    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>If you have perfect skin go for it.</li>
            <li>I am not that impressed with this item.  </li>
            <li>The best foundation  ever!</li>
            <li>I use the Sally hansen airbrush legs which has awesome coverage</li>
            <li>Best to use a sponge to blend, lasted all day.</li>
            <li>Best air makeup for the price.</li>
            <li>If you have flawless skin it will give you a hint of color, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>It made my face look flawless&amp; not cakey.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for not wanting that cake feeling on your face.</li>
            <li>It looks great and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>I could go on all day about this product lol&amp;</li>
            <li>But I still used it :p</li>
            <li>I have a light skin tone, so this shade worked perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>I use a latex free sponge to put it on, as Carmindy suggested, and it works great!</li>
            <li>I thought this product that she helped create would be really good, as she states that it also contains ingredients that are good for your skin.</li>
            <li>the price is fair</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>This review is being madr by the most pickiest person you will ever meet with make up!</li>
            <li>dont think i will be finding anything better!</li>
            <li>Love this foundation!</li>
            <li>Great for light coverage.</li>
            <li>Liked the product.  </li>
            <li>But I have to say, that this is a really nice foundation</li>
            <li>Used with Sally Hansen Natural Beauty by Carmindy luminizing face primer and gave an awesome glow.</li>
            <li>I just lightly dust my powder on after, and I&#x27;m good to go :)  </li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly with a non-latex sponge.  </li>
            <li>This was the item I needed most b/f leaving the country on Sunday</li>
            <li>I love this make up.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the color how it blended, but I ended up throwing the whole thing out.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product which I can no longer find in my local drug store!  </li>
            <li>(I love her WNTW show).</li>
            <li>You can layer this product on with your sponge for more coverage, and you can also do something called \\&quot;stippling\\&quot;, where instead of rubbing the sponge with product onto the skin, you press it into the skin for more coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently just wore this airbrush makeup for my engagement photoshoot, and my skin looked beautiful!</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>i love the moisturized dewy lool it gives.</li>
            <li>I love Sally Hansen Airbrush Makeup.</li>
            <li>This spray makeup is light and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It feels light (doesn&#x27;t feel like foundation at all) and makes my skin look healthy and &#x27;glowy&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it as it looks like no makeup but produces a clean, fresh look.</li>
            <li>I also bought the Beautyblender sponge (which I also LOVE) to use with this product, as Carmindy recommends to use a sponge, but I don&#x27;t like the incredible amount of waste generated from using a single-use sponge every day.</li>
            <li>Okay, it is a very shear and light foundation.  </li>
            <li>regular purchase from amazon, good product and price</li>
            <li>Spray a little bit on a makeup sponge, and pat it on for nice smooth, light coverage.</li>
            <li>so it was important it didn&#x27;t look like too much.</li>
            <li>this product does not cover ,and is not the right shade.</li>
            <li>It is Okay if you plan to use this and only this as your foundation.  </li>
            <li>I am a woman in my 30s and prefer a more dewy look so that wrinkles aren&#x27;t so obvious.  </li>
            <li>Hard to find locally though, happy to have found it here on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I have large pours&amp; it minimizes them almost 100%.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and while watching What Not To Wear, as others have noted, Carmindy suggests spray makeup for oily skin...  </li>
            <li>Its very light&amp;airy</li>
            <li>Very lightweight &amp; gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I like it, delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li>I tried because Carmendy makes it look so easy to use on WNTW, but I am not completely sold on this product.</li>
            <li>The coverage is decent and you can build it up.  </li>
            <li>Decent product.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>I like the shade and spray-on ability, but the price is quite high.  </li>
            <li>Price is a bit too high.</li>
            <li>so I was expecting a little more from them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I can truthfully say that this is the first foundation that I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t flake off the dry areas of my skin during the times of the year that I have dry skin.</li>
            <li>I would order again and I would order a few more</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like this product or not, so I ordered a small amount.</li>
            <li>So no I was not pleased with the means of delivery but love the product or wouldn&#x27;t had gone to thru the agony</li>
            <li>My skin is somewhat sensitive, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever had such an immediate problem with a foundation.</li>
            <li>This first time I tried this, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be enough coverage, as it seemed a little sheer.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize it would be that hard to locate more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not meant to be sprayed directly on your face, but rather, stipple it onto your face using a makeup sponge (just like Carmindy).  </li>
            <li>prior to applying foundation - that way the sponge won&#x27;t absorb as much of the make up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen products that are used on What Not to Wear, which is what initially made me want to try something new.</li>

            <li> Like other folks, I&#x27;ve seen Carmindy use this product on WNTW.  </li>
            <li> I only wish it weren&#x27;t so hard to find.</li>
            <li> is the price came down.</li>
            <li> In the mean time I had yo call UPS to tell them that the next delivery date wouldn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and was packaged like new, but unfortunately when I tried using it</li>
            <li> &amp; i typically wear make up everyday.</li>

            <li> Not impressed with the coverage.  </li>
            <li> That is absolutely stupid..</li>
            <li> &amp; I couldn&#x27;t get the item b/c of this stupid situation.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this makeup.  </li>
            <li> They charged me 6.00 for that &amp;#34;Special &amp;#34;delivery date… Absolutely outrageous..</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this product does not cover ,and is not the right shade.If you have perfect skin go for it.I threw mine in the garbage.And the stifling is a joke.Also my can only  lasted 6 uses.Covering red and lasting all day was a lie</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this makeup for several years, and was in a bit of a panic when I couldn&#x27;t find it locally anymore -- Amazon to the rescue! This is a Carmindy product, of What&#x27;s Not to Wear fame, and I like it a lot. Spray a little bit on a makeup sponge, and pat it on for nice smooth, light coverage. Now that I&#x27;m retired, I don&#x27;t often wear makeup but when I do, I always feel well-finished with this product.</li>
            <li> Great for light coverage. It goes on very smoothly with a non-latex sponge.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like this product or not, so I ordered a small amount. I&#x27;ve seen products that are used on What Not to Wear, which is what initially made me want to try something new. This spray makeup is light and very easy to apply. It looks great and stays on all day. I have a light skin tone, so this shade worked perfectly for me. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I am not that impressed with this item.  It is Okay if you plan to use this and only this as your foundation.  I used it with a BB cream under it and applied it by spraying a cosmetic sponge and it just didn&#x27;t work well.  Alone it works Okay, it is a very shear and light foundation.  I am a woman in my 30s and prefer a more dewy look so that wrinkles aren&#x27;t so obvious.  This product leaves a dry tight feel to skin.  I tried because Carmendy makes it look so easy to use on WNTW, but I am not completely sold on this product.</li>
            <li> Liked the product.  Didn&#x27;t realize it would be that hard to locate more.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and while watching What Not To Wear, as others have noted, Carmindy suggests spray makeup for oily skin...  So I decided to try it out!  I LOVE it!  It gives an even coverage without feeling like I have makeup on...  I just lightly dust my powder on after, and I&#x27;m good to go :)  I use a latex free sponge to put it on, as Carmindy suggested, and it works great!</li>
            <li> I like the shade and spray-on ability, but the price is quite high.  The only way to get this is from those who bought-up the stock on hand.</li>
            <li> I love the product &amp; am disappointed that it no longer is for sale in CVS or anywhere I use to find it except on the internet with Amazon.. I received the other items w/o any problems but this item took 4 times to be received in my home b/c UPS said they needed a signature to leave it &amp; that I couldn&#x27;t sign for it &amp; leave it taped on the door.. That is absolutely stupid.. UPS knows me &amp; that this is my house but because you &amp;#34;DEMANDED I be home It took 4 deliveries.. In the mean time I had yo call UPS to tell them that the next delivery date wouldn&#x27;t work b/c no one would be there until Thursday. They charged me 6.00 for that &amp;#34;Special &amp;#34;delivery date… Absolutely outrageous.. This was the item I needed most b/f leaving the country on Sunday &amp; I couldn&#x27;t get the item b/c of this stupid situation. So no I was not pleased with the means of delivery but love the product or wouldn&#x27;t had gone to thru the agony I went thru..</li>
            <li> I love this make up. Although the last time I bought it I to a shade to dark. But I still used it :p</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and was packaged like new, but unfortunately when I tried using it I had an itchy blotchy skin reaction to it. My skin is somewhat sensitive, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever had such an immediate problem with a foundation. I was happy with the color how it blended, but I ended up throwing the whole thing out.</li>
            <li> Like other folks, I&#x27;ve seen Carmindy use this product on WNTW.  So when I saw it in my local CVS, I bought a can in \\&quot;light.\\&quot;  I was skeptical given that it was $12 plus for such a small can.  But I have to say, that this is a really nice foundation and I have tried many.  I tend to have somewhat oily skin and I truly believe that this foundation helps mitigate the oil (I would agree with the other reviewer that it must dry out skin a bit).  The coverage is decent and you can build it up.  It&#x27;s not meant to be sprayed directly on your face, but rather, stipple it onto your face using a makeup sponge (just like Carmindy).  I learned some time ago to moisten the make up sponge with water (then wring it out well) prior to applying foundation - that way the sponge won&#x27;t absorb as much of the make up.  I definitely recommend trying it.  The only drawback is the quantity for the price; the 1 oz can lasted me not quite one month.  Trying to find the \\&quot;light\\&quot; color of this make up is so hard: it&#x27;s not at CVS anymore, and on Amazon, it&#x27;s listed at $30 plus dollars!  What the heck?</li>
            <li> The best foundation  ever!</li>
            <li> Decent product.  Not impressed with the coverage.  I use the Sally hansen airbrush legs which has awesome coverage so I was expecting a little more from them.  The shade worked well for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> regular purchase from amazon, good product and price</li>
            <li> Best to use a sponge to blend, lasted all day. Used with Sally Hansen Natural Beauty by Carmindy luminizing face primer and gave an awesome glow.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product which I can no longer find in my local drug store!  Love, love, love it as it looks like no makeup but produces a clean, fresh look.</li>
            <li> I initially only tried this product because of how Carmindy on What Not to Wear described airbrush foundation (I love her WNTW show). I thought this product that she helped create would be really good, as she states that it also contains ingredients that are good for your skin. I also bought the Beautyblender sponge (which I also LOVE) to use with this product, as Carmindy recommends to use a sponge, but I don&#x27;t like the incredible amount of waste generated from using a single-use sponge every day. This first time I tried this, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be enough coverage, as it seemed a little sheer. That was before I realized how to use it correctly. You can layer this product on with your sponge for more coverage, and you can also do something called \\&quot;stippling\\&quot;, where instead of rubbing the sponge with product onto the skin, you press it into the skin for more coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can truthfully say that this is the first foundation that I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t flake off the dry areas of my skin during the times of the year that I have dry skin. It feels light (doesn&#x27;t feel like foundation at all) and makes my skin look healthy and &#x27;glowy&#x27;. I am now a super-fan of this airbrush spray makeup, and I hope they keep selling it for a long time! I recently just wore this airbrush makeup for my engagement photoshoot, and my skin looked beautiful!</li>
            <li> Love it.. Best air makeup for the price. Hard to find locally though, happy to have found it here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this makeup.  I can see why they discontinued it.  It provides no coverage at all.  If you have flawless skin it will give you a hint of color, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> This review is being madr by the most pickiest person you will ever meet with make up! It made my face look flawless&amp; not cakey.  Ilike alot of coverage so it was important it didn&#x27;t look like too much. I have large pours&amp; it minimizes them almost 100%. Its very light&amp;airy i love the moisturized dewy lool it gives. 1bottle lasts me a month&amp; i typically wear make up everyday. I had my bestfriend&amp; sister try it&amp; they ordered it. I could go on all day about this product lol&amp; the price is fair dont think i will be finding anything better!</li>
            <li> I love Sally Hansen Airbrush Makeup. I squirt 2 sprays on a makeup sponge and blot it on my chin, cheeks, and forehead. Then I use the sponge to blend it on my face. It softens, smooths, and hides minor blemishes and wrinkles. I only wish it weren&#x27;t so hard to find.</li>
            <li> Love this foundation! Very lightweight &amp; gets the job done. Perfect for not wanting that cake feeling on your face.</li>
            <li> I like it, delivery was fast.  Price is a bit too high. I would order again and I would order a few more is the price came down.</li>
