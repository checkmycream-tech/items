            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make hair shinier, more manageable, less frizzy or do much of anything.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without it!  </li>
            <li>product is good, but the bottle was received with broken pump-tube inside.  </li>

            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make keratin relaxer last any longer than it normally would.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I have nice hair, but it just took a lot of time.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is not cheap, but it is well worth the money, especially if you have had the salon Keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li>In order for it to work properly, I have to blow dry my hair straight and then use a flat iron on it.</li>

            <li> Great treatment for long hair!  This stuff is great for smoothing fly aways, light frizz, and dry ends. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy or weigh heavy on your hair one bit. My hair is oily and I can&#x27;t use anything that would make it oilier.  I use after shampooing and on the middle to ends every time I comb my hair out.  It makes my hair not only smoother and shinier but gives it more volume and makes it feel thicker.  Its expensive but if you have long hair, you&#x27;ll find this treatment worth the price.  I use it sparingly with good results.  My hair is 30&amp;#34;s long and I use 15-20 squirts after washing and 5 when combing so a bottle will last a long time.  I&#x27;ve seen it in hair boutiques for double the Amazon price.</li>
            <li> I got a Keratin treatment on my hair in the salon.  It&#x27;s not cheap - costs $400 and lasts 12 weeks.  Why did I do it?  Let&#x27;s just say I used to have to spend about an hour every day on my huge hair and if I washed it, it took almost 2 hours to dry it, flat iron it, style it.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I have nice hair, but it just took a lot of time.  Anyway, this product is an absolute must.  It replenishes the Keratin in your hair and it&#x27;s awesome.  I tried an experiment where one day I showered and did not use this replenisher.  The next day I did use it and the difference was a very noticeable one.  This stuff is not cheap, but it is well worth the money, especially if you have had the salon Keratin treatment.  It will keep your hair looking like it did when you left the salon.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my expensive salon recommended it.  I bought it on Amazon for a bit less.  This stuff is expensive; but, it works</li>
            <li> Be sure to check the expiration dates. Product has shelf life of 2yrs and markdown mania sold be a bottle with about 6 months left. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Works well, but doesn&#x27;t leave hair as soft as I would like.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I love it</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It completely handles my hair- no frizz! Plus, it is not greasy or oily! Perfect on wet or dry hair!</li>
            <li> product is good, but the bottle was received with broken pump-tube inside.  Now I have to open the bottle and try to scoop the product out.</li>
            <li> I have  curly hair and this product  doesn&#x27;t weigh  down the curl and keeps the hair follicle smooth.  Great Product.</li>
            <li> After going to my regular hair salon, my hair dresser recommended I get this. It was much more expensive at the store so I decided to try it here. Afraid that it might be a fake, I bought it anyway. VERY pleased with the product. Smells exactly the same as the hair salon’s and works like a charm. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any difference with my hair by using this product.  I don&#x27;t think i would buy it again.</li>
            <li> very smooth and silky</li>
            <li> Bought this at the end of June 2014 and opened the bottle today. The product is a lot darker and thicker than it should be.  Looked on the bottle of the bottle and it expired September 2013! Not happy!</li>
            <li> There is nothing special about this conditioner to make it worth the price. It doesn&#x27;t make keratin relaxer last any longer than it normally would. It doesn&#x27;t make hair shinier, more manageable, less frizzy or do much of anything. It is an overpriced so so conditioner.</li>
            <li> Product arrived timely.  Its great for very fine hair adding body and infusions of keratin for healthy hair.  Would recommend this product for anyone with problem hair.</li>
            <li> Bottle was cracked and there was no interior tube for the pump to work.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Keratin Complex is the best product in the world!  It&#x27;s a fabulous product.  I couldn&#x27;t live without it!  It gives my hair the &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; it needs.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is really good. Love it!</li>
            <li> The pump does not work. I have to dig the product out with a nail file</li>
            <li> Fabulous hair product!! Can be used on dry hair to calm frizz and curls- can be used on wet hair for drying naturally or blow drying smooth- awesome product!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, keeps my frizzy hair smoothe.</li>
            <li> Both bottles that I ordered tops were broken and couldn&#x27;t get anything out of it.  Had to use an old bottle that I had.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and hate it. I finally got a Keratin two years ago, and it changed my life. Between treatments, I use this product, and it does wonders. I love it and can&#x27;t do without it. Just to clarify, this product is not a conditioner. It&#x27;s a leave in replenisher. In order for it to work properly, I have to blow dry my hair straight and then use a flat iron on it. It makes my keratin treatment last much, much longer. In addition, it makes my hair feel really soft. Good stuff!</li>
