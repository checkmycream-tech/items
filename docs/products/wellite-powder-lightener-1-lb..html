            <li>No toner needed because the shade was gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>As a first time bleacher, I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use gloves and cover everything around you when doing an at-home job!</li>
            <li>Then I do two more for a platinum look!</li>
            <li>Love this lightener, gets the job done!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The absolute best!</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own hair for years</li>
            <li>I have been dying my own hair for 10 years, my hair has seen a lot of ups, a lot of downs, a variety of colors, and a loooot of damage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my own hair and 360 grams of hair extensions</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This bleach works great and is very gentle.</li>
            <li>Have tried many bleaches, but Wellite is definitely one of the best, and the price cannot be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix one ounce of Wellite powder with 2 ounces of Clairol 30 vol.</li>
            <li>Took a peek before rinsing, and the lift was fantastic!  </li>
            <li>love the bleach</li>
            <li>The top was some how glued onto the container portion, and by the time I was able to pry it off, the top cracked and broke off in pieces.  </li>
            <li>I did this with no help so it should come out better if you have someone to help you.  </li>
            <li>My favorite bleach powder I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As a cosmetologist I have used many types of powdered bleach.</li>
            <li>You can tell a difference in quality of bleaches which often gets better</li>
            <li>This bleach is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend applying Infusium 23 Leave In Treatment post conditioning, which is a fab reconstructor which imparts great</li>
            <li>Have come to realize that the most economical and effective way to lighten my hair is by bleaching.  </li>
            <li>After all the damage my scalp and hair has experienced with my &amp;#34;experiments&amp;#34;, my scalp has become very sensitive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, a tub of this is a huge value.  </li>
            <li>I have very short hair like shaved type deal lol</li>
            <li>When you finally find a great product that works this</li>
            <li>Make sure you apply a good deep conditioner/hair mask afterwards.  </li>
            <li>and still this is superb, gentle and helps it grow in nicely instead of coarse and fragile.</li>
            <li>it was such a pretty tone lol)</li>
            <li>Right now I am currently on a journey to much healthier and much longer hair, and I am happy to say that this product is a part of it!</li>
            <li>It is so fine (like powdered sugar) that if you don&#x27;t mix it thoroughly really!</li>
            <li>It seemed mild to my skin.  </li>
            <li>:) Just be sure to wear gloves and have the proper accessories (developer, brushes, and a bowl, and someone to help you get those hard-to-reach areas!)</li>
            <li>go for it if ur looking for something to quickly lighten ur hair</li>
            <li>my container that the bleach comes in is heavily damaged but the box is fine, which means it was shipped this way...not good ðŸ˜£</li>
            <li>the higher the price(go figure right!).</li>
            <li>The results are amazing my hair is white!</li>
            <li>Since I do have dark hair I have to reprocess it, and when I do it comes out amazing!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money and would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s nervous about bleaching your hair.</li>
            <li>at first I was buying a small packet for four dollars, instead I found this nice big bucket ( Im a happy girl).</li>
            <li>Very gentle to my baby-fine hair.</li>
            <li>Of course, after the first bleaching it turned out orange, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting otherwise.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a higher end brand</li>
            <li>It was able to do my red highlights.</li>
            <li>:) I will buy the tub from Amazon next time.</li>
            <li>Just sorry they no longer sell it at Sally&#x27;s, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>I still proceeded with the process and it did absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>sure you have thick/tough skin when attempting to open the container!</li>
            <li>The seller contacted me quickly and revised my issue and sent a new package.</li>
            <li>But this stuff is so gentle I was able to bleach it again within the same week.</li>
            <li>this product pulled the color with amazing results, I use 40 volume, my hair is fine &amp; auburn but is extremely tough to pull the color out.</li>
            <li>I am a dark ash blonde/gray and hair is very strong.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t leave it on too long at one time but even in the little amount of time I have it on it bleaches beautifully.</li>
            <li>it was pretty cheap and it works very well,ive already touched up my roots and did some highlights nd some other bleached chunks of hair nd still have so much left,really worth it,pretty much no damage</li>
            <li>all while being extremely gentle on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>very reliable hair bleach.</li>
            <li>One pound of Wellite would mean many, many highlighting sessions in your future.  </li>
            <li>I should have left it on for ten more minutes.  </li>
            <li>The other nice thing about this product is that it lasts a pretty long time too!</li>
            <li>Soy4Plex developer (highly recommended)  </li>
            <li>Stays moist, doesn&#x27;r run, doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;fluff up\\&quot; and works super fast.....</li>
            <li>I only had to do it twice to get it light enough to dye it.</li>
            <li>the first and only bleach I use.</li>
            <li>WOW,!</li>
            <li>I used it with the wella 40 volume developer on my dark brown hair (dyed that way) and it lightened it significantly.</li>
            <li>I used Ion sensitive skin developer 30 vol  and didn&#x27;t have any burning and applied it with my hands, rinsing hands ever so often.  </li>
            <li>Its a wonder I havent gone completely bald at some point</li>
            <li>This bleach is so gentle and yet SO powerful, I was able to use it with little to no irritation and it lightened my hair just as much if not better than some of these other harsher bleaches.</li>
            <li>When you have really dark brown hair like me, a good bleach is hard to find.  </li>
            <li>My hair is highly lift resistant and so left mixture on 65 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It made my scalp itchy and it made my hair get really hot, so be careful and try not to let your hair make contact with skin.</li>
            <li>But shampooing and conditioning it heavily afterward and waiting a few days for your natural oils to set back in should leave your hair feeling like it did before (or better!).</li>
            <li>Be careful though because your hair might process much quicker.  </li>
            <li>The bleach I received didn&#x27;t work like the other &#x27;batches&#x27; of the same exact bleach I&#x27;ve gotten before from Sallys.</li>
            <li>take my naturally dark brown hair to platinum snow white with consistent quality results.</li>
            <li>With naturally black hair this bleach take me blonde gold in the first try(30 vol).</li>

            <li> With naturally black hair this bleach take me blonde gold in the first try(30 vol).</li>
            <li> I usually buy it in single packets, because they are just the right size.  </li>
            <li> Just a warning....learned the hard way, mix this stuff in a bowl first, then put in a bottle.  </li>
            <li> My hair color is naturally jet black.</li>
            <li> Took me two bleaching jobs (one week apart) to get to blonde from brunette, Just as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product will be fine--unfortunately, the tub container was almost impossible to open.  </li>
            <li> and it was slightly goldish white.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with 30 vol cream developer and went from dark brown to pale yellow in an hour.  </li>
            <li> I only had a few brassy places.  </li>
            <li> Minimal damage.</li>
            <li> It gets my DARK brown roots to a pale blonde to match the rest of my hair, in 1, 45 minute bleach...with a 20 vol developer!</li>
            <li> Since this IS bleach, it DOES dry out your hair a little bit.</li>
            <li> No more ridiculously priced &amp;#34;pro-formula&amp;#34; bleaches that costs me so much out-of-pocket.</li>
            <li> but there were some brown and black spots.</li>
            <li> It does damage your hair, it fried my ends and dried out my hair that I had to cut it all off.</li>
            <li> I have bleached my hair for 25 years, skipped a few years, but still know the process....</li>
            <li> This however has become my go-to powdered bleach for the past year.</li>
            <li> and they told me that it was too late and that maybe I should contact the manufacturer or read my directions.</li>
            <li> it was very gentle on my hair and doesn&#x27;t smell terrible.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to any and every person bleaching their hair, you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> AN EXPIRED OR FAKE PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> It smells so bad like bleach for laundry.</li>

            <li> When you have really dark brown hair like me, a good bleach is hard to find.  This bleach is SUPERB!  Stays moist, doesn&#x27;r run, doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;fluff up\\&quot; and works super fast.....all while being extremely gentle on the scalp.  I mixed it with 30 vol cream developer and went from dark brown to pale yellow in an hour.  I did put saran-wrap on my head and used my blow dryer for about 5 minutes.  No bleach burn or redness!  FANTASTI PRODUCT!!! (Good bye BW 2!!!)</li>
            <li> I am a dark ash blonde/gray and hair is very strong.  This and 30 vol developer lifted almost perfect in and hour.  I should have left it on for ten more minutes.  I only had a few brassy places.  I used Ion sensitive skin developer 30 vol  and didn&#x27;t have any burning and applied it with my hands, rinsing hands ever so often.  It seemed mild to my skin.  Good product. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This bleach works great and is very gentle. I used it with the wella 40 volume developer on my dark brown hair (dyed that way) and it lightened it significantly. Of course, after the first bleaching it turned out orange, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting otherwise. But this stuff is so gentle I was able to bleach it again within the same week. Since this IS bleach, it DOES dry out your hair a little bit. But shampooing and conditioning it heavily afterward and waiting a few days for your natural oils to set back in should leave your hair feeling like it did before (or better!).

Definitely worth the money and would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s nervous about bleaching your hair. :) Just be sure to wear gloves and have the proper accessories (developer, brushes, and a bowl, and someone to help you get those hard-to-reach areas!)</li>
            <li> Took me two bleaching jobs (one week apart) to get to blonde from brunette, Just as expected. Be sure to use gloves and cover everything around you when doing an at-home job!</li>
            <li> My product was destroyed when it arrived..</li>
            <li> very reliable hair bleach. always lightens my hair to its max. With naturally black hair this bleach take me blonde gold in the first try(30 vol). Then I do two more for a platinum look! amazing!!!</li>
            <li> For reference, I have 20-30% gray/dark blonde/strawberry blonde hair.  Have come to realize that the most economical and effective way to lighten my hair is by bleaching.  Have tried many bleaches, but Wellite is definitely one of the best, and the price cannot be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix one ounce of Wellite powder with 2 ounces of Clairol 30 vol. Soy4Plex developer (highly recommended)  It&#x27;s a 1:2 ratio (1 ounce of bleach to 2 ounces of developer).  Throw in a dash (teaspoon) of macadamia oil or coconut/olive oil for conditioning.  Mix throughly and allow it to stand a minute.  Let it thicken.  Did a foil on bangs and four of the rest of hair, doing my bangs (which were already lightened) last.  My hair is highly lift resistant and so left mixture on 65 minutes.  Be careful though because your hair might process much quicker.  Proceed on the side of caution.  Took a peek before rinsing, and the lift was fantastic!  Five levels?  No toner needed because the shade was gorgeous.  Minimal damage. Make sure you apply a good deep conditioner/hair mask afterwards.  Highly recommend applying Infusium 23 Leave In Treatment post conditioning, which is a fab reconstructor which imparts great slip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, a tub of this is a huge value.  One pound of Wellite would mean many, many highlighting sessions in your future.  So, if you&#x27;re dreaming of going blonde, why not go all the way . . . to platinum!</li>
            <li> Update !!!! The seller contacted me quickly and revised my issue and sent a new package. I will be purchasing again thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the bleach but im iffy on the seller...my container that the bleach comes in is heavily damaged but the box is fine, which means it was shipped this way...not good ðŸ˜£&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The absolute best! the first and only bleach I use. at first I was buying a small packet for four dollars, instead I found this nice big bucket ( Im a happy girl). So I used the wella 40 developer with the bleach, making it into a paste for a concentrated bleaching. The results are amazing my hair is white! (i contemplated not toning it was such a pretty tone lol) but I do not like any gold tones and it was slightly goldish white. it was very gentle on my hair and doesn&#x27;t smell terrible. I will keep using this product. Also! I have very short hair like shaved type deal lol and still this is superb, gentle and helps it grow in nicely instead of coarse and fragile.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a higher end brand but it fried My hair even with a low volume!!</li>
            <li> it was pretty cheap and it works very well,ive already touched up my roots and did some highlights nd some other bleached chunks of hair nd still have so much left,really worth it,pretty much no damage</li>
            <li> I have used Wellite Powder Lightener for quite some time.  I usually buy it in single packets, because they are just the right size.  I have started doing my hair differently, so decided to get the &amp;#34;tub.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m sure the product will be fine--unfortunately, the tub container was almost impossible to open.  The top was some how glued onto the container portion, and by the time I was able to pry it off, the top cracked and broke off in pieces.  I have to find another container now-frustrating and not convenient.</li>
            <li> My hair color is naturally jet black. I wanted to go purple. This product was recommended to me by a Sally&#x27;s employee, she said it was one of their stronger bleaches.   I had to bleach my hair by myself so it didn&#x27;t bleach evenly. After one try, my hair was already yellow but there were some brown and black spots. Keep in mind I did this with no help so it should come out better if you have someone to help you.  I only had to do it twice to get it light enough to dye it. It does damage your hair, it fried my ends and dried out my hair that I had to cut it all off. It smells so bad like bleach for laundry. I recommend a face mask. It made my scalp itchy and it made my hair get really hot, so be careful and try not to let your hair make contact with skin.</li>
            <li> After being referred to Sparks lightener, my hair didn&#x27;t pick any of it up. I bought a packet of this from the same beauty supply store, and oh la la! It was able to do my red highlights. :) I will buy the tub from Amazon next time. This is pro grade for a reason.</li>
            <li> I have bleached my hair for 25 years, skipped a few years, but still know the process....this product pulled the color with amazing results, I use 40 volume, my hair is fine &amp; auburn but is extremely tough to pull the color out. I used to use wellite \\&quot;package\\&quot; included a bottle of blue cream and 2 packs of powder-&amp; 40 volume. Just used this and 40 perfect results.  Just a warning....learned the hard way, mix this stuff in a bowl first, then put in a bottle.  It is so fine (like powdered sugar) that if you don&#x27;t mix it thoroughly really! it will clog your bottles.</li>
            <li> I have tried everywhere the best price and love the quality of the lighting of the product. go for it if ur looking for something to quickly lighten ur hair</li>
            <li> Just sorry they no longer sell it at Sally&#x27;s, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found.  Very gentle to my baby-fine hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite bleach powder I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I take my naturally dark brown hair to platinum snow white with consistent quality results.</li>
            <li> This is the best bleach I&#x27;ve ever used. It gets my DARK brown roots to a pale blonde to match the rest of my hair, in 1, 45 minute bleach...with a 20 vol developer! AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> Excellent, and i&#x27;m usi</li>
            <li> I ordered this and tried using it. When I mixed it with my developer it just turned into liquid, and smelled nothing like hair product. I still proceeded with the process and it did absolutely nothing! A couple weeks later I tried it again. And same thing! So I contacted the seller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NANCYS BEAUTY WAREHOUSE INC. and they told me that it was too late and that maybe I should contact the manufacturer or read my directions. WOW,! I have been doing my own hair for years, I think I know what I&#x27;m doing or else I wouldn&#x27;t be buying a bucket of hair bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went to Sally&#x27;s and bought the same products and guess what? It works!! It&#x27;s amazing. I don&#x27;t leave it on too long at one time but even in the little amount of time I have it on it bleaches beautifully. Since I do have dark hair I have to reprocess it, and when I do it comes out amazing! So I&#x27;m guessing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NANCYS BEAUTY WAREHOUSE GAVE ME AN EXPIRED OR FAKE PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> The bleach I received didn&#x27;t work like the other &#x27;batches&#x27; of the same exact bleach I&#x27;ve gotten before from Sallys. I cut my finger multiple times on the container trying to open it because the design of the lid is NOT good/smart. The design of the tub isn&#x27;t the sellers fault but the manufacturer of the bleach.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you have thick/tough skin when attempting to open the container!</li>
            <li> this product worked great for the look I was trying to achieve. It is very easy to use. Do not forget to always use gloves with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been dying my own hair for 10 years, my hair has seen a lot of ups, a lot of downs, a variety of colors, and a loooot of damage. Its a wonder I havent gone completely bald at some point no joke hah! Right now I am currently on a journey to much healthier and much longer hair, and I am happy to say that this product is a part of it! After all the damage my scalp and hair has experienced with my &amp;#34;experiments&amp;#34;, my scalp has become very sensitive. This bleach is so gentle and yet SO powerful, I was able to use it with little to no irritation and it lightened my hair just as much if not better than some of these other harsher bleaches. The other nice thing about this product is that it lasts a pretty long time too! I&#x27;ve used it on my own hair and 360 grams of hair extensions and I still have quite a bit left over. I highly recommend this product to any and every person bleaching their hair, you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Love this lightener, gets the job done!</li>
            <li> As a cosmetologist I have used many types of powdered bleach. You can tell a difference in quality of bleaches which often gets better the higher the price(go figure right!). This however has become my go-to powdered bleach for the past year. No more ridiculously priced &amp;#34;pro-formula&amp;#34; bleaches that costs me so much out-of-pocket. This bleach is phenomenal. Its lightening capabilities is absolutely wonderful. When retouching roots with my blond clients this bleach has often lifted stubborn hair to the point I dont have to use a toner or a double process to get rid of brassiness or redness. When you finally find a great product that works this well you stick with it &amp; this will always be my go to powder.</li>
