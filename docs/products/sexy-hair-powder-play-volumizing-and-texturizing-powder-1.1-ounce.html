    <ol>
            <li>I feel like I found a best friend for my hair,,,,,this is an amazing product!!!  </li>
            <li>I had heard wonderful things about hair powder.  </li>
            <li>Awesome product!  </li>
            <li>I am torn as to weather to rate this 5 stars as hair texturizing powder is the best thing since sliced bread, but in comparison I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars.  </li>
            <li>but this stuff is the best EVER.  </li>
            <li>If your looking for a awesome root lifter, give it a shot.</li>
            <li>have told everyone I see about it.. and have gotten some great feeback from friends and co-workers.</li>
            <li>Does seem to lift and give volume good though.</li>
            <li>Really loved it</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Works grand!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great to help you style freshly washed, no product built up yet, hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>glad I tried it out.</li>
            <li>i LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>the product... clumps your hair together (for lack of a better description) and holds all day.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Since I found this type of product I no longer have to check if my hair is messed up, because this stuff is like magic hairspray.  </li>
            <li>It really adds great volume to your hair.  </li>
            <li>Works much better than most volumizing sprays and mouses for me</li>
            <li>and I guess there is not an easy fix for that.</li>
            <li>Now that is no longer true, and I am able to go days with style.  </li>
            <li>I wish there was a free sample to try...</li>
            <li>She gave me a free sample</li>
            <li>Not as good as the Schwarzkopf dustit product or the loreal professional product, but it&#x27;s a lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li>It works good, I used it, but when I found out baby powder or any talcum power for a couple bucks does the same thing.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and this product really lets me play with it ,holds great , and at my job</li>
            <li>Super stoked</li>
            <li>Just a small amount does an incredible job in giving my hair volume and texture.  </li>
            <li>This product only takes a tiny bit and my hair looks incredible.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
            <li>My hair is very straight.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that always falls flat regardless of what I do.  </li>
            <li>Always use Big Sexy hair products.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t handle hair much after using it though, it&#x27;s powerful, and it can tangle AFTER using it if you try and brush or curl.</li>
            <li>ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical but read many reviews on here and saw SO much good feedback from people who have hair similar to me (fine and flat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this is the only thing that really gives my hair any body.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I was expecting to much.  </li>
            <li>this really does add texture to any hair.  </li>
            <li>fluff your hair throughout the day and its magic volume all over.  </li>
            <li>It really gives a boost to your hairstyle ..</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t compare it to another product, but this really works.  </li>
            <li>Using this stuff with loreal professional wax (relatively cheap on amazon) or with a fiber by crew type product is a great combination for volume and control while looking dry and natural (as opposed to shiny and stiff).</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for anyone with textured hair or anyone that wants a lift.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair super coarse and viscose-</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product ,,,,,</li>
            <li>A sprinkle of this power on my upside down head/crown adds just the right amount of texture that I can skip teasing my fine hair (when I tease, I can&#x27;t seem to cover up the tangled part with brushed looking hair.  </li>
            <li>This really helps boost ponys into bigger styles with more volume that stays,  Makes one day dirty hair look great and also boosts my hair at the roots when I wear it down straight or curly.  </li>
            <li>But if you curl and backcomb first, then sprinkle some in, you only need a pin or two to hold an updo.</li>
            <li>I had my stylist put some on me after she trimmed my hair today, and it really does seem to hold up my short, fine hair, unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  </li>
            <li>It feels a little sticky on your hands, but wash it off and you are fine.</li>
            <li>It actually has a very similar effect as expensive light hairsprays like loreal professional (not paris, but professional, the good stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much product, a little bit goes a long way! :)</li>
            <li>Your hairstyle will last much longer than it ever would without it.  </li>
            <li>Since I have very short hair, I am able to style my hair differently everyday with this product.</li>
            <li>and I use it whenever I get that flat look but don&#x27;t use too much at a time.</li>
            <li>;, i just mean it requires more of the product for the same effect.  </li>
            <li>I have to say I thought I might be crazy spending so much on a one ounce bottle of something - but the allure of something making my flat hair bigger was too good.  </li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way too which is nice since it is a small bottle.  </li>
            <li>I still do some back combing because I have a crazy natural part in my hair that is all powerful, however, for normal hair you really don&#x27;t need to.  </li>
            <li>Waxes just weigh it down and hairspray can only do so much.</li>
            <li>This causes my hair to have a strange texture and at times, if I lean back in my desk chair, my hair touches the headrest and it feels like the product is causing my roots to be extra sensitive.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about two years now and really enjoy that it gives you volume and texture for thin hair, without looking greasy, gelled, or wet!</li>
            <li> Expensive, I was expecting the powder to be more refined, it is a little granular like salt.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, very short hair, and before I found this product, it was very difficult for me to add volume and texture to my hair.</li>

            <li> (i have dark hair).</li>
            <li> I have very thin and fine hair and my ponytails or updos are so flat and sad.  </li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my hairdresser when I complained about my flat hair.  </li>
            <li> THERE IS A LOT OF PRODUCT IN THAT LITTLE BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> If my hair starts to flatten a little during the day, I just run my fingers through my roots and it gives it a little lift again.  </li>
            <li> I can NOT believe that I have not ever heard of this until a few weeks</li>
            <li> I can definitely feel it though on my scalp, and it feels a bit filmy or dirty.  </li>
            <li> My hairs is thin and this product helps to give the volume I am wanting.</li>
            <li> The instant i placed some on my hair, my hair turned stiff and felt knotted and dirty couldn&#x27;t even brush my hair!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy to pay 20 bucks plus shipping!</li>
            <li> this stuff is really expensive and horrible.</li>

            <li> I bought this item because it was offered as an add on to my order and to my surprise I feel like I found a best friend for my hair,,,,,this is an amazing product!!!  Not only does it deliver on what it is supposed to do, but it also lasts for days.  I was a \\&quot;shampoo every day\\&quot; gal only because that is the only time my hair would do what I wanted it to do.  Now that is no longer true, and I am able to go days with style.  I would highly recommend this product ,,,,,</li>
            <li> I have to say I thought I might be crazy spending so much on a one ounce bottle of something - but the allure of something making my flat hair bigger was too good.

            <li> i LOVE THIS STUFF. IT GIVES INSTANT LIFT. IT IS A LITTLE COSTLY, BUT IT LASTS VERY LONG. THERE IS A LOT OF PRODUCT IN THAT LITTLE BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> Always use Big Sexy hair products. My hairs is thin and this product helps to give the volume I am wanting.</li>

            <li> I had my stylist put some on me after she trimmed my hair today, and it really does seem to hold up my short, fine hair, unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  I can definitely feel it though on my scalp, and it feels a bit filmy or dirty.  I might still purchase a smaller bottle though, and try and work with it and not add it so close to the scalp like the stylist did. I wish there was a free sample to try...</li>
            <li> My hair dresser sells this in her salon for 10 bucks. It&#x27;s crazy to pay 20 bucks plus shipping! It works good, I used it, but when I found out baby powder or any talcum power for a couple bucks does the same thing. I never bought it again. Also my mom told me they were using talc for this decades ago.</li>
            <li> Not much is needed but one must remember to hold your breath when applying.</li>
            <li> A sprinkle of this power on my upside down head/crown adds just the right amount of texture that I can skip teasing my fine hair (when I tease, I can&#x27;t seem to cover up the tangled part with brushed looking hair.

            <li> I have the hardest time getting my hair to stay &amp;#34;up&amp;#34; all day. Waxes just weigh it down and hairspray can only do so much. This product only takes a tiny bit and my hair looks incredible. I don&#x27;t even have to blowdry for volume. Hopefully, the small bottle will last a while.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  This product does everything it claims. My hair is very straight.  All I do is apply, tease, toss and my hair is &amp;#34;big and sexy.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have fine, very short hair, and before I found this product, it was very difficult for me to add volume and texture to my hair. This powder is awesome-it gives my hair both the texture and volume that I want. A little bit goes a long way, and as the day goes on you can just sort of run your hands through your hair to give your hair the volume you want if it starts to flatten.</li>
            <li> this really does add texture to any hair.  i have straight black hair that looks dull without product.  the product... clumps your hair together (for lack of a better description) and holds all day.  fluff your hair throughout the day and its magic volume all over.  a little goes a long way with this product.  will buy again</li>

            <li> It really gives a boost to your hairstyle .. Really loved it dunno if I can go back now ❤️❤️Two thumbs up 👍👍</li>
            <li> Since I have very short hair, I am able to style my hair differently everyday with this product. It&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the Amazon recs. It makes your hair super coarse and viscose- you can&#x27;t pull a brush through it. But if you curl and backcomb first, then sprinkle some in, you only need a pin or two to hold an updo. It goes on white but melts away (i have dark hair).</li>
            <li> The instant i placed some on my hair, my hair turned stiff and felt knotted and dirty couldn&#x27;t even brush my hair!!! this stuff is really expensive and horrible. do not buy this!!!!</li>

            <li> This stuff works so well to make my hair look thicker! I will be ordering more when I run out. I use it every day!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Schwarzkopf dustit product or the loreal professional product, but it&#x27;s a lot cheaper.  By &amp;#34;not as good&amp;#34;, i just mean it requires more of the product for the same effect.  I am torn as to weather to rate this 5 stars as hair texturizing powder is the best thing since sliced bread, but in comparison I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars.

            <li> I have very fine hair that always falls flat regardless of what I do.  I heard this worked well and purchased it to find out for myself.  I can&#x27;t believe the difference it makes.  Just a small amount does an incredible job in giving my hair volume and texture.  Everyone asked what I had done differently.  It feels a little sticky on your hands, but wash it off and you are fine.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and this product really lets me play with it ,holds great , and at my job im on the go all evening</li>
            <li> I LOOOOVE this stuff! I can NOT believe that I have not ever heard of this until a few weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical but read many reviews on here and saw SO much good feedback from people who have hair similar to me (fine and flat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff WORKS!  I don&#x27;t know how but I don&#x27;t care - it is a miracle product, haha!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have told everyone I see about it.. and have gotten some great feeback from friends and co-workers. Super stoked and I hope this never EVER bets discontinued</li>
            <li> Not to overstate anything but this stuff is the best EVER.  I&#x27;ve never tried any other so I can&#x27;t compare it to another product, but this really works.  I still do some back combing because I have a crazy natural part in my hair that is all powerful, however, for normal hair you really don&#x27;t need to.  Your hairstyle will last much longer than it ever would without it.  It really adds great volume to your hair.  It&#x27;s also great to help you style freshly washed, no product built up yet, hair.  If your looking for a awesome root lifter, give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I have very short textured hair powder plays allows me to style with ease. I would highly recommend for anyone with textured hair or anyone that wants a lift.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing&lt;br /&gt;Instantly gives your hair tons of volume. Works much better than most volumizing sprays and mouses for me</li>
