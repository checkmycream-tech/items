            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>i love this hydrosol and the fact that it comes in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li>Having never used a hydrosol I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li>it soaks right in and feels good.  </li>
            <li>Applied right after cleansing, before applying moisturizer, toned my skin and smells good.  </li>
            <li>certainly will recommend, and I will buy more for my loved ones</li>
            <li>It smells AMAZING-I could easily use it as a room spray, but it&#x27;s too precious for that.</li>
            <li>i have an all-natural beauty blog and was quick to tell my readers about this rose water.</li>
            <li>Lovely smell, and the most important is the feeling of it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic Product!&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love</li>
            <li>Summertime skin needs this, Organic Rose Water Mist has a refreshing scent and is cooling on a hot day.  </li>
            <li>But I will say that it is super refreshing to spray on, and it smells lovely.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a great addition to an already solid routine, but even without one I&#x27;m confident it will help improve your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made the switch, I really love this product it leaves my face fresh</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li>my skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li>I do sometimes lightly mist it on after my makeup application though if I&#x27;m looking too matte.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a true pleasure to support a business that&#x27;s both friendly and knowledgeable; Inflora&#x27;s rosewater is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s shelf stable I actually prefer to keep it in the fridge, so that upon application the rose water is cool and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell exactly what I thought roses smelled like, but now I realize its a very sweet natural rose smell.</li>
            <li>It smells like real roses, which I absolutely love.</li>
            <li>and I really think my skin is more supple and radiant because of it.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a good size too so it will last awhile</li>
            <li>The rose water mist is also a perfect present for a girl friend that needs a little pick me up!</li>
            <li>It is important to know the source, pure rosewater is clean light and sweet like fresh roses.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pure soft gentle relaxes th ed countenance, causes great focus</li>
            <li>I had read about rose water prior to my purchasing it but had no idea how much I would love it.</li>
            <li>I like to use this as a makeup setting spray, a face refresher on hot days and as a light fragrance mist when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing a heavier scent.</li>
            <li>I have used other rose water that is much better:</li>
            <li>I also like that there&#x27;s only ONE ingredient--the rose water.</li>
            <li>and it feels like such a nice way to end the day.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making such good quality</li>
            <li>I wanted something natural and sensuous to add to my skin routine and what could be better than roses.</li>
            <li>I spray with the rose water prior to putting on my moisturizer and again after I&#x27;ve applied my make up.</li>
            <li>I love it all natural.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed anything different with my skin since using the rose water.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s organic and natural.</li>
            <li>High quality pure rosewater is a must for a goddess of beauty and love.</li>
            <li>For the first and final touch of gentle face and body care morning and before bed, and any time when I want a refreshing uplift, Inflora&#x27;s Rosewater is at the top of my beauty remedy kit.</li>
            <li>I just wish InFlora would make more stuff because I really appreciate the high quality of their products.</li>
            <li>After foundation and powder, one spray of this rose water adds a bit of &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; back into my face, and the product surprisingly dries down into a pretty, soft semi-matte finish :)  </li>
            <li>a smaller purse size would be nice ;-)</li>
            <li>I was super excited to add to my new regime.  </li>
            <li>I have also sprayed the rose water on my two sons, and they enjoy how it feels and calms them down.  </li>
            <li>and I do believe it is PURE!  </li>
            <li>A friend gave me a bottle of this because she knows I am constantly trying to find good, natural products for my skin.</li>
            <li>It has a rich, true rose scent that, unlike other rosewaters I have used, actually softly scents my skin, hair and clothes and lingers a while.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has such a lovely fragrance and feels like being pampered.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty obsessive about knowing exactly what goes on my skin</li>
            <li>It arrived before it was expected nicely packed.</li>
            <li>On hot days it revitalizes the skin.</li>
            <li>I have been spraying it on my face as a refresher, as it has been extremely hot this week in SoCal.  </li>
            <li>a natural protective clean layer..</li>
            <li>so soft and smelling faintly, naturally sweet.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light, fresh, fragrant (totally natural and pure delicate rose scent) and nourishing.</li>
            <li>I decided to try pure rosewater, and</li>
            <li>The product was mailed out to me in a very timely manner</li>
            <li>In order words, it&#x27;s a multitasker, and a very high-quality one at that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to all ladies out there !</li>
            <li>It smells like real roses.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Am following with rose hip oil mixed with fractionated coconut oil</li>
            <li>I have used other moisturizing sprays before but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find a new facial regime and have been wanting something more natural.</li>
            <li>After comparing similar products from other sellers I found that the 100% Pure &amp; Organic Rose Water Mist was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Another good part of this one is that contains just rose water and doesn&#x27;t have other ingredients like the ones I had before INFLORA; they have  glycerin or other ingredients that make them sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li>This smells just like real roses as opposed to some of those cloying sprays - even the ones that are natural!</li>
            <li>It makes you feel young and refreshed, ready to take on the day.</li>
            <li>Inflora Botanica offers the real essence and nectar of rosewater.</li>
            <li>In any case, the product itself feels luxurious, and there&#x27;s a delicate rose scent to it</li>
            <li>Love this use it everyday.</li>
            <li>...it catches me completely unaware and as I leave the room the special soft pretty scent stays with me..always look forward to it and spray it on several times throughout the day...</li>
            <li>Since I added this to my tried and true routine, I&#x27;ve noticed quite a difference in my skin within the first few days.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>i also spray it in my hair for a light scent and a little moisture.</li>
            <li>but I can already feel how soft my facial skin is and how much brighter it looks.</li>
            <li>when I do this the mist leaves a soft glow..</li>
            <li>natural</li>
            <li>so when my 5 and 2 year old want me to spray some on them</li>

            <li> It smells AMAZING-I could easily use it as a room spray, but it&#x27;s too precious for that.</li>
            <li> i have an all-natural beauty blog and was quick to tell my readers about this rose water.</li>
            <li> Lovely smell, and the most important is the feeling of it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product!&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love</li>
            <li> Summertime skin needs this, Organic Rose Water Mist has a refreshing scent and is cooling on a hot day.  </li>
            <li> But I will say that it is super refreshing to spray on, and it smells lovely.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a great addition to an already solid routine, but even without one I&#x27;m confident it will help improve your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I made the switch, I really love this product it leaves my face fresh</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li> my skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li> I do sometimes lightly mist it on after my makeup application though if I&#x27;m looking too matte.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a true pleasure to support a business that&#x27;s both friendly and knowledgeable; Inflora&#x27;s rosewater is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s shelf stable I actually prefer to keep it in the fridge, so that upon application the rose water is cool and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell exactly what I thought roses smelled like, but now I realize its a very sweet natural rose smell.</li>
            <li> It smells like real roses, which I absolutely love.</li>
            <li> and I really think my skin is more supple and radiant because of it.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a good size too so it will last awhile</li>
            <li> The rose water mist is also a perfect present for a girl friend that needs a little pick me up!</li>
            <li> It is important to know the source, pure rosewater is clean light and sweet like fresh roses.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pure soft gentle relaxes th ed countenance, causes great focus</li>
            <li> I had read about rose water prior to my purchasing it but had no idea how much I would love it.</li>
            <li> I like to use this as a makeup setting spray, a face refresher on hot days and as a light fragrance mist when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing a heavier scent.</li>
            <li> I have used other rose water that is much better:</li>
            <li> I also like that there&#x27;s only ONE ingredient--the rose water.</li>
            <li> and it feels like such a nice way to end the day.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making such good quality</li>
            <li> I wanted something natural and sensuous to add to my skin routine and what could be better than roses.</li>
            <li> I spray with the rose water prior to putting on my moisturizer and again after I&#x27;ve applied my make up.</li>
            <li> I love it all natural.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed anything different with my skin since using the rose water.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s organic and natural.</li>
            <li> High quality pure rosewater is a must for a goddess of beauty and love.</li>
            <li> For the first and final touch of gentle face and body care morning and before bed, and any time when I want a refreshing uplift, Inflora&#x27;s Rosewater is at the top of my beauty remedy kit.</li>
            <li> I just wish InFlora would make more stuff because I really appreciate the high quality of their products.</li>
            <li> After foundation and powder, one spray of this rose water adds a bit of &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; back into my face, and the product surprisingly dries down into a pretty, soft semi-matte finish :)  </li>
            <li> a smaller purse size would be nice ;-)</li>
            <li> I was super excited to add to my new regime.  </li>
            <li> I have also sprayed the rose water on my two sons, and they enjoy how it feels and calms them down.  </li>
            <li> and I do believe it is PURE!  </li>
            <li> A friend gave me a bottle of this because she knows I am constantly trying to find good, natural products for my skin.</li>
            <li> It has a rich, true rose scent that, unlike other rosewaters I have used, actually softly scents my skin, hair and clothes and lingers a while.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has such a lovely fragrance and feels like being pampered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty obsessive about knowing exactly what goes on my skin</li>
            <li> It arrived before it was expected nicely packed.</li>
            <li> On hot days it revitalizes the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been spraying it on my face as a refresher, as it has been extremely hot this week in SoCal.  </li>
            <li> a natural protective clean layer..</li>
            <li> so soft and smelling faintly, naturally sweet.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light, fresh, fragrant (totally natural and pure delicate rose scent) and nourishing.</li>
            <li> I decided to try pure rosewater, and</li>
            <li> The product was mailed out to me in a very timely manner</li>
            <li> In order words, it&#x27;s a multitasker, and a very high-quality one at that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to all ladies out there !</li>
            <li> It smells like real roses.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Am following with rose hip oil mixed with fractionated coconut oil</li>
            <li> I have used other moisturizing sprays before but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a new facial regime and have been wanting something more natural.</li>
            <li> After comparing similar products from other sellers I found that the 100% Pure &amp; Organic Rose Water Mist was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Another good part of this one is that contains just rose water and doesn&#x27;t have other ingredients like the ones I had before INFLORA; they have  glycerin or other ingredients that make them sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> This smells just like real roses as opposed to some of those cloying sprays - even the ones that are natural!</li>
            <li> It makes you feel young and refreshed, ready to take on the day.</li>
            <li> Inflora Botanica offers the real essence and nectar of rosewater.</li>
            <li> In any case, the product itself feels luxurious, and there&#x27;s a delicate rose scent to it</li>
            <li> Love this use it everyday.</li>
            <li> ...it catches me completely unaware and as I leave the room the special soft pretty scent stays with me..always look forward to it and spray it on several times throughout the day...</li>
            <li> Since I added this to my tried and true routine, I&#x27;ve noticed quite a difference in my skin within the first few days.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> i also spray it in my hair for a light scent and a little moisture.</li>
            <li> but I can already feel how soft my facial skin is and how much brighter it looks.</li>
            <li> when I do this the mist leaves a soft glow..</li>
            <li> natural</li>
            <li> so when my 5 and 2 year old want me to spray some on them</li>
            <li> (a lifetime of bad skin will do this to a person), so I love that it&#x27;s just as simple and natural as it claims.</li>
            <li> It also helps to thwart off negative energy which is much needed living and working in the city!</li>
            <li> ( There is a strange smell after it sits on your face for a second that I do t like.</li>
            <li> than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li> I live in a really dry and windy climate, and I probably go overboard spritzing my face and neck each time I leave the house.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Mario Badescu Facial Spray, but it had a lot of other ingredients in it that weren&#x27;t organic.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t dry it...nor makes it oily</li>
            <li> I have seen other products that claim to be a rosewater mist but have like 7 other ingredients as well.</li>
            <li> Living in Vermont is hard in the winter with the low humidity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I am suppose to use the mist before or after the oil?</li>
            <li> use it everyday, keeps my skin feeling refreshed!  </li>
            <li> I get tired of all the commercials and chemicals.</li>
            <li> but I have to admit I was disappointed:</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just got this and I&#x27;m so thrilled with it. Living in Vermont is hard in the winter with the low humidity. This Rosewater mist is wonderful. I also use the Infora Botanical Rosehip oil which I love and this goes perfect with it. I love the way it smells and feels on my face plus it&#x27;s organic!</li>
            <li> I use this every day after a shower, total body spritz - it is luxuriously wonderful, smells divine and feels like it is healing all of my skin&#x27;s woes.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> Just What I need for my skin !</li>
            <li> I used to use the Mario Badescu Facial Spray, but it had a lot of other ingredients in it that weren&#x27;t organic. I decided to try pure rosewater, and Inflora Botanica&#x27;s Rosewater Mist is amazing. It smells like real roses, which I absolutely love. Since I added this to my tried and true routine, I&#x27;ve noticed quite a difference in my skin within the first few days. My complexion is now more even, fewer breakouts, etc. I use this after I&#x27;ve washed my faced and swiped it with my glycolic acid toner. I&#x27;ve been thinking of nixing that toner altogether though. I also spray it on my face to set my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has such a lovely fragrance and feels like being pampered. I think this is a great addition to an already solid routine, but even without one I&#x27;m confident it will help improve your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this rose water mist - it&#x27;s light, fresh, fragrant (totally natural and pure delicate rose scent) and nourishing. I live in a really dry and windy climate, and I probably go overboard spritzing my face and neck each time I leave the house. I use it in conjunction with Inflora&#x27;s Rosehip Oil and I really think my skin is more supple and radiant because of it. The rose water mist is also a perfect present for a girl friend that needs a little pick me up!</li>
            <li> A friend gave me a bottle of this because she knows I am constantly trying to find good, natural products for my skin. This stuff is great. It smells AMAZING-I could easily use it as a room spray, but it&#x27;s too precious for that. instead, i use it when I get out of the tub and it leaves my skin feeling so soft and smelling faintly, naturally sweet. I also like that there&#x27;s only ONE ingredient--the rose water. I have seen other products that claim to be a rosewater mist but have like 7 other ingredients as well. I&#x27;m pretty obsessive about knowing exactly what goes on my skin (a lifetime of bad skin will do this to a person), so I love that it&#x27;s just as simple and natural as it claims.</li>
            <li> I love how this product feels on my skin.  I recently had to get some Actinic Keratosis removed from my face and using this has made all the difference in how my skin is healing from that process.  it soaks right in and feels good.  The product was mailed out to me in a very timely manner and I can&#x27;t wait to see what else INFLORA comes out with next.</li>
            <li> I was debating on getting this one from INFLORA because they are so many on the market, but after some research I decided to get it! Why not?! I ended up loving it! Lovely smell, and the most important is the feeling of it. I use it mostly as setting mist for makeup, after my moisturizer and also just during the day to refresh my face. Another good part of this one is that contains just rose water and doesn&#x27;t have other ingredients like the ones I had before INFLORA; they have  glycerin or other ingredients that make them sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> very refreshing. it feels nice on my face. I like it.</li>
            <li> Have been misting my face with this after showering and it makes my skin feel wonderful. Am following with rose hip oil mixed with fractionated coconut oil and my skin feels hydrated and healthier than it has in a long time. For me this is so much better than the expensive creams out there.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It refreshes my skin through the day and smells wonderful. I have used other moisturizing sprays before but this is my favorite. The bottle is a good size too so it will last awhile</li>
            <li> Everytime I spray this on it amazes me....its as if it just hits every area of my face...it catches me completely unaware and as I leave the room the special soft pretty scent stays with me..always look forward to it and spray it on several times throughout the day...when I do this the mist leaves a soft glow..a natural protective clean layer..i just LOVE this and I do believe it is PURE!  Get some and u will LUV it 2!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a couple weeks now and I like it a lot!  Though it&#x27;s shelf stable I actually prefer to keep it in the fridge, so that upon application the rose water is cool and refreshing.  In any case, the product itself feels luxurious, and there&#x27;s a delicate rose scent to it that&#x27;s extremely pleasant to the nose.  Moreover, though the rose water works well as a skincare item (pre-moisturizer), I&#x27;ve found that I like it best as a finisher to my makeup routine.  After foundation and powder, one spray of this rose water adds a bit of &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; back into my face, and the product surprisingly dries down into a pretty, soft semi-matte finish :)  In order words, it&#x27;s a multitasker, and a very high-quality one at that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, Inflora&#x27;s customer service is as wonderful as ever, and is responsive and honest with questions. I give a five-star rating here not just for the product, but also for the purchase experience.  It&#x27;s a true pleasure to support a business that&#x27;s both friendly and knowledgeable; Inflora&#x27;s rosewater is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Summertime skin needs this, Organic Rose Water Mist has a refreshing scent and is cooling on a hot day.  Applied right after cleansing, before applying moisturizer, toned my skin and smells good.  Scent does not linger.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, I absolutely love it, my skin feels fantastic !!! certainly will recommend, and I will buy more for my loved ones</li>
            <li> Great product, works very well...I found it to be one of the finest products I have ever used. It makes you feel young and refreshed, ready to take on the day.</li>
            <li> I love this item!  Works very well.  Smells Great!  I got this item as part of a review team at a discounted price, in exchange for fair feedback.  I recommend this item, if you are looking for something like this.</li>
            <li> I love my purchase. It arrived before it was expected nicely packed. I tried it and it is great! I highly recommend it to all ladies out there !I It leaves your skin fresh and healthy. Thank you! Great seller!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product,  leaves my skin smelling like roses and it refreshes it too, I love it</li>
            <li> Great quality!  My skin feels so nice.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a new facial regime and have been wanting something more natural. I get tired of all the commercials and chemicals. About a month ago I started using The Inflora Botanica Rosehip seed oil, I love it. I wanna take a bath in it. When I saw the Rosewater Mist I was super excited to add to my new regime.  It doesn&#x27;t smell exactly what I thought roses smelled like, but now I realize its a very sweet natural rose smell. It smells like real roses. I keep it by my bed, I mist before I goto sleep and it feels like such a nice way to end the day. I&#x27;m not sure if I am suppose to use the mist before or after the oil? hmmmm. Maybe if someone reads this they can let me know. Thanks for making such good quality products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. a smaller purse size would be nice ;-)</li>
            <li> Love, love, love.... use it everyday, keeps my skin feeling refreshed!  Great price too!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Also, The company cares about the consumer and is wonderful to work with.</li>
            <li> I had read about rose water prior to my purchasing it but had no idea how much I would love it. I wanted something natural and sensuous to add to my skin routine and what could be better than roses. The fact that INFLORA is organic was a big plus for me. I have used this product for only a week but I can already feel how soft my facial skin is and how much brighter it looks. I spray with the rose water prior to putting on my moisturizer and again after I&#x27;ve applied my make up. I even like to spritz my face again prior to going out in the evening to help revive the way my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt; I add a couple of drops of the Rose Oil to my nightly moisturizer before applying it and my skin is so smooth. I love this company and I love these products. You can&#x27;t over apply rose water and it&#x27;s wonderful for aging skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing product , make skin glow and keep moisture . Will order again . Reccomend it to everyone :))</li>
            <li> I use the rose water mist after cleaning my face.  It makes my face feel refreshed.  It does seem to make my skin more receptive to moisturizer.  On hot days it revitalizes the skin.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and great price. My friend makes her own organic Moroccan Rose Water and this comes closest to handbatched water. I loved the follow up email for usages for those unfamiliar with it. It also helps to thwart off negative energy which is much needed living and working in the city!</li>
            <li> Yum, yum, yum! I LOVE this rose water, and I&#x27;m a picky chick. This smells just like real roses as opposed to some of those cloying sprays - even the ones that are natural! I just wish InFlora would make more stuff because I really appreciate the high quality of their products. Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Just lovely!  Perfect toner.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I made the switch, I really love this product it leaves my face fresh and I feel refreshing. I use three times a day and I can actually see my face glows. Not to mention it&#x27;s organic and the smells is amazing. Its great to use as a toner and after shave as well. I don&#x27;t see razor burns anymore and my wife uses it after shaving her legs. I love it all natural.</li>
            <li> Ramadan Mubarak&lt;br /&gt;The Prophets spray,&lt;br /&gt;It us written he used Rose water to pray&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it it&#x27;s pure soft gentle relaxes th ed countenance, causes great focus, very happy Shukran,,or thankyou</li>
            <li> Great price!! So refreshing! I use this a couple times per day and I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this rosewater. It has a rich, true rose scent that, unlike other rosewaters I have used, actually softly scents my skin, hair and clothes and lingers a while. I like to use this as a makeup setting spray, a face refresher on hot days and as a light fragrance mist when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing a heavier scent. If you like rosewater, you need to try this brand!</li>
            <li> I have used other rose water that is much better:( I thought this would a good choice but I have to admit I was disappointed:( There is a strange smell after it sits on your face for a second that I do t like.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed anything different with my skin since using the rose water.  But I will say that it is super refreshing to spray on, and it smells lovely.  I like that it&#x27;s organic and all natural so when my 5 and 2 year old want me to spray some on them I don&#x27;t have to worry about spraying chemicals on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that some people use this as a bit of a setting spray. I can&#x27;t speak for the quality of that.  I do sometimes lightly mist it on after my makeup application though if I&#x27;m looking too matte.</li>
            <li> I have been using this before my make up to hydrate my skin. It works well. The water is a bit thicker than I would like but it still feels great on the skin . I love the quality of the product and the smell!  the bottle is glass and a very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this at a discount for my honest review</li>
            <li> Feels really good on skin...&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t dry it...nor makes it oily (i have combination sin)... Will buy again )</li>
            <li> High quality pure rosewater is a must for a goddess of beauty and love. It is important to know the source, pure rosewater is clean light and sweet like fresh roses. Inflora Botanica offers the real essence and nectar of rosewater. For the first and final touch of gentle face and body care morning and before bed, and any time when I want a refreshing uplift, Inflora&#x27;s Rosewater is at the top of my beauty remedy kit.</li>
            <li> This rosewater is awesome! It sprays well, smells good. I have very sensitive skin but this works well on my skin. Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this use it everyday. Has become a staple in my beauty regamin along with the rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> The one thing that caught my eye was that this mist is organic, and I only use organic skincare items for my face.  I have been spraying it on my face as a refresher, as it has been extremely hot this week in SoCal.  It feels wonderful and refreshing when I spray it on my face.  I have also sprayed the rose water on my two sons, and they enjoy how it feels and calms them down.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product!&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;So refreshing and smells like rose petals are all over me.  I love the fact that it&#x27;s organic and natural.</li>
            <li> Love this product. after reading an article in a magazine about using rose water as a toner I decided to give it a try. The smell is fantastic.  Smells like you just walked into the florist.  After comparing similar products from other sellers I found that the 100% Pure &amp; Organic Rose Water Mist was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> i love this hydrosol and the fact that it comes in a spray bottle. i have an all-natural beauty blog and was quick to tell my readers about this rose water. it smells so good and leaves my skin refreshed. i also spray it in my hair for a light scent and a little moisture. i will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m attracted to everything rose and this is no exception.  Having never used a hydrosol I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  After cleansing at night I found it to work as a nice finishing spray.  And after applying make-up in the morning it works as a setting spray.  This will likely be product I will continue to use.  Nothing not to like.</li>
            <li> Really refreshing! I&#x27;ve started spraying it on my chest and thighs, and feel like I&#x27;ve seen improvement in my skin tone.</li>
