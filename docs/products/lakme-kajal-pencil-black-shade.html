            <li>As someone with with oily skin, I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the \\&quot;bleeding\\</li>
            <li>works awesome did not have to burn the end to make it show up on my eyes</li>
            <li>Perfect consistency, the thickness of the pencil is perfect for cat eyes</li>

            <li>I am still searching for the perfect kajal product.</li>

            <li>Great price, and</li>
            <li>I am soo glad that I did!!</li>

            <li>/&gt;This is amazing!</li>

            <li>Lakme Kajal is a good kajal.</li>
            <li>Good product, kajal is protective to eyes.</li>
            <li>It smells quite good too.  </li>
            <li>, it is just gorgeous when applied on the waterline.</li>
            <li>Having grown up in India and purchased Lakme products, I thought this would be good and not smudge.</li>
            <li>I think smudged kajal looks good on tanned skin, but not on fair skin.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re in a hurry, this is great because it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the pencil itself didnt come wrapped in any kind of plastic or cardboard.</li>
            <li>It does smudge very easily so if your not going for the smudge look you need to learn to refrain from rubbing your eye with it on otherwise your eyeliner would be ruined.</li>
            <li>went on very easy and does not make my eyes itch like some I have tried</li>
            <li>This product is really nice, I love it.</li>
            <li>A true kajal (good for your eyes)</li>
            <li>and i love it its so creamy and easy to apply!</li>
            <li>However it gets a 5 star because it goes on very smooth</li>
            <li>The kajal is nice and it glides on easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, goes on creamy, and get smudged perfectly with a brush full of eye shadow smudging it into place</li>
            <li>Great quality, good color, soft to apply, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love the color on this.</li>
            <li>, I use it as for sunnah purposes in my water lines (top and bottom) and</li>
            <li>This eyeliner stays on especially on my waterline which is awesome.</li>
            <li>and I will buy again! :&gt;</li>
            <li>I ordered this pencil, it came with a plastic top.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love these eyeliner pencils.</li>
            <li>Probably better to wear in the winter and for someone with drier skin.</li>
            <li>Must buy! :-)</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and the colo Is great compared to others.</li>
            <li>For me buying this online was the best option as our local desi shop does&#x27;nt carry Lakme Kajal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I met her.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>pencil arrived in perfect condition and I have not had any issues sharpening it with a standard duo slot eyeliner sharpener.</li>
            <li>De todos los delineadores que he utilizado, este ha sido el mejor, estoy muy contenta con este producto lo seguire utilizando, me dura todo el dia :), me gustaria encontrar un rimel de la misma calidad</li>
            <li>Was very excited about this pencil.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and so smooth.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to put on and comfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was on amazon looking for a good quality eyeliner with a fairly reasonable price.</li>
            <li>kajal is very portable and smells really good.</li>
            <li>Lakme is owned by Unilever so the quality of the product is good and price reasonable.</li>
            <li>In comparison to any liner other than gel, this is the best there is.  </li>
            <li>This pencil gives you a great smoky eye but it won&#x27;t stay unless you really seal it with a primer first and a shadow on top.</li>
            <li>But other than that, it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li>and i gave it three stars because its smears way to easily.</li>
            <li>it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Well it suits me just fine when I apply it over the eye lid</li>
            <li>super raccoon eyes!</li>
            <li>They apply smoothly, are jet black and the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This is great, lasts long, easy to apply, easy to sharpen.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the product does go on smoothly but will smudge, if you want it to.</li>
            <li>the golden part on the top of the pencil comes off.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied - I most definitely will buy this product again.</li>
            <li>WAS EXCITED</li>
            <li>I Love it and will be reordering this very soon!  </li>
            <li>service and shipping was great and Lakme Kajal Pencil was just what I had expected it to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my wide brown eyes look even more wider and more exotic and people stare at me now (even though that wasn&#x27;t my purpose in buying it).</li>
            <li>, it is a bit smudgy, but as I use it mostly on my waterline, this effect is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This top is prone to cracking which can be very problematic if you travel with your liners.  </li>
            <li>I like a full smudgy line around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>What is more amazing about this product is how long it lasts!</li>
            <li>and I am nor able to use any other kind of eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It sharpens quite easily with a large makeup pencil sharpener.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product I bought it for only .01$</li>
            <li>This product is extremely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well I stumbled upon this item and seeing how all the reviews were very positive I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I actually bought my first Lakme kajal because of kajal&#x27;s reported \\&quot;cooling effect\\&quot; (camphor) and because the idea of a moisturizing natural product to put inside my waterline sounded great with my burnt out college student eyes.</li>
            <li>it is a very large pencil it stays on for the day</li>
            <li>my most favorite black eyeliner...</li>
            <li>It applies nicely - it&#x27;s very smooth and black, smells great, and lasts long!</li>
            <li>I also discovered that if you place the kajal in the fridge before you use it, you will end up with a nice defined line along your lower line and it also is much easier to apply on your upper lids.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t wanna go this far and buy something like that, I recommend you to go to your local dollar store and get one of those Make Up Remover Wipes; they also do good work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and lasts pretty much throughout the whole day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second pencil and will happily recommend it to anyone, though for true staying power and extreme drama, try your hand at gel liners, too.</li>
            <li>they make my eyes really pop!  </li>
            <li>You can define your eyes, upper and lower, or smudge your top lid for the \\&quot;smoky\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li>WAS DISAPOINTED , FIRST IT WAS NOT SEALED IN ANY WAY</li>
            <li>At first look, I thought they have sent me a used one.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t stand up to the hot Indian sun as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s that remover with blue on top and transparent liquid on the bottom).</li>
            <li>It really makes even the darkest eyes pop!</li>
            <li>This was the first one I used.</li>
            <li>overall, I&#x27;d just say it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It stung a bit at first, but it doesn&#x27;t anymore</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth, rich, and dark</li>
            <li>That being said, this kajal is the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot;, super black, pure and very lovely.</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful dark black and easy to blend.</li>
            <li>the pencil is plastic and its about 4.5 inches long with the top on and 4 inches without the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the outer rims of the eyes, this product goes where you want it, smudges as you want it and pretty much stays put for the day.  </li>
            <li>Whole tip crumbled and fell to the ground on first use.  </li>
            <li>its nice and black.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and works well overall.</li>
            <li>it is nice black color&lt;br /&gt;eyes</li>
            <li>its nice and black but it smells..</li>
            <li>Made in India from castor oil, the stuff is pure and medicinal.</li>
            <li>with a large sharpener.  </li>
            <li>It really does help to place the pencil in the freezer for an hour or two before you sharpen it and any sharpener with a large hole</li>
            <li>It glides on easily, it&#x27;s nice and dark and it made my eyelashes grow in just 2 days!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is quite tough to remove only with water, so my NYX Eye and Lip Remover is what I found works the best</li>
            <li>cuz i really couldnt tell you.</li>
            <li>purchased it primarily to function as an inner rim eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as smooth as what I hoped it to be, and it totally smudges, even if just applied to the waterline.</li>
            <li>I can go with it for a whole day that it will look almost just as like when I applied it in the</li>
            <li>It makes putting on my eye makeup much easier.</li>
            <li>For the price I paid (what I would have expected to pay back in India), it is extremely good.  </li>
            <li>It does take practice with applying it, and yes it does smear more than typical liner -</li>
            <li>But as I am allergic to almond oil, which is in most ayurvedic formulas from India, and wasn&#x27;t a fan of the idea of putting anything in my eyes like the parabens in western eyeliners or the  possible lead in the Arabic ones, I was at a loss until I found Lakme.</li>
            <li>and I have tried so many different types of eyeliners and this one is the only one that does not make my eyes itch.  </li>
            <li>Nothing particularly special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The kajal looked like I just applied it even 5 hours when I actually tried it for the first time!</li>
            <li>and it has natural ingredients!!</li>
            <li>However, it does smudge easily but that won&#x27;t be a problem for much longer with the colder weather coming (less sweating)  </li>
            <li>so I have to be very careful of the type of liner I use because it may easily print on my lids.</li>
            <li>For one thing, the stick is a bit fat and wide for a truly smooth application.</li>
            <li>It has a nice thick lining which makes it easier to get the trendy thick lining look.</li>
            <li>All in all, Kajal is definately my new eyeliner, though I may try a few more brands along the way.</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my eyes at all and the color is VERY BLACK which I love.</li>
            <li>I live in Washington state.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even look in a new condition.</li>
            <li>Used khol my whole life, love it, but it&#x27;s hard to apply.</li>
            <li>: When you add the cost of shipping (or free prime), it is slightly more expensive than perhaps at a desi shop.</li>
            <li>I love this little eyeliner!</li>
            <li>Most standard liner sharpeners will have two holes, one for standard pencils and one for slightly larger pencils.  </li>
            <li>so thats a pretty big pain in the butt</li>
            <li>I have tried many kajal products in the past and all of them smudge.</li>
            <li>I use this mainly on my top lid due to all the smudging, but likely would not purchase again.</li>
            <li>It looked okay, but I had more issues with this one smudging badly than with others I got.</li>
            <li>this stuff has great pigment, but smudges like crazy...</li>
            <li>/&gt;as far as a beauty product i like it.</li>
            <li>so far, i would recommend this to family and friends.</li>
            <li>&amp; although it took foreeeevvvveeer for it to finally come in the mail (I really shouldn&#x27;t complain since the product&#x27;s from India</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to any woman who wants to look even prettier than she already is.</li>
            <li>I have developed an allergy</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>plastic surrounding the kajal is soft and can be sharpened.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a pretty long pencil.</li>
            <li>but It doesn&#x27;t give me any allergic reaction , and im extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes, so it could be because of that, and THAT could be why I had smudging problems with this one as my eyes got a bit watery using it</li>
            <li>did find it to be kind of irritating for my eyes though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s jet black and has a nice dark color.</li>
            <li>Since my friend went back to India and the kajal she left me ran out, I have been in a intense unsuccessful search for a new one!</li>
            <li>At first I thought it didn&#x27;t until I realized the bigger sharpener can be converted to even bigger if you take the ring around it out of the way...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells like sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a liner, not black eyeshadow that smudges everywhere.</li>
            <li>If you want a smooth, silky and dark pencil this is it!!</li>
            <li>I found it kind of unpleasant and all, but might work better for some people with less sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I WAS IN DESPERATE NEED OF KAJAL :p)</li>
            <li>but it is not hard to do and took me like the 3rd application to get it how I wanted.</li>
            <li>Not only its the true black</li>
            <li>I buy ten at a time because they do run down quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>it NEVER makes my sensitive eyes turn red or water.</li>
            <li>This certainly would if I didn&#x27;t set it with black shadow, and apply setting powder on before it as well.</li>
            <li>I found the lid would come off, smearing black liner throughout my bag, very easily.&lt;br</li>

            <li> It is very comfortable to put on and comfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was on amazon looking for a good quality eyeliner with a fairly reasonable price.</li>
            <li> kajal is very portable and smells really good.</li>
            <li> Lakme is owned by Unilever so the quality of the product is good and price reasonable.</li>
            <li> In comparison to any liner other than gel, this is the best there is.  </li>
            <li> This pencil gives you a great smoky eye but it won&#x27;t stay unless you really seal it with a primer first and a shadow on top.</li>
            <li> But other than that, it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li> and i gave it three stars because its smears way to easily.</li>
            <li> it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Well it suits me just fine when I apply it over the eye lid</li>
            <li> super raccoon eyes!</li>
            <li> They apply smoothly, are jet black and the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is great, lasts long, easy to apply, easy to sharpen.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the product does go on smoothly but will smudge, if you want it to.</li>
            <li> the golden part on the top of the pencil comes off.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied - I most definitely will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> WAS EXCITED</li>
            <li> I Love it and will be reordering this very soon!  </li>
            <li> service and shipping was great and Lakme Kajal Pencil was just what I had expected it to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my wide brown eyes look even more wider and more exotic and people stare at me now (even though that wasn&#x27;t my purpose in buying it).</li>
            <li> , it is a bit smudgy, but as I use it mostly on my waterline, this effect is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This top is prone to cracking which can be very problematic if you travel with your liners.  </li>
            <li> I like a full smudgy line around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> What is more amazing about this product is how long it lasts!</li>
            <li> and I am nor able to use any other kind of eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It sharpens quite easily with a large makeup pencil sharpener.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product I bought it for only .01$</li>
            <li> This product is extremely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well I stumbled upon this item and seeing how all the reviews were very positive I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I actually bought my first Lakme kajal because of kajal&#x27;s reported \\&quot;cooling effect\\&quot; (camphor) and because the idea of a moisturizing natural product to put inside my waterline sounded great with my burnt out college student eyes.</li>
            <li> it is a very large pencil it stays on for the day</li>
            <li> my most favorite black eyeliner...</li>
            <li> It applies nicely - it&#x27;s very smooth and black, smells great, and lasts long!</li>
            <li> I also discovered that if you place the kajal in the fridge before you use it, you will end up with a nice defined line along your lower line and it also is much easier to apply on your upper lids.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t wanna go this far and buy something like that, I recommend you to go to your local dollar store and get one of those Make Up Remover Wipes; they also do good work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly and lasts pretty much throughout the whole day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second pencil and will happily recommend it to anyone, though for true staying power and extreme drama, try your hand at gel liners, too.</li>
            <li> they make my eyes really pop!  </li>
            <li> You can define your eyes, upper and lower, or smudge your top lid for the \\&quot;smoky\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li> WAS DISAPOINTED , FIRST IT WAS NOT SEALED IN ANY WAY</li>
            <li> At first look, I thought they have sent me a used one.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stand up to the hot Indian sun as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s that remover with blue on top and transparent liquid on the bottom).</li>
            <li> It really makes even the darkest eyes pop!</li>
            <li> This was the first one I used.</li>
            <li> overall, I&#x27;d just say it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> It stung a bit at first, but it doesn&#x27;t anymore</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth, rich, and dark</li>
            <li> That being said, this kajal is the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot;, super black, pure and very lovely.</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful dark black and easy to blend.</li>
            <li> the pencil is plastic and its about 4.5 inches long with the top on and 4 inches without the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the outer rims of the eyes, this product goes where you want it, smudges as you want it and pretty much stays put for the day.  </li>
            <li> Whole tip crumbled and fell to the ground on first use.  </li>
            <li> its nice and black.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and works well overall.</li>
            <li> it is nice black color&lt;br /&gt;eyes</li>
            <li> its nice and black but it smells..</li>
            <li> Made in India from castor oil, the stuff is pure and medicinal.</li>
            <li> with a large sharpener.  </li>
            <li> It really does help to place the pencil in the freezer for an hour or two before you sharpen it and any sharpener with a large hole</li>
            <li> It glides on easily, it&#x27;s nice and dark and it made my eyelashes grow in just 2 days!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is quite tough to remove only with water, so my NYX Eye and Lip Remover is what I found works the best</li>
            <li> cuz i really couldnt tell you.</li>
            <li> purchased it primarily to function as an inner rim eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as smooth as what I hoped it to be, and it totally smudges, even if just applied to the waterline.</li>
            <li> I can go with it for a whole day that it will look almost just as like when I applied it in the</li>
            <li> It makes putting on my eye makeup much easier.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid (what I would have expected to pay back in India), it is extremely good.  </li>
            <li> It does take practice with applying it, and yes it does smear more than typical liner -</li>
            <li> But as I am allergic to almond oil, which is in most ayurvedic formulas from India, and wasn&#x27;t a fan of the idea of putting anything in my eyes like the parabens in western eyeliners or the  possible lead in the Arabic ones, I was at a loss until I found Lakme.</li>
            <li> and I have tried so many different types of eyeliners and this one is the only one that does not make my eyes itch.  </li>
            <li> Nothing particularly special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The kajal looked like I just applied it even 5 hours when I actually tried it for the first time!</li>
            <li> and it has natural ingredients!!</li>
            <li> However, it does smudge easily but that won&#x27;t be a problem for much longer with the colder weather coming (less sweating)  </li>
            <li> so I have to be very careful of the type of liner I use because it may easily print on my lids.</li>
            <li> For one thing, the stick is a bit fat and wide for a truly smooth application.</li>
            <li> It has a nice thick lining which makes it easier to get the trendy thick lining look.</li>
            <li> All in all, Kajal is definately my new eyeliner, though I may try a few more brands along the way.</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my eyes at all and the color is VERY BLACK which I love.</li>
            <li> I live in Washington state.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even look in a new condition.</li>
            <li> Used khol my whole life, love it, but it&#x27;s hard to apply.</li>
            <li> : When you add the cost of shipping (or free prime), it is slightly more expensive than perhaps at a desi shop.</li>
            <li> I love this little eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Most standard liner sharpeners will have two holes, one for standard pencils and one for slightly larger pencils.  </li>
            <li> so thats a pretty big pain in the butt</li>
            <li> I have tried many kajal products in the past and all of them smudge.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly on my top lid due to all the smudging, but likely would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> It looked okay, but I had more issues with this one smudging badly than with others I got.</li>
            <li> this stuff has great pigment, but smudges like crazy...</li>
            <li> /&gt;as far as a beauty product i like it.</li>
            <li> so far, i would recommend this to family and friends.</li>
            <li> &amp; although it took foreeeevvvveeer for it to finally come in the mail (I really shouldn&#x27;t complain since the product&#x27;s from India</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to any woman who wants to look even prettier than she already is.</li>
            <li> I have developed an allergy</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> plastic surrounding the kajal is soft and can be sharpened.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a pretty long pencil.</li>
            <li> but It doesn&#x27;t give me any allergic reaction , and im extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes, so it could be because of that, and THAT could be why I had smudging problems with this one as my eyes got a bit watery using it</li>
            <li> did find it to be kind of irritating for my eyes though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s jet black and has a nice dark color.</li>
            <li> Since my friend went back to India and the kajal she left me ran out, I have been in a intense unsuccessful search for a new one!</li>
            <li> At first I thought it didn&#x27;t until I realized the bigger sharpener can be converted to even bigger if you take the ring around it out of the way...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells like sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a liner, not black eyeshadow that smudges everywhere.</li>
            <li> If you want a smooth, silky and dark pencil this is it!!</li>
            <li> I found it kind of unpleasant and all, but might work better for some people with less sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I WAS IN DESPERATE NEED OF KAJAL :p)</li>
            <li> but it is not hard to do and took me like the 3rd application to get it how I wanted.</li>
            <li> Not only its the true black</li>
            <li> I buy ten at a time because they do run down quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> it NEVER makes my sensitive eyes turn red or water.</li>
            <li> This certainly would if I didn&#x27;t set it with black shadow, and apply setting powder on before it as well.</li>
            <li> I found the lid would come off, smearing black liner throughout my bag, very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only thing is its, the product wouldn&#x27;t last long because its only at the tip of pencil.</li>
            <li> The eye pencil smells weird and easily smears off especially if you have oily skin...</li>
            <li> The pencil is soft and the color is dark.</li>
            <li> Pros: its soft, dark, &amp; glides on easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I live in Anytown USA with \\&quot;Little India\\&quot; miles away.</li>
            <li> I love the dark black shade and thick pencil for outlining-</li>
            <li> There are plenty of black pencils out there, but kajal has a reputation for increasing lash growth, and I can absolutely say that I can tell the difference when I use kajal instead of whatever black pencil.  </li>
            <li> And it lasts long.</li>
            <li> and then it lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li> maybe the results are different for other</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m re-buying it as soon as mine run out (which should not take long)!</li>
            <li> If sharpened correctly, this can be used for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Eyes have to be dry else</li>
            <li> product itself is quite soft and creamy - not at all like some of these rock hard, crumbly inner eye liners other companies try to sell.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was expensive at first, but in all honesty, I can&#x27;t recommend it enough, nowadays.</li>
            <li> Also, I find that it runs pretty badly on the inner corner (but nearly all liners do this for me, even when set with powder).&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it&#x27;s not good for rimming your inner lid if you wear contacts because the almond oil that&#x27;s used in this very traditional formula will fog over your contacts.  </li>
            <li> and it came in a week before the expected arrival date -</li>
            <li> This is the only product which is thick / creamy enough without smudging.  </li>
            <li> On my very pale skin, this liner is intensely pigmented and not in the least bit sheer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It smudges, even when I put liquid eyeliner on top of it. :(</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes like other eye pencils hurt.</li>
            <li> I usually use it for below eyes and use an eye liner above the eyes</li>
            <li> its was only 1 day late</li>
            <li> and it goes on really black</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pitch black and creamy.</li>
            <li> It costs less than 2 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ive been searching for a really black eyeliner...</li>
            <li> as for myself, i make wudu (wash face) a few times a day, so i have to reapply.</li>
            <li> I have oily lids, and heavy lids</li>
            <li> You do have to get used to its fairly big shape to get thin lines</li>
            <li> But I have to reapply it after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> however if you normally make very thin lines I wouldn&#x27;t use this because the tip is thick.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> it has kinda a weird smell but who is gonna get close enough to smell your eye?</li>
            <li> Worst part is its not easy to remove the smudge quickly.</li>
            <li> : it quickly smears &amp; ends up all over my under eye - making it completely useless :(</li>
            <li> Used it and within 15 minutes I was looking horrible as the kajal from my eyes starting spreading and smudging outside my eyes.</li>
            <li> It is hard to  draw the line as thin as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> What shocked me was not just its potency at curing my tired, allergic, dry eyes, but its beauty as a cosmetic!</li>
            <li> The tip of the pencil was slightly broken and there were scratches all over the body.</li>
            <li> a lady from India told me the medicinal principles behind this type of eye make up.</li>
            <li> silly me</li>
            <li> But I am still not satisfied as it was sent to me in a very bad state.</li>
            <li> On a random note, if your eyes itch when you use something, you are probably allergic to one of the ingredients!</li>
            <li> Even with base and powder, it smudges...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> so, i finally got my pencil...its was only 1 day late so i guess that its not so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the pencil itself didnt come wrapped in any kind of plastic or cardboard. it came only in the mail package that you&#x27;d use. you know, the yellowish envolope that has the bubble wrap inside. so dont ask about lead or anything like that cuz i really couldnt tell you. :/ you&#x27;d have to do some research on it yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the product does go on smoothly but will smudge, if you want it to. the golden part on the top of the pencil comes off. idk why yet. the pencil is plastic and its about 4.5 inches long with the top on and 4 inches without the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as far as a beauty product i like it. it has kinda a weird smell but who is gonna get close enough to smell your eye? so far, i would recommend this to family and friends. if i find anything about that i dont like or that i should tell you all about, i will let you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE! **This kajal will come off so you have to reapply. as for myself, i make wudu (wash face) a few times a day, so i have to reapply. maybe the results are different for other but i would still recommend this to friends and family **</li>
            <li> I love the dark black shade and thick pencil for outlining-they make my eyes really pop!  However, it does smudge easily but that won&#x27;t be a problem for much longer with the colder weather coming (less sweating)  Lasts all day  All in all, Kajal is definately my new eyeliner, though I may try a few more brands along the way.</li>
            <li> Lakme Kajal is a good kajal. However, it&#x27;s not the greatest kajal I&#x27;ve ever used. For one thing, the stick is a bit fat and wide for a truly smooth application. It really does help to place the pencil in the freezer for an hour or two before you sharpen it and any sharpener with a large hole will do the trick! I also discovered that if you place the kajal in the fridge before you use it, you will end up with a nice defined line along your lower line and it also is much easier to apply on your upper lids. That being said, this kajal is the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot;, super black, pure and very lovely. You can define your eyes, upper and lower, or smudge your top lid for the \\&quot;smoky\\&quot; look. Great product!    Catanya</li>
            <li> I love the color on this. It&#x27;s very smooth, rich, and dark BUT it runs a LOT. If you&#x27;re looking for something for smudging this may work for you but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I live in Washington state. Ordered this item on July 19 and got it August 9. &amp; although it took foreeeevvvveeer for it to finally come in the mail (I really shouldn&#x27;t complain since the product&#x27;s from India and it came in a week before the expected arrival date - I WAS IN DESPERATE NEED OF KAJAL :p) I&#x27;m really happy with this eyeliner! It applies nicely - it&#x27;s very smooth and black, smells great, and lasts long! The kajal looked like I just applied it even 5 hours when I actually tried it for the first time! Very satisfied - I most definitely will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this little eyeliner! It glides on easily, it&#x27;s nice and dark and it made my eyelashes grow in just 2 days! It makes my wide brown eyes look even more wider and more exotic and people stare at me now (even though that wasn&#x27;t my purpose in buying it). When I get my colored lenses, this stuff will do an amazing job of bringing out the color! I definitely recommend this product to any woman who wants to look even prettier than she already is.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading reviews that praised the pencil. Well it suits me just fine when I apply it over the eye lid but when I applied it in the lower inner side of my eyes , my eyes started to sting and became red, so I guess there is something in this product that does not suit my eyes but if it works for someone else..thats great... I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because it just  didn&#x27;t suit me.</li>
            <li> I have oily lids, and heavy lids so I have to be very careful of the type of liner I use because it may easily print on my lids. This certainly would if I didn&#x27;t set it with black shadow, and apply setting powder on before it as well. However it gets a 5 star because it goes on very smooth, I use it as for sunnah purposes in my water lines (top and bottom) and it NEVER makes my sensitive eyes turn red or water. I love it!</li>
            <li> This product is really nice, I love it. The pencil is soft and the color is dark. I bought 2!! &#x3D;D  My only question is how do I sharpen it? The pencil is plastic not wood and the gold cover at the bottom of the pencil can come off and on. Do you sharpen by pushing the kajal up?  Any info would help.</li>
            <li> I was on amazon looking for a good quality eyeliner with a fairly reasonable price. Well I stumbled upon this item and seeing how all the reviews were very positive I decided to give it a try. I am soo glad that I did!! This eyeliner stays on especially on my waterline which is awesome. You do have to get used to its fairly big shape to get thin lines but it is not hard to do and took me like the 3rd application to get it how I wanted. It does not irritate my eyes at all and the color is VERY BLACK which I love. It does smudge very easily so if your not going for the smudge look you need to learn to refrain from rubbing your eye with it on otherwise your eyeliner would be ruined. In all I am very impressed with this eyeliner and I will buy again! :&gt;</li>
            <li> I actually bought my first Lakme kajal because of kajal&#x27;s reported \\&quot;cooling effect\\&quot; (camphor) and because the idea of a moisturizing natural product to put inside my waterline sounded great with my burnt out college student eyes. But as I am allergic to almond oil, which is in most ayurvedic formulas from India, and wasn&#x27;t a fan of the idea of putting anything in my eyes like the parabens in western eyeliners or the  possible lead in the Arabic ones, I was at a loss until I found Lakme. Made in India from castor oil, the stuff is pure and medicinal. What shocked me was not just its potency at curing my tired, allergic, dry eyes, but its beauty as a cosmetic! A true kajal (good for your eyes), it is a bit smudgy, but as I use it mostly on my waterline, this effect is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. On a random note, if your eyes itch when you use something, you are probably allergic to one of the ingredients! Pay attention!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this pencil, because L&#x27;Oreal no longer sells the eyeliner I use and this product has 4 stars, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It&#x27;s horrible! It smudges, even when I put liquid eyeliner on top of it. :(</li>
            <li> just received mine today and i love it its so creamy and easy to apply! i give it 1000 stars!!</li>
            <li> Good product, kajal is protective to eyes. I have developed an allergy and I am nor able to use any other kind of eyeliner. No problem with a kajal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s jet black and has a nice dark color. It smears a bit, but I do like it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS ITEM WAS EXCITED WAS DISAPOINTED , FIRST IT WAS NOT SEALED IN ANY WAY, SECOND THE END HAS A CAP THAT COMES OFF REPEATLY , HAVE BEEN WEARING FOR A COUPLE DAYS I ONLY WEAR KHAL LINER,ON WATER LINE HAVE TO REAPPLY ALL THRU DAY SO KEEP IT WITH YOU IF YOU USE IT ON UPPER LID IT STAYS WELL, SECOND DAY NOTICED A ITCH AND EYES FEEL ALITTLE BURN</li>
            <li> This is probably my favourite go-to liner, next to gel liners.  On the outer rims of the eyes, this product goes where you want it, smudges as you want it and pretty much stays put for the day.  On my very pale skin, this liner is intensely pigmented and not in the least bit sheer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it primarily to function as an inner rim eyeliner.  In comparison to any liner other than gel, this is the best there is.  I do have to reapply it once or twice a day (for all day wear).  Also, I find that it runs pretty badly on the inner corner (but nearly all liners do this for me, even when set with powder).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is quite soft and creamy - not at all like some of these rock hard, crumbly inner eye liners other companies try to sell.  It is very comfortable to put on and comfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered this pencil, it came with a plastic top.  This top is prone to cracking which can be very problematic if you travel with your liners.  I found the lid would come off, smearing black liner throughout my bag, very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, this is a fat pencil.  You will need a sharpener big enough to handle it.  Most standard liner sharpeners will have two holes, one for standard pencils and one for slightly larger pencils.  The larger one will often have a removable ring to accommodate even bigger pencils.  You will have to use this largest setting to sharpen this pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this product.  I&#x27;m on my second pencil and will happily recommend it to anyone, though for true staying power and extreme drama, try your hand at gel liners, too.</li>
            <li> went on very easy and does not make my eyes itch like some I have tried it is a very large pencil it stays on for the day I am very happy with it</li>
            <li> I am allergic to every eye liner I had tried before lakme Kajal pencil.  I have no problem with this one.  I wished they would make the pencil  thinner, though.  It is hard to  draw the line as thin as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes like other eye pencils hurt. I usually use it for below eyes and use an eye liner above the eyes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best but if you&#x27;re in a hurry, this is great because it is easy to apply. And it lasts long.</li>
            <li> I Love it and will be reordering this very soon!  I hope it will be in stock when I do!</li>
            <li> its nice and black. and i gave it three stars because its smears way to easily. so thats a pretty big pain in the butt</li>
            <li> The kajal is nice and it glides on easily. But I am still not satisfied as it was sent to me in a very bad state. It didn&#x27;t even look in a new condition. At first look, I thought they have sent me a used one. The tip of the pencil was slightly broken and there were scratches all over the body.</li>
            <li> I love these eyeliner pencils. They apply smoothly, are jet black and the best I&#x27;ve used. I buy ten at a time because they do run down quickly.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stand up to the hot Indian sun as I had hoped. As someone with with oily skin, I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the \\&quot;bleeding\\&quot; it did. Probably better to wear in the winter and for someone with drier skin.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as smooth as what I hoped it to be, and it totally smudges, even if just applied to the waterline.</li>
            <li> This pencil gives you a great smoky eye but it won&#x27;t stay unless you really seal it with a primer first and a shadow on top. Doesn&#x27;t last through the evening.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product I bought it for only .01$ and it goes on really black and it is an amazing product! Must buy! :-)</li>
            <li> my most favorite black eyeliner... kinda smells like mildew though.. works awesome did not have to burn the end to make it show up on my eyes i recommend this</li>
            <li> Since my friend went back to India and the kajal she left me ran out, I have been in a intense unsuccessful search for a new one! I finally found it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is amazing! It&#x27;s pitch black and creamy. It is smudgeable but it will not do it if you don&#x27;t want it to! What is more amazing about this product is how long it lasts! I can go with it for a whole day that it will look almost just as like when I applied it in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quite tough to remove only with water, so my NYX Eye and Lip Remover is what I found works the best (it&#x27;s that remover with blue on top and transparent liquid on the bottom). That is, I must say, not a big issue in my opinion... If you don&#x27;t wanna go this far and buy something like that, I recommend you to go to your local dollar store and get one of those Make Up Remover Wipes; they also do good work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for sharpening it, I bought the Essence Of Beauty Sharpener and it works. At first I thought it didn&#x27;t until I realized the bigger sharpener can be converted to even bigger if you take the ring around it out of the way... I found this out by accident. *silly me* It costs less than 2 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kajal is very portable and smells really good. I thought it was expensive at first, but in all honesty, I can&#x27;t recommend it enough, nowadays. I&#x27;m re-buying it as soon as mine run out (which should not take long)!</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive eyes and I have tried so many different types of eyeliners and this one is the only one that does not make my eyes itch.  It glides on smoothly and lasts pretty much throughout the whole day.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid (what I would have expected to pay back in India), it is extremely good.  This is the only product which is thick / creamy enough without smudging.  It smells quite good too.  But I have to reapply it after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic surrounding the kajal is soft and can be sharpened.  with a large sharpener.  This information is not mentioned anywhere - I was about to throw the same when I read it somewhere else.  If sharpened correctly, this can be used for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Ive been searching for a really black eyeliner...and I decided to try this, it is just gorgeous when applied on the waterline. It really makes even the darkest eyes pop! A must have!</li>
            <li> Perfect consistency, the thickness of the pencil is perfect for cat eyes and it&#x27;s a pretty long pencil. You can also use an angled eye liner brush with this pencil if you want a thinner line. I have not used it on my waterline so no advice there but It doesn&#x27;t give me any allergic reaction , and im extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> The eye pencil smells weird and easily smears off especially if you have oily skin... The smell doesnt irritate my eyes but cant stand the smell of it. I wont be using the product. Fast shipping and the colo Is great compared to others.</li>
            <li> I have tried many kajal products in the past and all of them smudge. I am looking to get that perfect look without smudging. Having grown up in India and purchased Lakme products, I thought this would be good and not smudge. It is easy to apply and works well overall. Eyes have to be dry else it doesn&#x27;t go on well. Mid-day it smudges. I tried applying powder kohl over it to make it last, it does last but still smudges. I am still searching for the perfect kajal product. I think smudged kajal looks good on tanned skin, but not on fair skin. Lakme is owned by Unilever so the quality of the product is good and price reasonable. Of all the items I have tried (Urban Decay, etc.), this one works well.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely worth the price. It is a beautiful dark black and easy to blend. It sharpens quite easily with a large makeup pencil sharpener.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and so smooth. Only thing is its, the product wouldn&#x27;t last long because its only at the tip of pencil. I would buy again though!</li>
            <li> I live in Anytown USA with \\&quot;Little India\\&quot; miles away. For me buying this online was the best option as our local desi shop does&#x27;nt carry Lakme Kajal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service and shipping was great and Lakme Kajal Pencil was just what I had expected it to be.&lt;br /&gt;cons: When you add the cost of shipping (or free prime), it is slightly more expensive than perhaps at a desi shop.</li>
            <li> Whole tip crumbled and fell to the ground on first use.  Tried to access the remaining product inside and the applicator broke.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great quality, good color, soft to apply, easy to use. a lady from India told me the medicinal principles behind this type of eye make up. I&#x27;m glad I met her.</li>
            <li> I had never tried a Kajal pencil before, so I ordered this out of curiosity.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  It does take practice with applying it, and yes it does smear more than typical liner - but it also can offer you a thicker lines and a totally different look to your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pencil arrived in perfect condition and I have not had any issues sharpening it with a standard duo slot eyeliner sharpener.</li>
            <li> I have not used lakme products In a while. Was very excited about this pencil. Used it and within 15 minutes I was looking horrible as the kajal from my eyes starting spreading and smudging outside my eyes. Worst part is its not easy to remove the smudge quickly. I won&#x27;t use this at all. I have to find an alternate pencil or kajal that lines my eyes but no smudging.</li>
            <li> I like a full smudgy line around my eyes.  This works so well.  It&#x27;s gentle, goes on creamy, and get smudged perfectly with a brush full of eye shadow smudging it into place and then it lasts all day long.  There are plenty of black pencils out there, but kajal has a reputation for increasing lash growth, and I can absolutely say that I can tell the difference when I use kajal instead of whatever black pencil.  My lashes are definitely thicker, healthier and longer with regular use.  The only drawback is that it&#x27;s not good for rimming your inner lid if you wear contacts because the almond oil that&#x27;s used in this very traditional formula will fog over your contacts.  But other than that, it&#x27;s perfect.  And lasts forever.  It&#x27;s been almost a year since I bought my last one and I&#x27;ve still got about an inch left but I&#x27;m ordering now so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Big and bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t stay on the waterline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells like sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a liner, not black eyeshadow that smudges everywhere.</li>
            <li> I purchased several different kajal products at the same time. This was the first one I used. It looked okay, but I had more issues with this one smudging badly than with others I got. Nothing particularly special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find it to be kind of irritating for my eyes though. I have sensitive eyes, so it could be because of that, and THAT could be why I had smudging problems with this one as my eyes got a bit watery using it and I kept wanting to rub them or use drops. :-\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I&#x27;d just say it&#x27;s okay. I found it kind of unpleasant and all, but might work better for some people with less sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> it is nice black color&lt;br /&gt;eyes look bright&lt;br /&gt;but it smudges within an hour&lt;br /&gt;dont buy if you need a smudge proof kajal</li>
            <li> If you want a smooth, silky and dark pencil this is it!! however if you normally make very thin lines I wouldn&#x27;t use this because the tip is thick. It stung a bit at first, but it doesn&#x27;t anymore and it has natural ingredients!!</li>
            <li> Not only its the true black but you have to go thru it just once. unlike the test of the pencil that i used!</li>
            <li> Used khol my whole life, love it, but it&#x27;s hard to apply. This is great, lasts long, easy to apply, easy to sharpen.</li>
            <li> Pros: its soft, dark, &amp; glides on easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it quickly smears &amp; ends up all over my under eye - making it completely useless :(</li>
            <li> I like this pencil a lot.  It makes putting on my eye makeup much easier. It has a nice thick lining which makes it easier to get the trendy thick lining look.</li>
            <li> Use this every day now. Sometimes with it I skip the&lt;br /&gt;mascara!&lt;br /&gt;!  Great price, and it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> De todos los delineadores que he utilizado, este ha sido el mejor, estoy muy contenta con este producto lo seguire utilizando, me dura todo el dia :), me gustaria encontrar un rimel de la misma calidad</li>
            <li> I love this product! It works wonderfully by itself. Pair it with some mascara, and it&#x27;s all you need! It&#x27;s smooth, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> this stuff has great pigment, but smudges like crazy... super raccoon eyes! Even with base and powder, it smudges... I use this mainly on my top lid due to all the smudging, but likely would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> its nice and black but it smells..like tea tree oil or something, and its soooo melty. it doesnt stay on.</li>
