            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance mist from Bath and Body Works - only sold at Christmas.  </li>
            <li>it smells exactly like sugar cookies .</li>
            <li>I gave it to my little sister and my mom who liked it.</li>
            <li>It is a sweet but not sickeningly sweet, strong vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>It arrived fast and intact.</li>
            <li>But I have a sensitive nose to certain smells.</li>
            <li>new.</li>
            <li>I live in an apartment that&#x27;s why.</li>
            <li>My husband has asthma and it&#x27;s one of the only ones I can wear that has a light enough scent that it doesn&#x27;t bother him.</li>
            <li>The mist was pretty big.</li>
            <li>People stop in their tracks so often when I&#x27;m near them and say&amp;#34;yummmm....</li>
            <li>the smell is so soft.  </li>
            <li>:) It was wrapped and had a little pink string tied around it.</li>
            <li>I only wish it was available all year round from Bath and Body Works!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to bath and body vanilla bean lovers because you can barely smell it at all.</li>
            <li>The vanilla bean scent was not as strong as other vanilla bean perfumes/products I&#x27;ve owned in the past.</li>

            <li> I LOVE vanilla Bean Noel. I discovered it a few years ago via a coworker, but by that time it had already been out of stores and off the site. You better believe I stock up every year now! In fact, I currently have a huge haul coming to me :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smells like sugar cookies, and it just smells good enough to eat. I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments on it, and it really holds to clothing and hair so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Perfect companion to the lotion. It is a sweet but not sickeningly sweet, strong vanilla scent. The highest rated vanilla out there. i spray it all over me before I go out and everyone compliments it. Everyone!!</li>
            <li> I discovered it on a visit to my sister-in-law&#x27;s and fell in love. But it&#x27;s a Christmas product and I couldn&#x27;t find it on the Bath and Body Works website. Bless you, Amazon! One of your sellers had three left and I bought all of them. But I just checked and another vendor has them. It arrived promptly and was well packaged. Well worth the search!</li>
            <li> I love this scent...and enjoy wearing it. I like the softness of the fragrance. it smells like I&#x27;ve been in the kitchen baking cookies and it isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite smell from bath and body products! The scent is light  vanilla/ sugary smell. It lasts on clothes and spayed in hair.</li>
            <li> If you love Vanilla Bean Noel, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase. I already have the bath/shower gel and the lotion, but to have it in a spray is awesome. Shipping was quicker than I anticipated. My husband has asthma and it&#x27;s one of the only ones I can wear that has a light enough scent that it doesn&#x27;t bother him. Will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Vanilla scents. This is a great, almost sweet scent. It almost smells like a vanilla flavored cake baking... Some may not like this smell, I love it! I get compliments on it all the time. While the scent doesn&#x27;t last all day, I carry it and spray it often. The smell never becomes over-powering and a bottle still lasts me 7 months. Considering the fact that I spray it so many times a day, I was shocked by how long it lasted! If you found this review helpful, please click &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34;. Thank you!</li>
            <li> smells comparable to dark vanilla. new. clean. i will def look for this to be on sale at christmas time,</li>
            <li> I was hardly able to smell any frangrance. Might&#x27;ve just been me, but it didn&#x27;t smell like the quality you get at bath and body stores.</li>
            <li> This product was the real deal!! Wish I could have found this deal again!!!! It was a reasonable price too!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best vanilla scents out there and a little goes a loooong way! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> surprisingly long lasting</li>
            <li> Way better vanilla/sweet smell than the Warm Vanilla Sugar perfume.  Waiting for when it comes out in the fall so I can exchange my 5 bottles of the warm vanilla sugar for the Vanilla Bean Noel!</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of vanilla you&#x27;ll love this fragrance. Very happy with this purchase. I would reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bath and body fragrance. They did discontinue it for a year! Now I have my favorite fragrance once again. It smells like cake in case you are wondering.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance mist from Bath and Body Works - only sold at Christmas.  But you can still get it at Amazon after Christmas - don&#x27;t know how long Amazon will make it available, but I promise you are going to love the scent.</li>
            <li> It never fails! People stop in their tracks so often when I&#x27;m near them and say&amp;#34;yummmm....it smells like a carnival and cotton candy!&amp;#34; I always laugh cut it&#x27;s so predictable. It brings warm happy feelings wherever I go.</li>
            <li> Just got it today!!! OMG I LOVE THE SMELL OF THIS. I will DEFF be buying from this seller again in the future. Now all I need is Sweet On Paris and then I&#x27;ll have ALL my favorites by Bath and Body Works(:</li>
            <li> This is the only vanilla scented body product that doesn&#x27;t have some spicy undertone to it.  It smells so good and I get so many compliments on it.  It&#x27;s more of a sweet smell, like cookies or cotton candy (so I&#x27;ve been told).  I only wish it was available all year round from Bath and Body Works!</li>
            <li> Shipping was rather messed up. I ordered this on April, and it was suppose to arrive in a week, but it didn&#x27;t. I waited for the next several weeks. I emailed the seller about it, and they said it should have arrived, and they gave me a refund. After several months, my mom woke me up from sleeping and she said I got something in the mail. Immediately, I opened it because I love mail. It was the Vanilla Bean Noel Mist!! I was super shocked and contacted the seller, and explained everything. My mom told me that my apartment manager kept it. I live in an apartment that&#x27;s why. I&#x27;m like &amp;#34;Are you kidding me? She had it all along?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I didn&#x27;t care, I was too happy that I got it. Immediately, I sprayed it on, the smell was sweet. But I have a sensitive nose to certain smells. And I didn&#x27;t like it. It was too sweet, didn&#x27;t smell like Vanilla to me. I gave it to my little sister and my mom who liked it. They said it smelled like Vanilla and Coffee. They spray it on everyday, and it sickens my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I liked about it was the packaging. :) It was wrapped and had a little pink string tied around it. The mist was pretty big.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t like it, it was my first time smelling it so I gave it to my friend at school and she sprays it all the time and SHE LOVES IT AND EVERYONE ELSE DOES TOO so maybe its just me</li>
            <li> This fragrance mist smells amazing it smells exactly like sugar cookies . The packaging is gorgeous as well! :) Recommend this seller as well.  Nicely wrapped it for me so it wouldn&#x27;t get broken and a cute little pink ribbon for an added touch.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells just like the soap and the hand sanitizer now they need a lotion if they don&#x27;t have it already</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I wear this fragrance. It arrived fast and intact. I wear it all year &#x27;round. Great price, great delivery time. Smells like just baked sugar cookies. :-)</li>
            <li> The vanilla bean scent was not as strong as other vanilla bean perfumes/products I&#x27;ve owned in the past. Maybe I should have checked the age on it before purchasing it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to bath and body vanilla bean lovers because you can barely smell it at all.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! the smell is so soft.  Definitely recommend it to anyone! The price is not high, it just smells like it was.</li>
            <li> this product is sooo hard to find ...but i found it great price packaged well shipped very fast..im happy thanks</li>
            <li> For those that love a strong vanilla scent, this is the scent for you!  The nice thing is that you can layer it with the body wash, lotion, and fragrance mist.</li>
            <li> Love it, don&#x27;t need to use much, people want to know what I&#x27;m wearing!! They want to know what It is!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> i love the smell of this, my husband loves it to i will be buying this product more often, smells fantastic</li>
