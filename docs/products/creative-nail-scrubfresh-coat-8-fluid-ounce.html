    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly as shown&lt;br /&gt;Arrived promptly&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I thought that I might not need this item for the CND process, but it is crucial to have the nail bed clean and dehydrated before applying the CND Gel! This product does just that, and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the Gel application using it. Don&#x27;t leave this step out.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with this product, and have enjoyed using it at home.  I have saved so much money by doing my nails at home (with the same products that they use at the salon) for a fraction of the price! Salon quality.</li>
            <li> I ordered this nail scrub based on the instruction on the CND website on how to apply Shellac.  It seems to work well; I just wonder if it is an absolutely necessary step of the process.  I wonder if just washing your hands in soap and water would be enough, or if it would leave a residue.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would prevent peeling of my Shellac nail polish but not the case. It still starts peeling after about a week when they say it should last for 2 weeks (which it did the first couple of times).</li>
            <li> So happy to have CND Scrub Fresh Nail Surface Sanitizer delivered.  Very hard to find in a rural area and a good price, as well!</li>
            <li> I use this product like it is suggested. As a pre treatment to the nail polish. It must work because the Vinalyx nail polish is staying on for a week and I love it!</li>
            <li> I do my daughters nails at home and have for the last two years. I use scrub fresh to prep her nail beds and it works great!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted to keep my shellac on.</li>
            <li> This product along with the Creative Nail Prime Nail Primer allows for salon quality results. I was having trouble getting the shellac to stay before I used this.</li>
            <li> This is pure acetone, and I find out incredibly harsh.  Dried out my nails and made them even more brittle.</li>
            <li> My polish lasts for weeks with no chipping!!  Finally!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It helps my shellac create a good bond.</li>
            <li> Good for what it&#x27;s supposed to do (getting those nails clean and oil free before polish application). I have purchased the surface scrub twice, but find that regluar old nail polish remover doesn the trick for far less damage to your pocket book. I don&#x27;t know if I would buy this product again.. but it does do what it&#x27;s supposed to, so you can&#x27;t be mad at that!</li>
            <li> CND scrub fresh nail surface sanitizer very good product . Came very fast . Good price . I would recommended to other. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great product to use with the CND system. Large bottle to accompany a lot off manicures. Super fast shipping. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was using Shellac for a few months and noticed that after about a week the color would start to peel off my nails.  I read about this on the CND website and ordered from Amazon.  Wow - it&#x27;s made a huge difference.  I&#x27;ve had my latest color on for two weeks and zero peeling.  Even when I chip a nail and need to cut the edge - it still doesn&#x27;t peel.  For anyone using Shellac, I strongly recommend using Scrubfresh first.</li>
            <li> It works great. I think it works as good as salon products. I would recommend it to a friend for sure.</li>
            <li> This makes all the difference when I&#x27;m doing my nails!</li>
            <li> Bought this for the manicure and pedicure shellac start process. It seems as the bottle will last a little longer than a polish remover bottle would have lasted.</li>
            <li> This product is a replacement product. It is required first step product. my wife and daughters love all these products.</li>
            <li> I purchased the CND UV lamp and all the items necessary to do my at home gel manicures.  Love this product and use it every time I do my gel manicure.  The bottle is a good size so I&#x27;m sure it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Works good but not a necessity.</li>
