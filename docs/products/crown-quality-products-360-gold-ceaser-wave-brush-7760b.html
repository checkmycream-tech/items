            <li>The brush is amazing.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve read that before I know but its amazing.</li>
            <li>It conforms to your head while creating amazing waves.</li>
            <li>, you will never wanna touch a Diane or Annie ever again I already own</li>
            <li>comes off easily but the bristles an quality of the brush is so good</li>

            <li>You will never find another brush better than this one.</li>
            <li>Diane brushes are okay</li>
            <li>A week from now you will on amazon buying more.</li>
            <li>this brush is perfect if you have very coarse hair.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>The fit is like brushing your hair with your hand!</li>
            <li>I will just order more.</li>
            <li>Love this brush, my fav brush of all time.</li>
            <li>It allows you to sport waves at longer lenghts with greater ease.</li>
            <li>If you are starting out waving this is the best brush to start out on.</li>
            <li>Outstanding products.</li>
            <li>After two weeks of use, I used warm water to clean and the brush cracked</li>
            <li>Easy to grip handles makes it effortless.</li>
            <li>The Best wave brush HANDS DOWN...</li>
            <li>Well ..just like everyone else is saying u get what you pay for cqp has the best brushes hands down 1week of results and use</li>
            <li>if you wants some fast waves get it work great</li>
            <li>Comfortable in the hand while brushing</li>
            <li>Its big so fits in hand great and</li>
            <li>honestly i like this brush a lot more although Diane brushes are also great for your wave game...</li>
            <li>Nothing special like I thought.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t to nothing special</li>
            <li>This is the best hard bristle brush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>However, its still a good brush to use when having enough hair.</li>
            <li>the absolute best...Worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li>Love the curve of the brush so it brushes the contour of your head very well.</li>
            <li>Any brush will do the trick and you do not need a crown brush to get, develop, and/or maintain waves, but it will allow you to brush your hair evenly and with high quality bristles that makes for better waving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Did take a while to be delivered though over a week, maybe I&#x27;m used to stuff on amazon shipping real fast...</li>
            <li>This Brush Is Worth</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re still worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>do own several crowns.</li>
            <li>but worth it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never really cared about loosing them because they were so easy to replace!!</li>
            <li>but this brush right here...</li>
            <li>These brushes are amazing, i have to admit i was all pro DIane brush for a really long time until i tried Crown QUality and</li>
            <li>This brush is more like what you expect a medium brush to feel like, it does not have the feeling of a hard brush, but it is effective.  </li>
            <li>when i used it at first i notice how the brush felt to the head.</li>
            <li>This Crown 360 Gold Ceaser brush does exactly what it says it&#x27;s designed to do, create waves.</li>
            <li>this brush puts things over the top especially with consistency and manageability.</li>
            <li>Now he wants this brush, NOPE!</li>
            <li>Good brush... seen results in a few days.</li>
            <li>This brush is pretty much the real deal.</li>
            <li>They are right, less brushing for sure.</li>
            <li>I  bought both of these brush&#x27;s for my grandson and he really likes both of them.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and contours to your head.  </li>
            <li>The whole brush is used.</li>
            <li>The results come fast.</li>
            <li>the bend really  takes to the form of your head..    </li>
            <li>This brush is the real deal......</li>
            <li>But it works at any length, really.</li>
            <li>But overall it&#x27;s a nice brush that will get the job done while it last</li>
            <li>It says \\&quot;more waves with less brushing\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Wish products were available for Amazon Prime, but maybe in the near future.</li>
            <li>Must buy for anyone look for a high quality brush for their hair.</li>
            <li>I own the Med, the Premium (with Med Boar Bristles), and this crown brush the hard.</li>
            <li>this brush is defiantly worth every last penny!!</li>
            <li>the first crown quality brush i bought (same one but with the handle) it seemed to be made a little better.</li>
            <li>and I gotta live with it.</li>
            <li>Definitely works on any type of hair, exactly what you need to get waves on a any problem areas.</li>
            <li>it does exactly what it is suppose to do period which is create a deep wave pattern</li>
            <li>It seems to get more of your head than a regular brush and it doesn&#x27;t hurt like heck just to lay your hair down.</li>
            <li>Love this brush its just what I needed it completes my set of the soft medium and the hard.</li>
            <li>This brush is that something extra that a real waver needs.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair and been using this brush with the red softee brush and just oil, and no pomade</li>
            <li>If you got a tender head I would say get a soft brush.</li>
            <li>Should have got a soft brush</li>
            <li>It feels like a med brush or even soft.</li>
            <li>This brush has an unique design and does feel different than other brushes.</li>
            <li>I was actually trying to buy a soft crown brush, not a hard.</li>
            <li>but i definitely plan on purchasing the soft, medium and premium as well.</li>
            <li>with this brush i never loose track of it day and night!</li>
            <li>The bristles are unlike any other brush I&#x27;ve used before, which lay waves down in a smooth motion.</li>
            <li>the wood and coating seemed to be a little higher quality.</li>
            <li>Symbol came off in the first day of use and paint came off a little.</li>
            <li>Great purchase, you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>

            <li> Great purchase, you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> It is more of a medium than a hard, at least on my coarse hair.</li>
            <li> If you serious about your hair and getting waves, buy this brush Right Now.</li>
            <li> This is very hard and hurts probably because my hair is too short for it right now.</li>
            <li> i got wave in 4 weeks with kinda long hair</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m starting to see waves it had only been little over 2 weeks...</li>
            <li> It should of said hard in the title because I thought this brush was going to be soft.</li>
            <li> Hard Brush , medium brush , soft brush</li>
            <li> Bought hard, medium, and soft.</li>
            <li> a soft, medium, hard, and premium ..</li>
            <li> but the bristles never got loose or came out!</li>
            <li> The crown med feels harder.</li>
            <li> though the actual wood started splitting (very slightly at both ends) as soon as i started using it.</li>
            <li> Other than that.</li>
            <li> i notice it does bring waves faster than other brushes i have used.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well on the sides and connection points.  </li>
            <li> I bought the brush and place the item under cold water to rinse it off and clean it and the brush split in half.</li>
            <li> But the only reason I gave 4 is because of the price and the fact that my crown brush has the tendency to get soft at random intervals during the day.</li>
            <li> They sent me the wrong color,  plus it&#x27;s hard to keep clean.</li>
            <li> especially the hard areas on the head.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH  $21 (15.99 + 5.99 SHIPPING)  and the two month waiting period.  </li>
            <li> Lays hair down, and forms wave pattern.</li>
            <li> $ SPENT!!?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and arm strength with other brushes.</li>
            <li> Crown made me throw away my previous brushes (ANNIE)  </li>
            <li> You will see an improvement in your wave pattern in a few days.</li>
            <li> The crown medium is a hard in any other brand(IMO)</li>
            <li> The medium is almost as firm as the hard</li>
            <li> Ive been through over 15-20 brushes in the past 5 years</li>
            <li> Get the hard brush, it&#x27;s the equivalent to a medium.</li>
            <li> Just to HARD for the face.</li>
            <li> Wasnt as hard as i thought it was</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like one of those hard brushes that destroys your scalp.</li>
            <li> This one is the hard brush</li>
            <li> Not at all hard like the Diane hard brush</li>
            <li> I wouldnt recommend to those who are looking for a hard cqb brush.</li>
            <li> I mean damn</li>
            <li> I mean its a brush</li>
            <li> Yes, it is on the expensive side for a brush</li>
            <li> A lil expensive for a brush</li>
            <li> Either way you can&#x27;t go wrong though.</li>
            <li> You will not go wrong with this brush!!</li>

            <li> I was actually trying to buy a soft crown brush, not a hard. It should of said hard in the title because I thought this brush was going to be soft. However, its still a good brush to use when having enough hair.</li>
            <li> I Love This Brush 100% The Bread I Notice My Wave Become Deeper Instantly And It Helped Reveal My Receiver Line Back In Place A Must Have Product People This Brush Is Worth The Twenty Dollar Bill And Change!!!</li>
            <li> 360 Crown Brush....The Best wave brush HANDS DOWN...You will never find another brush better than this one. Diane brushes are okay but this brush right here...the absolute best...Worth every penny and more. Hard Brush , medium brush , soft brush it doesnt matter. If you serious about your hair and getting waves, buy this brush Right Now. A week from now you will on amazon buying more. BUY IT NOW !!</li>
            <li> this brush is perfect if you have very coarse hair. I&#x27;ve had it for about a week and I can already see results. The curve of the brush is good for connections. If you want a quality brush that&#x27;s this is your best bet. Yes, it is on the expensive side for a brush but it&#x27;s a good investment.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me. But this brush feels the same as my medium brush. Other than that. Comfortable in the hand while brushing</li>
            <li> The brush is great! when i used it at first i notice how the brush felt to the head. it literally wraps around the contour of your head. i notice it does bring waves faster than other brushes i have used. especially the hard areas on the head. it&#x27;s worth its weight in gold. two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Love this brush its just what I needed it completes my set of the soft medium and the hard. The medium is almost as firm as the hard but they&#x27;re still worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Awesome quality product... though the actual wood started splitting (very slightly at both ends) as soon as i started using it. (change in humidity etc?) the first crown quality brush i bought (same one but with the handle) it seemed to be made a little better. the wood and coating seemed to be a little higher quality. but the bristles never got loose or came out! it does just what it says!!! this is not a brush u would regret buying im sure!</li>
            <li> Very Very Good brush. You will feel the difference. Worth every penny. you will not be dissapointed. Only thing i wish they had a medium brush too.</li>
            <li> I recently cut off my braids and I&#x27;m going back to waves. This brush has an unique design and does feel different than other brushes. It takes approx 4-6 weeks to see results, so we&#x27;ll see if this brush has the magic I&#x27;ve been searching for! It&#x27;s 60 percent genetics, 20 percent good brush technique, and 20 good hair products. Good luck my friends lol. Good brush... Just a lil over priced.</li>
            <li> Lays hair down, and forms wave pattern. Must buy for anyone look for a high quality brush for their hair.</li>
            <li> I  bought both of these brush&#x27;s for my grandson and he really likes both of them. If he is happy then Granny is happy</li>
            <li> They sent me the wrong color,  plus it&#x27;s hard to keep clean. But overall it&#x27;s a nice brush that will get the job done while it last</li>
            <li> Love the curve of the brush so it brushes the contour of your head very well. A lil expensive for a brush but would def buy again.</li>
            <li> Brush is amazing! Can&#x27;t wait to order 2 more!</li>
            <li> This brush is offical! The bristles are unlike any other brush I&#x27;ve used before, which lay waves down in a smooth motion. You will see an improvement in your wave pattern in a few days. But the only reason I gave 4 is because of the price and the fact that my crown brush has the tendency to get soft at random intervals during the day. I suppose the temperature is the cause? Get the hard brush, it&#x27;s the equivalent to a medium. Either way you can&#x27;t go wrong though.</li>
            <li> The 360 Gold brush is great. I use it all the time and it has my waves on swirl.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit bristles feel just right !!!! Love it</li>
            <li> Brush was lighter and kept falling off.</li>
            <li> All Wave enthusiast if you want to take your brush quality to the highest level, this is the product you want to add. Any brush will do the trick and you do not need a crown brush to get, develop, and/or maintain waves, but it will allow you to brush your hair evenly and with high quality bristles that makes for better waving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do own several crowns. I own the Med, the Premium (with Med Boar Bristles), and this crown brush the hard. This brush is more like what you expect a medium brush to feel like, it does not have the feeling of a hard brush, but it is effective.  It also is designed to to contour to your head. Great purchase, you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> Great brush if you&#x27;re looking to start your 360 wave pattern.  Very sturdy and contours to your head.  I ordered another one so I could keep on for when I&#x27;m away from the house.</li>
            <li> Just to HARD for the face.</li>
            <li> Wasnt as hard as i thought it was</li>
            <li> The brush is amazing. It works great and give you waves everywhere. It says \\&quot;more waves with less brushing\\&quot; but heck, I brush all the time. I have the best waves around</li>
            <li> This brush is that something extra that a real waver needs. It CONTOURS to your head,you&#x27;ve read that before I know but its amazing. The fit is like brushing your hair with your hand! The whole brush is used. I tried to use my Diane afterwards and I laughed. The crown medium is a hard in any other brand(IMO) the brush is larger so you have to adjust your strokes,but. I will never use another brush again. I already have a 360 so I can&#x27;t wait to see what 2 weeks of the crown brush will do.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a 4* bcuz I mean damn its s 20$ brush...but worth it</li>
            <li> Great for my hair and my waves are the best right now, which can only get better in time I will just order more.</li>
            <li> best brush in the world</li>
            <li> The results come fast. My waves have definitely approved from this. Buy this if you want to start spinning crazy!!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are the best.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, my fav brush of all time. Its big so fits in hand great and the bend really  takes to the form of your head..    Brush seems to chip an paint comes off easily but the bristles an quality of the brush is so good still will give it a 5 but if they had a 4/half would give that</li>
            <li> I have been sporting 360 waves since 1986.  This is the best hard bristle brush I have ever used.  It works extremely well on the sides and connection points.  It allows you to sport waves at longer lenghts with greater ease.</li>
            <li> This Crown 360 Gold Ceaser brush does exactly what it says it&#x27;s designed to do, create waves. I guess it&#x27;s the contoured shape that covers every side of of your head when brushing.</li>
            <li> If you are starting out waving this is the best brush to start out on. I have straight hair and been using this brush with the red softee brush and just oil, and no pomade and I&#x27;m starting to see waves it had only been little over 2 weeks... Did take a while to be delivered though over a week, maybe I&#x27;m used to stuff on amazon shipping real fast... Keep brushing</li>
            <li> They are right, less brushing for sure. It seems to get more of your head than a regular brush and it doesn&#x27;t hurt like heck just to lay your hair down. Team CQP ALL DAY!</li>
            <li> I received the product.  After two weeks of use, I used warm water to clean and the brush cracked</li>
            <li> The best brush I&#x27;ve EVER bought!! It conforms to your head while creating amazing waves. I&#x27;ll never buy a different brand again.</li>
            <li> Definitely works on any type of hair, exactly what you need to get waves on a any problem areas. Easy to grip handles makes it effortless.</li>
            <li> Outstanding products. Crown made me throw away my previous brushes (ANNIE)  I&#x27;m sold on CQP. 360&#x27;d in 2 weeks. Bought hard, medium, and soft. Wish products were available for Amazon Prime, but maybe in the near future.</li>
            <li> Man I LOVING IT!!!!!  This brush is the real deal......NO BS!  Very happy, I just bought another one. BUT I NEED MY BAGS MANE!</li>
            <li> I asked the CQP to replace the brush but they still have not responded since July. I bought the brush and place the item under cold water to rinse it off and clean it and the brush split in half. The only thing that&#x27;s holding the brush together is the sticker CQP places on the back of the brush. Customer service is non existence, and the only method of communication is via email. NOT WORTH  $21 (15.99 + 5.99 SHIPPING)  and the two month waiting period.  The company won&#x27;t even stand by their product to replace damaged goods.</li>
            <li> You will not go wrong with this brush!! As soon as I brushed my hair within 2-3 stroke I could feel and see a difference, it hugs your head perfectly, great control on the brush, doesn&#x27;t came up with grease from your head. To sum everything up I will never use a brush UNLESS it&#x27;s the gold Caesar wave brush</li>
            <li> This brush is pretty much the real deal. It is more of a medium than a hard, at least on my coarse hair. But it works at any length, really. It&#x27;s not like one of those hard brushes that destroys your scalp. The bristles are rigid and feel like heaven when they run through your waves. It&#x27;s awesome. If you are considering buying a medium, no need to buy one of those if you get this.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing, i have to admit i was all pro DIane brush for a really long time until i tried Crown QUality and honestly i like this brush a lot more although Diane brushes are also great for your wave game...this brush puts things over the top especially with consistency and manageability. This one is the hard brush but i definitely plan on purchasing the soft, medium and premium as well. Job well don Crown QUality</li>
            <li> Nothing special like I thought. I mean its a brush it doesn&#x27;t to nothing special like u might think but works just like a brush.</li>
            <li> Great brush works just like they say waves in 2 weeks or better.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE JUST ANOTHER NOTCH ON THE BELT FOR THE CQP LINE OF BRUSHES. I HAVE 3  NOW AND THEY ARE THE BEST OF THE BEST AND WORTH EVERY $ SPENT!!?</li>
            <li> Good brush... seen results in a few days. Symbol came off in the first day of use and paint came off a little. If you got a tender head I would say get a soft brush. Will be ordering a softee this week. Overall brush works.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush it does exactly what it is suppose to do period which is create a deep wave pattern</li>
            <li> Well ..just like everyone else is saying u get what you pay for cqp has the best brushes hands down 1week of results and use, you will never wanna touch a Diane or Annie ever again I already own a soft, medium, hard, and premium .. I&#x27;M SOLD !!!! #spinningonu</li>
            <li> What more can a man ask for, this brush is the best out there. I&#x27;ve had a very good brush that three of my son&#x27;s have wanted for years but after finding this one, I gave my old brush to my oldest son and he was so happy until he tried the 360 Gold Ceaser Wave Brush. Now he wants this brush, NOPE!</li>
            <li> Should have got a soft brush but that is my fault.  This is very hard and hurts probably because my hair is too short for it right now.</li>
            <li> Company is horrible! Do not buy from Crown Quality Products.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and arm strength with other brushes. Countours to your head, you&#x27;ll  be making chicks seasick in no time</li>
            <li> Not at all hard like the Diane hard brush &amp; it&#x27;s not boar bristles but I brought it and I gotta live with it. It feels like a med brush or even soft. I wouldnt recommend to those who are looking for a hard cqb brush. The crown med feels harder.</li>
            <li> Ive been through over 15-20 brushes in the past 5 years and I&#x27;ve never really cared about loosing them because they were so easy to replace!! with this brush i never loose track of it day and night! the way it wraps around your head you can just feel the waves forming as u brush!! this brush is defiantly worth every last penny!!</li>
            <li> im using the brush and my waves have  come out a lot easier and i recommend this brush to anyone</li>
            <li> if you wants some fast waves get it work great i got wave in 4 weeks with kinda long hair</li>
