            <li> Recommended by my podiatrist.  Great product for cracked feet and hands.  Vanishing base is nice to use</li>
            <li> I use this and my Clarisonic Pedi Buff and my feet look amazing!</li>
            <li> Works well on dried, flaking skin or hard rough spots.</li>
            <li> My Dr suggested this cream to me. It has done wonders to soften and allow the trimming of big, heavy foot callouses. It does exactly what the doctor said it would do.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve had horribly dry, calloused heels that would crack and be very painful.  I went to a podiatrist for a different issue and apologized for my awful dry, cracked heels.  She asked if I had any skin conditions elsewhere on my body.  In fact, my dermatologist had diagnosed seborrheic dermatitis which caused severe scalp itching and flaking.  The podiatrist said my heel problem was likely due to the dermatitis - that had never occurred to me. She recommended a cream with urea, and sold me a 2 oz jar.  It is a miracle!!  I occasionally use a pumice stone in the shower but the key is I use this cream twice a day - after morning shower and before bed.  I have such soft and supple heels now with no painful cracking!  I have spent years using the wrong products to try to solve the dry heel problem but they never really did the trick.  If I stopped them for a week - my problem returned. The urea product seems to fix the problem rather than putting a band-aid on the problem and not truly treating and healing it.  The 4 oz jar is so convenient and a good price.</li>
            <li> This product is an absolute life saver when it comes to cracked heels and cuticles.  It is the first product I have used that has actually helped with cracked heels and showed results within the first few days of use.  I recommend it for anyone that lives in a dry climate and has cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for my feet for about a year I used to get it from my foot doctor but Now found it cheaper here. Worksd like magic</li>
            <li> My foot doctor recommended this cream and it has keep these bare feet soft and smooth.  Thank You Gordon Labs.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  It works!  Recommended to me by my foot doctor!  It keeps feet nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I love the texture of this cream. It helped tremendously and I am glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday as a preemptive way to prevent eczema (which has plagued me for years).  It works great!  I use it all over.</li>
            <li> AFTER HAVING AN ALLERGY REACTION WHERE SKIN PEALED, NOT ALL PEALED OFF MY FEET.  THEY WOULD CRACK AND THEN I WOULD GET BLOOD INFECTION.  I TRIED EVERYTHING MY DERMATOLOGIST SUGGESTED AND MORE.  I HAD VERY HARD AREAS ON MY FEET.  I PURCHASE AN ENJOI PRODUCT THAT SANDS OFF HARD SURFACES FROM FEET.  AFTER I USE THAT ITEM I PUT ON THE UREA.  ONLY USE THE ENJOI PRODUCT ABOUT ONCE A WEEK, BUT USE THE UREA DAILY AFTER SHOWERING AND BEFORE PUTTING SOCKS ON.  MY DERMATOLOGIST HAD PRECRIBED A 10% UREA.  THIS ITEM IS NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE, BUT CAN BE PURCHASED ONLINE AT 20% FROM GORDON LABS.  IT HAS SAVED ME FROM DANGEROUS BLOOD INFECTIONS.</li>
            <li> I had some terribly painful cracked heels when I bought this product. Two days after I began using this cream my feet were very much improved. I use it twice a day in the morning and before I go to bed and wear socks immediately after applying. This is the best product I have ever used for cracked heels. I have tried other products but none have ever had the healing power this cream does. It has a sort of gritty feel on your fingers after applying but I just use some hand lotion over it as I don&#x27;t want to wash it from my skin. I get cracks in my fingers as well in the winter and this product has helped with that too.</li>
            <li> does make feet soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Not as good as advertised I was disappointed!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, got rid of the fungus even Lamisil didn&#x27;t get rid of and my feet are the softest they&#x27;ve been in years!</li>
            <li> the stuff is awsome. I first got it from foot doctor and tried other stuff. this is only stuff that heels cracked heels</li>
            <li> My foot doctor gave me samples of this cream. It&#x27;s great for dry skin and also fights fungus. I use it every morning and night. Otherwise my skin on the soles of my feet get real dry and spilt. the cream is also great to heal split skin.</li>
            <li> Best foot cream I&#x27;ve ever used. Helps me treat my dry cracking feet, helps prevent cracks and keeps your feet soft.</li>
            <li> Fast on time delivery. Great buy.</li>
            <li> My foot doctor sells this in her office, but at a much higher price. It gets my rough cracked feet in great shape when applied twice a day. Nothing has ever worked this good!</li>
