    <ol>
            <li>This is the best stuff to use if you are doing foils on your nails..</li>
            <li>However this makes great body tattoo glue!</li>
            <li>Works great and great value</li>
            <li>Good product, but hoped that the adhesion was stronger.</li>
            <li>Also, the glue doesn&#x27;t seem to work as good since it was heated in shipment.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t hold the foil on as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>It did peal off very easy so not to happy about that.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>This works great with nail transfer film, I just wish I had the right film to work with.</li>
            <li>Foils still come off nails even after the top coat is applied.</li>
            <li>It made me light headed.</li>
            <li>Great product especially for nail art foils</li>
            <li>I excited to use these on my foils I purchased I can not wait.</li>
            <li>Foil would rub right off even after one hr.</li>
            <li>I cant get the foil to stick right</li>
            <li>First, they came with glue leaked all over the bottles.</li>
            <li>I have had good experiences with this in the past, but not this batch.</li>
            <li>I find the adhesive stays super soft.</li>
            <li>There weren&#x27;t great instructions due to not being able to read the very small print on the bottle.</li>
            <li>Not to mention it smells very in intoxicated.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is the real thing.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It works very well however</li>
            <li>I was really trying to like these.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re smaller than I expected but they work just fine!</li>
            <li>Second,  the glue takes forever to dry and it doesn&#x27;t get very tacky.</li>

            <li> Good product, but hoped that the adhesion was stronger.</li>
            <li> Foils still come off nails even after the top coat is applied.</li>
            <li> works...stays sticky even after its dry so don&#x27;t forget the topcoat.</li>
            <li> They are alright. I wish they dried on the nail faster.</li>
            <li> This does not work well AT ALL! The adhesive is not strong or durable. Not to mention it smells very in intoxicated. It made me light headed. I would not pay for these again or recommend them to anyone. Basically there not worth the $7.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t even stick to my nail the foil I put on with it doesn&#x27;t stick</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff to use if you are doing foils on your nails.. Thanks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real thing. Smells like a glue that children use. Foil would rub right off even after one hr.</li>
            <li> Great product especially for nail art foils</li>
            <li> Beware the time of year you order these. One of mine overheated and leaked something fierce. Also, the glue doesn&#x27;t seem to work as good since it was heated in shipment. I find the adhesive stays super soft. I have had good experiences with this in the past, but not this batch.</li>
            <li> SEE REVISED REVIEW...  Maybe I am not using it right, but mine did not stick at all.  :-(</li>
            <li> This works great with nail transfer film, I just wish I had the right film to work with. Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this at all.  I cant get the foil to stick right and Ive tried everything. However this makes great body tattoo glue!</li>
            <li> Item as described and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Received the bottles a lot faster then expected and I am very pleased with the product. Will re order when I run out.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re smaller than I expected but they work just fine! Will but again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I excited to use these on my foils I purchased I can not wait.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It works very well however, it doesn&#x27;t hold the foil on as good as I had hoped. It did peal off very easy so not to happy about that. There weren&#x27;t great instructions due to not being able to read the very small print on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Works great and great value</li>
            <li> I was really trying to like these. First, they came with glue leaked all over the bottles. Second,  the glue takes forever to dry and it doesn&#x27;t get very tacky. I have lash glue ( Revlon) that works better sadly.</li>
            <li> Products arrived damaged</li>
