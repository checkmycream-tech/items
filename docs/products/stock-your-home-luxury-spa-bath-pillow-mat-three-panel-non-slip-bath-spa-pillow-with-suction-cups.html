            <li>I just wish it had more suction cups</li>
            <li>I ended up using it for an hour bc its so comfortable!</li>
            <li>It makes taking a bath better.</li>
            <li>It does make the bath more comfy, but I would probably look for something more sturdy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more then</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still hoping to have a better product but this will do for now.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>The problem is most tubs are curved and</li>
            <li>This is my favorite bath pillow ever.</li>
            <li>Can relax with your pillow in place lock to tub to be able to relax.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to get something like this, you will be much more satisfied if you make sure it will fit your tub.</li>
            <li>I got this pillow and loved it at first.</li>
            <li>It waked well enough, and I was content with the cushioning, although it wasn&#x27;t a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>I love my winter evening baths and thought this pillow would help make it more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Perfect for a single use.</li>
            <li>The pillow is comfortable through once you get it set up and much better than the ones you fill with air.</li>
            <li>Tis is the most comfortable spa pillow I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>The suction cups really stick to the tub Good price too.</li>
            <li>This product is soft and comfortable great for lying in tub.</li>
            <li>It inflates and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li>The quality of this bath pillow is fine, but it&#x27;s just like 90% of the size it needs to be to cover either of the bath seats we have in our home.</li>
            <li>I still use the pillow without the suction cups and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so comfortable and easy to maintain</li>
            <li>But comfortable.</li>
            <li>it was so comfortable.  </li>
            <li>its comfortable but doesn&#x27;t stay in place as well as I would like</li>
            <li>The pillow is comfortable, but it&#x27;s too buoyant.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable.</li>
            <li>soothing and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>but so far so good, it is comfy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s longer than most which keeps you from sliding, cushions your shoulders and lets you sit higher if you want.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product for the first 6 months</li>
            <li>What really gets me is that after using it maybe 10 times the top pillow filled with water.</li>
            <li>However, I tried to move it to clean my tub</li>
            <li>I would really have liked getting the right product.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and would recommend it not only is your head comfortable but so are your shoulders.</li>
            <li>it tends to float when tub is full</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit quite right for the type of bathtub we have -</li>
            <li>Quick delivery a day or 2</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and soft.</li>
            <li>First use and my finger poked a hole right through the plastic, to the foam inside!  </li>
            <li>but it is definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>Nice support for my long soaks!</li>
            <li>I used it a few more times until I knew I&#x27;d have a chance to drop it off at UPS to return it, and by the time I was ready to wrap this baby up to mail, it was so filled with water I had to wrap it in a huge Ziploc bag and then tape</li>
            <li>The suction cups hold, the head and neck portion of the pad fits properly in the tub making it very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Broke apart the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>We have to fold over the top pillow so there is enough padding for your head and shoulder area.</li>
            <li>but it likes to slip at first</li>
            <li>I loved this at first the problems started after a few uses.</li>
            <li>I will order more in the future for myself and my family.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what was advertised.</li>
            <li>However, if falls apart after two or three baths (at the most) and you&#x27;re left with ripped fabric, soggy foam, and a bunch of suction cups stuck to your tub.</li>
            <li>Also, it is not white, but a cream/brownish white that does not look good on my soaker tub.  </li>
            <li>I like this one much better that the traditional one, its very compfortable</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This bath pillow is so comfortable and actually suctions to my tub.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>In the future, I&#x27;m sticking to free shipping orders.</li>
            <li>That did bother me too much.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Very disapointed.</li>
            <li>They stick very well to the tub.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t stay with the pillow very well.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves it very relaxing</li>
            <li>I really like this pillow</li>
            <li>Works properly, stays clean, I even use it in the pool for leaning against the side</li>
            <li>The product is large enough to comfortably fit a man or woman and is study while also being soft.</li>
            <li>I may switch to a full body pillow, but that is personal preference.</li>
            <li>Besides that, it is a decent bath pillow.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>The product is somewhat stiff as well which wasn&#x27;t very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t weigh enough (100lbs), but I can&#x27;t use it right because it pushes me up.</li>
            <li>Had to order a different product to get it right.</li>
            <li>, I bought a second one, hoping that all of the flaws the first one had were just a fluke.</li>
            <li>All of the positive reviews had to have been written by individuals who had only used the pillow once.</li>
            <li>neck,&lt;br /&gt;It takes a while to secure pillow to tub properly, but not a real problem.</li>
            <li>but just too busy, didn&#x27;t have time to pack it up and return it.</li>
            <li>Once that happens you can&#x27;t really get them to go back in again.  </li>
            <li>Only can imagine this is for cleaning, but doesn&#x27;t allow the pillow to be very stable/sturdy?</li>
            <li>The bottom filled with water and did not drain which made the pillow extremely heavy.</li>
            <li>The item I ordered only had 2 panels and did not include the top round panel.</li>
            <li>The first few times using it, it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>The very small holes are all along seams in the top pillow where the plastic covering is welded together.</li>
            <li>it shut with duct tape to be sure it wouldn&#x27;t begin leaking on the way and ruin everything that might ever be below it on the truck; it weighed about the same as a small bag of sugar, which puts it at about 3 lbs.</li>
            <li>On top of that, when I wanted to return it, I was expected to pay the fee for the return, which would have been about five dollars less than what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, but, like the other reviews, it sprang leaks right away and became water-logged and difficult to drain.</li>
            <li>It quickly became a hassle because the suction cups are not easy to attach back onto the pillow.</li>
            <li>Bigger than I expected and very comfy.</li>
            <li>The pillow is now full of water, is heavy and will not drain or dry out.</li>
            <li>Head rest part is not exactly a good fit for my current tub.</li>
            <li>CERTAINLY not worth the high price tag.</li>

            <li> CERTAINLY not worth the high price tag.</li>
            <li> When it got here I didn&#x27;t find it that bad because I really needed something to replace the towel under my neck while taking long baths and this was good for it and very comfortable even though it&#x27;s not perfect and doesn&#x27;t really stick well to the tub which can be frustrating at times.</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting off the top pillow and just using the bottom part.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s long, supports your shoulders, doesn&#x27;t get a hole and air run out.</li>
            <li> I tried to dry it out, but nothing worked.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the suction cups don&#x27;t last long before they start coming off the back.  </li>
            <li> I was really not sure if buying this is a good idea considering the bad reviews</li>
            <li> it was only a half pillow.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this pillow, the last one lasted several years before a small hole started letting water in, but hey it is water, it gets in things that is what it does.</li>
            <li> It wa all I expected it to be  </li>
            <li> I spent $6.95 to have it shipped to me, $8.95 to return it, and then they gave me a 50% credit&lt;br /&gt;because</li>
            <li> Not the size that we expected, but it does work.</li>
            <li> kept falling down the suction cups are the absolute worse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fortunately rare for products to fail this badly this quickly.</li>
            <li> Comfy, but leaks and filled with water, making it smell bad</li>
            <li> Tried cleaning excessively, waiting till dry and cleaning suction cups.</li>
            <li> just like others, the suction cups came off easily and it ripped at the seams with in a month disappointed.  </li>
            <li> What we received was the bottom half of what is pictured.</li>
            <li> Now, after a little over 1/2 year...</li>
            <li> Not comfortable at all.  </li>
            <li> Its too heavy to put in my luggage to take home...would cost me extre for being over weight.</li>
            <li> I just wasted a bunch of time and energy and got no product.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost :/</li>
            <li> The real disappointment is the suction cups are so small that they won&#x27;t stick to the pebble finish utilized on most bath seats for safety reasons.</li>
            <li> So, now we have a soft cushion that slips and slides around making for a dangerous condition.</li>
            <li> the suction cups are towards the outside and its difficult to get them to stick.  </li>
            <li> :\ I have to push against it for it to stay, and the suction cups don&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> after using for a month or so....when taken out was  very very heavy...</li>
            <li> just very heavy.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these pillows before and just plain wore it out!</li>
            <li> Pillow fills with water and is unable to drain or dry out.  </li>
            <li> My only fear is that it will mildew bad like the shower curtain.</li>
            <li> I was searching a bath pillow for a while, saw the review about this one, and bought it, unfortunately it did not meet my expectation, because the pillow is small and can not attach to the bath, it is definitely not good design.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a thing in the world wrong with this product, but it doesn&#x27;t work too well in MY Jacuzzi tub because it covers two of the jets.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the WORST bath pillow I&#x27;ve ever owned and stupidly</li>
            <li> This is a bad product.  </li>
            <li> Bad bad bad.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

            <li> does not stay in place.</li>
            <li> Just got for Christmas but so far so good, it is comfy</li>
            <li> Suction cups come out and it fills with water. Gross. But comfortable.</li>
            <li> I was searching a bath pillow for a while, saw the review about this one, and bought it, unfortunately it did not meet my expectation, because the pillow is small and can not attach to the bath, it is definitely not good design. I only tried once since I bought it, I wanted to return it but just too busy, didn&#x27;t have time to pack it up and return it. I would not recommend it if you want a good one. Thanks</li>
            <li> Love them we bought 2</li>
            <li> Not what arrived,  it was only a half pillow.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and soft.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Enough padding for my neck</li>
            <li> Broke apart the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> The suction cups are always coming off and then water gets in through the holes.</li>
            <li> It wa all I expected it to be  I just wish it had more suction cups it tends to float when tub is full</li>
            <li> The item I ordered only had 2 panels and did not include the top round panel.</li>
            <li> This product ripped on the 4th or 5th use...bad quality.</li>
            <li> The suction cups have all come off. Plan to cut off the bottom section and see if I can still use it as a pillow.</li>
            <li> It waked well enough, and I was content with the cushioning, although it wasn&#x27;t a perfect fit. Now, after a little over 1/2 year... A suction cup tore out, now water gets inside and bacteria is gathering.</li>
            <li> This bath pillow is so comfortable and actually suctions to my tub. I ended up using it for an hour bc its so comfortable!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter for Xmas.  She absolutely loves it. I recommend it highly.  Think everyone will love it!</li>
            <li> The third time I used this, the vinyl covering sprang a leak and the pillow began to take on water.  I used it a few more times until I knew I&#x27;d have a chance to drop it off at UPS to return it, and by the time I was ready to wrap this baby up to mail, it was so filled with water I had to wrap it in a huge Ziploc bag and then tape it shut with duct tape to be sure it wouldn&#x27;t begin leaking on the way and ruin everything that might ever be below it on the truck; it weighed about the same as a small bag of sugar, which puts it at about 3 lbs. of water, which is pushing a half-gallon.  This is a bad product.  Bad bad bad.  It&#x27;s fortunately rare for products to fail this badly this quickly.</li>
            <li> Pillow fills with water and is unable to drain or dry out.  We quit using fearing that it would mold inside.</li>
            <li> It makes taking a bath better.</li>
            <li> Will not stay stuck on bathtub.  Tried cleaning excessively, waiting till dry and cleaning suction cups. No luck. Cant even use it.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a thing in the world wrong with this product, but it doesn&#x27;t work too well in MY Jacuzzi tub because it covers two of the jets.  If you&#x27;re going to get something like this, you will be much more satisfied if you make sure it will fit your tub.</li>
            <li> This was just too big for my bath tub. I spent $6.95 to have it shipped to me, $8.95 to return it, and then they gave me a 50% credit&lt;br /&gt;because they said it looked used. It was used once which is where I discovered it didn&#x27;t work in my tub. The product is somewhat stiff as well which wasn&#x27;t very comfortable. In the future, I&#x27;m sticking to free shipping orders.</li>
            <li> Not the size that we expected, but it does work. The suction cups really stick to the tub Good price too.</li>
            <li> We have to fold over the top pillow so there is enough padding for your head and shoulder area. Besides that, it is a decent bath pillow.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get the bath pillow to stay up in the tub.  It is well made, and I use it, but still trying to figure it out.</li>
            <li> It does not stay in place, the suction cups ripped off within days, and the plastic tore within a couple of months. Overpriced for exceptionally low quality. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> Not comfortable at all.  Maybe if you are six feet tall.  If I fill the tub, the spa pillow detaches and won&#x27;t stay put.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 10 months ago. The first few times using it, it worked pretty well. I did realize soon though that the suction cups on the back were not going to stick to the tub. That did bother me too much. What really gets me is that after using it maybe 10 times the top pillow filled with water. I tried to dry it out, but nothing worked. I ended up cutting off the top pillow and just using the bottom part. It does make the bath more comfy, but I would probably look for something more sturdy.</li>
            <li> This pillow did not last a month the suction cups came off after the second use and then it tore and took on water.</li>
            <li> I like it but it likes to slip at first but it stays if u put it in one place and leave it alone. Good product I like that it&#x27;s more then just the head pillow also the back. Quick delivery a day or 2 (:</li>
            <li> The pillow fit the tub very nicely and provided required comfort for a very special head/neck,&lt;br /&gt;It takes a while to secure pillow to tub properly, but not a real problem.</li>
            <li> The quality of this bath pillow is fine, but it&#x27;s just like 90% of the size it needs to be to cover either of the bath seats we have in our home. The real disappointment is the suction cups are so small that they won&#x27;t stick to the pebble finish utilized on most bath seats for safety reasons. So, now we have a soft cushion that slips and slides around making for a dangerous condition.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this pillow, the last one lasted several years before a small hole started letting water in, but hey it is water, it gets in things that is what it does. And it did take about 2 years before that happened.</li>
            <li> The pillow is wonderful. I have a walkin tub and works great. I am very pleased and would recommend it not only is your head comfortable but so are your shoulders.</li>
            <li> I was really not sure if buying this is a good idea considering the bad reviews however there is not a lot of options out there. When it got here I didn&#x27;t find it that bad because I really needed something to replace the towel under my neck while taking long baths and this was good for it and very comfortable even though it&#x27;s not perfect and doesn&#x27;t really stick well to the tub which can be frustrating at times. I&#x27;m still hoping to have a better product but this will do for now.</li>
            <li> Works well, very comfortable, no problem with suction cup attachment.&lt;br /&gt;Only problem....after using for a month or so....when taken out was  very very heavy...thought water had gotten in and soaked it but doesnt seem to be the case. No holes for water to enter and I cant feel water inside....just very heavy. Its too heavy to put in my luggage to take home...would cost me extre for being over weight.</li>
            <li> I had looked for two years in stores trying to find one.  Went on line and took a chance.  I love it.  Fell asleep in tub it was so comfortable.  Grandson thinks it is a tub slide.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a gift basket of bath/spa products. Looks impressive. Haven&#x27;t heard any complaints.</li>
            <li> So far so good!! My fiance loves her bath pillow. I haven&#x27;t seen any problems that I read about on this pillow. She says it is very comfortable and stays in place.</li>
            <li> The problem is most tubs are curved and the suction cups are towards the outside and its difficult to get them to stick.  The pillow is comfortable through once you get it set up and much better than the ones you fill with air.</li>
            <li> This bath pillow is perfect. It&#x27;s longer than most which keeps you from sliding, cushions your shoulders and lets you sit higher if you want.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. The product is large enough to comfortably fit a man or woman and is study while also being soft.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  The suction cups hold, the head and neck portion of the pad fits properly in the tub making it very comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bath pillow ever. I finally found one that fits my tub and allows me to relax in the bath.</li>
            <li> its comfortable but doesn&#x27;t stay in place as well as I would like but it is definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> Item is as advertised. New, excellent condition, arrived as promised. Great deal for the price &amp; will use again.</li>
            <li> I loved this at first the problems started after a few uses. Suction cups come off, split along the seem and foam is soaked with water almost never drying out. Needs some improvements</li>
            <li> The pillow is comfortable, but it&#x27;s too buoyant. Maybe it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t weigh enough (100lbs), but I can&#x27;t use it right because it pushes me up. :\ I have to push against it for it to stay, and the suction cups don&#x27;t work at all (though I don&#x27;t have a ceramic tub, I have a plastic one!).&lt;br /&gt;I let it float on my stomach and I rest my hands on it instead.</li>
            <li> The pillow looks great in the tub. It is very comfortable from head to seat! I will order more in the future for myself and my family.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a single use. Very comfortable, but, like the other reviews, it sprang leaks right away and became water-logged and difficult to drain.</li>
            <li> Thus is great for your bathtub. Can relax with your pillow in place lock to tub to be able to relax. Love it.</li>
            <li> Tis is the most comfortable spa pillow I have ever purchased. I recommend the item to anyone who is looking for an excellent item.</li>
            <li> wont stay in place, it floats and the suction cups pop out.</li>
            <li> Works properly, stays clean, I even use it in the pool for leaning against the side</li>
            <li> First use and my finger poked a hole right through the plastic, to the foam inside!  Also, it is not white, but a cream/brownish white that does not look good on my soaker tub.  Very disapointed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit quite right for the type of bathtub we have - I have made it work (somewhat). Looking for something for a whirlpool tub</li>
            <li> I have had one of these pillows before and just plain wore it out! My only complaint is that the suction cups don&#x27;t last long before they start coming off the back.  Once that happens you can&#x27;t really get them to go back in again.  I still use the pillow without the suction cups and it works just fine. Nice support for my long soaks!</li>
            <li> Floats, which causes it to tear away from the suction cups on the back.</li>
            <li> This is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Best bath pillow I have bought.  Love it.  Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> No attempt was made to send me the correct item. It wasn&#x27;t even an option on the return process. You need to work this out. I just wasted a bunch of time and energy and got no product. I would really have liked getting the right product. This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> kept falling down the suction cups are the absolute worse. I do not recommend it at all to anyone who is considering this product</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s long, supports your shoulders, doesn&#x27;t get a hole and air run out. you need this if you&#x27;re looking for a great pillow that&#x27;s plush but forming.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what was advertised. I may switch to a full body pillow, but that is personal preference.</li>
            <li> The suction cups come off of the pillow constantly. They stick very well to the tub. They don&#x27;t stay with the pillow very well. It quickly became a hassle because the suction cups are not easy to attach back onto the pillow.</li>
            <li> Comfy, but leaks and filled with water, making it smell bad</li>
            <li> Did not come was as pictured. It was a gift and my wife likes it but the head pillow was not included.</li>
            <li> Bath mat is nicely made. Only drawback is that the suction cups pop out of the back. Only can imagine this is for cleaning, but doesn&#x27;t allow the pillow to be very stable/sturdy?</li>
            <li> What we received was the bottom half of what is pictured. Also it ripped at the seams after just a week of use. The bottom filled with water and did not drain which made the pillow extremely heavy.</li>
            <li> I would give this a zero (0) if I could. Absolutely the WORST bath pillow I&#x27;ve ever owned and stupidly, I bought a second one, hoping that all of the flaws the first one had were just a fluke. Yes, the suction cups pull off the pillow within minutes, ripping the fabric and allowing the foam inside to fill up with water. I promise you, you will regret buying this pillow. All of the positive reviews had to have been written by individuals who had only used the pillow once. It is beautiful. It is comfortable. However, if falls apart after two or three baths (at the most) and you&#x27;re left with ripped fabric, soggy foam, and a bunch of suction cups stuck to your tub.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product for the first 6 months I had it. It was wonderful. It stayed in place and was very comfortable. However, I tried to move it to clean my tub and now it will not stick to the tub anymore. Since it is held on by suction cups I don&#x27;t understand this. Now whenever I use it the water just pushes it up and out of the tub.</li>
            <li> Had one of these before. Perfect for a soak in the tub.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it very relaxing</li>
            <li> This product is soft and comfortable great for lying in tub. It inflates and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected and very comfy. My only fear is that it will mildew bad like the shower curtain.</li>
            <li> I love my winter evening baths and thought this pillow would help make it more comfortable. Not only does it not stick to the tub and floats, but if you do manage to get one suction cup on, expect it to rip the plastic. CERTAINLY not worth the high price tag. On top of that, when I wanted to return it, I was expected to pay the fee for the return, which would have been about five dollars less than what I paid for it. Terrible product, do NOT buy.</li>
            <li> just like others, the suction cups came off easily and it ripped at the seams with in a month disappointed.  Not worth the cost :/</li>
            <li> soothing and comfortable.  Almost fell asleep in the tub.</li>
            <li> I got this pillow and loved it at first. Then I used the pillow three times and after the third use found holes in the cover which allowed water into one of the pillow sections. The pillow is now full of water, is heavy and will not drain or dry out. The very small holes are all along seams in the top pillow where the plastic covering is welded together. Poor quality.</li>
            <li> Head rest part is not exactly a good fit for my current tub. Had to order a different product to get it right.</li>
            <li> Seam split after using for 10 days.</li>
            <li> Remember Matthew 7:21</li>
            <li> I like this one much better that the traditional one, its very compfortable</li>
            <li> I really like this pillow, it&#x27;s like having a bed in the tub!! It&#x27;s so comfortable and easy to maintain</li>
            <li> This pillow was overpriced and does not stay put in my garden tub as the tub is rounded.  I won&#x27;t be buying another one.</li>
