            <li>The serum truly does feel like silk on your hands and it has a very pleasant smell too.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!!</li>
            <li>I have used it in a spray form as well and both are very good.  </li>

            <li>It works beautifully on Caucasian and African-American hair.</li>
            <li>The oil when placed on the hair after a shampoo gives the hair a beautiful shine.</li>

            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Hair seems stringy and has fly aways after use.</li>
            <li>I am happy I splurged and bought this one.</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;ve chemically treated your hair before.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I could find it on Amazon from one of their trustworthy merchants.</li>
            <li>Biosilk is a really great product.</li>
            <li>For shoulder-length hair, a nickle-sized amount works great.  </li>
            <li>This works great by itslef-  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for anyone with frizzy fly away hair.</li>

            <li>(I think it&#x27;s redesigned one), but I knew it&#x27;s really great product for hair.  </li>
            <li>Have used for a year with great results, but have purchased from salon.  </li>
            <li>I think this stuff is a great product.  </li>

            <li>the price was great for the amount you get......</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another great product is [[ASIN:B008BT2P7S</li>
            <li>It is a great product to avoid frizz.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>that tells you that I&#x27;m happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;smells</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>Perfect on any kind of hair.</li>
            <li>I use this product all the time and am evry happy with it.</li>
            <li>This was a great find</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to have something that works.</li>
            <li>Biosilk silk thearapy serum is very popular amongst my friends / family.     </li>
            <li>The smell is very nice too, I feel like I just walked out of a beauty salon when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Great product, at the best price you&#x27;ll be able to find.  </li>
            <li>I use it about 3X a week along with my hair straightener and the results are amazing !  </li>
            <li>This has been the best price I have been able to find...</li>
            <li>I love it is the best..</li>
            <li>While still in the shower I wring my hair out the best I can, then I apply this before getting out so it will trap the most moisture.</li>
            <li>stuff is better than BEST!</li>
            <li>Thrilled!</li>
            <li>It works best when the hair is damp after washing, and it soaks into the hair much better to keep the hair follicles from drying without needing moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li>Great product, good price</li>
            <li>I also love the awesome smell.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair nice and silky!</li>
            <li>Biosilk is probably a good product for some people, but it does not work great for my type of hair.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this stuff, and when I found it on amazon for a great price i had to  buy it.</li>
            <li>:) Great buy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fully satisfied with it and the price  is excellent as well.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff, as it leaves my hair looking and feeling awesome.</li>
            <li>I used to love Biosilk and was very happy with how it made my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>Biosilk has a pleasant and a thicker constancy.</li>
            <li>but I purchased it at a beauty store, and the smell is so pleasant</li>
            <li>It Great OK!</li>
            <li>Best leave in conditioner available.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used my fair share of hair serums/oils...</li>
            <li>It works well and smells great, but it&#x27;s not as effective as it used to be.</li>
            <li>it and it smells good too.</li>
            <li>I loved it, then I this happened.....</li>

            <li>Good protectant.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter if you do or not, but ionic products enhance everything good that you can do to your hair including this product.  </li>
            <li>Every once in a while it is good to use a shampoo that rids your hair of build up with this product.  </li>
            <li>As another person said in a post, this is a good reason to use a moisturizing shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find that this product does a good job at control, &amp; the frizz.</li>
            <li>and I so loved the fragrance and feel of my hair that I immediately bought some.  </li>
            <li>It smells good, too.</li>
            <li>I got good price from this seller,so I bought 2 at a time.</li>
            <li>Also good for the skin as well.</li>
            <li>HOLD A CURL WITHOUT A GOOD QUALITY PRODUCT.</li>

            <li>I bought this at a discount beauty supply company, and have been thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>Okay, bought biosilk after hearing alot of good things about it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use heat, so I use this just to keep my hair nice after a shower, which it does.</li>
            <li>Silk Therapy is such a great product and Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li>I have had so many people tell me I smelled so good, and ask what I was wearing.</li>
            <li>Then I found this product from biosilk which is as good or even better.</li>

            <li>This is best hair silking product by far.</li>

            <li>This serum has a pleasant, slightly sweet</li>
            <li>wow I fall in love on this product!!!</li>
            <li>This is great for those with some frizzes and excellent for bed head where you dont want to do a full hair job in the morning--yet still look good after putting a little on and rushing out the door.    </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years now and love it.</li>
            <li>I have used Silk Therapy for many years, and it is an outstanding product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It still feels silky and silicony, but I&#x27;ve been purchasing from salons since this experience to make sure I get the authentic product.</li>
            <li>You have to use just a litte, and that&#x27;s what is perfect, because you will have the same bottle forever.</li>
            <li>I just love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.. tried lots of others..</li>
            <li>and I am sure others can to.</li>
            <li>This is not the authentic product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a great product that really is longlasting.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure if you haven&#x27;t used it&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>as many have stated.</li>
            <li>It comes with tape on the top for shipping purposes.</li>

            <li>there, I have tried almost every serum on the market, from drug store discounts to internet sensations that are even more spendy than this.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Even on the rainiest most humid day.</li>
            <li>I love Biosilk, I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s healthy as can be.</li>

            <li>,  More can always be added.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Interesting how it&#x27;s stated in the product info here that the packaging may vary...</li>
            <li>Anytime I purchase this product from a salon, there&#x27;s always a cover on top of the opening to the bottle that needs to be pulled off by it&#x27;s tab.</li>
            <li>Works ok for the price&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Better hair days with this product.</li>
            <li>The Biosilk is my favorite leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I was trying to go without the biosilk to save money, but I caved and bought some more.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy after I use it like regular conditioners.</li>
            <li>I would never be able to comb out the knots after I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>what more could I ask for?  </li>
            <li>It can be used from the top of the head to the bottom of the feet.</li>
            <li>One more product on my growing list.</li>
            <li>I love biosilk.  </li>
            <li>I think some of the cheeper products out there are better than this.</li>
            <li>But that was ok.  </li>
            <li>and this one is even more thinner</li>
            <li>Buy it from a reputable salon.</li>
            <li>Biosilk comes with a BluePrint \\&quot;Pull Here\\&quot; on top of the silver seal, this product does not.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I just like it the skinny serum better.</li>
            <li>I bought mine in an authentic Biosilk 3-piece gift set from Target.</li>
            <li>I have purchased biosilk from the beauty supply store in town MANY times.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Excellent Product, this is the second time that I purchase this item</li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel softer, but I think I was expecting more out of it.</li>
            <li>Doesnt magically make your hair shiny.</li>
            <li>Also always worried the product will leak but packaging made sure that this product would not leak during shipping.  </li>
            <li>I love this product..great for skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works like magic.</li>

            <li>It says shake well on the top</li>
            <li>It was an expired product from 2011 and it was more like liquid alchol</li>
            <li>Biolage Exquisite Oil Replenishing Treatment 3.1 oz.]] which can be used in multiple ways: at night, in the shower, or during styling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also light like the paul mitchell and has a nice smell :)</li>
            <li>Love this product, lightweight, leaves hair feeling silky, soft and smooth... smells good too!!</li>
            <li>I suggested that she put the Biosilk on her hair and finish the blowdrying, and the results were phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I love this Product.  </li>
            <li>If I use more my hair looks greasy.</li>
            <li>it being more dense</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I know this product gets tons of rave reviews, and maybe this is just me, but I&#x27;m not feeling the Biosilk serum love.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>Love Love Love it.</li>
            <li>Better price on Amazon and comes to your mailbox</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>I read reviews about Amazon selling a deluted version of what you can get at a beauty store, but I thought that I would have a better experience.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it...</li>

            <li>LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and effective.</li>
            <li>Authentic Biosilk.</li>
            <li>Make sure you buy from a reputable seller.  </li>
            <li>:) 5 STARS FROM ME</li>
            <li>Someone is diluting it &amp; it is much more watery and has a thinner consistency.  </li>
            <li>Love this, use it after every wash</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these products and this seller has the best deal and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this one the best of all, and believe me I have tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;It started out with frizz-ease in my teenage years, which was a god send and the first product that allowed me to really love and appreciate the gorgeous hair I was born with.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still the best thing too if you are using a flat iron.</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who require more maintenance with their hair, biosilk might be better in that it is heavier and does work well, but for those who have hair like mine (fine and requiring every-day wash), paul mitchell is a much better alternative.</li>
            <li>Very clean smelling.</li>
            <li>I am now using Biosilk and it is soft &amp; Beautiful.</li>
            <li>Not the original but works just as well!</li>
            <li>not every Marshalls has it but northern NJ does have the original and cheaper!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if this product works good on the hair or not, but for sure, i dont like the smell...  </li>
            <li>More importantly, my hair is in better condition than it ever has been.</li>
            <li>Keeps the braids slicked back so nicely and smells great too.  </li>
            <li>It really adds a healthy shine and makes the color of my hair look really good.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I have fine hair and Biosilk</li>
            <li>I put it in damp hair and whether I blow it dry (which is best) or not, it keeps tangles to a minimum, but my favorite part is that my hair feels so silky and smooth without being greasy or feeling caked up with product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Biosilk, a product that most women will swear buy, as it makes their hair nice and soft, flow nicely, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>glad to find this at amazon and buy at cheaper price with free shipping.</li>
            <li>My hair remained smooth and frizz free!</li>
            <li>Combine with moisturizing shampoo and ceramic straightener to have healthy, smooth, and shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>i love this product it makes my hair silky &amp; smooth</li>
            <li>I also feel that because it&#x27;s sort of waxy it pulls off my hair more because it doesn&#x27;t go on smooth.</li>
            <li>and I honestly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth $16.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best leave-in treatment on the market and has been for many years.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re using this serum for the first time I recommend putting a tiny dab in the palm of your hand, work that into the hair and gradually add more if needed to find that perfect amount for you.  </li>
            <li>The light smell is wonderful and it does not weigh your hair down like most over products.  </li>
            <li>This order came within 2 days and was such a great surprise when I saw the huge bottle!  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and healthy looking along with a smooth frizz free all day style.    </li>
            <li>yet you can easily see the surviving trace around the rim.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried so far as it seems to be absorbed quickly by the hair and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially good if you wash your hair, and, before blow drying it, you rub it in your hands, and just smooth it all over the wet hair.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product if your looking for strength and softness.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I know some people don&#x27;t like it, or find it&#x27;s too strong, so there&#x27;s that to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have paid full price for this and have been completely satisfied, if not blown away.</li>
            <li>so you can have beautiful, silky,and shiny hair and save money at the same time....</li>
            <li>Results are okay, certainly not bad</li>
            <li>I get the best results with keeping the smell down and getting results</li>
            <li>Her hair is now silky smooth and easy to comb.  </li>
            <li>Less is definitely best is you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>Smells SOOOOOOO good and feels very soft.</li>
            <li>she said it makes hair very soft and good looking</li>
            <li>We loved the great smell, shine,and smooth texture it leaves in your hair and because it was light it didn&#x27;t leave a very heavy feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now for the truly wonderful thing about Biosilk Silk Therapy....as a very special treat, I love to smooth a very small amount on my arms and legs after a shower.  </li>
            <li>the lotion is a little pricey so shop around for the best buy.</li>
            <li>I learned a lot about hair there and got to try a huge number of products, including Biosilk Serum which I have been using since then.</li>
            <li>It made it feel so smooth and the smell...to die</li>
            <li>It dries smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to get this from Amazon and especially that I can subscribe to it</li>
            <li>Not only great for hair but for skin too.</li>
            <li>Silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>Silky smooth locks    </li>
            <li>This makes my hair SO smooth and non-frizzy.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so smooth.</li>
            <li>It feels fantastic no matter where you apply it.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the smell of cheap perfume or cologne, you probably won&#x27;t like this.    </li>
            <li>I have tried everything on the market that promises to smooth my hair.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking to have your hair smell and look fantastic</li>
            <li>Also, rub into your hands &amp; then smooth onto your hair--</li>
            <li>I never felt my hair so smooth before using this product.</li>
            <li>I have used it for years and was ecstatic to find it at such a GREAT price.  </li>
            <li>Basically, we went through every cheap drugstore brand of hair serum, frizz-ease, got2b, garnier fructis, pantene, suave, and everything else under $10.  </li>
            <li>It is important to know what hair types that products work on.  </li>
            <li>BUT biosilk is light and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>The formula is non-greasy and has a silky smooth finish.</li>
            <li>This product is light and helps against &amp;#34;the freeze&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice shine in your hair with out the greasy look if you don&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, makes hair appear shiny without seeming oily, and smells</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s smooth and bouncy</li>
            <li>(my hair has never been smooth and bouncy).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does smooth hair well</li>
            <li>I wish they would have a fragrance free serum.</li>
            <li>I thought if the produce is defect, the shipping is free.</li>
            <li>and it really make my hair better and better</li>
            <li>I have used the real Biosilk on my hair many many times.</li>
            <li>And after using this, my hair is really soft and smells really good.</li>
            <li>Hair smells good and makes them soft and shiny</li>
            <li>it have too much alcohol smell!!!    </li>
            <li>And nothing, absolutely nothing comes close to Biosilk!!!</li>
            <li>Works wonderful for those who blow dry their hair daily, I love it and also use the shampoo!</li>
            <li>Biosilk&#x27;s main ingredient, hydrolyzed silk, is an amazing substance that gives moisture and sheen to the hair shaft.</li>
            <li>It smells light and clean and leaves a silky feeling on the skin and</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel and it has calmed down the fly away dryness.  </li>
            <li>I moved to a new state and no one carries it, so being able to get it here made my day!</li>
            <li>It is highly recommended to those who seek effective heat protector, as well as hair treatment for silky hair.</li>
            <li>, i love it very much but&lt;</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really smell too pleasant straight out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>but it is so worth it !  </li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>My hairdresser had originally used it on my hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and I feel like it really controls frizz and leaves my hair soft and it smells great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the biosilk serum for two years, and I really like it! :)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an expert, but I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Biosilk but its pretty pricy...</li>
            <li>love this so much!</li>
            <li>I love it sooooo much!</li>
            <li>and it is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>First of all, I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I love this product so much!</li>
            <li>First, it has a REALLY STRONG fragrance (what I call odor) which smells like CHEAP PERFUME OR CHEAP COLOGNE.</li>
            <li>By the way, this is also a great product for dry skin -</li>
            <li>By the way, this is also a great product for dry skin -</li>
            <li>I like the weightless and clean look.</li>
            <li>Biosilk is essential for my hair extensions and make my own hair shine healthy</li>
            <li>It works best on hair that is left natural.</li>
            <li>I do not have to color my hair because this product adds so much health to it that my natural color looks great.  </li>
            <li>I can not live without this lol.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using BioSilk Silk Therapy for a long time now and LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>Finish off with a flat iron, and your hair will look absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft, silky, shiny, and manageable--I love it!</li>
            <li>some reviewers said, but the last bottle I got (at a pharmacy) was wonderful and made my hair feel soft and LOOK soft, not to mention it smoothed my hair cuticles and smelled soooo nice.</li>
            <li>One thing that&#x27;s very important to add is that it does not take much of this serum to achieve those results.  </li>
            <li>the morning my hair is glossy, soft, frizz-free and my waves so well defined that I can dare just touch up some strays with the flat iron and leave it like that &amp;#62;&amp;#62;Oh, and the best part...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this product did anything special for my hair--</li>
            <li>(If I also use a straightening wand for special occasions, it looks like \\&quot;princess hair.\\&quot;) &lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a special improvement in my hair health</li>
            <li>it did not create a good straight press, it did not seem to leave my hair particularly moisturized either.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly they dry very quickly and tend to be in form for a longer time.</li>
            <li>I bought the biggest bottle possible and it feels so good on my hair.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very watery, more like an oil.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery love this product</li>
            <li>It has completely changed how I think of my own hair.</li>
            <li>and maybe you&#x27;d love it as much as I</li>
            <li>and maybe you&#x27;d love it as much as I do.      </li>
            <li>i know it doesn&#x27;t cure split or burnt ends, but after shampooing and cool drying i use this</li>
            <li>Overall, I recommend a good conditioner instead.</li>
            <li>It is true that some of the sellers using amazon&#x27;s market place may not be on the up and up</li>
            <li>when i first bought this biosilk product two years ago it was nice and thick, now its not viscus at all, more like water that smells good</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and fast service with this seller</li>
            <li>I must say, it is true.  </li>
            <li>This product is good for taming moderate frizz, adding shine and softness to my hair.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>It really makes your hair healthy &amp; shining.    </li>
            <li>I am able to run a large barrel curling iron right over it to smooth it out.  </li>
            <li>You take about a teaspoon full, rub it in your hands and then run your hands through your hair.</li>
            <li>My hair looks full and silky.</li>
            <li>This is my go to product for a shiny straight blow out, I do wish it smelled better</li>
            <li>When I received it, it was the serum vs the true Biosilk leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I was misled by the claims on the bottle...thought it would make my hair nice and shiny and soft.....</li>
            <li>I want a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have also found this product useful for controlling frizz and fly-aways - just rub a drop or two between your palms and smooth over the ends of the hair.</li>
            <li>If you get it somewhere like Target or CVS, you will be paying full retail.  </li>
            <li>But I have this hair so maybe it works best on thick hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s top notch because it gives those defined curls without the feeling of having too much product in your hair.</li>
            <li>My hair used to stick up a bit in the middle, but with this, it stays perfect and easy to manage all day long without feeling greasy or using any hardening gels or sprays.</li>
            <li>It smells very strong like cheap perfume and if you use too much, the smell is too much.</li>
            <li>subscribed for it and got the first 2 deliveries perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>and It was so much more expensive than this product, this product IS the best trust me</li>
            <li>I always used to buy in Lucky or Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I ordered this item from Quick E Shop, and the product in the bottle was NOT Biosilk.  </li>
            <li>be be quick in the morning.   </li>
            <li>quick note about how I use this product.</li>
            <li>I have purchased in the salon, but it&#x27;s adequate.</li>
            <li>I have tried many similar product, Silk is still my favorite..</li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum, 5.1 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>and in one use, it won me over, even though I have been a loyal user of biosilk for 6 years or so</li>
            <li>but i is not real it is fake!!!</li>
            <li>then I flat iron...and add some after for a nice shine and smooth finish.</li>
            <li>A great value, even with paying freight, about half of what it retails for in my area.</li>
            <li>This was an easy and fast transaction.</li>
            <li>So really appreciated the easy access.</li>
            <li>Shake the bottle, and I mean shake it real good, the oil and all the other good stuff in there need to mix.</li>
            <li>Using too much leaves fine hair a bit oily</li>
            <li>The smooth silky feel of my clothes gliding on is pure heaven.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that my hair look absolutely great; I spend little time on it.</li>
            <li>it was surprisingly very silky and smooth feeling.  </li>
            <li>Fast free  shipping also a plus.</li>
            <li>I also use this to finger through my hair when it&#x27;s curled to calm the fly-aways.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing when you have the actual product.</li>
            <li>Okay, first off, when i first received this i was freaked out because when i poured it out it was all alcohol and watery like, but you need to really listen to the directions (cough).</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>was worth the money and wait.</li>
            <li>Few years back I found Pantene Smooth Serum which was just an awesome product</li>
            <li>I have soft curly hair in a humid environment, and I love using this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the $.</li>
            <li>Biosilk Silk Therapy is a magic hair product that will leave your hair so soft and shining you won&#x27;t need to buy another hair product again.</li>
            <li>My hair has a natural wave, but seems to get frizzy on the top of my head.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and how soft it makes my hair</li>
            <li>The smell of this product is really powerful for me.</li>
            <li>love biosilk so soft</li>
            <li>I initially liked it but stopped using it - felt like it didn&#x27;t change my hair, only affected it when I used it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Just a few drops rubbed through leaves my hair shiny, soft and delightfully scented.</li>
            <li>My skin absorbed it in seconds.</li>
            <li>the correct product is dense liquid, with decent smell, but this one is like water, with strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>But, the most recent one I received is just not the original product.</li>
            <li>Great product to tame frizzy hair and make it shinier.</li>
            <li>but just kind of made it lay flat and look greasy.</li>
            <li>It IS the right stuff.</li>
            <li>I use this product right after a shampoo,</li>
            <li>It has just the right touch of hair control for him without leaving his hair looking as if he had used any hair product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In any event, the product sold by Amazon.com LLC, was the right one-</li>
            <li>Therefore, when I smell it, I think of her right away.  </li>
            <li>The smell is right</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong at first, but it dissipates fast, too, so</li>
            <li>the best thick frizz help I have found though but easily weighs down fine hair strands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be sure to shake the bottle well and don&#x27;t get exuberant in applying</li>
            <li>Use this everyday and it keeps my hair nice and silky!</li>
            <li>This was a great value (I find it much more expensive at the salon or grocery stores)</li>
            <li>It is absolutely FABULOUS ( and did I mention that my hair is natural !</li>
            <li>They have the idea right, as many hair conditioners contain some of the same ingredients as body lotions, making multi-tasking easier.</li>
            <li>I recomend this product very much.</li>
            <li>I RECEIVED MY PRODUCT VERY FAST...</li>
            <li>Just rub over your elbows or any other rough skin - it is an excellent skin moisturizer as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just rub over your elbows or any other rough skin - it is an excellent skin moisturizer as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for blow drying, but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Not just subtly softer, if you&#x27;re paying close attention, but like the difference between those new kind of plush toys that have extra-silky fur, compared to the old-fashioned kind of stuffed-animal fur.</li>
            <li>and it was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I use this product all the time, and it sells for more than double this price in the store.  </li>
            <li>My mom had bought this years ago for the first time and from the get go my sisters</li>
            <li>The waves have better shape and the frizz is almost entirely gone.</li>
            <li>Therapy\\&quot; because that&#x27;s exactly what it makes your hair feel like.</li>
            <li>Therapy\\&quot; because that&#x27;s exactly what it makes your hair feel like.</li>
            <li>I recently bought this item for the first time and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It absolutely makes the world of a difference!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ordered it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It will do nothing but give you a pleasing smell, and the great fragrance does not last long.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair silky, smooth, soft, and manageable.</li>
            <li>and this is the first time I purchased from Amazon...</li>
            <li>First time I ordered this product in Amazon coz</li>
            <li>I got my first bottle of biosilk silk therapy in May</li>
            <li>I wrap my hair faithfully every night, it lasts until my next wash without my continuing to put heat on it more than that.  </li>
            <li>My husband is the one that uses it the most and only uses about two drops, rubs between his hands and then applies it to his hair.  </li>
            <li>One must try this to know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about</li>
            <li>No need to read the review, just buy the product already  ;)</li>
            <li>Totally out ranks the top name brand I had sworn by for years.  </li>
            <li>Biosilk never fails.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>had this been my first exposure.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I buy it at Amazon.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not fake.</li>
            <li>This is an absolute  &amp;#34;MUST HAVE&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>So I Googled it and sure enough it contains alcohol.</li>
            <li>I thought this was an original product since it was bottled exactly the same as the original.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used biosilk for so long though that I rarely use more than I need now since I&#x27;ve adjusted according to how my hair reacts...</li>
            <li>And the shipping was fast !</li>
            <li>Alcohol is the first thing that comes out when you squeeze the bottle.</li>
            <li>I first had it applied to my hair by a hairdresser in NYC</li>
            <li>The price is much better than local Target.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried it before, I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>My local beauty supply store discontinued it from their shelves (I suspect many are going over to argan oil products)</li>
            <li>MUST shake well first.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I used to be able to buy a bottle even bigger than this at Costco for about $11, then they quit selling it.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well for smoothing but don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>, you should not use this product everyday, as it does contain a good bit of alcohol.</li>
            <li>OH yes,  the price is so reasonable and a little bit goes a long way, truly the best I have found.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is so nice &amp; pleasant &amp; can be used on not only dry hair, but dry skin, also.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for the dry Colorado days to tame staticy hair.</li>
            <li>After using the Biosilk Therapy and the flat iron, though, my hair looks 10x better.     </li>
            <li>Now that I use Biosilk Silk Therapy along with my Sedu Flat Iron, my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s one of the things I love about this serum - one bottle can last quite awhile since it doesn&#x27;t take much to achieve that silky feel and appearance, so you get a lot of bang for your buck.  </li>
            <li>Though, one has to be really be cautious when using this product, do not use too much!</li>
            <li>Also, this is the real deal, not fake</li>
            <li>I picked up this product as a way to protect my hair when I straighten it, and as I started using it regularly I noticed my hair becoming softer and softer.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not even close to being halfway done with this, although it really doesn&#x27;t take much!</li>
            <li>This product is also good for individuals that are constantly straightening their hair with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>it also doesnt weigh down your hair and it doesnt have any scent to it which is nice.  </li>
            <li>and I probably use a dab about three times throughout my hair, it tames the frizzes down to a nice wavy curl.</li>
            <li>I have pretty thin hair that tend to fly all over the place at a smallest gust of wind.</li>
            <li>After washing your hair, towel dry slightly (it&#x27;s ok if its still a bit drippy even), then bend over and flip your hair over.</li>
            <li>i will always buy this stuff and buy it in large quantities</li>
            <li>It certainly keeps the hair under control.  </li>
            <li>Normally my hair is pretty fizzy and all over the place when it&#x27;s hot and humid, but Biosilk really keeps it under control.</li>
            <li>Works great on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>It really gets rid of fizz and makes hair super soft.</li>
            <li>have short, fine hair that is prone to dryness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricier than I&#x27;d like, to be honest, but I really like it.</li>
            <li>When I am actively making sure that I use this product as well as the Fast Food for hair I always receive complements on how pretty my hair is.  </li>
            <li>Blowdry as normal (I usually do it with a large brush), and the hair comes out silky, shiny, and gorgeous.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found that it really helps do away with much of the dryness associated with having too much iron in the water.</li>
            <li>It really tames the frizz and creates curls.  </li>
            <li>This product is very versatile.</li>
            <li>The product arrived very soon after I ordered it</li>
            <li>The price is really reasonable for the wonders it provides.</li>
            <li>It is really oily after all.</li>
            <li>this is the real stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And really-</li>
            <li>but I prefer to wear it straight.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle too</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle too</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>This item shipped so fast.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very cautious of what I put in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Using too much tends to leave the hair a bit oily.  </li>
            <li>If you use too much it will make your hair greasy..</li>
            <li>It is not the real thing.</li>
            <li>This product arrived superfast, was packaged very neatly, and works really well.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting it to help my hair this much, this</li>
            <li>I have had this product before, and I do like what the real stuff can do.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>The serum is of very diluted consistency.</li>
            <li>Determining how much to use is according to hair length/type/condition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very runny as if it&#x27;s been diluted with baby oil which is probably why it&#x27;s so inexpensive.</li>
            <li>This Biosilk is the real product.  </li>
            <li>This is not the real thing.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell.  </li>
            <li>Use too much &amp; you&#x27;ll end up with greasy-looking hair.  </li>
            <li>also think this product would be really helpful for detangling the unruly hair of a child as it seems to just release even the nastiest snarls.</li>
            <li>With this silk therapy, we are done in 5-10 minutes, and it is much easier.  </li>
            <li>I makes my hair very silky.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really care, but it may help someone else.  </li>
            <li>Wrap your hair or do something where you don&#x27;t have to put the product on too much.  </li>
            <li>I love how it tames my curls without making it greasy or wet looking.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the Skinny Serum for  my hair type and way</li>
            <li>She loves the smell and always wants me to use it on her.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair so much easier to comb out after washing.</li>
            <li>Probably why it was so much cheaper than at a salon.  </li>
            <li>The liquid will be very runny, as the alcohol will start pouring out first-Biosilk does not do this.</li>
            <li>Ordered Biotin from salonwholesale and it was real Biotin, sealed and everything.</li>
            <li>Ready for this?</li>
            <li>If you get too much of it in one area then your hair will have a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look to it.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really say it smells like alcohol</li>
            <li>but nothing really to write home about.</li>
            <li>In any case it is not what the REAL BIOSILK is at all.</li>
            <li>I mix this product with A/G Fast food for hair and put it in my hair after I shower every morning.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair really straight after using a straightener too.</li>
            <li>but she is very Sadisfade</li>
            <li>and you really do have to shake it which I have never had to do before with the salon biosilk.</li>
            <li>Very satisfy</li>
            <li>Tonight, my daughter, who has much silkier hair than mine, blow dryed her hair and came downstairs.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so much easier to straighten</li>
            <li>and hope you do yourself a favor and get it from a real supplier of Biosilk.</li>
            <li>The serum was better than I expected.</li>
            <li>my hair gets really frizzy in the summer.</li>
            <li>The thing you should watch out for is using too much of it at once will make your hair greasy (or that&#x27;s what I experience).  </li>
            <li>I really want to keep it</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loves this.  </li>
            <li>this serum has too much fragrance in it</li>
            <li>I really like e shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>A huge mess, but what really bothered me was when I was clean off all of my make-up that I could salvage</li>
            <li>I bought this item, but didn&#x27;t use it right away, because i need to use up my old bottle which was purchased from Costco.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t wear the hair down and your hair is silky smooth, came quickly.</li>
            <li>It prevents split ends, dentangles my fine hair without leaving it greasy or weighted down, and leaves it silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Biosilk Silk Therapy is one of the best; this product can be used on all different types of hair from long, short, strait, curly, frizzy, to all different ethnic backgrounds.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how this works, but I can tell you that if you put it on the most damaged hair from dye, perms, or bleach, it will look like new hair again when it is dry.</li>
            <li>The routine is easy: rinse my hair, towel dry, apply biosilk, let hair air dry overnight (wrap a loose scarf as to not get the pillow wet and be able to get a good night&#x27;s sleep).&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels- like silk-I use both the leave in conditioner which has eliminated 2 other products from my hair care lineup &amp; the Silk lotion.</li>
            <li>I immediately quit using it and am looking forward to my hair returning to normal!</li>
            <li>I use this after showering on damp hair and also after curling or flat ironing to smooth frizz and increase shine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s as strong as a perfume, and I&#x27;m not sure if it was originally like that.</li>
            <li>This helps my hair calm down after a shower, and makes it so smooth to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Brushing out the tangles after her bath at night was a nightly disaster, complete with tears, pleading to skip it, and 30 minutes of distraction while I would try to very gently comb out the tangles.  </li>
            <li>I try never to run out of it because it&#x27;s a real help on bad hair days, or on a day when, even when my hair looks good, I want more shine.</li>
            <li>My cupboards are full of beauty products that haven&#x27;t delivered, but Biosilk Therapy Serum is definitely one that I&#x27;ll turn to again and again.  </li>
            <li>Biosilk user, do not waste your time; if this your first time ordering, just know that you&#x27;re probably getting a copycat.</li>
            <li>The sticker on the top of the bottle telling you to &amp;#34;shake well&amp;#34; so that you do not notice how watered down it is.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without Biosilk!</li>
            <li>I live in the Northeast and this product works wonders when it&#x27;s really humid.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically take the time to write reviews, but this is one product that I love.  </li>
            <li>Even when I leave my hair curly, it&#x27;s noticeably less frizzy and more silky.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In sum, I&#x27;d say give it a try - you may like it better than I did, but my advice if you&#x27;re on a budget is stick with a less pricey product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not very easy to ably on my hair.</li>
            <li>This particular product was used every time I went to the salon.</li>
            <li>I will not order Biosilk from this particular vendor again.</li>
            <li>Then back in 2003 I worked as a hair product consultant/salesgirl in this giant Beauty Supply store which carried more hair brands that you ever knew existed.</li>
            <li>It still does a decent job on my hair</li>
            <li>and i dont particularly like how it smells.  </li>
            <li>I did read all the reviews on it, and every one said that you don&#x27;t have to use much and it makes your hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>More for a sleeker look and a little less if I want more texture.     </li>
            <li>I put this on before I dry my hair and sometimes smooth a little more over it</li>
            <li>It smells good, makes your hair smell good, but does not weight it down or look dirty.   </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for all hair types.</li>
            <li>highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li>Also helps to use high quality shampoo and condtioners.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until after high school that I learned how to style my hair without frying it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It eaves hair silky but not greasy and would highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>I used to use the CHI silk infusion and swore by it in college and high school.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My hair is slightly wavy and it really makes my curls more defined and soft.</li>
            <li>My comb slides through the little tangles I get, and I still love the scent of it on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that is a real challenge between relaxers.  </li>
            <li>With the Biosilk, my hair is soft, shiny, and pin straight.</li>
            <li>It really does make your hair feel soft and lightweight.</li>
            <li>I looked at their reviews after purchasing, but my experience with this product were pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>They sell the smallest size for that price on sale, but normally $14.99.</li>
            <li>It is reminiscent of some potion from the far east and gives my skin such a magical feel.  </li>
            <li>my hair looked normal</li>
            <li>It does smooth out my hair after wash when I use it on towel dried hair, and I use it before I use hot tools in my hair.</li>
            <li>I about dropped dead:)</li>
            <li>The first and last time I used it on wet hair, and blow-dried, my fire alarm set off, because the smell was somewhat strong like those from the hair salons.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product do what it promises.</li>
            <li>I have found Biosilk serum works better applied to damp hair than dry, especially if you let it sit for a couple minutes on the damp hair before blow-drying it</li>
            <li>Just a little works amazing on my hair, it really tames the frizz and my hair is not nearly as puffy.</li>
            <li>First, let me disclaim that my hair, although kinky, presses fairly easily, but I wanted to get a bone straight press which is why I was trying something a little different.  </li>
            <li>I live in the south and there is HIGH heat and HIGH humidity here as we are near the gulf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The results were so good for me that I recommended it to a friend who had fine, thin slightly wavy hair and</li>
            <li>She cannot live without it.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone that uses a silk therapy serum; this product contains no alcohol so it will not dry out your hair like most other products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years, but when I ordered on Amazon from vendor &amp;#34;Naturaly&amp;#34;, the product I received smells different and has a different/diluted consistency compared to the real product  (very runny even after shaking).</li>
            <li>I have that thick, medium textured hair that tangles easily and doesn&#x27;t know if it wants to be straight or curly.</li>
            <li>I use it on my hair right out of the shower, and sometimes I use a little more when my hair&#x27;s dry, if it is frizzy or getting fly-aways.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>Cant believe there are really \\&quot;fake\\&quot; hair products, but apparently you learn something new every day.</li>
            <li>My two year old daughter has total curly ringlets, and I use this after her bath, and I can immediately comb right through them (time and sanity saver).</li>
            <li>It is a little bit more liquid-ish than the old product, but it works as well as the old ones I used before.</li>
            <li>The fluid was VERY WATERY!</li>
            <li>Was so excited to use it to do a blow out and press on my kinky coiled african american hair.  </li>
            <li>For some reason I decided to shake the bottle up to see if maybe I would get a different consistency and sure enough after I did, the fluid became a serum.  </li>
            <li>I put the remaining amount from my hands on my arms and it makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and healthier looking!</li>
            <li>Now, after all this, it still works, maybe not the exact same way, but it works.  </li>
            <li>The other formula has more alcohol and different amounts of some of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>i just use a little bit and it&#x27;s already too strong.</li>
            <li>It works like magic and I highly recommend it to people who have thick hair like myself.</li>
            <li>It works great on wet or dry hair to help hold down frizzies.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my wife and my two daughters that have long delicate and silky hair, immediately after my wife applied this to my daughters hair you could see a bright shine to it</li>
            <li>I have used it and have blown dry my hair straight to not using the blow dryer and just applying it while my hair was still damp and allowing it to dry naturally and both times my hair turned out fine.</li>
            <li>The last bottle I bought was huge (like 12 inches high and wide) from Marshall&#x27;s for $19.99.  </li>
            <li>now I rated Amazon very high, but with this episode I am feeling so cheated that now I will think twice before ordering anything; and any new subscription is a definitely no.</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid area and if I walk outside...</li>
            <li>and i still have more than half the bottle left !  </li>
            <li>and it gives a nice shine, but I don&#x27;t find it does that any better than less expensive silicone</li>
            <li>All silicon products seal the hair cuticle so anything you apply afterwards will be much less effective, including mousse, hair spray and other styling products.d nowhere near your scalp!</li>
            <li>Just the very best oil therapy on the market, little bit expensive</li>
            <li>Just a little dab of it makes my hair incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My sisters and I have very thick hair, mine is frizzier and my sisters is more straight</li>
            <li>I would use it maybe every other day, and make sure to use a shampoo that restores moisture, as alchol will dry it out.</li>
            <li>All silicon products seal the hair cuticle so anything you apply afterwards will be much less effective, including mousse, hair spray and other styling products.</li>
            <li>smell like old cosmetic.   </li>
            <li>it smelled like old mans cologne</li>
            <li>I use this product everyday to smooth out my hair before styling.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair so soft and untangled.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I can really tell the difference, especially when i dye my hair.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that the fluid smelled like straight rubbing alcohol, but I still continued to apply it to the sections of my hair before blow-drying them.  </li>
            <li>I got this one directly from amazon.</li>
            <li>There is no place on earth that offers this price for this sized bottle, unless you happen to find it in TJ Max.</li>
            <li>Since my hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely diluted and reeks of alcohol.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money getting this product here.</li>
            <li>leaves hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>This biosilk makes your haie so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I am African-American, but my hair, because its been relaxed for years, is sort of a cross between curly and straight, with kinky curls at the root.</li>
            <li>The product does not have the same consistency as the real Biosilk.</li>
            <li>It holds my curls, isn&#x27;t greasy, and makes my hair feel extremely soft.</li>
            <li>if you dump this directly onto your hair, you&#x27;ll have a greasy spot.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair manageable &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>Even though this doesn&#x27;t have oil in it, putting too much on it gives it the same over lubed</li>
            <li>My curls are soft and shine, shine, shine.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft and al ittle shiney .</li>
            <li>I noticed if I use it on a completely damp hair it makes my hair look as if I didn&#x27;t wash it at all....</li>
            <li>Dries soft, not sticky.</li>
            <li>My hair gets really soft and manageable, and not oily.</li>
            <li>The product I received seems old..</li>
            <li>I got this in a bundle package talk about wow</li>
            <li>and wow it added shine and</li>
            <li>It gives softness yet helps retain curls/moisture, also gives volume and shine,  WOW</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft now because I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
            <li>I completely agree with the reviewers that gave it one star.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I poured it onto my hands.</li>
            <li>I understand that others may be not as sensitive as I am about smells, example:</li>
            <li>It makes my hair really soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Wow, the tangles my hair would develop...</li>
            <li>I am natural with 3c/4a hair.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>It was like slik, not heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an all natural product then this isn&#x27;t for you because it has silicone in it.  </li>
            <li>No matter what professional, salon-grade conditioner I buy, I still have tangles.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive, but totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>it was watery and not as thick as it is suppose to be, so you have to be careful where you buy it from, Costco is another good place to get it from when they have it in stock.</li>
            <li>I have loved using this product for years, but it is always so EXPENSIVE, so when I found it here</li>
            <li>/&gt;While Biosilk won&#x27;t tame completely some frizz cases, it makes my hair feel soft and light, not sticky or saturated to the touch.</li>
            <li>last year, like 3 times i had to go back to salons and get a perm or coloring right the day after i got them which made my hair so so so damaged.</li>
            <li>Over the decade that I have been using this, I have occasionally tried other similar silicone-based serums, from Biolage to Chi to Paul Mitchell to KMS to RUSS and many others I can&#x27;t even remember now.</li>
            <li>It also appears to dramatically lessen the damage and protect from heat styling because considering how much I use my flat iron, you&#x27;d never know it when looking at or feeling my hair</li>
            <li>I have silky smooth thick and high volume hair.</li>
            <li>After shaking the product, the consistency and smell was exactly the same as the open bottle she had been using her salon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have VERY think long hair (with a perm and natural curl) and still use a dime size amount.  </li>
            <li>I went to a local department store and found a much smaller bottle with a much higher price tag.</li>
            <li>This is a great product but it was a little thinner and watered down then bottles I have purchased from other retailers.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of split ends due to coloring and heat styling and this seems to seal them right up....</li>
            <li>My 8 yr old daughter has long, thick hair that tangles very easily.  </li>
            <li>It has hydrolyzed silk in it and that is what makes it slick and smooth, not grease.</li>
            <li>I hope this really makes my hair stronger and longer I will use it as long as I can</li>
            <li>This is the next size up and normally sells at Target for $25.99 when it is not on sale.</li>
            <li>I normally use the Paul Mitchell Skinny Serum, but decided to try something different.  </li>
            <li>I first hesitated to order this product, because some people wrote this was not real deal;  I ordered the product and received it on time,  </li>
            <li>Normally I pull my hair back.</li>
            <li>I got the 2.2oz one, which is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>it gives you the healthy look without a the weigh down like other products.</li>
            <li>I also apply a little Redken finishing creme which adds another layer of mild control</li>
            <li>Today it was pretty hot, but my hair did not frizz, so that&#x27;s another reason to at least try this product.</li>
            <li>She had been using it very sparingly so it would last as the only places she had found it charged a hefty price for it.  </li>
            <li>I never recommend this product in amazon and don&#x27;t waste your money, it&#x27;s not at all worthy.</li>
            <li>A drop of this (I use it year round) while wet before styling makes my hair do so much better.  </li>
            <li>I use a little on my ends right out of the shower, then a few drops more after my hair is dry.</li>
            <li>I have fine brittle hair that is hard to comb out after I wash it.</li>
            <li>It came with a piece of tape across the top, no expiration date (which the past few bottles I have purchased at a salon did have) and is much thinner than this product is supposed to be.  </li>
            <li>Do not put product on upper portions of your hair and nowhere near your scalp!</li>
            <li>I noticed no difference, positive or negative, after putting it on consistently.    </li>
            <li>And it also keeps my hair nice and soft, rather than dry and unhealthy looking.</li>
            <li>The cap is defect too, as there is always a large amount (some from side of the cap) get on my hand no matter how careful I am.</li>
            <li>a few days to shake it up first!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not a question of being disappointed; rather, I am more concerned about running out of this fine product that I&#x27;ve used on my face and arms for years.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to scents but this one leaves a subtle, clean, inviting and a \\&quot;I want to get close to you\\&quot; scent in your hair.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s applied to the hair, you can turn any bad hair day into a great one.  </li>
            <li>I also use it on my stepdaughter, who has fine dirty blonde hair, and it tames her flyaways and leave it soft, shiny and super manageable.</li>
            <li>The only thing is you cant buy it from just anywhere, for example, I bought it at Ulta or a professional salon</li>
            <li>And since my hair is naturally curly, frizz is almost inevitable when it&#x27;s humid.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s possible that even people with sensitive skin will have no problem using it.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s possible that even people with sensitive skin will have no problem using it.  </li>
            <li>Using only a dime-sized amount should not really affect it too much, it may in the long run, but using a moisture restoring shampoo, and not using heat tools too much may help.</li>
            <li>Expected product was received on a timely basis and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist taught me how to iron my naturally curly hair several weeks ago.</li>
            <li>It seem similar (smell/thickness/feel) to the old bottle she had.  </li>
            <li>, I would definitely recommend this product to everyone out there who has natural hair.  </li>
            <li>, only drawback for me is that if used a bit too much, it can make your hair a tad bit greasy, I did not find that with the &amp;#34; 21 miracle leave in conditioner.&amp;#34; I could go atleast 3-4 days without washing my hair with the leave in conditioner, but with this, I can pull max of 2 days only without it starting to become oily.</li>
            <li>I now have short, naturally wavy hair, and I use about a dime-sized drop.  </li>
            <li>It has now lasted me two years and it barely has a dent in it.  </li>
            <li>I have long, thick, coarse hair and this serum helps smooth the ends out really well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good in a pinch though if you&#x27;re having a crazy unruly hair day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely watered down and has way too much alcohol.</li>
            <li>Someone said to me that they&#x27;d never seen my hair down and that I had pretty hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth every single penny, and a bottle will last forever, because you use it in such tiny amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tames my curls without being too sticky, greasy or heavy - just right.  </li>
            <li>It also has a very faint pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I have long, very naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>It is very pricey at other locations.</li>
            <li>It leaves it shiny, soft and helps the flat iron do its thing.</li>
            <li>Better to buy from a real store &amp; know you&#x27;re getting the real deal. :(</li>
            <li>The first time, I was aware after using it, that is was just a little less thick than the original Biosilk I have purchased in the stores.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is just the right texture so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down flat</li>
            <li>had a shampoo-sized bottle (not sure of the exact ounces) and it lasted nearly two years.</li>
            <li>Leave-In Treatment (which is much lighter, minimal fragrance, and actually conditions).</li>
            <li>Be careful though because it will look gross oily fast.</li>
            <li>It did seem a little pricey to me at first...</li>
            <li>My flat ironed looks usually last me 2-3 days, depending on the heat, humidity, outside (I live in the south).</li>
            <li>I did shake the bottle before using but it was not enough apparently.</li>
            <li>It does leave my hair soft but not incredibly soft as described by reviews.</li>
            <li>I have still found the thick, original formula in the smaller versions.</li>
            <li>I live in Nevada and it is so dry here that you have to use something in your hair daily to counter the desert.  </li>
            <li>Too much on the roots will weigh your hair down.     </li>
            <li>AND I live in the hot humid weather of Georgia, it is difficult to find a product that will maintain smoothness and banish frizz when I want to wear it straight.  </li>
            <li>She said it was a little watery than usual but ok.  </li>
            <li>It does not flake and does not leave my hair super hard.</li>
            <li>My hair is really thick, and when my stylist thins it out with those magical thinning shears, it also leaves lots of different layers that have a mind of their own on bad hair days.</li>
            <li>Do not use more than 2 quarters even if you have very thick long hair, trust me.</li>
            <li>There is certainly no way that could have been fake, and yet my product is just as many others describe - mainly SUPER runny (goes all over the place unless I&#x27;m very careful).</li>
            <li>For one thing they probably sell it for less (no S&amp;H), and for another, if you don&#x27;t like it then its much easier to return.</li>
            <li>Once you get past the sticker shock at some places, you soon realize it is worth it because it last me forever.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While the bottle says you can use on dry hair I have had little success with that -- it does not spread well</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the bottle says you can use on dry hair I have had little success with that -- it does not spread well</li>
            <li>You just have to be careful how much you put on and let it dry or just follow the instructions.  </li>
            <li>but if you have thin, fine hair ask your hair stylist to try some on your hair before you purchase a bottle.  </li>
            <li>Fairly certain that the product I purchased is fake due to the strong alcohol smell.</li>
            <li>Just use a little because it can make your hair look oily if you use too much and don&#x27;t put it close to the scalp either for the same reason.</li>
            <li>I balked at getting this at first because it was expensive, but this works so far above and beyond any of the other hair serums out there, and is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>and it really helps to protect it from heat and keep down my frizz!</li>
            <li>The result is great shine and softness, and moderate frizz taming for the little hairs at the base of my forehead or neck, the ones that will escape or refuse to stay straight and sleek like the rest.</li>
            <li>For my long, thick  and wavy hair I have used Biosilk Therapy Serum as finish conditioning in straight/sleek styling (just after drying and styling; for protecting my hair from heat, I use another product, a creamy leave-in conditioning specially for heat protection).</li>

            <li> Biosilk is THE BEST thing I have ever used on my hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially great for people who have permed their hair.</li>
            <li> And it smells awesome.</li>
            <li> It worked amazingly!!!  </li>

            <li> great price for this product!</li>
            <li> Great buy!</li>
            <li> I love BIOSILK!!!</li>
            <li> The serum truly does feel like silk on your hands and it has a very pleasant smell too.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!</li>
            <li> I have used it in a spray form as well and both are very good.  </li>
            <li> and I understand that this is ideal for keeping hair from being damaged by heat/styling (As the heat then forms the silicone instead of the hair shaft).</li>
            <li> Her looks and smells great, and the savings in tears and brushing time is priceless!</li>
            <li> Great product and perfect price !!</li>
            <li> And smells soooo good!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells sooo good!</li>
            <li> It is the best price around and it is good quality, not the \\&quot;over-priced yard sale, worn out quality\\&quot; like TJ Max and Marshalls.</li>
            <li> It works beautifully on Caucasian and African-American hair.</li>
            <li> The oil when placed on the hair after a shampoo gives the hair a beautiful shine.</li>
            <li> Great like all producta</li>
            <li> it smells great too, sort of fruity.</li>
            <li> It also smells great.</li>
            <li> I had put all of my products into one bag (no, I don&#x27;t fly often.)</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Hair seems stringy and has fly aways after use.</li>
            <li> I am happy I splurged and bought this one.</li>
            <li> Basically I think its a great product</li>
            <li> Another great ingredient is panthenol, a protein.</li>
            <li> The hair product line is great when used together.</li>
            <li> This product is great IF YOU GET THE ORIGINAL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The leave in conditioner is a great bargain-</li>
            <li> i have used Biosilk Silk Therapy Serum for over a decade and it&#x27;s great for fly away hair  .</li>
            <li> you get two great things in one bottle of Biosilk......</li>
            <li> My hair &amp; skin aren&#x27;t happy &amp; neither am I.</li>
            <li> It does a great job in taming my frizz.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;ve chemically treated your hair before.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I could find it on Amazon from one of their trustworthy merchants.</li>
            <li> Biosilk is a really great product.</li>
            <li> For shoulder-length hair, a nickle-sized amount works great.  </li>
            <li> This works great by itslef-  </li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for anyone with frizzy fly away hair.</li>
            <li> great silky product for hair</li>
            <li> (I think it&#x27;s redesigned one), but I knew it&#x27;s really great product for hair.  </li>
            <li> Have used for a year with great results, but have purchased from salon.  </li>
            <li> I think this stuff is a great product.  </li>
            <li> great buy for your mother in law...</li>
            <li> and my hair was great afterwards - and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> the price was great for the amount you get......</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another great product is [[ASIN:B008BT2P7S</li>
            <li> It is a great product to avoid frizz.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> that tells you that I&#x27;m happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;smells</li>
            <li> This product is great.</li>
            <li> Perfect on any kind of hair.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time and am evry happy with it.</li>
            <li> This was a great find</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy to have something that works.</li>
            <li> Biosilk silk thearapy serum is very popular amongst my friends / family.     </li>
            <li> The smell is very nice too, I feel like I just walked out of a beauty salon when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Great product, at the best price you&#x27;ll be able to find.  </li>
            <li> I use it about 3X a week along with my hair straightener and the results are amazing !  </li>
            <li> This has been the best price I have been able to find...</li>
            <li> I love it is the best..</li>
            <li> While still in the shower I wring my hair out the best I can, then I apply this before getting out so it will trap the most moisture.</li>
            <li> stuff is better than BEST!</li>
            <li> Thrilled!</li>
            <li> It works best when the hair is damp after washing, and it soaks into the hair much better to keep the hair follicles from drying without needing moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great product, good price</li>
            <li> I also love the awesome smell.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair nice and silky!</li>
            <li> Biosilk is probably a good product for some people, but it does not work great for my type of hair.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this stuff, and when I found it on amazon for a great price i had to  buy it.</li>
            <li> :) Great buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fully satisfied with it and the price  is excellent as well.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff, as it leaves my hair looking and feeling awesome.</li>
            <li> I used to love Biosilk and was very happy with how it made my hair feel.  </li>
            <li> Biosilk has a pleasant and a thicker constancy.</li>
            <li> but I purchased it at a beauty store, and the smell is so pleasant</li>
            <li> It Great OK!</li>
            <li> Best leave in conditioner available.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my fair share of hair serums/oils...</li>
            <li> It works well and smells great, but it&#x27;s not as effective as it used to be.</li>
            <li> it and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> I loved it, then I this happened.....</li>

            <li> Good protectant.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter if you do or not, but ionic products enhance everything good that you can do to your hair including this product.  </li>
            <li> Every once in a while it is good to use a shampoo that rids your hair of build up with this product.  </li>
            <li> As another person said in a post, this is a good reason to use a moisturizing shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that this product does a good job at control, &amp; the frizz.</li>
            <li> and I so loved the fragrance and feel of my hair that I immediately bought some.  </li>
            <li> It smells good, too.</li>
            <li> I got good price from this seller,so I bought 2 at a time.</li>
            <li> Also good for the skin as well.</li>

            <li> I bought this at a discount beauty supply company, and have been thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> Okay, bought biosilk after hearing alot of good things about it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use heat, so I use this just to keep my hair nice after a shower, which it does.</li>
            <li> Silk Therapy is such a great product and Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li> I have had so many people tell me I smelled so good, and ask what I was wearing.</li>
            <li> Then I found this product from biosilk which is as good or even better.</li>
            <li> It came out looking wonderful, and was very bouncy.</li>

            <li> Wonderful product with great results for dry or frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> But after blow-drying, it leaves my hair super shiny, smooth, and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I was impressed that Amazon gave top quality Biosilk for such a great price.</li>

            <li> This serum has a pleasant, slightly sweet</li>
            <li> wow I fall in love on this product!!!</li>
            <li> This is great for those with some frizzes and excellent for bed head where you dont want to do a full hair job in the morning--yet still look good after putting a little on and rushing out the door.    </li>
            <li> It really makes for beautiful hair.</li>

            <li> sincerely hope this review helps you!never found anything better.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t find better ones.</li>
            <li> This is the real Biosilk at a great cost.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love the way my hair looks and feels.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not goopy or gel-ly or oily like many anti-frizz products.</li>
            <li> but I was able to just wash off the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years now and love it.</li>
            <li> I have used Silk Therapy for many years, and it is an outstanding product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It still feels silky and silicony, but I&#x27;ve been purchasing from salons since this experience to make sure I get the authentic product.</li>
            <li> You have to use just a litte, and that&#x27;s what is perfect, because you will have the same bottle forever.</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.. tried lots of others..</li>
            <li> and I am sure others can to.</li>
            <li> This is not the authentic product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a great product that really is longlasting.  </li>

            <li> and we all know and love it.</li>
            <li> there, I have tried almost every serum on the market, from drug store discounts to internet sensations that are even more spendy than this.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Even on the rainiest most humid day.</li>
            <li> I love Biosilk, I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s healthy as can be.</li>

            <li> ,  More can always be added.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Interesting how it&#x27;s stated in the product info here that the packaging may vary...</li>
            <li> Anytime I purchase this product from a salon, there&#x27;s always a cover on top of the opening to the bottle that needs to be pulled off by it&#x27;s tab.</li>
            <li> Works ok for the price&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Better hair days with this product.</li>
            <li> The Biosilk is my favorite leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was trying to go without the biosilk to save money, but I caved and bought some more.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy after I use it like regular conditioners.</li>
            <li> I would never be able to comb out the knots after I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> what more could I ask for?  </li>
            <li> It can be used from the top of the head to the bottom of the feet.</li>
            <li> One more product on my growing list.</li>
            <li> I love biosilk.  </li>
            <li> I think some of the cheeper products out there are better than this.</li>
            <li> But that was ok.  </li>
            <li> and this one is even more thinner</li>
            <li> Buy it from a reputable salon.</li>
            <li> Biosilk comes with a BluePrint \\&quot;Pull Here\\&quot; on top of the silver seal, this product does not.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I just like it the skinny serum better.</li>
            <li> I bought mine in an authentic Biosilk 3-piece gift set from Target.</li>
            <li> I have purchased biosilk from the beauty supply store in town MANY times.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, this is the second time that I purchase this item</li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel softer, but I think I was expecting more out of it.</li>
            <li> Doesnt magically make your hair shiny.</li>
            <li> Also always worried the product will leak but packaging made sure that this product would not leak during shipping.  </li>
            <li> I love this product..great for skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works like magic.</li>
            <li> I totally love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> and I love how it smells.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love to use it with my hair curling strips.</li>
            <li> It says shake well on the top</li>
            <li> It was an expired product from 2011 and it was more like liquid alchol</li>
            <li> Biolage Exquisite Oil Replenishing Treatment 3.1 oz.]] which can be used in multiple ways: at night, in the shower, or during styling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also light like the paul mitchell and has a nice smell :)</li>
            <li> Love this product, lightweight, leaves hair feeling silky, soft and smooth... smells good too!!</li>
            <li> I suggested that she put the Biosilk on her hair and finish the blowdrying, and the results were phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I love this Product.  </li>
            <li> If I use more my hair looks greasy.</li>
            <li> it being more dense</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I know this product gets tons of rave reviews, and maybe this is just me, but I&#x27;m not feeling the Biosilk serum love.</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> Love Love Love it.</li>
            <li> Better price on Amazon and comes to your mailbox</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.  </li>
            <li> I read reviews about Amazon selling a deluted version of what you can get at a beauty store, but I thought that I would have a better experience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it...</li>
            <li> Have used forever, love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and is very smoothing in my hair.</li>
            <li> LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and effective.</li>
            <li> Authentic Biosilk.</li>
            <li> Make sure you buy from a reputable seller.  </li>
            <li> :) 5 STARS FROM ME</li>
            <li> Someone is diluting it &amp; it is much more watery and has a thinner consistency.  </li>
            <li> Love this, use it after every wash</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these products and this seller has the best deal and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this one the best of all, and believe me I have tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;It started out with frizz-ease in my teenage years, which was a god send and the first product that allowed me to really love and appreciate the gorgeous hair I was born with.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still the best thing too if you are using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who require more maintenance with their hair, biosilk might be better in that it is heavier and does work well, but for those who have hair like mine (fine and requiring every-day wash), paul mitchell is a much better alternative.</li>
            <li> Very clean smelling.</li>
            <li> I am now using Biosilk and it is soft &amp; Beautiful.</li>
            <li> Not the original but works just as well!</li>
            <li> not every Marshalls has it but northern NJ does have the original and cheaper!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if this product works good on the hair or not, but for sure, i dont like the smell...  </li>
            <li> More importantly, my hair is in better condition than it ever has been.</li>
            <li> Keeps the braids slicked back so nicely and smells great too.  </li>
            <li> It really adds a healthy shine and makes the color of my hair look really good.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I have fine hair and Biosilk</li>
            <li> I put it in damp hair and whether I blow it dry (which is best) or not, it keeps tangles to a minimum, but my favorite part is that my hair feels so silky and smooth without being greasy or feeling caked up with product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Biosilk, a product that most women will swear buy, as it makes their hair nice and soft, flow nicely, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> glad to find this at amazon and buy at cheaper price with free shipping.</li>
            <li> My hair remained smooth and frizz free!</li>
            <li> Combine with moisturizing shampoo and ceramic straightener to have healthy, smooth, and shiny hair.  </li>
            <li> i love this product it makes my hair silky &amp; smooth</li>
            <li> I also feel that because it&#x27;s sort of waxy it pulls off my hair more because it doesn&#x27;t go on smooth.</li>
            <li> and I honestly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth $16.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best leave-in treatment on the market and has been for many years.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re using this serum for the first time I recommend putting a tiny dab in the palm of your hand, work that into the hair and gradually add more if needed to find that perfect amount for you.  </li>
            <li> The light smell is wonderful and it does not weigh your hair down like most over products.  </li>
            <li> This order came within 2 days and was such a great surprise when I saw the huge bottle!  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and healthy looking along with a smooth frizz free all day style.    </li>
            <li> yet you can easily see the surviving trace around the rim.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried so far as it seems to be absorbed quickly by the hair and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially good if you wash your hair, and, before blow drying it, you rub it in your hands, and just smooth it all over the wet hair.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product if your looking for strength and softness.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I know some people don&#x27;t like it, or find it&#x27;s too strong, so there&#x27;s that to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have paid full price for this and have been completely satisfied, if not blown away.</li>
            <li> so you can have beautiful, silky,and shiny hair and save money at the same time....</li>
            <li> Results are okay, certainly not bad</li>
            <li> I get the best results with keeping the smell down and getting results</li>
            <li> Her hair is now silky smooth and easy to comb.  </li>
            <li> Less is definitely best is you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> Smells SOOOOOOO good and feels very soft.</li>
            <li> she said it makes hair very soft and good looking</li>
            <li> We loved the great smell, shine,and smooth texture it leaves in your hair and because it was light it didn&#x27;t leave a very heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for the truly wonderful thing about Biosilk Silk Therapy....as a very special treat, I love to smooth a very small amount on my arms and legs after a shower.  </li>
            <li> the lotion is a little pricey so shop around for the best buy.</li>
            <li> I learned a lot about hair there and got to try a huge number of products, including Biosilk Serum which I have been using since then.</li>
            <li> It made it feel so smooth and the smell...to die</li>
            <li> It dries smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to get this from Amazon and especially that I can subscribe to it</li>
            <li> Not only great for hair but for skin too.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> Silky smooth locks    </li>
            <li> This makes my hair SO smooth and non-frizzy.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so smooth.</li>
            <li> It feels fantastic no matter where you apply it.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the smell of cheap perfume or cologne, you probably won&#x27;t like this.    </li>
            <li> I have tried everything on the market that promises to smooth my hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking to have your hair smell and look fantastic</li>
            <li> Also, rub into your hands &amp; then smooth onto your hair--</li>
            <li> I never felt my hair so smooth before using this product.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years and was ecstatic to find it at such a GREAT price.  </li>
            <li> Basically, we went through every cheap drugstore brand of hair serum, frizz-ease, got2b, garnier fructis, pantene, suave, and everything else under $10.  </li>
            <li> It is important to know what hair types that products work on.  </li>
            <li> BUT biosilk is light and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> The formula is non-greasy and has a silky smooth finish.</li>
            <li> This product is light and helps against &amp;#34;the freeze&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice shine in your hair with out the greasy look if you don&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, makes hair appear shiny without seeming oily, and smells</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s smooth and bouncy</li>
            <li> (my hair has never been smooth and bouncy).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does smooth hair well</li>
            <li> I wish they would have a fragrance free serum.</li>
            <li> I thought if the produce is defect, the shipping is free.</li>
            <li> and it really make my hair better and better</li>
            <li> I have used the real Biosilk on my hair many many times.</li>
            <li> And after using this, my hair is really soft and smells really good.</li>
            <li> Hair smells good and makes them soft and shiny</li>
            <li> it have too much alcohol smell!!!    </li>
            <li> And nothing, absolutely nothing comes close to Biosilk!!!</li>
            <li> Works wonderful for those who blow dry their hair daily, I love it and also use the shampoo!</li>
            <li> Biosilk&#x27;s main ingredient, hydrolyzed silk, is an amazing substance that gives moisture and sheen to the hair shaft.</li>
            <li> It smells light and clean and leaves a silky feeling on the skin and</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel and it has calmed down the fly away dryness.  </li>
            <li> I moved to a new state and no one carries it, so being able to get it here made my day!</li>
            <li> It is highly recommended to those who seek effective heat protector, as well as hair treatment for silky hair.</li>
            <li> , i love it very much but&lt;</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really smell too pleasant straight out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> but it is so worth it !  </li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser had originally used it on my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and I feel like it really controls frizz and leaves my hair soft and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the biosilk serum for two years, and I really like it! :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert, but I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Biosilk but its pretty pricy...</li>
            <li> love this so much!</li>
            <li> I love it sooooo much!</li>
            <li> and it is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the scent.  </li>
            <li> I love this product so much!</li>
            <li> First, it has a REALLY STRONG fragrance (what I call odor) which smells like CHEAP PERFUME OR CHEAP COLOGNE.</li>
            <li> By the way, this is also a great product for dry skin -</li>
            <li> By the way, this is also a great product for dry skin -</li>
            <li> I like the weightless and clean look.</li>
            <li> Biosilk is essential for my hair extensions and make my own hair shine healthy</li>
            <li> It works best on hair that is left natural.</li>
            <li> I do not have to color my hair because this product adds so much health to it that my natural color looks great.  </li>
            <li> I can not live without this lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using BioSilk Silk Therapy for a long time now and LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Finish off with a flat iron, and your hair will look absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft, silky, shiny, and manageable--I love it!</li>
            <li> some reviewers said, but the last bottle I got (at a pharmacy) was wonderful and made my hair feel soft and LOOK soft, not to mention it smoothed my hair cuticles and smelled soooo nice.</li>
            <li> One thing that&#x27;s very important to add is that it does not take much of this serum to achieve those results.  </li>
            <li> the morning my hair is glossy, soft, frizz-free and my waves so well defined that I can dare just touch up some strays with the flat iron and leave it like that &amp;#62;&amp;#62;Oh, and the best part...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product did anything special for my hair--</li>
            <li> (If I also use a straightening wand for special occasions, it looks like \\&quot;princess hair.\\&quot;) &lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a special improvement in my hair health</li>
            <li> it did not create a good straight press, it did not seem to leave my hair particularly moisturized either.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly they dry very quickly and tend to be in form for a longer time.</li>
            <li> I bought the biggest bottle possible and it feels so good on my hair.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very watery, more like an oil.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery love this product</li>
            <li> It has completely changed how I think of my own hair.</li>
            <li> and maybe you&#x27;d love it as much as I</li>
            <li> and maybe you&#x27;d love it as much as I do.      </li>
            <li> i know it doesn&#x27;t cure split or burnt ends, but after shampooing and cool drying i use this</li>
            <li> Overall, I recommend a good conditioner instead.</li>
            <li> It is true that some of the sellers using amazon&#x27;s market place may not be on the up and up</li>
            <li> when i first bought this biosilk product two years ago it was nice and thick, now its not viscus at all, more like water that smells good</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and fast service with this seller</li>
            <li> I must say, it is true.  </li>
            <li> This product is good for taming moderate frizz, adding shine and softness to my hair.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> It really makes your hair healthy &amp; shining.    </li>
            <li> I am able to run a large barrel curling iron right over it to smooth it out.  </li>
            <li> You take about a teaspoon full, rub it in your hands and then run your hands through your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair looks full and silky.</li>
            <li> This is my go to product for a shiny straight blow out, I do wish it smelled better</li>
            <li> When I received it, it was the serum vs the true Biosilk leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was misled by the claims on the bottle...thought it would make my hair nice and shiny and soft.....</li>
            <li> I want a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have also found this product useful for controlling frizz and fly-aways - just rub a drop or two between your palms and smooth over the ends of the hair.</li>
            <li> If you get it somewhere like Target or CVS, you will be paying full retail.  </li>
            <li> But I have this hair so maybe it works best on thick hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s top notch because it gives those defined curls without the feeling of having too much product in your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair used to stick up a bit in the middle, but with this, it stays perfect and easy to manage all day long without feeling greasy or using any hardening gels or sprays.</li>
            <li> It smells very strong like cheap perfume and if you use too much, the smell is too much.</li>
            <li> subscribed for it and got the first 2 deliveries perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> and It was so much more expensive than this product, this product IS the best trust me</li>
            <li> I always used to buy in Lucky or Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item from Quick E Shop, and the product in the bottle was NOT Biosilk.  </li>
            <li> be be quick in the morning.   </li>
            <li> quick note about how I use this product.</li>
            <li> I have purchased in the salon, but it&#x27;s adequate.</li>
            <li> I have tried many similar product, Silk is still my favorite..</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum, 5.1 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> and in one use, it won me over, even though I have been a loyal user of biosilk for 6 years or so</li>
            <li> but i is not real it is fake!!!</li>
            <li> then I flat iron...and add some after for a nice shine and smooth finish.</li>
            <li> A great value, even with paying freight, about half of what it retails for in my area.</li>
            <li> This was an easy and fast transaction.</li>
            <li> So really appreciated the easy access.</li>
            <li> Shake the bottle, and I mean shake it real good, the oil and all the other good stuff in there need to mix.</li>
            <li> Using too much leaves fine hair a bit oily</li>
            <li> The smooth silky feel of my clothes gliding on is pure heaven.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that my hair look absolutely great; I spend little time on it.</li>
            <li> it was surprisingly very silky and smooth feeling.  </li>
            <li> Fast free  shipping also a plus.</li>
            <li> I also use this to finger through my hair when it&#x27;s curled to calm the fly-aways.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing when you have the actual product.</li>
            <li> Okay, first off, when i first received this i was freaked out because when i poured it out it was all alcohol and watery like, but you need to really listen to the directions (cough).</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> was worth the money and wait.</li>
            <li> Few years back I found Pantene Smooth Serum which was just an awesome product</li>
            <li> I have soft curly hair in a humid environment, and I love using this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the $.</li>
            <li> Biosilk Silk Therapy is a magic hair product that will leave your hair so soft and shining you won&#x27;t need to buy another hair product again.</li>
            <li> My hair has a natural wave, but seems to get frizzy on the top of my head.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and how soft it makes my hair</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is really powerful for me.</li>
            <li> love biosilk so soft</li>
            <li> I initially liked it but stopped using it - felt like it didn&#x27;t change my hair, only affected it when I used it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops rubbed through leaves my hair shiny, soft and delightfully scented.</li>
            <li> My skin absorbed it in seconds.</li>
            <li> the correct product is dense liquid, with decent smell, but this one is like water, with strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> But, the most recent one I received is just not the original product.</li>
            <li> Great product to tame frizzy hair and make it shinier.</li>
            <li> but just kind of made it lay flat and look greasy.</li>
            <li> It IS the right stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this product right after a shampoo,</li>
            <li> It has just the right touch of hair control for him without leaving his hair looking as if he had used any hair product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In any event, the product sold by Amazon.com LLC, was the right one-</li>
            <li> Therefore, when I smell it, I think of her right away.  </li>
            <li> The smell is right</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty strong at first, but it dissipates fast, too, so</li>
            <li> the best thick frizz help I have found though but easily weighs down fine hair strands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be sure to shake the bottle well and don&#x27;t get exuberant in applying</li>
            <li> Use this everyday and it keeps my hair nice and silky!</li>
            <li> This was a great value (I find it much more expensive at the salon or grocery stores)</li>
            <li> It is absolutely FABULOUS ( and did I mention that my hair is natural !</li>
            <li> They have the idea right, as many hair conditioners contain some of the same ingredients as body lotions, making multi-tasking easier.</li>
            <li> I recomend this product very much.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED MY PRODUCT VERY FAST...</li>
            <li> Just rub over your elbows or any other rough skin - it is an excellent skin moisturizer as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just rub over your elbows or any other rough skin - it is an excellent skin moisturizer as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for blow drying, but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not just subtly softer, if you&#x27;re paying close attention, but like the difference between those new kind of plush toys that have extra-silky fur, compared to the old-fashioned kind of stuffed-animal fur.</li>
            <li> and it was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I use this product all the time, and it sells for more than double this price in the store.  </li>
            <li> My mom had bought this years ago for the first time and from the get go my sisters</li>
            <li> The waves have better shape and the frizz is almost entirely gone.</li>
            <li> Therapy\\&quot; because that&#x27;s exactly what it makes your hair feel like.</li>
            <li> Therapy\\&quot; because that&#x27;s exactly what it makes your hair feel like.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this item for the first time and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It absolutely makes the world of a difference!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ordered it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It will do nothing but give you a pleasing smell, and the great fragrance does not last long.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky, smooth, soft, and manageable.</li>
            <li> and this is the first time I purchased from Amazon...</li>
            <li> First time I ordered this product in Amazon coz</li>
            <li> I got my first bottle of biosilk silk therapy in May</li>
            <li> I wrap my hair faithfully every night, it lasts until my next wash without my continuing to put heat on it more than that.  </li>
            <li> My husband is the one that uses it the most and only uses about two drops, rubs between his hands and then applies it to his hair.  </li>
            <li> One must try this to know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about</li>
            <li> No need to read the review, just buy the product already  ;)</li>
            <li> Totally out ranks the top name brand I had sworn by for years.  </li>
            <li> Biosilk never fails.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> had this been my first exposure.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I buy it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not fake.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute  &amp;#34;MUST HAVE&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> So I Googled it and sure enough it contains alcohol.</li>
            <li> I thought this was an original product since it was bottled exactly the same as the original.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used biosilk for so long though that I rarely use more than I need now since I&#x27;ve adjusted according to how my hair reacts...</li>
            <li> And the shipping was fast !</li>
            <li> Alcohol is the first thing that comes out when you squeeze the bottle.</li>
            <li> I first had it applied to my hair by a hairdresser in NYC</li>
            <li> The price is much better than local Target.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried it before, I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> My local beauty supply store discontinued it from their shelves (I suspect many are going over to argan oil products)</li>
            <li> MUST shake well first.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I used to be able to buy a bottle even bigger than this at Costco for about $11, then they quit selling it.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty well for smoothing but don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> , you should not use this product everyday, as it does contain a good bit of alcohol.</li>
            <li> OH yes,  the price is so reasonable and a little bit goes a long way, truly the best I have found.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is so nice &amp; pleasant &amp; can be used on not only dry hair, but dry skin, also.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for the dry Colorado days to tame staticy hair.</li>
            <li> After using the Biosilk Therapy and the flat iron, though, my hair looks 10x better.     </li>
            <li> Now that I use Biosilk Silk Therapy along with my Sedu Flat Iron, my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s one of the things I love about this serum - one bottle can last quite awhile since it doesn&#x27;t take much to achieve that silky feel and appearance, so you get a lot of bang for your buck.  </li>
            <li> Though, one has to be really be cautious when using this product, do not use too much!</li>
            <li> Also, this is the real deal, not fake</li>
            <li> I picked up this product as a way to protect my hair when I straighten it, and as I started using it regularly I noticed my hair becoming softer and softer.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not even close to being halfway done with this, although it really doesn&#x27;t take much!</li>
            <li> This product is also good for individuals that are constantly straightening their hair with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> it also doesnt weigh down your hair and it doesnt have any scent to it which is nice.  </li>
            <li> and I probably use a dab about three times throughout my hair, it tames the frizzes down to a nice wavy curl.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thin hair that tend to fly all over the place at a smallest gust of wind.</li>
            <li> After washing your hair, towel dry slightly (it&#x27;s ok if its still a bit drippy even), then bend over and flip your hair over.</li>
            <li> i will always buy this stuff and buy it in large quantities</li>
            <li> It certainly keeps the hair under control.  </li>
            <li> Normally my hair is pretty fizzy and all over the place when it&#x27;s hot and humid, but Biosilk really keeps it under control.</li>
            <li> Works great on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> It really gets rid of fizz and makes hair super soft.</li>
            <li> have short, fine hair that is prone to dryness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricier than I&#x27;d like, to be honest, but I really like it.</li>
            <li> When I am actively making sure that I use this product as well as the Fast Food for hair I always receive complements on how pretty my hair is.  </li>
            <li> Blowdry as normal (I usually do it with a large brush), and the hair comes out silky, shiny, and gorgeous.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found that it really helps do away with much of the dryness associated with having too much iron in the water.</li>
            <li> It really tames the frizz and creates curls.  </li>
            <li> This product is very versatile.</li>
            <li> The product arrived very soon after I ordered it</li>
            <li> The price is really reasonable for the wonders it provides.</li>
            <li> It is really oily after all.</li>
            <li> this is the real stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And really-</li>
            <li> but I prefer to wear it straight.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gentle too</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gentle too</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> This item shipped so fast.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very cautious of what I put in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Using too much tends to leave the hair a bit oily.  </li>
            <li> If you use too much it will make your hair greasy..</li>
            <li> It is not the real thing.</li>
            <li> This product arrived superfast, was packaged very neatly, and works really well.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting it to help my hair this much, this</li>
            <li> I have had this product before, and I do like what the real stuff can do.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> The serum is of very diluted consistency.</li>
            <li> Determining how much to use is according to hair length/type/condition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very runny as if it&#x27;s been diluted with baby oil which is probably why it&#x27;s so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This Biosilk is the real product.  </li>
            <li> This is not the real thing.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell.  </li>
            <li> Use too much &amp; you&#x27;ll end up with greasy-looking hair.  </li>
            <li> also think this product would be really helpful for detangling the unruly hair of a child as it seems to just release even the nastiest snarls.</li>
            <li> With this silk therapy, we are done in 5-10 minutes, and it is much easier.  </li>
            <li> I makes my hair very silky.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really care, but it may help someone else.  </li>
            <li> Wrap your hair or do something where you don&#x27;t have to put the product on too much.  </li>
            <li> I love how it tames my curls without making it greasy or wet looking.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the Skinny Serum for  my hair type and way</li>
            <li> She loves the smell and always wants me to use it on her.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair so much easier to comb out after washing.</li>
            <li> Probably why it was so much cheaper than at a salon.  </li>
            <li> The liquid will be very runny, as the alcohol will start pouring out first-Biosilk does not do this.</li>
            <li> Ordered Biotin from salonwholesale and it was real Biotin, sealed and everything.</li>
            <li> Ready for this?</li>
            <li> If you get too much of it in one area then your hair will have a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look to it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really say it smells like alcohol</li>
            <li> but nothing really to write home about.</li>
            <li> In any case it is not what the REAL BIOSILK is at all.</li>
            <li> I mix this product with A/G Fast food for hair and put it in my hair after I shower every morning.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair really straight after using a straightener too.</li>
            <li> but she is very Sadisfade</li>
            <li> and you really do have to shake it which I have never had to do before with the salon biosilk.</li>
            <li> Very satisfy</li>
            <li> Tonight, my daughter, who has much silkier hair than mine, blow dryed her hair and came downstairs.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so much easier to straighten</li>
            <li> and hope you do yourself a favor and get it from a real supplier of Biosilk.</li>
            <li> The serum was better than I expected.</li>
            <li> my hair gets really frizzy in the summer.</li>
            <li> The thing you should watch out for is using too much of it at once will make your hair greasy (or that&#x27;s what I experience).  </li>
            <li> I really want to keep it</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this.  </li>
            <li> this serum has too much fragrance in it</li>
            <li> I really like e shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> A huge mess, but what really bothered me was when I was clean off all of my make-up that I could salvage</li>
            <li> I bought this item, but didn&#x27;t use it right away, because i need to use up my old bottle which was purchased from Costco.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t wear the hair down and your hair is silky smooth, came quickly.</li>
            <li> It prevents split ends, dentangles my fine hair without leaving it greasy or weighted down, and leaves it silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Biosilk Silk Therapy is one of the best; this product can be used on all different types of hair from long, short, strait, curly, frizzy, to all different ethnic backgrounds.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how this works, but I can tell you that if you put it on the most damaged hair from dye, perms, or bleach, it will look like new hair again when it is dry.</li>
            <li> The routine is easy: rinse my hair, towel dry, apply biosilk, let hair air dry overnight (wrap a loose scarf as to not get the pillow wet and be able to get a good night&#x27;s sleep).&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels- like silk-I use both the leave in conditioner which has eliminated 2 other products from my hair care lineup &amp; the Silk lotion.</li>
            <li> I immediately quit using it and am looking forward to my hair returning to normal!</li>
            <li> I use this after showering on damp hair and also after curling or flat ironing to smooth frizz and increase shine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s as strong as a perfume, and I&#x27;m not sure if it was originally like that.</li>
            <li> This helps my hair calm down after a shower, and makes it so smooth to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Brushing out the tangles after her bath at night was a nightly disaster, complete with tears, pleading to skip it, and 30 minutes of distraction while I would try to very gently comb out the tangles.  </li>
            <li> I try never to run out of it because it&#x27;s a real help on bad hair days, or on a day when, even when my hair looks good, I want more shine.</li>
            <li> My cupboards are full of beauty products that haven&#x27;t delivered, but Biosilk Therapy Serum is definitely one that I&#x27;ll turn to again and again.  </li>
            <li> Biosilk user, do not waste your time; if this your first time ordering, just know that you&#x27;re probably getting a copycat.</li>
            <li> The sticker on the top of the bottle telling you to &amp;#34;shake well&amp;#34; so that you do not notice how watered down it is.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without Biosilk!</li>
            <li> I live in the Northeast and this product works wonders when it&#x27;s really humid.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically take the time to write reviews, but this is one product that I love.  </li>
            <li> Even when I leave my hair curly, it&#x27;s noticeably less frizzy and more silky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In sum, I&#x27;d say give it a try - you may like it better than I did, but my advice if you&#x27;re on a budget is stick with a less pricey product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not very easy to ably on my hair.</li>
            <li> This particular product was used every time I went to the salon.</li>
            <li> I will not order Biosilk from this particular vendor again.</li>
            <li> Then back in 2003 I worked as a hair product consultant/salesgirl in this giant Beauty Supply store which carried more hair brands that you ever knew existed.</li>
            <li> It still does a decent job on my hair</li>
            <li> and i dont particularly like how it smells.  </li>
            <li> I did read all the reviews on it, and every one said that you don&#x27;t have to use much and it makes your hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> More for a sleeker look and a little less if I want more texture.     </li>
            <li> I put this on before I dry my hair and sometimes smooth a little more over it</li>
            <li> It smells good, makes your hair smell good, but does not weight it down or look dirty.   </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for all hair types.</li>
            <li> highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> Also helps to use high quality shampoo and condtioners.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until after high school that I learned how to style my hair without frying it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It eaves hair silky but not greasy and would highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I used to use the CHI silk infusion and swore by it in college and high school.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hair is slightly wavy and it really makes my curls more defined and soft.</li>
            <li> My comb slides through the little tangles I get, and I still love the scent of it on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is a real challenge between relaxers.  </li>
            <li> With the Biosilk, my hair is soft, shiny, and pin straight.</li>
            <li> It really does make your hair feel soft and lightweight.</li>
            <li> I looked at their reviews after purchasing, but my experience with this product were pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> They sell the smallest size for that price on sale, but normally $14.99.</li>
            <li> It is reminiscent of some potion from the far east and gives my skin such a magical feel.  </li>
            <li> my hair looked normal</li>
            <li> It does smooth out my hair after wash when I use it on towel dried hair, and I use it before I use hot tools in my hair.</li>
            <li> I about dropped dead:)</li>
            <li> The first and last time I used it on wet hair, and blow-dried, my fire alarm set off, because the smell was somewhat strong like those from the hair salons.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product do what it promises.</li>
            <li> I have found Biosilk serum works better applied to damp hair than dry, especially if you let it sit for a couple minutes on the damp hair before blow-drying it</li>
            <li> Just a little works amazing on my hair, it really tames the frizz and my hair is not nearly as puffy.</li>
            <li> First, let me disclaim that my hair, although kinky, presses fairly easily, but I wanted to get a bone straight press which is why I was trying something a little different.  </li>
            <li> I live in the south and there is HIGH heat and HIGH humidity here as we are near the gulf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The results were so good for me that I recommended it to a friend who had fine, thin slightly wavy hair and</li>
            <li> She cannot live without it.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone that uses a silk therapy serum; this product contains no alcohol so it will not dry out your hair like most other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, but when I ordered on Amazon from vendor &amp;#34;Naturaly&amp;#34;, the product I received smells different and has a different/diluted consistency compared to the real product  (very runny even after shaking).</li>
            <li> I have that thick, medium textured hair that tangles easily and doesn&#x27;t know if it wants to be straight or curly.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair right out of the shower, and sometimes I use a little more when my hair&#x27;s dry, if it is frizzy or getting fly-aways.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Cant believe there are really \\&quot;fake\\&quot; hair products, but apparently you learn something new every day.</li>
            <li> My two year old daughter has total curly ringlets, and I use this after her bath, and I can immediately comb right through them (time and sanity saver).</li>
            <li> It is a little bit more liquid-ish than the old product, but it works as well as the old ones I used before.</li>
            <li> The fluid was VERY WATERY!</li>
            <li> Was so excited to use it to do a blow out and press on my kinky coiled african american hair.  </li>
            <li> For some reason I decided to shake the bottle up to see if maybe I would get a different consistency and sure enough after I did, the fluid became a serum.  </li>
            <li> I put the remaining amount from my hands on my arms and it makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and healthier looking!</li>
            <li> Now, after all this, it still works, maybe not the exact same way, but it works.  </li>
            <li> The other formula has more alcohol and different amounts of some of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> i just use a little bit and it&#x27;s already too strong.</li>
            <li> It works like magic and I highly recommend it to people who have thick hair like myself.</li>
            <li> It works great on wet or dry hair to help hold down frizzies.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife and my two daughters that have long delicate and silky hair, immediately after my wife applied this to my daughters hair you could see a bright shine to it</li>
            <li> I have used it and have blown dry my hair straight to not using the blow dryer and just applying it while my hair was still damp and allowing it to dry naturally and both times my hair turned out fine.</li>
            <li> The last bottle I bought was huge (like 12 inches high and wide) from Marshall&#x27;s for $19.99.  </li>
            <li> now I rated Amazon very high, but with this episode I am feeling so cheated that now I will think twice before ordering anything; and any new subscription is a definitely no.</li>
            <li> I live in a very humid area and if I walk outside...</li>
            <li> and i still have more than half the bottle left !  </li>
            <li> and it gives a nice shine, but I don&#x27;t find it does that any better than less expensive silicone</li>
            <li> All silicon products seal the hair cuticle so anything you apply afterwards will be much less effective, including mousse, hair spray and other styling products.d nowhere near your scalp!</li>
            <li> Just the very best oil therapy on the market, little bit expensive</li>
            <li> Just a little dab of it makes my hair incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My sisters and I have very thick hair, mine is frizzier and my sisters is more straight</li>
            <li> I would use it maybe every other day, and make sure to use a shampoo that restores moisture, as alchol will dry it out.</li>
            <li> All silicon products seal the hair cuticle so anything you apply afterwards will be much less effective, including mousse, hair spray and other styling products.</li>
            <li> smell like old cosmetic.   </li>
            <li> it smelled like old mans cologne</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday to smooth out my hair before styling.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair so soft and untangled.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I can really tell the difference, especially when i dye my hair.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that the fluid smelled like straight rubbing alcohol, but I still continued to apply it to the sections of my hair before blow-drying them.  </li>
            <li> I got this one directly from amazon.</li>
            <li> There is no place on earth that offers this price for this sized bottle, unless you happen to find it in TJ Max.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely diluted and reeks of alcohol.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money getting this product here.</li>
            <li> leaves hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> This biosilk makes your haie so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I am African-American, but my hair, because its been relaxed for years, is sort of a cross between curly and straight, with kinky curls at the root.</li>
            <li> The product does not have the same consistency as the real Biosilk.</li>
            <li> It holds my curls, isn&#x27;t greasy, and makes my hair feel extremely soft.</li>
            <li> if you dump this directly onto your hair, you&#x27;ll have a greasy spot.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair manageable &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> Even though this doesn&#x27;t have oil in it, putting too much on it gives it the same over lubed</li>
            <li> My curls are soft and shine, shine, shine.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft and al ittle shiney .</li>
            <li> I noticed if I use it on a completely damp hair it makes my hair look as if I didn&#x27;t wash it at all....</li>
            <li> Dries soft, not sticky.</li>
            <li> My hair gets really soft and manageable, and not oily.</li>
            <li> The product I received seems old..</li>
            <li> I got this in a bundle package talk about wow</li>
            <li> and wow it added shine and</li>
            <li> It gives softness yet helps retain curls/moisture, also gives volume and shine,  WOW</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft now because I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
            <li> I completely agree with the reviewers that gave it one star.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I poured it onto my hands.</li>
            <li> I understand that others may be not as sensitive as I am about smells, example:</li>
            <li> It makes my hair really soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Wow, the tangles my hair would develop...</li>
            <li> I am natural with 3c/4a hair.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> It was like slik, not heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an all natural product then this isn&#x27;t for you because it has silicone in it.  </li>
            <li> No matter what professional, salon-grade conditioner I buy, I still have tangles.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive, but totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> it was watery and not as thick as it is suppose to be, so you have to be careful where you buy it from, Costco is another good place to get it from when they have it in stock.</li>
            <li> I have loved using this product for years, but it is always so EXPENSIVE, so when I found it here</li>
            <li> /&gt;While Biosilk won&#x27;t tame completely some frizz cases, it makes my hair feel soft and light, not sticky or saturated to the touch.</li>
            <li> last year, like 3 times i had to go back to salons and get a perm or coloring right the day after i got them which made my hair so so so damaged.</li>
            <li> Over the decade that I have been using this, I have occasionally tried other similar silicone-based serums, from Biolage to Chi to Paul Mitchell to KMS to RUSS and many others I can&#x27;t even remember now.</li>
            <li> It also appears to dramatically lessen the damage and protect from heat styling because considering how much I use my flat iron, you&#x27;d never know it when looking at or feeling my hair</li>
            <li> I have silky smooth thick and high volume hair.</li>
            <li> After shaking the product, the consistency and smell was exactly the same as the open bottle she had been using her salon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have VERY think long hair (with a perm and natural curl) and still use a dime size amount.  </li>
            <li> I went to a local department store and found a much smaller bottle with a much higher price tag.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but it was a little thinner and watered down then bottles I have purchased from other retailers.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of split ends due to coloring and heat styling and this seems to seal them right up....</li>
            <li> My 8 yr old daughter has long, thick hair that tangles very easily.  </li>
            <li> It has hydrolyzed silk in it and that is what makes it slick and smooth, not grease.</li>
            <li> I hope this really makes my hair stronger and longer I will use it as long as I can</li>
            <li> This is the next size up and normally sells at Target for $25.99 when it is not on sale.</li>
            <li> I normally use the Paul Mitchell Skinny Serum, but decided to try something different.  </li>
            <li> I first hesitated to order this product, because some people wrote this was not real deal;  I ordered the product and received it on time,  </li>
            <li> Normally I pull my hair back.</li>
            <li> I got the 2.2oz one, which is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> it gives you the healthy look without a the weigh down like other products.</li>
            <li> I also apply a little Redken finishing creme which adds another layer of mild control</li>
            <li> Today it was pretty hot, but my hair did not frizz, so that&#x27;s another reason to at least try this product.</li>
            <li> She had been using it very sparingly so it would last as the only places she had found it charged a hefty price for it.  </li>
            <li> I never recommend this product in amazon and don&#x27;t waste your money, it&#x27;s not at all worthy.</li>
            <li> A drop of this (I use it year round) while wet before styling makes my hair do so much better.  </li>
            <li> I use a little on my ends right out of the shower, then a few drops more after my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I have fine brittle hair that is hard to comb out after I wash it.</li>
            <li> It came with a piece of tape across the top, no expiration date (which the past few bottles I have purchased at a salon did have) and is much thinner than this product is supposed to be.  </li>
            <li> Do not put product on upper portions of your hair and nowhere near your scalp!</li>
            <li> I noticed no difference, positive or negative, after putting it on consistently.    </li>
            <li> And it also keeps my hair nice and soft, rather than dry and unhealthy looking.</li>
            <li> The cap is defect too, as there is always a large amount (some from side of the cap) get on my hand no matter how careful I am.</li>
            <li> a few days to shake it up first!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not a question of being disappointed; rather, I am more concerned about running out of this fine product that I&#x27;ve used on my face and arms for years.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to scents but this one leaves a subtle, clean, inviting and a \\&quot;I want to get close to you\\&quot; scent in your hair.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s applied to the hair, you can turn any bad hair day into a great one.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my stepdaughter, who has fine dirty blonde hair, and it tames her flyaways and leave it soft, shiny and super manageable.</li>
            <li> The only thing is you cant buy it from just anywhere, for example, I bought it at Ulta or a professional salon</li>
            <li> And since my hair is naturally curly, frizz is almost inevitable when it&#x27;s humid.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s possible that even people with sensitive skin will have no problem using it.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s possible that even people with sensitive skin will have no problem using it.  </li>
            <li> Using only a dime-sized amount should not really affect it too much, it may in the long run, but using a moisture restoring shampoo, and not using heat tools too much may help.</li>
            <li> Expected product was received on a timely basis and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist taught me how to iron my naturally curly hair several weeks ago.</li>
            <li> It seem similar (smell/thickness/feel) to the old bottle she had.  </li>
            <li> , I would definitely recommend this product to everyone out there who has natural hair.  </li>
            <li> , only drawback for me is that if used a bit too much, it can make your hair a tad bit greasy, I did not find that with the &amp;#34; 21 miracle leave in conditioner.&amp;#34; I could go atleast 3-4 days without washing my hair with the leave in conditioner, but with this, I can pull max of 2 days only without it starting to become oily.</li>
            <li> I now have short, naturally wavy hair, and I use about a dime-sized drop.  </li>
            <li> It has now lasted me two years and it barely has a dent in it.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, coarse hair and this serum helps smooth the ends out really well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good in a pinch though if you&#x27;re having a crazy unruly hair day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely watered down and has way too much alcohol.</li>
            <li> Someone said to me that they&#x27;d never seen my hair down and that I had pretty hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth every single penny, and a bottle will last forever, because you use it in such tiny amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tames my curls without being too sticky, greasy or heavy - just right.  </li>
            <li> It also has a very faint pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I have long, very naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> It is very pricey at other locations.</li>
            <li> It leaves it shiny, soft and helps the flat iron do its thing.</li>
            <li> Better to buy from a real store &amp; know you&#x27;re getting the real deal. :(</li>
            <li> The first time, I was aware after using it, that is was just a little less thick than the original Biosilk I have purchased in the stores.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is just the right texture so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down flat</li>
            <li> had a shampoo-sized bottle (not sure of the exact ounces) and it lasted nearly two years.</li>
            <li> Leave-In Treatment (which is much lighter, minimal fragrance, and actually conditions).</li>
            <li> Be careful though because it will look gross oily fast.</li>
            <li> It did seem a little pricey to me at first...</li>
            <li> My flat ironed looks usually last me 2-3 days, depending on the heat, humidity, outside (I live in the south).</li>
            <li> I did shake the bottle before using but it was not enough apparently.</li>
            <li> It does leave my hair soft but not incredibly soft as described by reviews.</li>
            <li> I have still found the thick, original formula in the smaller versions.</li>
            <li> I live in Nevada and it is so dry here that you have to use something in your hair daily to counter the desert.  </li>
            <li> Too much on the roots will weigh your hair down.     </li>
            <li> AND I live in the hot humid weather of Georgia, it is difficult to find a product that will maintain smoothness and banish frizz when I want to wear it straight.  </li>
            <li> She said it was a little watery than usual but ok.  </li>
            <li> It does not flake and does not leave my hair super hard.</li>
            <li> My hair is really thick, and when my stylist thins it out with those magical thinning shears, it also leaves lots of different layers that have a mind of their own on bad hair days.</li>
            <li> Do not use more than 2 quarters even if you have very thick long hair, trust me.</li>
            <li> There is certainly no way that could have been fake, and yet my product is just as many others describe - mainly SUPER runny (goes all over the place unless I&#x27;m very careful).</li>
            <li> For one thing they probably sell it for less (no S&amp;H), and for another, if you don&#x27;t like it then its much easier to return.</li>
            <li> Once you get past the sticker shock at some places, you soon realize it is worth it because it last me forever.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While the bottle says you can use on dry hair I have had little success with that -- it does not spread well</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the bottle says you can use on dry hair I have had little success with that -- it does not spread well</li>
            <li> You just have to be careful how much you put on and let it dry or just follow the instructions.  </li>
            <li> but if you have thin, fine hair ask your hair stylist to try some on your hair before you purchase a bottle.  </li>
            <li> Fairly certain that the product I purchased is fake due to the strong alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> Just use a little because it can make your hair look oily if you use too much and don&#x27;t put it close to the scalp either for the same reason.</li>
            <li> I balked at getting this at first because it was expensive, but this works so far above and beyond any of the other hair serums out there, and is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> and it really helps to protect it from heat and keep down my frizz!</li>
            <li> The result is great shine and softness, and moderate frizz taming for the little hairs at the base of my forehead or neck, the ones that will escape or refuse to stay straight and sleek like the rest.</li>
            <li> For my long, thick  and wavy hair I have used Biosilk Therapy Serum as finish conditioning in straight/sleek styling (just after drying and styling; for protecting my hair from heat, I use another product, a creamy leave-in conditioning specially for heat protection).</li>
            <li> I must admit that I have turned my dressing room into a virtual beauty store of failed hair products, however, this product really lives up up to every positive review I&#x27;ve read!</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, you will probably need a product with thicker consistency to tame better the frizziness.</li>
            <li> So recently I wanted to buy a serum for my hair, especially since I am flat ironing it and adding heat.</li>
            <li> I usually put some in my hair right after a shower while my hair is damp and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> I have long, wavy, thickish thin hair which gets SUPER frizzy from all the bleach i have had in my hair!</li>
            <li> [...]A little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I have long, naturally curly hair and silk therapy makes it soft and less frizzy!</li>
            <li> This step is CRUCIAL because you want this ONLY on the bottom half of your hair, and nowhere near the roots.</li>
            <li> A small amount while your hair is wet works wonders and sometimes I add a little more when my hair is dry for an extra silky look.  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to use too much though or it mats your hair down.</li>
            <li> price is a little be expensive , if the next time can give me a cheaper price will be nice ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shiny, smooth, and even seems less thick.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Biosilk Silk Therapy with my CHI flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Then, I took my flat iron (Maxiglide) and flat ironed my hair.</li>
            <li> When I flat iron it, I use the product as well - and it works just as well.</li>
            <li> and I wash my hair and use the silk therapy while flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> As a side note, I use all Ionic products from the Conair ionic brush, to the Andis ionic hairdryer and an ionic flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Then pour the product into your palm - abt the size of a nickel for short hair and the size of a quarter for long hair.</li>
            <li> the product last for a long time..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this anti-frizz serum for a long time and although I&#x27;ve tried others, I always keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> But then, I have pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> And as indicated earlier, by using a dab, this product can actually last very long!</li>
            <li> it was drastically marked down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok seems a little thin</li>
            <li> It can be used when hair is either wet or dry, but I prefer using it when my hair is slightly air-dried, to avoid blow-drying right when hair is wet and cause sweating mixing with the product, making the hair too oily/shiny.</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY use before any heat tools - blow dry, curling, or flat</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY use before any heat tools - blow dry, curling, or flat</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty unbelievable what this product has done for my hair!</li>
            <li> Same goes with dry hair (although it adds some sheen).</li>
            <li> I do the same when applying to dry hair either before styling, or after, for shine.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I will gently dry with a diffuser at this point, but only if I am in a rush or it&#x27;s freezing</li>
            <li> something is WRONG please learn from me and buy the real Biosilk in a store to ensure you are buying the real thing.</li>
            <li> Even with the harsh heat generated by both items, my hair remains so soft!  </li>
            <li> but since it lasts so long, it&#x27;s really not any more expensive than anything else.</li>
            <li> Instead I use a coconut hair lotion/cream (when my hair is still wet) from Target that will tame the frizz and make my hair really curly.</li>
            <li> I put this into my hair after it is towel dried and then blow dry as normal.</li>
            <li> I had Cancer in 2010 and when my hair came back it was very Dry.</li>
            <li> I have stick straight hair; naturally brunette with really light highlights that have been brutal to my hair.</li>
            <li> If you have crazy undecided hair it isn&#x27;t magical.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff a long time ago when I permed my hair, and I believe I stopped using it to wear braids.</li>
            <li> it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I do a deep conditioning with the silk therapy serum (wet my hair, apply and wrap in a towel, I leave it for an hour)</li>
            <li> It worked so well for me that I will be a life long customer.  </li>
            <li> I keep about 4-5 inch long strands</li>
            <li> For some reason when my hair gets really long</li>
            <li> This stuff lasts you a really long time and has done wonders for my frizz ball hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a long time</li>
            <li> I find that just a dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> , if you are not sensitive to smells, this works</li>
            <li> Its bottle is different as I expected</li>
            <li> but it is definitely easier to comb my hair when wet, leaving my hair silky, so</li>
            <li> use it with mousse on my curly hair and works all day long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a long time ago and did not remember it being so watery......</li>
            <li> So, I am not near as enchanted as I once was.  </li>
            <li> The product I received I clearly NOT Biosilk.</li>
            <li> because my hair is so thick, hair perm or coloring doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t have to use any at all, and I have really, really thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly, thick and somewhat frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE STRAIGHT AND THICK HAIR</li>
            <li> My hair is over halfway down my back so reducing styling time is essential.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly in the cold season when the weather is so dry.</li>
            <li> Rub only through the lower half and especially the ends.</li>
            <li> Rub only through the lower half and especially the ends.</li>
            <li> Too much may leave residue and leave your hair feeling a little heavy.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t know about any other products in the line that smell the same as this.</li>
            <li> I have used several items for when my hair gets a bit dry from using other products and nothing works as well as this does.  </li>
            <li> so it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product off an on for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I notice that if I go very long without my morning leave in condition routine, I stop getting complements on my hair.  </li>
            <li> it goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> My hair routine is now wash, condition, towel dry, put in about a quarter sized amount of biosilk, scrunch it around a bit and move on with my day.</li>
            <li> My hair seemed so dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> I have very naturally dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> No maybe as I blow dry them after application which may not be how its directed.</li>
            <li> I apply my makeup, takes about 45 minutes, then I take off the towel and let it air dry the rest of the way.</li>
            <li> and I blow dry and straighten my hair</li>
            <li> If I blow dry my hair, I can go 3 days without rewashing.</li>
            <li> Even if I didn&#x27;t swim I would use the product it gives my hair body and prevents it from being dry and brittle</li>
            <li> have used biosilk for years and encourage anyone&lt;br /&gt;with dry skin issues to apply biosilk after shower then&lt;br /&gt;body lotion.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair too sticky and too dry after I wash it off.  </li>
            <li> I just use a dime size drop per section of hair (4 sections) and blow dry...</li>
            <li> I use this as a heat protectant before I blow dry or straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> Just a small bit goes a long way and it makes your hair extremely soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> and I use it every single day.  </li>
            <li> In fact less since it does last so long.  </li>
            <li> It has almost an albumen-like  slick feel to it, but it is not &amp;#34;grease&amp;#34; or anything near it.</li>
            <li> Just use a small bit and it makes hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> - it helps me brush through my long hair easier when wet...</li>
            <li> I use it on my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair too to try and tame the short little hairs in the front.</li>
            <li> Showed up with a loose cap, with no seal... and it leaked all over rest of package.  </li>
            <li> The bottle last forever because you only need very little evertime, use it on damp hair or dry</li>
            <li> is the only produce that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it gives it body.</li>
            <li> It smells the same but wondering if its a watered down version.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so the bottle can last a while.</li>
            <li> A little definitely goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I use just a little after my very curly hair dries and it takes care of my frizz without completely destroying the curl itself!</li>
            <li> The product I received was thin like water, not at all the high quality serum I have purchased before in retail stores, by the same brand name.</li>
            <li> (I have very long, around 3 ft of hair, and this can handle it!)</li>
            <li> After several months of using this product, my hair has grown noticeably and there is very little shedding when I wash my hair even though I use a curling iron daily (thermal), have color AND get a relaxer.</li>
            <li> There is alcohol in this product, you have to be careful not to over dry.  </li>
            <li> I used the Biosilk on my wet hair and let air dry.  </li>
            <li> If you put it on while your hair is wet, it may take forever to dry.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this hair serum by a worker at my beauty polar.  </li>
            <li> I am a black woman, whose hair is regularly permed and colored.  </li>
            <li> I will probably play around with different types of serums from this line and see if I can find a less smelly one.</li>
            <li> It looks super expensive compared to the ounces</li>
            <li> A little goes a long long long way.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and hair and use biosilk for both.</li>
            <li> have long and thick African American hair type</li>
            <li> I am a lifelong user of hair serum for my very thick, very naturally curly, very coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I came across the product and Amazon and bought it because of all the glowing positive reviews    After using about a half dozen times, I am very skeptical of this product and the people writing the positive reviews for it.    </li>
            <li> My application is a little different though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but you only need a little bit</li>
            <li> As exclusive reinforcement for these hairs, I use little touchs of another serum (one produced and sold locally in my country), a heavier one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This left my hair feeling oily and smelt a little pungent</li>
            <li> /&gt;Use just a little--my hair is very thick &amp; anything over a quarter-sized dollop is too much.  </li>
            <li> the REAL Biosilk is very thick and viscous.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried when I read the negative reviews claiming this is not the real product.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed that my hair condition improves as I continue to use this (probably due to less stress on the hair overall)    </li>
            <li> I have bought same stuff from other shops before during my visits to the US and this is nothing like my previous buy.</li>
            <li> I dont think I&#x27;ll ever switch back to any other hair serum ever again !!</li>
            <li> This I hardly use because it is so thick but its great for those crazy stray hairs.</li>
            <li> That sounds bad but my hair is healthy</li>
            <li> It stinks as if diluted with some cheap nail polish remover and the viscosity is like water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Till</li>
            <li> It has lasted a long time since I put a small dab of it on my hair daily.</li>
            <li> As expected</li>
            <li> You only need a few drops each time.</li>
            <li> and then I get pink moustache.</li>
            <li> Just gotta be careful.</li>
            <li> I initially tried this product a few years ago.</li>
            <li> If you put this product in while hair is wet though, it will keep your hair looking almost wet-like.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for a few years, and will continue to use it, it makes hair easier to manage, especially the ends.</li>
            <li> I comb mine after applying to distribute well.(when wet).</li>
            <li> I put it on her hair while it is still wet, and work it through with my hands, then start brushing.  </li>
            <li> I have used silk therapy for years.&lt;br /&gt;Things to be careful with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this when my hair is wet - scrunch it into ends.</li>
            <li> I put this on wet, go to bed and wake up to silk hair with no friz.  </li>
            <li> 2 DAYS SOONER THAN EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> So you have to be careful and apply it sparingly and evenly.</li>
            <li> I apply this on my wet or damp hair then brush my hair to distribute the product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really not.</li>
            <li> have learned that I can only use a few drops of the serum.</li>
            <li> but this one did not have the quality that I expected</li>
            <li> and it totally tamed my frizzy, humidity hair in the summer without making my hair feel heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> Item arrive when expected was as described.</li>
            <li> However, it is not for thick, unruly and natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> My friend introduced me to this product, she has really thick, natural curly/unruly hair unless she uses Silk.</li>
            <li> I have used leave in conditioners, straighteners , morroccan oil, Mystic Oil, etc,  Biosilk eleimimates the frizz, relaxes the waves and my hair feels soft and not so thick.</li>
            <li> later, I have a little less than half left.</li>
            <li> When I straightened my hair with other protectants, my hair used to become very dry-</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with the hair dryer and a round brush on some days and with a flat iron on others.  </li>
            <li> I used to blow dry my hair after shower to give it some form and style but then within few hours it would loose form.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly, thick, course blonde hair.      </li>
            <li> Might I add, a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other posters here are correct, a LITTLE goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When you use this product you don&#x27;t need to put alot in your hair, a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way - just use a dime-sized amount.  </li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so use it sparingly.  </li>
            <li> A LITTLE goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> ive tried other products before.</li>
            <li> and this is the first time I received fake product.</li>
            <li> I realized that the biosilk removed all of the labels and print on the bottles of make-up and other hair products.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a small amount, otherwise your hair looks greasy.</li>
            <li> I do not like wet looking gels or sticky pomades!</li>
            <li> So i started looking for something to style without wearing a wet look!</li>
            <li> but without the wet look!  </li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money!  </li>
            <li> and i do it every other day and straighten it again on the day I don&#x27;t wash.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes her hair shiny, glossy and detangled without making it look greasy like some of the other hair serums we have tried.  </li>
            <li> With other serums, by day 2</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t careful you will end up with shiny, greasy hair!</li>
            <li> It smells like alcohol and is extremely runny.</li>
            <li> Usually I don&#x27;t have product loyalty to any products and once I am done with one, I move on to the next.</li>
            <li> I went out the same day and bought it at Target as I was anxious to try it.</li>
            <li> The other day I woke up and went to my exercise class.</li>
            <li> I should have read the other user&#x27;s reviews.  </li>
            <li> Just remember, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The other formula maybe a knock off or what is sold at a drug store not a hair salon.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this from Amazon and other retailers.  </li>
            <li> (just the tiniest little drop goes a long way)!  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> I struggle to find products that stop the frizz of my curls but does not weight my hair down or make it look wet and greasy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive but worth every drop I applied to my hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s usually a frizzy mess especially if there&#x27;s any humidity.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair, so I&#x27;m very sensitive to anything that will be too oily or weigh my hair down and make it appear thinner.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> This is the real deal , please do not spread wrong words,  </li>
            <li> Definitely NOT worth the savings.  </li>
            <li> It smelled like rubbing alcohol and did not have the same thick consistency.</li>
            <li> This product helps to weigh my hair down a bit that prevent it flying everywhere.</li>
            <li> This was a watered down perfumed version of biosilk.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair or leave hair globed /lumped together and leaves the b4st shine i have found in any product.</li>
            <li> Over the years though it has been watered down but it still works</li>
            <li> However, using Biosilk calms it down...</li>
            <li> This calms them down.</li>
            <li> This bottle seems to be watered down; either they changed/cheapened their formula</li>
            <li> I think Biosilk themselves watered down this gigantic version of the product, because if they didn&#x27;t it would be way too pricey for them.</li>
            <li> This seemed watered down.</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s going to be the watered down version like</li>
            <li> The bottled it watered down with alcohol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Biosilk user for years and have never experienced this product in any negative way until now---  Extremely runny and after putting it in my hair, it&#x27;s evident that half the contents of the bottle is alcohol!</li>
            <li> considering i can just go down to wal mart and buy a bottle of serum for less than half the price of this</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used Biosilk in a while, but I remember it being thicker in consistency when I previously used it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my hair looks any less frizzy either.</li>
            <li> I found it for $17 which is half the price, so I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> , SO I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED THE SELLER AND WITHIN HALF</li>
            <li> Then I found it on Amazon &amp; the cost of it was much less than what I&#x27;d been paying at the Salon for years.  </li>
            <li> I decided to get this because I had used it previously</li>
            <li> I agree with a previously written review.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t try to return it because of the previous reviewers experience.  </li>
            <li> Use less than you estimate you&#x27;ll need, a teensy drop should be all you need.</li>
            <li> Through Amazon the price is about half of any place else she had found previously.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair seem greasy and feel a little weighted down.  </li>
            <li> Even with all frizziness not completely controled, I like what this product does to my hair, and don&#x27;t mind using the reinforcement of the heavier and sticky serum, for the isolated and small cases of frizziness that Biosilk won&#x27;t tame.</li>
            <li> my hair&#x27;s type is really thick, black and not really soft.</li>
            <li> I tried the Chi Silk Infusion because I thought they would be the same since they are both made by Farouk but the Chi is not nearly as good.</li>
            <li> my hair usually  sticks out a mile wide from frizziness</li>
            <li> If you style your hair it is bound to mess it up.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long &amp; curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hispanic with thick long wavy hair.</li>
            <li> If your hair is really long or thick, do it this way, just a dab at a time until it gets how you want it.</li>
            <li> I had long, thick hair with a tight perm (some of you probably remember the 90&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li> One little dab (the size of half a dime) smooths your hair..controls frizz and adds shine..</li>
            <li> However, I am not certain if they changed the formula or if my hair is changing, but I do not LOVE it the way I used to.  </li>
            <li> This Biosilk Silk Therapy serum works miracles if your hair is dry, dull or is prone to frizz.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and dry, so I use about a guarter size.</li>
            <li> A little product was leaking when delivered</li>
            <li> I on the other hand have to go seriously overboard before it looks greasy on my hair.    </li>
            <li> even if you go a bit overboard, it won&#x27;t leave a greasy residue like other serums I&#x27;ve used in the past&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it after washing my hair and drying it with hair dryer a little bit.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey for the size though...</li>
            <li> A little biosilk and a blowout is all I need.</li>
            <li> i did feel that hte biosilk i ordered was a little &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; compared to the one i had from the store.</li>
            <li> The product you&#x27;ll be getting is watered down Biosilk!</li>
            <li> i have black, thick, thick, thick, thick, straight but frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It will be a very dark day in my world if they ever stop making this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair that gets abused daily.</li>
            <li> I was afraid after reading some comments about \\&quot;non-original\\&quot; products where customer said the product smell like alcohol and was very liquid.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years.  </li>
            <li> Works without making the hair heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> Also, it was heavily perfumed.</li>
            <li> You may use it on towel dried hair, or as a finishing gloss.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t get limp often</li>
            <li> I even use it on my skin when I get out of the shower or pour a few drops into my lotion as well.</li>
            <li> I use it after I have dried my hair before finishing the style.</li>
            <li> Before I used Biosilk, my hair was dried out after I straightened it.</li>
            <li> this always use it everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ran out a few times and stopped using it</li>
            <li> I put a few drops in my hands and rub them together and then run my hands through my hair.</li>
            <li> I do not straighten my hair, but I do color it every few weeks.</li>
            <li> In fact, it takes very little (for me just a dime sized amount or less in the palm of my hand) and if too much is used, it will cause a dirty or oily appearance.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use gels, sprays or any hair product usually, because they weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this was simply a defective bottle or if the overall quality of the product has gone down, but I was definitely disappointed and wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the money.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the other negative reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> This is possible that my hair type is not suitable for this product!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over 2 years to tame my frizzy curls, and it works without making my hair too oily.</li>
            <li> So be aware you are not getting what you expect or pay for, and the alcohol will dry out your hair and make it smell bad!</li>
            <li> I have thick curly black hair</li>
            <li> A little dab of Silk Therapy and no worries all day - wouldn&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
            <li> It had the wrong consistency, smelled like rubbing alcohol, and was not the same product that I have purchased from salons.  </li>
            <li> but Amazon will usually handle any issues you have with them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I am not sure how this would work for that purpose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a small amount in your palm goes along ways...</li>
            <li> She used this product on my hair and gave me a small .5 oz.</li>
            <li> No more knots.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> Even since I was a teenager my hair would grow to about 6-8in past my shoulders and start splitting all over, forcing me to cut it, and no fancy product seemed to help.</li>
            <li> A 5.64 oz bottle usually lasts me a couple of years, so even though it appears to be \\&quot;expensive\\&quot;, (for me)</li>
            <li> I usually use Kiehl&#x27;s creme with silk groom, but this product way surpasses the results I have gotten from that.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy my Biosilk at a retail store, but decided to buy it online this time (never again).</li>
            <li> The Biosilk I usually buy does not contain alcohol and this product does.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount on the palm of your hand and rubbing it on your hand before transferring it onto the ends and hair follicles will do well.  </li>
            <li> Last week, when i tried to use it, i found this is a totally wrong thing inside.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately that means having to use a flat iron almost every day.  </li>
            <li> and it is tough to find something that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it look greasy.  </li>
            <li> The previous reviewer must be confused.</li>
            <li> it is silicone based, so it builds up in the hair like a layer of plastic and must be washed out (not too hard to do if you use shampoo)</li>
            <li> It is hard to explain this product.</li>
            <li> This is really very big disappointment for me.</li>
            <li> CHI Silk Infusion Reconstructing Complex 6 oz]]    </li>
            <li> , my hair just sucks it</li>
            <li> Not getting it on your scalp to prevent from receiving oily hair (at least for me).  </li>
            <li> this is my 1st negative comments from Amazon shopping experience.</li>
            <li> I have thick dirty blonde hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, FRIZZY hair.</li>
            <li> The serum is not as thick as the CHI Silk Infusion Silk Reconstructing Complex,(Farouk sister of Biosilk).</li>
            <li> I have curly, thick Egyptian hair, and I searched forever for the \\&quot;miracle product\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The waves slowly start to disappear and my hair feels so silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and need product to relax and flatten out.  </li>
            <li> I have thick bleached hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, somewhat frizzy, curly hair.. and a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> This product is NOT authentic!  </li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, other than that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so waterish that there is no way to get \\&quot;a small amount\\&quot; in your hand!</li>
            <li> it is NOT the real biosilk, OR it is terribly watered down.</li>
            <li> the product made her hair look greasy even with a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is seriously the solution to all hair issues.</li>
            <li> hair is colored, curly, can get dry on the ends and frizzes like crazy in the humidity.  </li>
            <li> It was less expensive than had I purchased at the salon.</li>
            <li> I have only had one or two bad experiences with the products they sell.</li>
            <li> started using Biosilk Silk Therapy back in the 90&#x27;s when I was in my \\&quot;bad perm\\&quot; phase.  </li>
            <li> Im not using this crap on my hair because the alcohol will not only destroy my color, but it would probably fry my hair as well since I have thin but puffy hair.</li>
            <li> Silk Therapy is thick and smells like roses; the product I received was as thin as water, and smells like alcohol.</li>
            <li> and before long the hair gets dry, splitends-y, and a horrible tangled</li>
            <li> A bit expensive, but this small bottle lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> This sucks!</li>
            <li> I use to think it was ugly and dry looking.</li>
            <li> I mean, come on!  </li>
            <li> Anyway, when I opened the bottle and began using it, it seemed like water which confused me because I though it was supposed to be a serum.  </li>
            <li> Third, it is greasy and annoying to have in your hair unless you are used to it.    </li>
            <li> The SCENT of the Silk Therapy is one reason I stay addicted.</li>
            <li> It was opened &amp; tampered with because the foil seal had been broken and smashed into the cap.  </li>
            <li> It smells like Biosilk but is way too thin and watery.  </li>
            <li> Further, the comb will sail right through the worst gummy tangles of overprocessed hair, without the awful pulling and breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is also very subtle.</li>
            <li> This product is difficult to sqeeze out of the bottle, need to use a lot of product to condition hair and just not happy with results.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed when I tried to pour a little in my hand.  </li>
            <li> My skin &amp; hair had a very rude awakening!</li>
            <li> USE A SMALL quantity!!!  </li>
            <li> Fake product.</li>
            <li> I find it expensive</li>
            <li> This version is watery and smells weird.</li>
            <li> all are fake.</li>
            <li> Seems fake...</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this to me, but it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> Having frizzy, thin, kinky curly hair, I am a hair product junkie!  </li>
            <li> its expensive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also expensive.</li>
            <li> buy it u wont be sorry</li>
            <li> I could tell there was something wrong with this bottle before I even opened it because it was so watery.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used everything under the sun from expensive keratin products and moroccan oil to drug store stuff.</li>
            <li> i doubt this is a returned item which was returned by others with wrong stuffs inside the bottle.</li>
            <li> It is not good quality and as if it has gone bad or something.    </li>
            <li> So I think people should take the time to read the instructions before they claim that something is a fake or a bad  product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Helps to defreeze hair without leaving them feeling dirty.</li>
            <li> The smell of the product drives me crazy.</li>
            <li> It is very expensive</li>
            <li> Bad hair days are not a thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is bad news for your hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product on my children as well as friends and family that have asked me to do their hair, I have never been disappointed and either has anyone that I have known that has used this product.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed and dissatisfied.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> So annoying.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate when my budget is suffering</li>
            <li> Well I was very wrong!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and have hated my hair forever.</li>
            <li> It is a shame Amazon is selling it despite very bad reviews.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the product I received!!!!!</li>
            <li> Worst product I have ever bought on amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to pay the outrageous shipping price.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Been using for years.  As expected</li>
            <li> I got expired products</li>
            <li> Great like all producta</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, but when I ordered on Amazon from vendor &amp;#34;Naturaly&amp;#34;, the product I received smells different and has a different/diluted consistency compared to the real product  (very runny even after shaking). Hoping I can return it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years.  It really tames the frizz and creates curls.  This has been the best price I have been able to find...</li>
            <li> There are many products out there for smoothing hair. Biosilk Silk Therapy is one of the best; this product can be used on all different types of hair from long, short, strait, curly, frizzy, to all different ethnic backgrounds.  This product can also be used on children that have hair that is not tamed.  This product is also good for individuals that are constantly straightening their hair with a flat iron.  I have used this product on my children as well as friends and family that have asked me to do their hair, I have never been disappointed and either has anyone that I have known that has used this product.  This product is used in salons all over the country as well as sold in salons and all your local grocery store as well as online.  I recommend this product to anyone that uses a silk therapy serum; this product contains no alcohol so it will not dry out your hair like most other products.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product when I was younger and could not find it again.I bought the biggest bottle possible and it feels so good on my hair.It made it feel so smooth and the smell...to die for!I will be buying more when I run out!</li>
            <li> This product is very versatile. I have thick curly black hair and I love this stuff. I also use it on my stepdaughter, who has fine dirty blonde hair, and it tames her flyaways and leave it soft, shiny and super manageable. (Plus she loves the smell). I use a little on my ends right out of the shower, then a few drops more after my hair is dry. Might I add, a little goes a long ways. You only need a few drops each time. These drops will make anybody&#x27;s hair look healthy and tames the frizzies. Overall, awesome product. I highly recommend it for all hair types.</li>
            <li> Best leave in conditioner available.  Works without making the hair heavy or greasy.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife and my two daughters that have long delicate and silky hair, immediately after my wife applied this to my daughters hair you could see a bright shine to it and when running your fingers through they&#x27;re hair it was surprisingly very silky and smooth feeling.  My wife already asked for me to purchase more of this product......final comment.....this stuff is awesome would recommend and have recommended to everyone (well my wife has).</li>
            <li> I have stick straight hair; naturally brunette with really light highlights that have been brutal to my hair. I bought this at a discount beauty supply company, and have been thrilled with the results. A couple drops in my hair and I can comb it through! It dries smooth and silky. More for a sleeker look and a little less if I want more texture.     I have also noticed that my hair condition improves as I continue to use this (probably due to less stress on the hair overall)    The smell is wonderful, reminds me of the old Breck Shampoo (in a good way) very clean.    My two year old daughter has total curly ringlets, and I use this after her bath, and I can immediately comb right through them (time and sanity saver). Plus, with summer humidity, her hair just curls up into neat ringlets instead of frizz. I am sold.    Like the others have said, start on the roots and work your way up. Too much on the roots will weigh your hair down.     I bought the big 11 oz size in October. I use it for both of us and and 10 mos. later, I have a little less than half left. I would have paid full price for this and have been completely satisfied, if not blown away.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair that gets abused daily. I&#x27;ve used my fair share of hair serums/oils...Frizz Ease, Chi, Paul Mitchell, Biosilk, etc. I hadn&#x27;t used Biosilk in a while, but I remember it being thicker in consistency when I previously used it. I wouldn&#x27;t even consider it a serum now, it&#x27;s very watery, more like an oil. It works well and smells great, but it&#x27;s not as effective as it used to be.</li>
            <li> This serum is AWESOME Sauce!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;You only need a drop and it glides on perfectly. It leaves my hair shiny and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product since i was a teen and then stopped using it because i couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere and recently i heard someone say they used Biosilk and i immediately checked Amazon and ordered it. It arrived in 3 days. WOOOHOOOO!&lt;br /&gt;Love it and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> The product arrived very soon after I ordered it and it was exactly as described.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had used it before. When it arrived, I opened the bottle to try some on my hair. The fluid was VERY WATERY! It used to be thicker, like an oil.  Also, it was heavily perfumed. I can&#x27;t wait to wash it out of my hair. I don&#x27;t think my hair looks any less frizzy either. I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend switched me to this products a while ago and I love it. I have pretty thin hair that tend to fly all over the place at a smallest gust of wind. So annoying. It gets stuck to my lipstick... and then I get pink moustache. This product helps to weigh my hair down a bit that prevent it flying everywhere. it smells great too, sort of fruity. A bit expensive, but this small bottle lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> Okay, first off, when i first received this i was freaked out because when i poured it out it was all alcohol and watery like, but you need to really listen to the directions (cough). Shake the bottle, and I mean shake it real good, the oil and all the other good stuff in there need to mix. After you shake it let it sit for a while then try it again. It IS the right stuff. I bought the 2 pack of 5.64 oz (also labeled as 12 oz).</li>
            <li> I used this stuff a long time ago when I permed my hair, and I believe I stopped using it to wear braids. Now, I wear my hair \\&quot;natural\\&quot; without any chemicals--so combing through my hair can be a bit of a challenge sometimes.    One dime size amount after washing my hair did wonders!  My hair is so soft, silky, shiny, and manageable--I love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if this product works good on the hair or not, but for sure, i dont like the smell...  smell like old cosmetic.   I bought it and can&#x27;t use it, can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I have turned my dressing room into a virtual beauty store of failed hair products, however, this product really lives up up to every positive review I&#x27;ve read! It is absolutely FABULOUS ( and did I mention that my hair is natural ! It is so light, yet effective at taming (smoothing) my hair.....and oh it leave one&#x27;s hair smelling sooo gooood! The price is excellent. It is very pricey at other locations. I am very pleased with this product. It works miracles for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have been using it for years now to add shine to my hair without the added moisture.  I use this product right after a shampoo, after I have flat-ironed my.  It leaves my hair shiny and bouncy!</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time, and it sells for more than double this price in the store.  I&#x27;m happy to get this from Amazon and especially that I can subscribe to it so it is sent to me as often as I need so I don&#x27;t have to make a trip to the store.  Great job Amazon!!</li>
            <li> It works! After using this product, my hair looks much more healthy and silky! The price is really reasonable for the wonders it provides. Though, one has to be really be cautious when using this product, do not use too much! It is really oily after all. Just a dab is enough. It can be used when hair is either wet or dry, but I prefer using it when my hair is slightly air-dried, to avoid blow-drying right when hair is wet and cause sweating mixing with the product, making the hair too oily/shiny. Therefore, beware the amount being used. The first and last time I used it on wet hair, and blow-dried, my fire alarm set off, because the smell was somewhat strong like those from the hair salons.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product do what it promises. It is highly recommended to those who seek effective heat protector, as well as hair treatment for silky hair. And as indicated earlier, by using a dab, this product can actually last very long!</li>
            <li> This product to the best it helped me a lot&lt;br /&gt;And this is the real stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I love I will sure buy this is the future!&lt;br /&gt;I had brought 2 and it was great!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery love this product</li>
            <li> Is the best ever oil for u hair I been buying this biosilk for many years I love it is the best..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my hair for years, it smells great and it makes your hair silky smooth. The bottle last forever because you only need very little evertime, use it on damp hair or dry it goes a long way. I would recomend this product since is the only silk treatment i&#x27;ll use on my hair. My sister gave me a CHI oil product for my hair I didnt like it at all it smelled like old mans cologne and It was so much more expensive than this product, this product IS the best trust me ive tried other products before.</li>
            <li> Fake product. I bought a lot of things from Amazon.com and this is the first time I received fake product.So disappointed</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is a real challenge between relaxers.  I tried this based upon reviews and couldn&#x27;t believe the results.  It worked.  I could get the comb through my hair without wincing.  My hair is bouncy, shiny and a pleasure to touch.       And really- I only used a drop.</li>
            <li> My mom had bought this years ago for the first time and from the get go my sisters and I were using it up. We loved the great smell, shine,and smooth texture it leaves in your hair and because it was light it didn&#x27;t leave a very heavy feeling. We still use it years later. The only thing is you cant buy it from just anywhere, for example, I bought it at Ulta or a professional salon and I got the correct product but I noticed when I bought it from Target it was watery and not as thick as it is suppose to be, so you have to be careful where you buy it from, Costco is another good place to get it from when they have it in stock. Just gotta be careful. *Note: My sisters and I have very thick hair, mine is frizzier and my sisters is more straight but it works well for us.</li>
            <li> Not only great for hair but for skin too. It soaks in/does not stay oily. It also smells great. I have been using this for years. highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> smells good and makes my hair feel amazing and NOT greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, FRIZZY hair. About six or seven years ago, the lady that cuts my hair introduced me to Biosilk and explained to me that I was over shampooing my hair type. It has completely changed how I think of my own hair. I freakin&#x27; LOVE my hair now. I use to think it was ugly and dry looking. Now I get compliments on my hair on a regular basis. A little bit goes a very long way. My hair routine is now wash, condition, towel dry, put in about a quarter sized amount of biosilk, scrunch it around a bit and move on with my day. The waves have better shape and the frizz is almost entirely gone. I haven&#x27;t had problems with split ends or hair breaking since I started using it. It will be a very dark day in my world if they ever stop making this stuff.</li>
            <li> I initially tried this product a few years ago. My hair is really thick, and when my stylist thins it out with those magical thinning shears, it also leaves lots of different layers that have a mind of their own on bad hair days. I use this product everyday to smooth out my hair before styling. It leaves it shiny, soft and helps the flat iron do its thing.</li>
            <li> I have long, very naturally curly hair but I prefer to wear it straight.  Unfortunately that means having to use a flat iron almost every day.  All of us ladies know that styling our hair with heat on a regular basis can do some damage.  And since my hair is naturally curly, frizz is almost inevitable when it&#x27;s humid.  However, about 11 or 12 years ago I was introduced to the Biosilk line and have been a faithful user and believer ever since.  This Biosilk Silk Therapy serum works miracles if your hair is dry, dull or is prone to frizz.  The serum truly does feel like silk on your hands and it has a very pleasant smell too.  When it&#x27;s applied to the hair, you can turn any bad hair day into a great one.  All dryness is gone, fly-a-ways disappear and humidity no longer causes an unruly poof to appear. It also appears to dramatically lessen the damage and protect from heat styling because considering how much I use my flat iron, you&#x27;d never know it when looking at or feeling my hair and I fully credit this silk therapy serum. One thing that&#x27;s very important to add is that it does not take much of this serum to achieve those results.  In fact, it takes very little (for me just a dime sized amount or less in the palm of my hand) and if too much is used, it will cause a dirty or oily appearance.  So if you&#x27;re using this serum for the first time I recommend putting a tiny dab in the palm of your hand, work that into the hair and gradually add more if needed to find that perfect amount for you.  That&#x27;s one of the things I love about this serum - one bottle can last quite awhile since it doesn&#x27;t take much to achieve that silky feel and appearance, so you get a lot of bang for your buck.  Also, I have well water and I&#x27;ve found that it really helps do away with much of the dryness associated with having too much iron in the water. I&#x27;d imagine that it would help those with chemicals like chlorine (etc) from city water too. Even after using this product for 11 or 12 years, I&#x27;ve never found anything better. They gave it the perfect name \\&quot;Silk Therapy\\&quot; because that&#x27;s exactly what it makes your hair feel like. By the way, this is also a great product for dry skin - it&#x27;s gentle too so it&#x27;s possible that even people with sensitive skin will have no problem using it.  So now your hair and your skin can feel like silk and have a beautiful smell as a bonus! I would definitely recommend giving it a try and maybe you&#x27;d love it as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sincerely hope this review helps you!never found anything better.

            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years. can&#x27;t find better ones. i have black, thick, thick, thick, thick, straight but frizzy hair. because my hair is so thick, hair perm or coloring doesn&#x27;t work very well. last year, like 3 times i had to go back to salons and get a perm or coloring right the day after i got them which made my hair so so so damaged. i know it doesn&#x27;t cure split or burnt ends, but after shampooing and cool drying i use this and it makes my hair so soft and untangled. glad to find this at amazon and buy at cheaper price with free shipping. thanks</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have been using it for over 5 years now. Just a small bit goes a long way and it makes your hair extremely soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This is the real Biosilk at a great cost. It makes my hair soft and silky. I can really tell the difference, especially when i dye my hair. Fast free  shipping also a plus.</li>
            <li> This item shipped so fast. I ordered it and by the 3rd day i had it in my hands. I love it! This was an easy and fast transaction. </li>
            <li> Okay, bought biosilk after hearing alot of good things about it.  Was so excited to use it to do a blow out and press on my kinky coiled african american hair.  First, let me disclaim that my hair, although kinky, presses fairly easily, but I wanted to get a bone straight press which is why I was trying something a little different.  Anyway, when I opened the bottle and began using it, it seemed like water which confused me because I though it was supposed to be a serum.  Still I kept applying it to my hair and blow-dried it.  My hair seemed so dry and brittle.  I also noticed that the fluid smelled like straight rubbing alcohol, but I still continued to apply it to the sections of my hair before blow-drying them.  For some reason I decided to shake the bottle up to see if maybe I would get a different consistency and sure enough after I did, the fluid became a serum.  All in all I don&#x27;t know if this product did anything special for my hair-- it did not create a good straight press, it did not seem to leave my hair particularly moisturized either.  In conclusion, I think anyone considering purchasing this item should first look at the other reviewers who swear that this product is nothing like the biosilk purchased in salons or in other stores.  I looked at their reviews after purchasing, but my experience with this product were pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> IT does what it says: Makes hair softer (like silk) but restore hair and improve it? Probably not . . . it is silicone based, so it builds up in the hair like a layer of plastic and must be washed out (not too hard to do if you use shampoo) and I understand that this is ideal for keeping hair from being damaged by heat/styling (As the heat then forms the silicone instead of the hair shaft). Chi is the same principal. I don&#x27;t use heat, so I use this just to keep my hair nice after a shower, which it does. If you put this product in while hair is wet though, it will keep your hair looking almost wet-like. Same goes with dry hair (although it adds some sheen). So try it out at different times.</li>
            <li> If you color or otherwise process your hair, BUY THIS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the three piece set at CVS (shampoo, conditioner and the silk therapy, all 12 oz bottles and for $27 its a steal!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other posters here are correct, a LITTLE goes a long way. Three days before I color my hair I do a deep conditioning with the silk therapy serum (wet my hair, apply and wrap in a towel, I leave it for an hour) and then I comb dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After coloring (48 hrs) I do it again and since I&#x27;ve been doing this, my color has stayed longer and richer. More importantly, my hair is in better condition than it ever has been.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love the way my hair looks and feels.  It does not flake and does not leave my hair super hard. It will also moisturizes my scalp.  Amazon sells this product cheaper than any where I have looked.</li>
            <li> I have longish wavy hair that I color occasionally. My hair tends to frizz up and look frazzled out, even though I never use a blow dryer. I have tried a lot of different hair-smoothing products, from shampoos to conditioners to leave-in lotions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But this stuff! It makes my hair sleek and silky in a way that no over-the-counter stuff I have ever found could. It&#x27;s not goopy or gel-ly or oily like many anti-frizz products. I think it&#x27;s silicone-based, so it just slithers onto your hair and then makes it look like a &#x27;70s shampoo commercial. (If I also use a straightening wand for special occasions, it looks like \\&quot;princess hair.\\&quot;) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My hair also feels about 500% softer than it does without it. Not just subtly softer, if you&#x27;re paying close attention, but like the difference between those new kind of plush toys that have extra-silky fur, compared to the old-fashioned kind of stuffed-animal fur. (I&#x27;ve had guys compliment me on the softness of my hair since I started using it.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a \\&quot;desert-island\\&quot; product for me! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had a shampoo-sized bottle (not sure of the exact ounces) and it lasted nearly two years.</li>
            <li> This hair product is truly the best. This particular product was used every time I went to the salon. I was pleased with the results, so I went and bought a bottle of my own. You will not be disappointed! It&#x27;s especially good if you wash your hair, and, before blow drying it, you rub it in your hands, and just smooth it all over the wet hair. Blowdry as normal (I usually do it with a large brush), and the hair comes out silky, shiny, and gorgeous. It also smells great too! Finish off with a flat iron, and your hair will look absolutely amazing! (I have very long, around 3 ft of hair, and this can handle it!)</li>
            <li> I got this product about two weeks ago and I really like it. I was afraid after reading some comments about \\&quot;non-original\\&quot; products where customer said the product smell like alcohol and was very liquid. I got this one directly from amazon. I recomend this product very much.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product religiously! I loved it, then I this happened..... I was on an airplane to Vegas to meet my husband there. I had put all of my products into one bag (no, I don&#x27;t fly often.) So I had my hair supplies along with my make-up. Well, when I got to the hotel to touch up I realized that my bottle of biosilk had exploded in my make-up bag. A huge mess, but what really bothered me was when I was clean off all of my make-up that I could salvage I realized that the biosilk removed all of the labels and print on the bottles of make-up and other hair products. In short, why would I want to put something on my hair that removes print that has been typed onto a bottle or removes the labels?</li>
            <li> I recently bought this item for the first time and I love it.  I&#x27;m african american and I&#x27;m very cautious of what I put in my hair.  It made my hair stronger &amp; softer.  When you use this product you don&#x27;t need to put alot in your hair, a little bit goes a long way.  Too much may leave residue and leave your hair feeling a little heavy.  I strongly recommend this product if your looking for strength and softness.</li>
            <li> Great product. A little product was leaking when delivered but I was able to just wash off the bottle. Would still order again.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth.  That&#x27;s the best way to describe my hair after using this wonderful product.  My cupboards are full of beauty products that haven&#x27;t delivered, but Biosilk Therapy Serum is definitely one that I&#x27;ll turn to again and again.  I use it in conjunction with the hair dryer and a round brush on some days and with a flat iron on others.  Even with the harsh heat generated by both items, my hair remains so soft!  I don&#x27;t typically take the time to write reviews, but this is one product that I love.  One word of caution, though.  Using too much tends to leave the hair a bit oily.  I&#x27;ve found that a dime-size portion is perfect.    Pro&#x27;s:  Protects hair from high-heat of dryers and irons  Silky smooth locks    Con&#x27;s:  Pricey  Using too much leaves fine hair a bit oily</li>
            <li> If you want a hair care product to control uncontrollable hair this is the product for you. One little dab (the size of half a dime) smooths your hair..controls frizz and adds shine..The only product that does this..Trust me I&#x27;ve tried everything...P.S. It makes your hair smell wonderful...    Beware however..If you use too much it will make your hair greasy..One tiny dab is all you need...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years now and love it. I put this into my hair after it is towel dried and then blow dry as normal. This makes my hair SO smooth and non-frizzy. It works like magic and I highly recommend it to people who have thick hair like myself. It absolutely makes the world of a difference! It can be a but pricey but is definitely work it!!</li>
            <li> I have used Silk Therapy for many years, and it is an outstanding product. This is the first time I have ordered it from Amazon. Silk Therapy is thick and smells like roses; the product I received was as thin as water, and smells like alcohol. It is not the real thing.</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price around. The previous reviewer must be confused. Target does not sell this size for $11.99. They sell the smallest size for that price on sale, but normally $14.99. This is the next size up and normally sells at Target for $25.99 when it is not on sale. I almost didn&#x27;t buy this here because I thought it was a mistake in the listing. There is no place on earth that offers this price for this sized bottle, unless you happen to find it in TJ Max. I did that once and will never buy those kinds of products again from that store. It is not good quality and as if it has gone bad or something.    I was impressed that Amazon gave top quality Biosilk for such a great price. However, it is not for thick, unruly and natural curly hair. It will do nothing but give you a pleasing smell, and the great fragrance does not last long. This is great for those with some frizzes and excellent for bed head where you dont want to do a full hair job in the morning--yet still look good after putting a little on and rushing out the door.    I would probably not buy this again, but recommend for those with a different hair type to try this out. It is the best price around and it is good quality, not the \\&quot;over-priced yard sale, worn out quality\\&quot; like TJ Max and Marshalls.</li>
            <li> This makes my long and straight hair look healthy and best of all ... smell sooooooooo good! I am very sensitive to scents but this one leaves a subtle, clean, inviting and a \\&quot;I want to get close to you\\&quot; scent in your hair. A must have for me!!!!!</li>
            <li> Out of all the products that i have tried, silk therapy by biosilk seems to do the perfect job.  Helps to defreeze hair without leaving them feeling dirty. Love it.</li>
            <li> I like to straighten my hair with a straightening iron once in a while.  Since my hair is naturally curly AND I live in the hot humid weather of Georgia, it is difficult to find a product that will maintain smoothness and banish frizz when I want to wear it straight.  After appyling BioSilk to my hair, I had to run an errand.  Not only was it humid outside, but it was also misting rain.  My hair remained smooth and frizz free!</li>
            <li> This product is difficult to sqeeze out of the bottle, need to use a lot of product to condition hair and just not happy with results. Hair seems stringy and has fly aways after use.</li>
            <li> Fairly certain that the product I purchased is fake due to the strong alcohol smell. It still feels silky and silicony, but I&#x27;ve been purchasing from salons since this experience to make sure I get the authentic product. There seems to be a lot of Chinese biosilk floating around online.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks. Makes my hair so smooth.</li>
            <li> You have to use just a litte, and that&#x27;s what is perfect, because you will have the same bottle forever. I just love this stuff. It smells good, makes your hair smell good, but does not weight it down or look dirty.   It&#x27;s still the best thing too if you are using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.. tried lots of others.. no comparison</li>
            <li> This product arrived superfast, was packaged very neatly, and works really well. I have been using it for over 2 years to tame my frizzy curls, and it works without making my hair too oily.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not a question of being disappointed; rather, I am more concerned about running out of this fine product that I&#x27;ve used on my face and arms for years.</li>
            <li> Just the very best oil therapy on the market, little bit expensive but it pays itself.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product with great results for dry or frizzy hair.  A great value, even with paying freight, about half of what it retails for in my area.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky, smooth, soft, and manageable. This effect does not fade either. I have used it daily for 4 days now, and I see and feel a total difference in my hair. I am happy I splurged and bought this one. I was not expecting it to help my hair this much, this quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is seriously the solution to all hair issues. Bad hair days are not a thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is also heavenly, and you can use it not just in your hair, but on skin as well. It feels fantastic no matter where you apply it.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this product and she loves it.  It does wonders for her hair.  I find it expensive but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I came across the product and Amazon and bought it because of all the glowing positive reviews    After using about a half dozen times, I am very skeptical of this product and the people writing the positive reviews for it.    First, it has a REALLY STRONG fragrance (what I call odor) which smells like CHEAP PERFUME OR CHEAP COLOGNE. And the smell doesn&#x27;t go away. If you put it on in the morning, you can smell it all day into the evening and I am sure others can to. If you don&#x27;t like the smell of cheap perfume or cologne, you probably won&#x27;t like this.    Second, it doesn&#x27;t do anything in terms of conditioning or moisturizing hair. I noticed no difference, positive or negative, after putting it on consistently.    Third, it is greasy and annoying to have in your hair unless you are used to it.    Overall, I recommend a good conditioner instead. If you want leave-in treatment, try Infusium 23 Leave-In Treatment (which is much lighter, minimal fragrance, and actually conditions).</li>
            <li> I am totally in luv with this!! It is just like the one at the mall without the hefty price tag! I am so going to purchase another one!!</li>
            <li> A friend told me to try this product a while back.  I have long, curly, thick, course blonde hair.      It worked so well for me that I will be a life long customer.  A small amount while your hair is wet works wonders and sometimes I add a little more when my hair is dry for an extra silky look.  It makes my hair shiny and healthy looking along with a smooth frizz free all day style.    The results were so good for me that I recommended it to a friend who had fine, thin slightly wavy hair and the product made her hair look greasy even with a very small amount.  I on the other hand have to go seriously overboard before it looks greasy on my hair.    Basically I think its a great product but if you have thin, fine hair ask your hair stylist to try some on your hair before you purchase a bottle.  I honestly don&#x27;t think this product is for all hair types but the ones who can wear it will be very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Biosilk Silk Therapy with my CHI flat iron.  This product is great!  A little goes a long way - just use a dime-sized amount.  My hair feels silky but *not* gunky.  5 stars!</li>
            <li> Use  this product every day.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my hair nice and silky. You only need to use a small amount, otherwise your hair looks greasy. Works great on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this product. It is not the Biosilk serum I buy at the stores. It&#x27;s completely watered down and has way too much alcohol. What you can find at the stores feels different and stays on your hair. This feels like a nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely diluted and reeks of alcohol. This is not the authentic product. I have had this product before, and I do like what the real stuff can do. This version is watery and smells weird. It is obviously tampered with.     Do not waste your money getting this product here. And for those of you who have tried it, buy the product from a salon store and TRUST ME you will notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Silk Therapy is such a great product and Amazon had the best price. You can use it on your skin or hair and it soaks in, leaving a softness and no greasy feel. The smell is wonderful, too! Very clean smelling.</li>
            <li> I got some of this after working for a lady that always had the prettiest shine&lt;br /&gt;to her hair.  She said she used Biosilk!&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product that really is longlasting.  Just be sure if you haven&#x27;t used it&lt;br /&gt;in a few days to shake it up first!</li>
            <li> i gat this product and i compare with mine before i used   but i is not real it is fake!!! it have too much alcohol smell!!!    i naver don&#x27;t want buy here  --</li>
            <li> leaves hair shiny and soft. I definitely will buy it again. was worth the money and wait. have a good day</li>
            <li> I have very naturally dry, frizzy hair. I have tried everything on the market that promises to smooth my hair. Biosilk serum is the only thing I have found that conditions my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling like there is product in it.  Also, this is the real deal, not fake as many have stated. It comes with tape on the top for shipping purposes. I have been using this serum for years and this is the first time I purchased from Amazon...it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li> This biosilk makes your haie so soft and silky. It really does work.</li>
            <li> I have always used this product.  Makes my hair shine and it smells wonderful.  love it I would recommend this to anyone looking to have your hair smell and look fantastic</li>
            <li> First time I ordered this product in Amazon coz I have very good experience with Amazon, but for this product I am not even ready to give one star for this product. The reason is this is duplicate. I always used to buy in Lucky or Walgreen&#x27;s. But when I searched in amazon i thought this is the best deal and purchased 3 bottles- all are fake. This is really very big disappointment for me. I never recommend this product in amazon and don&#x27;t waste your money, it&#x27;s not at all worthy. Better buy it in diect stores.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! Smells SOOOOOOO good and feels very soft. I put the remaining amount from my hands on my arms and it makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I would do without this product. I have very dry skin and hair and use biosilk for both.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for a few years, and will continue to use it, it makes hair easier to manage, especially the ends.</li>
            <li> Makes hair manageable, especially curly/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> The product is not of the same quality. The serum is of very diluted consistency. Seems fake... Disappointed and dissatisfied.  I have bought same stuff from other shops before during my visits to the US and this is nothing like my previous buy.</li>
            <li> Biosilk Silk Therapy remains as one of my mainstays in my hair care products. It is one I keep going back to again and again. I love it.  It is a medium textured serum. Biosilk&#x27;s main ingredient, hydrolyzed silk, is an amazing substance that gives moisture and sheen to the hair shaft. It coats it like liquid silk. Another great ingredient is panthenol, a protein. You may use it on towel dried hair, or as a finishing gloss. Determining how much to use is according to hair length/type/condition. My hair is thick and dry, so I use about a guarter size. Rub your palms together, and run hands throughout hair. I comb mine after applying to distribute well.(when wet). I do the same when applying to dry hair either before styling, or after, for shine. Use only a small amount at first.    I also love it because it can be used on the skin as well. It&#x27;s an amazing moisturizer. They have the idea right, as many hair conditioners contain some of the same ingredients as body lotions, making multi-tasking easier. Not only that, I use this stuff as a cologne! I have had so many people tell me I smelled so good, and ask what I was wearing. I say \\&quot;my hair.\\&quot; I love all of the products by Farouk Systems..(they have a body wash and lotion). The hair product line is great when used together. (try the Biosilk Fruit Cocktail Treatment [[ASIN:B00317DODO Biosilk Farouk Systems Usa Fruit Cocktail Reconstructing Treatment 11.6oz/300ml]]if you have dry/damaged hair). They have something for everything.    The SCENT of the Silk Therapy is one reason I stay addicted. They make a men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cologne, but I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re similar to the Silk Therapy fragrance. I also don&#x27;t know about any other products in the line that smell the same as this. Farouk, if you&#x27;re listening..make a fragrance just like this smells!    But this product is wonderful. It works beautifully on Caucasian and African-American hair. The serum is not as thick as the CHI Silk Infusion Silk Reconstructing Complex,(Farouk sister of Biosilk). The CHI treatment smells similar to a men&#x27;s fragrance. [[ASIN:B002WF9QLU CHI Silk Infusion Reconstructing Complex 6 oz]]    This is all around great stuff you have to see, feel and smell to believe!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I have fine hair and Biosilk is the only produce that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it gives it body. It is very expensive and so I stock up on it when I find it on sale.</li>
            <li> I have loved using this product for years, but it is always so EXPENSIVE, so when I found it here I bought two. I&#x27;ve been using Biosilk for years now and I keep coming back to it, my only deturrents is the regualr price in stores</li>
            <li> I ordered this item from Quick E Shop, and the product in the bottle was NOT Biosilk.  It had the wrong consistency, smelled like rubbing alcohol, and was not the same product that I have purchased from salons.  You should not order from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I have silky smooth thick and high volume hair. I keep about 4-5 inch long strands and I&#x27;m a guy who likes be be quick in the morning.   Problem with my hair is that they are too silky and do not hold or shape as i want. I do not like wet looking gels or sticky pomades! I like the weightless and clean look. I used to blow dry my hair after shower to give it some form and style but then within few hours it would loose form. So i started looking for something to style without wearing a wet look! Few years back I found Pantene Smooth Serum which was just an awesome product but for some reason was discontinued.   Then I found this product from biosilk which is as good or even better. My application is a little different though. After shower I spread about a penny sized serum on my palms and fingers and apply on damp hair by working my fingers through my hair. Using an ionic hair dryer (the ones that come with a comb attachment) I style my hair as I want in about 2 minutes. Surprisingly they dry very quickly and tend to be in form for a longer time. I also apply a little Redken finishing creme which adds another layer of mild control but without the wet look!  Does it make my hair more silkier? No maybe as I blow dry them after application which may not be how its directed. But it does what I wanted and I have salon style hair every morning with this awesome product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I would recommend this to any person that has frizz. It makes my hair feel so silky smoothe. I started using it about 2 months ago and cannot stand to go without it. Just use a little because it can make your hair look oily if you use too much and don&#x27;t put it close to the scalp either for the same reason. I tried the Chi Silk Infusion because I thought they would be the same since they are both made by Farouk but the Chi is not nearly as good. I would give this 100 stars I could.</li>
            <li> [...]A little really does go a long way. I used only a dime-sized amount of the product and massaged it from my roots to my ends, especially the ends. Then, I took my flat iron (Maxiglide) and flat ironed my hair. It came out looking wonderful, and was very bouncy. People have actually been staring at my hair all day. I am African-American, but my hair, because its been relaxed for years, is sort of a cross between curly and straight, with kinky curls at the root. After using the Biosilk Therapy and the flat iron, though, my hair looks 10x better.     One word of warning though, you should not use this product everyday, as it does contain a good bit of alcohol. I would use it maybe every other day, and make sure to use a shampoo that restores moisture, as alchol will dry it out. Using only a dime-sized amount should not really affect it too much, it may in the long run, but using a moisture restoring shampoo, and not using heat tools too much may help. My flat ironed looks usually last me 2-3 days, depending on the heat, humidity, outside (I live in the south). Today it was pretty hot, but my hair did not frizz, so that&#x27;s another reason to at least try this product. The smell is also very subtle. You can smell it, but its not over-powering.     I bought my Biosilk Therapy (5.64 oz) from Target for only $11.99, so I&#x27;d check there and at a local beauty supply store. For one thing they probably sell it for less (no S&amp;H), and for another, if you don&#x27;t like it then its much easier to return.</li>
            <li> wow I fall in love on this product!!! love it on my hair, I recommend this product! I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again...</li>
            <li> The product does not have the same consistency as the real Biosilk. It&#x27;s very runny as if it&#x27;s been diluted with baby oil which is probably why it&#x27;s so inexpensive. I will not order Biosilk from this particular vendor again.</li>
            <li> This Biosilk is the real product.  I was a little worried when I read the negative reviews claiming this is not the real product.  In fact, I was so worried that I went to a salon and spoke with a hair stylist.  I explained what my concerns where and then she looked at the product picked it up and shook it.  After shaking the product, the consistency and smell was exactly the same as the open bottle she had been using her salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, if you take the time to read the directions on the back of the bottle it says \\&quot;Shake well before use.\\&quot;  So I think people should take the time to read the instructions before they claim that something is a fake or a bad  product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been an Amazon shopper for many years and I spend a lot of money here.  I have only had one or two bad experiences with the products they sell. It is true that some of the sellers using amazon&#x27;s market place may not be on the up and up but Amazon will usually handle any issues you have with them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an Amazonian for life.</li>
            <li> Have been a regular user of this product for several years.  Expected product was received on a timely basis and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This I hardly use because it is so thick but its great for those crazy stray hairs. Be careful though because it will look gross oily fast. It is the best thick frizz help I have found though but easily weighs down fine hair strands.</li>
            <li> This product is great IF YOU GET THE ORIGINAL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I subscribed for it and got the first 2 deliveries perfectly fine. But, the most recent one I received is just not the original product. It stinks as if diluted with some cheap nail polish remover and the viscosity is like water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Till now I rated Amazon very high, but with this episode I am feeling so cheated that now I will think twice before ordering anything; and any new subscription is a definitely no.</li>
            <li> Awesome transaction, fast shipping!  I love this product and I use it every single day.  I have curly hair and it works wonders, cannot go without it!</li>
            <li> The network popular product, nearby of friend also used it. Hair after using a smooth, elastic, moisturizing effect is also very good.</li>
            <li> This was a watered down perfumed version of biosilk. This is not the real thing. Beware purchasing from this vendor.SHouldn&#x27;t even get a one star.</li>
            <li> I have soft curly hair in a humid environment, and I love using this product. It holds my curls, isn&#x27;t greasy, and makes my hair feel extremely soft. When I flat iron it, I use the product as well - and it works just as well. However, I prefer this product with my curls because of the texture. I often use it with the leave in conditioner (since I do damage my hair a lot), and it functions well.</li>
            <li> when i first bought this biosilk product two years ago it was nice and thick, now its not viscus at all, more like water that smells good</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I really like the smell.  It&#x27;s pretty strong at first, but it dissipates fast, too, so I don&#x27;t worry about it clashing with my perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is colored, curly, can get dry on the ends and frizzes like crazy in the humidity.  I put this on before I dry my hair and sometimes smooth a little more over it afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use just a little--my hair is very thick &amp; anything over a quarter-sized dollop is too much.  Use too much &amp; you&#x27;ll end up with greasy-looking hair.  Also, rub into your hands &amp; then smooth onto your hair--if you dump this directly onto your hair, you&#x27;ll have a greasy spot.  You will also have to wash your hands after using it.  Which is no problem if you use it at home.  If you plan on using it on the go during the day, take wipes, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve priced this locally at several stores &amp; this price is cheaper by $1 to $3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got it on auto-delivery!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best serum I have ever used !  It did seem a little pricey to me at first... considering i can just go down to wal mart and buy a bottle of serum for less than half the price of this but it is so worth it !  I got my first bottle of biosilk silk therapy in May and i still have more than half the bottle left !  I use it about 3X a week along with my hair straightener and the results are amazing !  I have a lot of split ends due to coloring and heat styling and this seems to seal them right up.... it also doesnt weigh down your hair and it doesnt have any scent to it which is nice.  I dont think I&#x27;ll ever switch back to any other hair serum ever again !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty unbelievable what this product has done for my hair! I have curly, thick Egyptian hair, and I searched forever for the \\&quot;miracle product\\&quot; that would make my hair manageable. I picked up this product as a way to protect my hair when I straighten it, and as I started using it regularly I noticed my hair becoming softer and softer. When I straightened my hair with other protectants, my hair used to become very dry- even straw-like. After I started using Biosilk my straightened hair is completely different. It&#x27;s shiny, smooth, and even seems less thick. Even when I leave my hair curly, it&#x27;s noticeably less frizzy and more silky. Biosilk is my miracle product!</li>
            <li> This product is NOT authentic!  It was a total waste of money!  It is a shame Amazon is selling it despite very bad reviews.</li>
            <li> of course this product is amazing, its been around forever and we all know and love it. i will always buy this stuff and buy it in large quantities</li>
            <li> I am a lifelong user of hair serum for my very thick, very naturally curly, very coarse hair. I love this one the best of all, and believe me I have tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;It started out with frizz-ease in my teenage years, which was a god send and the first product that allowed me to really love and appreciate the gorgeous hair I was born with.&lt;br /&gt;From there, I have tried almost every serum on the market, from drug store discounts to internet sensations that are even more spendy than this.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best product available at any price point.&lt;br /&gt;It is just the right texture so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down flat but it abolishes the frizz. Even on the rainiest most humid day. You will need to experiment to find the correct amount. My hair is literally like a giant sponge so I literally can&#x27;t overdo it, my hair just sucks it in.&lt;br /&gt;I should point out that I do not straighten my hair, not ever. I wear it curly always so I am not sure how this would work for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;People will stop me everywhere I go and want to touch my hair or &amp;#34;boing&amp;#34; my curls.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to both penetrate the hair shaft and polish and coat the outer layer at the same time. It smells amazing too!&lt;br /&gt; I have to use a serum daily or I look like a brillo pad so a serum is a necessity for me. I absolutely hate when my budget is suffering and I have to buy a cheaper, inferior alternative.&lt;br /&gt;A quick note about how I use this product. While still in the shower I wring my hair out the best I can, then I apply this before getting out so it will trap the most moisture. Then I do my last comb through and wrap my hair in a towel turban. I apply my makeup, takes about 45 minutes, then I take off the towel and let it air dry the rest of the way. Sometimes I will gently dry with a diffuser at this point, but only if I am in a rush or it&#x27;s freezing outside.&lt;br /&gt;I also think this product would be really helpful for detangling the unruly hair of a child as it seems to just release even the nastiest snarls. I wish someone would have known about this when I was a kid, could have saved A LOT of tears!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and fast service with this seller</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels- like silk-I use both the leave in conditioner which has eliminated 2 other products from my hair care lineup &amp; the Silk lotion. Both can be used on the body or hair. The leave in conditioner is a great bargain- the lotion is a little pricey so shop around for the best buy.</li>
            <li> i have used Biosilk Silk Therapy Serum for over a decade and it&#x27;s great for fly away hair  . it doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair or leave hair globed /lumped together and leaves the b4st shine i have found in any product. Over the years though it has been watered down but it still works</li>
            <li> I love Biosilk, I have been using it for years. I wash my hair and put just a dab on the roots and I blow dry and straighten my hair and it&#x27;s healthy as can be. i know people say not to use a blow dryer and a straightner but I do and i do it every other day and straighten it again on the day I don&#x27;t wash. That sounds bad but my hair is healthy and I know it&#x27;s because I protect it with Biosilk. Also helps to use high quality shampoo and condtioners. I love Bumble and Bumble. A bit pricey but I get great complimented on my hair all the time! Worth it!</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this to me, but it is so expensive. I found it for $17 which is half the price, so I purchased it.  I did read all the reviews on it, and every one said that you don&#x27;t have to use much and it makes your hair very soft.  I must say, it is true.  You really don&#x27;t have to use any at all, and I have really, really thick hair.  Plus, my hair is even softer now, and I LOVE that. It looks healthier too, and I&#x27;ve only used it twice.  It&#x27;s worth the $.</li>
            <li> Great product, at the best price you&#x27;ll be able to find.  This helps my hair calm down after a shower, and makes it so smooth to the touch.  Combine with moisturizing shampoo and ceramic straightener to have healthy, smooth, and shiny hair.  I also use this to finger through my hair when it&#x27;s curled to calm the fly-aways.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. It works wonders for my hair. I moved to a new state and no one carries it, so being able to get it here made my day!</li>
            <li> Biosilk Silk Therapy is a magic hair product that will leave your hair so soft and shining you won&#x27;t need to buy another hair product again. Just a small amount in your palm goes along ways...so you can have beautiful, silky,and shiny hair and save money at the same time....you get two great things in one bottle of Biosilk......now that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years.  Good protectant.  The package will last over a year and I have waist length hair.</li>
            <li> This product is truly awesome!!! I have been using it for over 6 years &amp; still works as well as the 1st time I tried it ❤</li>
            <li> works excellent!! I never felt my hair so smooth before using this product. could be used as heat resistant serum for hair before blow drying or ironing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth every single penny, and a bottle will last forever, because you use it in such tiny amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how this works, but I can tell you that if you put it on the most damaged hair from dye, perms, or bleach, it will look like new hair again when it is dry. Further, the comb will sail right through the worst gummy tangles of overprocessed hair, without the awful pulling and breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is better than BEST! If you haven&#x27;t tried it -- YOU MUST! There is nothing else like it on earth.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product for my hair.  I have used it for years and was ecstatic to find it at such a GREAT price.  I paid approx. $2 more for this bottle which is over TWICE the size of the one I \\&quot;used\\&quot; to buy.  Thrilled!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist taught me how to iron my naturally curly hair several weeks ago. She used this product on my hair and gave me a small .5 oz. bottle. It has lasted a long time since I put a small dab of it on my hair daily. I  love the BioSilk products!!!! Have gotten the smoothing shampoo and conditioner and also the hairspray. My once course and curly hair is not straight and silky soft even with the hairspray on. Highly recommend these products and this seller has the best deal and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> My 8 yr old daughter has long, thick hair that tangles very easily.  Brushing out the tangles after her bath at night was a nightly disaster, complete with tears, pleading to skip it, and 30 minutes of distraction while I would try to very gently comb out the tangles.  With this silk therapy, we are done in 5-10 minutes, and it is much easier.  I put it on her hair while it is still wet, and work it through with my hands, then start brushing.  This stuff makes her hair shiny, glossy and detangled without making it look greasy like some of the other hair serums we have tried.  Basically, we went through every cheap drugstore brand of hair serum, frizz-ease, got2b, garnier fructis, pantene, suave, and everything else under $10.  Nothing works as good as this stuff, and it has a very nice kind of fruity smell.  I balked at getting this at first because it was expensive, but this works so far above and beyond any of the other hair serums out there, and is well worth the price.  Her looks and smells great, and the savings in tears and brushing time is priceless!</li>
            <li> I like it. I makes my hair very silky.  It tames my hair because it was damaged from color dye and bleaching.  It works well. It works best when the hair is damp after washing, and it soaks into the hair much better to keep the hair follicles from drying without needing moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> Nothing to brag about.  I didn&#x27;t notice any change in the look or texture of my hair. Save your money. I wish I did.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love Biosilk.  My hair has a natural wave, but seems to get frizzy on the top of my head.  However, using Biosilk calms it down... Thank, Amazon.</li>
            <li> A must for my hair. Smells great, silky, shiny, smooth leave-in. Absorbs in minutes. Makes my hair manageable &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> If I could have only one hair product, this would be it.  I&#x27;ve tried the \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; type products that I got at the discount stores / grocery / drug store and NOTHING comes close.  Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive, but totally worth it.  I have VERY think long hair (with a perm and natural curl) and still use a dime size amount.  The comb will go through my hair now with ease.  It makes it so silky too.  I&#x27;m not that fond of the shampoo or conditioner in this line, just the Biosilk therapy stuff itself.</li>
            <li> It is important to know what hair types that products work on.  From whatI see and have heard, it works on most anyone&#x27;s.  I live in the south and there is HIGH heat and HIGH humidity here as we are near the gulf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long and thick African American hair type and I wash my hair and use the silk therapy while flat ironing.  As a side note, I use all Ionic products from the Conair ionic brush, to the Andis ionic hairdryer and an ionic flat iron.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if you do or not, but ionic products enhance everything good that you can do to your hair including this product.  With it, my hair bounces and flows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I wrap my hair faithfully every night, it lasts until my next wash without my continuing to put heat on it more than that.  I have used silk therapy for years.&lt;br /&gt;Things to be careful with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  USE A SMALL quantity!!!  My hair doesn&#x27;t do well with oil AT ALL.  Even though this doesn&#x27;t have oil in it, putting too much on it gives it the same over lubed effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Every once in a while it is good to use a shampoo that rids your hair of build up with this product.  But then, I have pretty thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t get limp often so I don&#x27;t really care, but it may help someone else.  Over time you can feel that build up on your hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  There is alcohol in this product, you have to be careful not to over dry.  Especially if you have a hair type that you don&#x27;t have to wash daily.  Wrap your hair or do something where you don&#x27;t have to put the product on too much.  As another person said in a post, this is a good reason to use a moisturizing shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... But this is just knowing the product.  Not everyone will have ANY reason to use caution and some will have to use maybe one or two of these tips.  It TOTALLY gets 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Amazing for my hair. For some reason when my hair gets really long it starts to get tangled very easily. This saves my hair from doing that.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long &amp; curly hair. I find that this product does a good job at control, &amp; the frizz.</li>
            <li> Finalllly a product that works with my curly hair! My curls are soft and shine, shine, shine. It helps repair damaged hair as well.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for blow drying, but a little bit goes a long way. Just put some in your palm and rub your hands together and stroke it through to the ends. I don&#x27;t put it on my scalp because it might flatten it. But after blow-drying, it leaves my hair super shiny, smooth, and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hispanic with thick long wavy hair. It wasn&#x27;t until after high school that I learned how to style my hair without frying it. This product, I use it to straighten my hair. The routine is easy: rinse my hair, towel dry, apply biosilk, let hair air dry overnight (wrap a loose scarf as to not get the pillow wet and be able to get a good night&#x27;s sleep).&lt;br /&gt;In the morning my hair is glossy, soft, frizz-free and my waves so well defined that I can dare just touch up some strays with the flat iron and leave it like that &amp;#62;&amp;#62;Oh, and the best part...even if you go a bit overboard, it won&#x27;t leave a greasy residue like other serums I&#x27;ve used in the past&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&lt;br /&gt;I split my hair in four sections and brush it using my long-time best friend ConAir heated brush. The waves slowly start to disappear and my hair feels so silky and shiny. My hair is left shiny; it will be about 4 days before having to wash it. With other serums, by day 2 my hair begins to get oily at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;When I want my hair curly, I don&#x27;t use it. Instead I use a coconut hair lotion/cream (when my hair is still wet) from Target that will tame the frizz and make my hair really curly.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair soft and manageable.  It is smells clean.&lt;br /&gt;The seller was great!  I have and continue to recommend this.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft and al ittle shiney .</li>
            <li> Both my husband and myself have used this product for over 10 years and simply love it.  My hairdresser had originally used it on my hair and I so loved the fragrance and feel of my hair that I immediately bought some.  My husband is the one that uses it the most and only uses about two drops, rubs between his hands and then applies it to his hair.  It has just the right touch of hair control for him without leaving his hair looking as if he had used any hair product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the truly wonderful thing about Biosilk Silk Therapy....as a very special treat, I love to smooth a very small amount on my arms and legs after a shower.  The smooth silky feel of my clothes gliding on is pure heaven.  It is reminiscent of some potion from the far east and gives my skin such a magical feel.  One must try this to know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about and then you&#x27;ll be as hooked as I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to shake the bottle well and don&#x27;t get exuberant in applying,  More can always be added.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Great product, good price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Biosilk user for years and have never experienced this product in any negative way until now---  Extremely runny and after putting it in my hair, it&#x27;s evident that half the contents of the bottle is alcohol! I even use it on my skin when I get out of the shower or pour a few drops into my lotion as well. My skin &amp; hair had a very rude awakening! Interesting how it&#x27;s stated in the product info here that the packaging may vary... It&#x27;s not the actual &#x27;packaging&#x27;... It&#x27;s  the &#x27;safety sealing&#x27;!  Anytime I purchase this product from a salon, there&#x27;s always a cover on top of the opening to the bottle that needs to be pulled off by it&#x27;s tab. The one I bought from here had no such thing--  yet you can easily see the surviving trace around the rim. My hair &amp; skin aren&#x27;t happy &amp; neither am I. These kinds of Biosilk reviews have been on here since 2011 and it&#x27;s quite obvious&lt;br /&gt;A  M  A  Z  O  N  knows &amp; simply doesn&#x27;t care because they continue to sell it.  In my world, this is called FR  AU  D!</li>
            <li> I use it mostly in the cold season when the weather is so dry. It does help, so I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years now.</li>
            <li> Works ok for the price&lt;br /&gt;My&lt;br /&gt;Daughter likes it</li>
            <li> It does a great job in taming my frizz. I use it after washing my hair and drying it with hair dryer a little bit. I noticed if I use it on a completely damp hair it makes my hair look as if I didn&#x27;t wash it at all....</li>
            <li> This is a great product but it was a little thinner and watered down then bottles I have purchased from other retailers.</li>
            <li> I love how it tames my curls without making it greasy or wet looking.  I also love the awesome smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders! And smells soooo good! It makes my hair so soft and healthier looking! I love it!</li>
            <li> Keeps hair nice and silky!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells sooo good! It&#x27;s pricey but you only need a little bit so it lasts a very long time. It works great on wet or dry hair to help hold down frizzies.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. Better hair days with this product. I use it after I have dried my hair before finishing the style. Best product on the market</li>
            <li> Biosilk is probably a good product for some people, but it does not work great for my type of hair.</li>
            <li> I use this when my hair is wet - scrunch it into ends. It keeps the ends from looking frizzy. I use it daily. Keeps my hair very soft. Dries soft, not sticky.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have thin hair, so I&#x27;m very sensitive to anything that will be too oily or weigh my hair down and make it appear thinner. The Biosilk is my favorite leave-in conditioner. My hair gets really soft and manageable, and not oily. I use it on my hair right out of the shower, and sometimes I use a little more when my hair&#x27;s dry, if it is frizzy or getting fly-aways. This calms them down. It&#x27;s a little pricier than I&#x27;d like, to be honest, but I really like it.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by a friend so we gave it a try since my daughter always gets knots in her hair.  Her hair is now silky smooth and easy to comb.  No more knots.</li>
            <li> I was trying to go without the biosilk to save money, but I caved and bought some more. I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;ve chemically treated your hair before. I usually put some in my hair right after a shower while my hair is damp and let it air dry.  My hair is slightly wavy and it really makes my curls more defined and soft.</li>
            <li> The product I received seems old.. It doesn&#x27;t mix well even after shaking. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Keeps the braids slicked back so nicely and smells great too.  I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday and it keeps my hair nice and silky! would definitely recommend this to anyone with unruly hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Now that I use Biosilk Silk Therapy along with my Sedu Flat Iron, my hair has never looked better. Before I used Biosilk, my hair was dried out after I straightened it. With the Biosilk, my hair is soft, shiny, and pin straight. Also, a little goes a long way. I will never straighten my hair without this product again.</li>
            <li> This product is good for taming moderate frizz, adding shine and softness to my hair. If you have thick hair, you will probably need a product with thicker consistency to tame better the frizziness. For my long, thick  and wavy hair I have used Biosilk Therapy Serum as finish conditioning in straight/sleek styling (just after drying and styling; for protecting my hair from heat, I use another product, a creamy leave-in conditioning specially for heat protection). The result is great shine and softness, and moderate frizz taming for the little hairs at the base of my forehead or neck, the ones that will escape or refuse to stay straight and sleek like the rest. As exclusive reinforcement for these hairs, I use little touchs of another serum (one produced and sold locally in my country), a heavier one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Biosilk won&#x27;t tame completely some frizz cases, it makes my hair feel soft and light, not sticky or saturated to the touch. Even with all frizziness not completely controled, I like what this product does to my hair, and don&#x27;t mind using the reinforcement of the heavier and sticky serum, for the isolated and small cases of frizziness that Biosilk won&#x27;t tame. It smells good, too. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Not the original but works just as well! Smells really nice too</li>
            <li> It is a leave in conditioner.I have fine brittle hair that is hard to comb out after I wash it. This is the best product I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy after I use it like regular conditioners. If I blow dry my hair, I can go 3 days without rewashing. It really makes for beautiful hair. I would never be able to comb out the knots after I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get to buy mine on here bc it was drastically marked down. I got this in a bundle package talk about wow my hair usually  sticks out a mile wide from frizziness I used this and wow it added shine and my hair looked normal I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Hairdresser used this and loved the way it made my hair so shiny and healthy looking. It was less expensive than had I purchased at the salon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Biosilk, a product that most women will swear buy, as it makes their hair nice and soft, flow nicely, but not greasy.  No need to read the review, just buy the product already  ;)</li>
            <li> I have always loved this stuff, and when I found it on amazon for a great price i had to  buy it. it gives you the healthy look without a the weigh down like other products.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t like to use gels, sprays or any hair product usually, because they weigh my hair down. BUT biosilk is light and not greasy at all. It&#x27;s smooth and I feel like it really controls frizz and leaves my hair soft and it smells great. A little goes a long way so the bottle can last a while. Great product!</li>
            <li> Biosilk silk thearapy serum is very popular amongst my friends / family.     It really makes your hair healthy &amp; shining.    Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man but I love this product,I use it for my hair every day,keep my hair in good condiction,and also a good smell.I got good price from this seller,so I bought 2 at a time.</li>
            <li> Bio Silk Product Line -- &#x27;SILK&#x27; is a life saver for my permed hair.  It gives softness yet helps retain curls/moisture, also gives volume and shine,  WOW what more could I ask for?  OH yes,  the price is so reasonable and a little bit goes a long way, truly the best I have found.  Totally out ranks the top name brand I had sworn by for years.  My friend introduced me to this product, she has really thick, natural curly/unruly hair unless she uses Silk. This product works wonders for everyone!                    Brenda Hasting, Tennessee</li>
            <li> It is hard to explain this product. It can be used from the top of the head to the bottom of the feet. It smells light and clean and leaves a silky feeling on the skin and a body building feel to the hair if used sparingly. I am so happy I could find it on Amazon from one of their trustworthy merchants. One more product on my growing list.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find Biosilk Serum at Amazon for a better price than Walmart. The formula is non-greasy and has a silky smooth finish. It&#x27;s a little expensive but worth every drop I applied to my hair. Also good for the skin as well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that my hair look absolutely great; I spend little time on it. This product is light and helps against &amp;#34;the freeze&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Having frizzy, thin, kinky curly hair, I am a hair product junkie!  I decided to try the Biosilk Silk Therapy Serum based on the reviews here.  I normally use the Paul Mitchell Skinny Serum, but decided to try something different.  I used the Biosilk on my wet hair and let air dry.  A little definitely goes a long way.  After using it for a week, I decided I didn&#x27;t like it at all.  It made my hair seem greasy and feel a little weighted down.  It didn&#x27;t let my hair curl but just kind of made it lay flat and look greasy. This product reminded me of the John Frieda Frizz Ease Serum...same consistency and feeling on hair.  I much prefer the Skinny Serum for  my hair type and way I style it.</li>
            <li> Biosilk is a really great product. I live in the Northeast and this product works wonders when it&#x27;s really humid. Normally my hair is pretty fizzy and all over the place when it&#x27;s hot and humid, but Biosilk really keeps it under control. And it also keeps my hair nice and soft, rather than dry and unhealthy looking.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! You only have to use a teeny tiny amount and it smooths your hair and makes it softer over time! My hair is so soft now because I&#x27;ve been using this. And it smells awesome! I bought it from Amazon because it was a lot cheaper than it was at Walmart, and it&#x27;s the same stuff! I use it on my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair too to try and tame the short little hairs in the front. She loves the smell and always wants me to use it on her. It&#x27;s awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 10 years  I would not be without it  the cost is also great  love this always use it everyday</li>
            <li> I use it as a styling gel. It keeps my hair in place while improving and repairing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Dr George Tomes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for your hair!</li>
            <li> For shoulder-length hair, a nickle-sized amount works great.  Start at the ends of your hair the way you would condition it.  Then with any leftover, finger-comb by roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO ADDITIONAL STYLING PRODUCT is necessary for blow drying.  This works great by itslef-  adds shine, controls frizz...an effective and sweet-smelling product.</li>
            <li> I can not live without this lol. This stuff lasts you a really long time and has done wonders for my frizz ball hair. I ordered this almost a year ago and I&#x27;m not even close to being halfway done with this, although it really doesn&#x27;t take much! Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Not the same quality as the Bio Silk I have purchased in the salon, but it&#x27;s adequate.</li>
            <li> i got it earlier ,and i used this product about two years  and it really make my hair better and better , i love it very much but&lt;br /&gt;the price is a little be expensive , if the next time can give me a cheaper price will be nice ..</li>
            <li> Biosilk is essential for my hair extensions and make my own hair shine healthy</li>
            <li> This makes my hair so much easier to comb out after washing. It leaves my hair silky and smells wonderful! A++++</li>
            <li> I love this product it helps maintain frizz on my curly hair I also like to put it on after blow drying my hair to prevent damage works great</li>
            <li> I love biosilk.  I have very curly, thick and somewhat frizzy hair.  I put this on wet, go to bed and wake up to silk hair with no friz.  I am able to run a large barrel curling iron right over it to smooth it out.  I have been using this product off an on for a very long time.  Biosilk never fails.</li>
            <li> I think some of the cheeper products out there are better than this.</li>
            <li> This left my hair feeling oily and smelt a little pungent</li>
            <li> I like this product, my hair loves it!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how soft it makes my hair</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this on Amazon.  The first time, I was aware after using it, that is was just a little less thick than the original Biosilk I have purchased in the stores.  But that was ok.  I just ordered and received my second bottle and this one is even more thinner and you can tell it has alcohol in it by the cooling effect that you have on your hands when you apply it to your hair.  Now, after all this, it still works, maybe not the exact same way, but it works.  I will use it.  But I think Amazon should rethink how they portray this item and come out front and say it has been diluted.  The price is what brings me back to buy it and that is all.</li>
            <li> I have used Biosilk before, and I absolutely love it! This is a great product. It really does make your hair feel soft and lightweight. It also got here sooner than it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> I have used Biosilk Silk Therapy for YEARS and this seems like it had been diluted or tampered with.  It came with a piece of tape across the top, no expiration date (which the past few bottles I have purchased at a salon did have) and is much thinner than this product is supposed to be.  Probably why it was so much cheaper than at a salon.  I guess it is a reminder that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 10 years. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered it through Amazon. I completely agree with the reviewers that gave it one star. The product you&#x27;ll be getting is watered down Biosilk! I would be totally turned off by this product had this been my first exposure. The scent is off and it reeks of alcohol, this is not Biosilk! Buy it from a reputable salon. Biosilk comes with a BluePrint \\&quot;Pull Here\\&quot; on top of the silver seal, this product does not. If you&#x27;re a long time Biosilk user, do not waste your time; if this your first time ordering, just know that you&#x27;re probably getting a copycat. You will notice it as soon as you start pouring it onto your hands. The liquid will be very runny, as the alcohol will start pouring out first-Biosilk does not do this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. This is the first time I buy it at Amazon. I was surprised when I poured it onto my hands. It&#x27;s like water!!! Never happened to me before. In all the years that I&#x27;ve been using it. I don&#x27;t understand?! Same brand, same type. Not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> I swim everyday and my hair was taking a beating from the chemicals in the water this product really helped restore my hair. Even if I didn&#x27;t swim I would use the product it gives my hair body and prevents it from being dry and brittle</li>
            <li> Ordered Biotin from salonwholesale and it was real Biotin, sealed and everything. Just a little works amazing on my hair, it really tames the frizz and my hair is not nearly as puffy. The bottle is going to last forever!</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice shine in your hair with out the greasy look if you don&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li> I heard about it so I decided to buy for my wife she said it makes hair very soft and good looking</li>
            <li> Hello ladies. I also use Biosilk and agree with a lady that said that it comes with a seal &#x27;pull here&#x27; and this one does not. I buy my at Marshalls. Ready for this? 15 oz for $19.99! not every Marshalls has it but northern NJ does have the original and cheaper!</li>
            <li> I am still trying yo figure out what it does actually!! I bought it just by looking at thr number of reviews it has got but Paul Mitchell super skinny serum does good to me! Its okey to have it but nothing great! I just use max two pumps! This is possible that my hair type is not suitable for this product!!</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED MY PRODUCT VERY FAST...2 DAYS SOONER THAN EXPECTED. THE PACKAGING WAS DAMAGED AND THE PRODUCT LEAKED OUT, SO I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED THE SELLER AND WITHIN HALF AN HOUR THEY WERE EMAILING ME TO LET ME KNOW THEY WERE SENDING ME A REPLACEMENT PRODUCT AT NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE. BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. AND BIOSILK IS AWESOME. I HAVE STRAIGHT AND THICK HAIR THAT WON&#x27;T HOLD A CURL WITHOUT A GOOD QUALITY PRODUCT. SILK THERAPY HOLDS MY CURLS ALL DAY AND KEEPS THEM LOOKING AND FEELING SILKY. CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO RECEIVE MY REPLACEMENT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> One of my bottles was open.  I lost one third of the product.</li>
            <li> Biosilk is the best serum ever!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for anyone with frizzy fly away hair. It works best on hair that is left natural. If you style your hair it is bound to mess it up. If you put it on while your hair is wet, it may take forever to dry. I find that just a dab goes a long way. You do not saturate your hair with it. You take about a teaspoon full, rub it in your hands and then run your hands through your hair. If your hair is really long or thick, do it this way, just a dab at a time until it gets how you want it. Some others have posted that it is greasy. It is not. It is &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34;. It has almost an albumen-like  slick feel to it, but it is not &amp;#34;grease&amp;#34; or anything near it. It has hydrolyzed silk in it and that is what makes it slick and smooth, not grease. If you get too much of it in one area then your hair will have a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look to it. So you have to be careful and apply it sparingly and evenly. I have super curly and frizzy fly away hair. When I apply this evenly... and I probably use a dab about three times throughout my hair, it tames the frizzes down to a nice wavy curl. LOVE this stuff! It is not sticky, greasy, or waxy. And is nothing like hair gel and stuff like that. There is nothing else out there like this stuff. Believe me, I&#x27;ve tried finding others since they stopped carrying this stuff locally, and there just isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have gotten this product many times before and loved it. This bottle seems to be watered down; either they changed/cheapened their formula or I got swindled</li>
            <li> Been using this forever!  Love it</li>
            <li> Great product and perfect price !!</li>
            <li> I use this with styling serum and volumizer.  My hair looks full and silky.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best leave-in treatment on the market and has been for many years. Even since I was a teenager my hair would grow to about 6-8in past my shoulders and start splitting all over, forcing me to cut it, and no fancy product seemed to help. Then back in 2003 I worked as a hair product consultant/salesgirl in this giant Beauty Supply store which carried more hair brands that you ever knew existed. People gasped when they would walk in. I learned a lot about hair there and got to try a huge number of products, including Biosilk Serum which I have been using since then. It prevents split ends, dentangles my fine hair without leaving it greasy or weighted down, and leaves it silky smooth and soft. People always ask me what I&#x27;m using when they touch my hair. Over the decade that I have been using this, I have occasionally tried other similar silicone-based serums, from Biolage to Chi to Paul Mitchell to KMS to RUSS and many others I can&#x27;t even remember now. And nothing, absolutely nothing comes close to Biosilk!!! I&#x27;ve ran out a few times and stopped using it and before long the hair gets dry, splitends-y, and a horrible tangled mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a trick on using it that has served me well. After washing your hair, towel dry slightly (it&#x27;s ok if its still a bit drippy even), then bend over and flip your hair over. This step is CRUCIAL because you want this ONLY on the bottom half of your hair, and nowhere near the roots. Then pour the product into your palm - abt the size of a nickel for short hair and the size of a quarter for long hair. Do not use more than 2 quarters even if you have very thick long hair, trust me. A little goes a long long long way. Once you pour out the proper amount rub your palms together to spread the product. It&#x27;s going to feel greasy and gross but fear not. Next start scrunching the tips of your hair and rubbing the stands between your palms to distribute the product. Do not put product on upper portions of your hair and nowhere near your scalp! Rub only through the lower half and especially the ends. Voila. Once your hair dries it will be silky and detangled. And what to do with those greasy palms? Just rub over your elbows or any other rough skin - it is an excellent skin moisturizer as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the bottle says you can use on dry hair I have had little success with that -- it does not spread well and it does give you a greasy feeling. I only use it when I wash my hair. DEFINITELY use before any heat tools - blow dry, curling, or flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But beware! All silicon products seal the hair cuticle so anything you apply afterwards will be much less effective, including mousse, hair spray and other styling products.d nowhere near your scalp!

            <li> my hair feels unnaturally like silk. Love this product</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is really powerful for me. I understand that others may be not as sensitive as I am about smells, example: I can&#x27;t wear perfume sometimes because it causes to me to sneeze a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are not sensitive to smells, this works okay. I think it works just as well as Paul Mitchell&#x27;s skinny serum, which I am going back to. I just like it the skinny serum better.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to clarify to those who claim to have received \\&quot;fake\\&quot; product... it&#x27;s not fake. I bought mine in an authentic Biosilk 3-piece gift set from Target. There is certainly no way that could have been fake, and yet my product is just as many others describe - mainly SUPER runny (goes all over the place unless I&#x27;m very careful). I wouldn&#x27;t really say it smells like alcohol but it doesn&#x27;t really smell too pleasant straight out of the bottle. When it&#x27;s in my hair it&#x27;s as strong as a perfume, and I&#x27;m not sure if it was originally like that. Results are okay, certainly not bad but nothing really to write home about. I think Biosilk themselves watered down this gigantic version of the product, because if they didn&#x27;t it would be way too pricey for them. Cheapskates. I have still found the thick, original formula in the smaller versions.</li>
            <li> i bought this biosilk recently. I have purchased biosilk from the beauty supply store in town MANY times. I have used the real Biosilk on my hair many many times. This time, i bought it from amazon thinking the price was good. Having this product for about a month now, i finally opened it. I dont think the fact that i had it for a month should affect the product at all. this product is like WATER. it is NOT the real biosilk, OR it is terribly watered down. In any case it is not what the REAL BIOSILK is at all. the REAL Biosilk is very thick and viscous. It is slippery and leaves a coating on your hands when poured. This product is like water. something is WRONG please learn from me and buy the real Biosilk in a store to ensure you are buying the real thing. Cant believe there are really \\&quot;fake\\&quot; hair products, but apparently you learn something new every day.</li>
            <li> This is my go to product for a shiny straight blow out, I do wish it smelled better though- kind of your grandmas perfume smell.</li>
            <li> great silky product for hair</li>
            <li> I bought this in conjunction with the CHI hairstraightening iron.  They work well together.  A little goes a long way, so use it sparingly.  The best part is that it smells really great, and I get compliments on the smell along with my hair!</li>
            <li> Its bottle is different as I expected (I think it&#x27;s redesigned one), but I knew it&#x27;s really great product for hair.  I&#x27;ve used the biosilk serum for two years, and I really like it! :)  Additionally, it&#x27;s delivered in a day!!</li>
            <li> I mix this product with A/G Fast food for hair and put it in my hair after I shower every morning.  I notice that if I go very long without my morning leave in condition routine, I stop getting complements on my hair.  When I am actively making sure that I use this product as well as the Fast Food for hair I always receive complements on how pretty my hair is.  I am no expert on hair care but I would say that the proof is in the pudding with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Have used for a year with great results, but have purchased from salon.  However, I received and the pull tab was present but lifted 75 percent off bottle and product consistency was &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;, watery and reminds me of hand sanitizer. Disappointed with purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, this is the second time that I purchase this item and I really like how wonderful my hairs shine</li>
            <li> Showed up with a loose cap, with no seal... and it leaked all over rest of package.  Next time I will buy from store/salon.  It seem similar (smell/thickness/feel) to the old bottle she had.  I&#x27;m not an expert, but I&#x27;m pretty sure the ones I bought for my wife before from a salon were sealed. For that alone, I am suspect.  For the money, I&#x27;ll avoid this in the future.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff is a great product.  It certainly keeps the hair under control.  You have to be careful not to use too much though or it mats your hair down.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel softer, but I think I was expecting more out of it. Doesnt magically make your hair shiny.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Biosilk but its pretty pricy... This was a great value (I find it much more expensive at the salon or grocery stores) Perfect for the dry Colorado days to tame staticy hair. Also always worried the product will leak but packaging made sure that this product would not leak during shipping.  :) Great buy!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair shiny, but that is about all it does.  If you aren&#x27;t careful you will end up with shiny, greasy hair!</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels good, does good.</li>
            <li> I love this product..great for skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have used biosilk for years and encourage anyone&lt;br /&gt;with dry skin issues to apply biosilk after shower then&lt;br /&gt;body lotion. Works like magic.</li>
            <li> I totally love this product. I love the way it makes my hair feel and I love how it smells. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, other than that, I would definitely recommend this product to everyone out there who has natural hair.  Love it, Love it, LOVE IT!!! This is an absolute  &amp;#34;MUST HAVE&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Works wonderful for those who blow dry their hair daily, I love it and also use the shampoo! Doesn&#x27;t wear the hair down and your hair is silky smooth, came quickly.</li>
            <li> My wife bought it for her mom and she loves how it makes her skin feel...  great buy for your mother in law...</li>
            <li> The product is described simply as \\&quot;Biosilk Silk Therapy\\&quot;. When I received it, it was the serum vs the true Biosilk leave in conditioner. Nothing in the description tells you it is a serum. Beware!</li>
            <li> I like this serum - it helps me brush through my long hair easier when wet... I was initially looking for a detangler but after my last hair appointment I noticed that my stylist use Biosilk Silk Serum and my hair was great afterwards - and decided to try it. I haven&#x27;t noticed a special improvement in my hair health but it is definitely easier to comb my hair when wet, leaving my hair silky, so it did the job.</li>
            <li> The product I received I clearly NOT Biosilk. It smells like alcohol and is extremely runny. Biosilk has a pleasant and a thicker constancy. Very disappointed in the product I received!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is a little bit more liquid-ish than the old product, but it works as well as the old ones I used before. I have tried many similar product, Silk is still my favorite..</li>
            <li> Works better than L&#x27;Oreal!</li>
            <li> I apply this on my wet or damp hair then brush my hair to distribute the product. It makes my hair really soft and silky. Makes my hair really straight after using a straightener too. Just don&#x27;t use a lot at the scalp because of oiliness.</li>
            <li> This was everything i thought I would be. Very great customer service, arrived on time. I would work with this company again.</li>
            <li> I first hesitated to order this product, because some people wrote this was not real deal;  I ordered the product and received it on time,  This is the real deal , please do not spread wrong words,  I&#x27;m fully satisfied with it and the price  is excellent as well. I strongly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> love this so much! it does the job. my hair&#x27;s type is really thick, black and not really soft. And after using this, my hair is really soft and smells really good.</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy, thickish thin hair which gets SUPER frizzy from all the bleach i have had in my hair! Biosilk is THE BEST thing I have ever used on my hair! I love it sooooo much! I would recommend this hair product to ANYONE!</li>
            <li> I had Cancer in 2010 and when my hair came back it was very Dry. I am now using Biosilk and it is soft &amp; Beautiful.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use just a little after my very curly hair dries and it takes care of my frizz without completely destroying the curl itself!</li>
            <li> I love BIOSILK!!! its expensive but you can go to any Marshalls and find the big bottle for $19.99 and it is totally worth it! If you used there shampoo and conditioner they have it there as well (the big bottles)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without Biosilk! Just a little dab of it makes my hair incredibly soft and smooth. It&#x27;s especially great for people who have permed their hair. It really gets rid of fizz and makes hair super soft. It also has a very faint pleasant smell. It isn&#x27;t too greasy either</li>
            <li> This is best hair silking product by far. I think I&#x27;ve been through 3 bottles already and still haven&#x27;t tire of it. Usually I don&#x27;t have product loyalty to any products and once I am done with one, I move on to the next. This one is an exception. And it smells awesome. Love to use it with my hair curling strips. It helps to reduce pulling hair a bit.</li>
            <li> love biosilk so soft it makes my hair! the product last for a long time..the price was great for the amount you get......</li>
            <li> Order for  lmy mom she was waiting  for them for about 1 week but she is very Sadisfade</li>
            <li> This product is bad news for your hair. I was misled by the claims on the bottle...thought it would make my hair nice and shiny and soft.....wellllll....it contains alcohol. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years and about a year ago I noticed my hair was just gettn frizzier and drier than ever. I attributed it to my age...I turned 40....thought maybe my hair was just changing. Then recently I figured it out because I could smell the alcohol. So I Googled it and sure enough it contains alcohol. Alcohol dries things out. My advice...don&#x27;t use it. Find another product that doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol. I immediately quit using it and am looking forward to my hair returning to normal!</li>
            <li> The product I received was thin like water, not at all the high quality serum I have purchased before in retail stores, by the same brand name. Not sure if this was simply a defective bottle or if the overall quality of the product has gone down, but I was definitely disappointed and wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the money.</li>
            <li> I thought this was an original product since it was bottled exactly the same as the original.  Serum has a lot of alcohol that separates from the entire concentration.  It makes my hair too sticky and too dry after I wash it off.  I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> This seemed watered down. It says shake well on the top and you really do have to shake it which I have never had to do before with the salon biosilk. It still does a decent job on my hair but I feel like I got ripped off.</li>
            <li> It was an expired product from 2011 and it was more like liquid alchol</li>
            <li> I have always loved the smell and effect of biosilk...but I also thought that it&#x27;s quite heavy, even in minute doses, and can make hair seem too oily if you use even a tad too much. I&#x27;ve used biosilk for so long though that I rarely use more than I need now since I&#x27;ve adjusted according to how my hair reacts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, a friend of mine suggested I use[[ASIN:B000NYL3NQ Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum, 5.1 Ounce]] and in one use, it won me over, even though I have been a loyal user of biosilk for 6 years or so now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who require more maintenance with their hair, biosilk might be better in that it is heavier and does work well, but for those who have hair like mine (fine and requiring every-day wash), paul mitchell is a much better alternative. It&#x27;s light, makes hair appear shiny without seeming oily, and smells fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great product is [[ASIN:B008BT2P7S Biolage Exquisite Oil Replenishing Treatment 3.1 oz.]] which can be used in multiple ways: at night, in the shower, or during styling. This is a really great serum for those who want more versatility with managing their hair. It&#x27;s also light like the paul mitchell and has a nice smell :)</li>
            <li> I like it.  I used as needed.  That all I have to say about it.  &amp;#34;It Great&amp;#34;.  It Great OK!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product ! And the shipping was fast ! Very satisfy</li>
            <li> The package arrived quickly and the item in package was in excellent condition. I was recommended this hair serum by a worker at my beauty polar.  The oil when placed on the hair after a shampoo gives the hair a beautiful shine.</li>
            <li> This is what my hairdresser uses so I thought I&#x27;d buy it myself.  Love it on my hair!</li>
            <li> I used to use the Biosilk 21 miracle leave in conditioner which I loved but amazon had none in stock so I went with the SERUM instead. I like all of Biosilk products, they make such a difference in the texture of my hair. I like the serum too, only drawback for me is that if used a bit too much, it can make your hair a tad bit greasy, I did not find that with the &amp;#34; 21 miracle leave in conditioner.&amp;#34; I could go atleast 3-4 days without washing my hair with the leave in conditioner, but with this, I can pull max of 2 days only without it starting to become oily. It does smooth out my hair after wash when I use it on towel dried hair, and I use it before I use hot tools in my hair. I definitely like but if I had a choice between this and the miracle leave in conditioner, I would go with the latter.</li>
            <li> I initially liked it but stopped using it - felt like it didn&#x27;t change my hair, only affected it when I used it. It&#x27;s also expensive. A good price on amazon though.</li>
            <li> Love this product, lightweight, leaves hair feeling silky, soft and smooth... smells good too!!</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the scent.  I know some people don&#x27;t like it, or find it&#x27;s too strong, so there&#x27;s that to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using Biosilk Silk Therapy back in the 90&#x27;s when I was in my \\&quot;bad perm\\&quot; phase.  Wow, the tangles my hair would develop... I had long, thick hair with a tight perm (some of you probably remember the 90&#x27;s).  My hairdresser at the time introduced me to Biosilk.  I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  I now have short, naturally wavy hair, and I use about a dime-sized drop.  My comb slides through the little tangles I get, and I still love the scent of it on my hair.  A 5.64 oz bottle usually lasts me a couple of years, so even though it appears to be \\&quot;expensive\\&quot;, (for me) it&#x27;s really not.</li>
            <li> This is not the same Biosilk that I have bought from local retailers. It smelled like rubbing alcohol and did not have the same thick consistency. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> i love this product it makes my hair silky &amp; smooth i use i every day. buy it u wont be sorry</li>
            <li> I am a black woman, whose hair is regularly permed and colored.  After reading the reviews, and after the incentive of a discount if I bought this product, I decided to give it a try.  It is FABULOUS!!  This weekend, I wasn&#x27;t feeling like going through all the work of setting my hair, so I washed, conditioned, put in setting lotion (for volume and curl) and added a quarter-sized amount of Biosilk and wrapped.  It worked amazingly!!!  When I un-wrapped my hair, I shook the bottle, and placed another quarter-sized amount in, rubbing thru all of my hair.  Curled with my ceramic curling iron, and was AMAZED at the results!!  My hair came out as if I had just come from a salon!  I usually use Kiehl&#x27;s creme with silk groom, but this product way surpasses the results I have gotten from that.  Tonight, my daughter, who has much silkier hair than mine, blow dryed her hair and came downstairs.  I suggested that she put the Biosilk on her hair and finish the blowdrying, and the results were phenomenal. I would recommend this product to ANYONE.  A++++    UPDATE:  After several months of using this product, my hair has grown noticeably and there is very little shedding when I wash my hair even though I use a curling iron daily (thermal), have color AND get a relaxer.</li>
            <li> This is a good item...It definitely makes your hair feel silkier when used with curling irons...The light smell is wonderful and it does not weigh your hair down like most over products.  It is a little pricey for the size though...I would recommend because it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> After trying several products on the market, I finally decided to spend the money for Biosilk. It eaves hair silky but not greasy and would highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Worth every penny. Just a few drops rubbed through leaves my hair shiny, soft and delightfully scented.</li>
            <li> I love this Product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years for my hair &amp; buying it from my Hair Dresser.  Then I found it on Amazon &amp; the cost of it was much less than what I&#x27;d been paying at the Salon for years.  The fragrance is so nice &amp; pleasant &amp; can be used on not only dry hair, but dry skin, also.  Use it sparingly bc it goes a very long way.  Start out with a dime sz in your palm &amp; go from there.</li>
            <li> It is a great product to avoid frizz.&lt;br /&gt;I use it with mousse on my curly hair and works all day long</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for years. that tells you that I&#x27;m happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;smells nice and you only need a tiny drop to spread over a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> I used to use the CHI silk infusion and swore by it in college and high school. So recently I wanted to buy a serum for my hair, especially since I am flat ironing it and adding heat. I decided to get this because I had used it previously and my hair loved it. A LITTLE goes a long way. I just use a dime size drop per section of hair (4 sections) and blow dry...then I flat iron...and add some after for a nice shine and smooth finish. I am natural with 3c/4a hair.</li>
            <li> I heard about Biosilk and got on Amazon to read the reviews. I went out the same day and bought it at Target as I was anxious to try it. I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and have hated my hair forever. It&#x27;s very fine and has a frizzy curl. I straighten it but by the end of the day it&#x27;s usually a frizzy mess especially if there&#x27;s any humidity. I bought the shampoo, conditioner and serum. I can&#x27;t believe the difference it has made in my hair! Normally I pull my hair back. The other day I woke up and went to my exercise class. I didn&#x27;t wash it and didn&#x27;t pull it back. Someone said to me that they&#x27;d never seen my hair down and that I had pretty hair. I about dropped dead:) My hair is so much easier to straighten and it&#x27;s smooth and bouncy (my hair has never been smooth and bouncy).&lt;br /&gt;I have learned that I can only use a few drops of the serum. I put a few drops in my hands and rub them together and then run my hands through my hair. If I use more my hair looks greasy. Less is definitely best is you have fine hair. People aren&#x27;t lying when they say a bottle of the serum could last for years.&lt;br /&gt;I never write reviews but I have been so amazed with the results that I thought it might help someone else.</li>
            <li> I had bought  this product  at a hair salon and the one I got here was liquidity  I remember  it being more dense</li>
            <li> I learned of this Biosilk product from my hairstylist...I went to a local department store and found a much smaller bottle with a much higher price tag. This order came within 2 days and was such a great surprise when I saw the huge bottle!  I&#x27;d definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I usually buy my Biosilk at a retail store, but decided to buy it online this time (never again). I honestly think this item is a knock off. The Biosilk I usually buy does not contain alcohol and this product does. Alcohol is the first thing that comes out when you squeeze the bottle. Worst product I have ever bought on amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> I felt like it was mixed by water, it damaged my hair, I have already had this product but this one did not have the quality that I expected</li>
            <li> Love this product on how soft my hair is afterwards and how easily I can manage my hair and how great it smells!  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot in order to receive the best results.  Just a small amount on the palm of your hand and rubbing it on your hand before transferring it onto the ends and hair follicles will do well.  Not getting it on your scalp to prevent from receiving oily hair (at least for me).  I have used it and have blown dry my hair straight to not using the blow dryer and just applying it while my hair was still damp and allowing it to dry naturally and both times my hair turned out fine.</li>
            <li> I use this as a heat protectant before I blow dry or straighten my hair. I absolutely love it. It makes my hair look shiny &amp; healthy and it makes my hair feel great throughout the day. The smell is very nice too, I feel like I just walked out of a beauty salon when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I agree with a previously written review.  I have never used the product before but I was disappointed when I tried to pour a little in my hand.  It is the 5.64 ounce and poured like water!  I won&#x27;t try to return it because of the previous reviewers experience.  I would like to try the smaller size to compare but it is not Amazon Prime and I don&#x27;t want to pay the outrageous shipping price. I think there should be a &#x27;comparison&#x27; study. If the smaller bottle has a thicker consistency, an explanation is definitely needed!</li>
            <li> I should have read the other user&#x27;s reviews.  I have used Biosilk, and this doesn&#x27;t COME from Biosilk as they are named but some shop named Brandname Health and Beauty out of Orlando.  It was opened &amp; tampered with because the foil seal had been broken and smashed into the cap.  When I finally dealt with that and went to apply, it literally rained all over me and the items I was standing next to!  THIS WAS NOT BIOSILK!  At best, tampered with.  At worst - counterfeit product!  I want a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Seller basically said &#x27;sorry about that&#x27; and they said they do check to be sure things are sealed etc before they go out ... so I guess according to them, I the customer am a liar.  They want me to spend the money to ship this back.  I&#x27;m taking it up with the credit card company and the post office as mail fraud.  I mean, come on!  I didn&#x27;t even have a scent to it!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff, as it leaves my hair looking and feeling awesome. My hair used to stick up a bit in the middle, but with this, it stays perfect and easy to manage all day long without feeling greasy or using any hardening gels or sprays.</li>
            <li> I know this product gets tons of rave reviews, and maybe this is just me, but I&#x27;m not feeling the Biosilk serum love. It does smooth hair well and it gives a nice shine, but I don&#x27;t find it does that any better than less expensive silicone serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short, fine hair that is prone to dryness. I do not straighten my hair, but I do color it every few weeks. I have found Biosilk serum works better applied to damp hair than dry, especially if you let it sit for a couple minutes on the damp hair before blow-drying it (if you do blow-dry, which I only do occasionally). That&#x27;s just my observation. I have also found this product useful for controlling frizz and fly-aways - just rub a drop or two between your palms and smooth over the ends of the hair. This serum has a pleasant, slightly sweet fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, I&#x27;d say give it a try - you may like it better than I did, but my advice if you&#x27;re on a budget is stick with a less pricey product.</li>
            <li> Love this product It makes your hair soft and manageable.  Love Love Love it. Better price on Amazon and comes to your mailbox how can you beat thatn</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.  I have used several items for when my hair gets a bit dry from using other products and nothing works as well as this does.  I have used it in a spray form as well and both are very good.  You just have to be careful how much you put on and let it dry or just follow the instructions.  It really adds a healthy shine and makes the color of my hair look really good.  I do not have to color my hair because this product adds so much health to it that my natural color looks great.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I read reviews about Amazon selling a deluted version of what you can get at a beauty store, but I thought that I would have a better experience. Well I was very wrong! the minute I opened the bottle, the smell of alcohol was overpowering. I did shake the bottle before using but it was not enough apparently. I&#x27;ve tried this oil before and it is amazing but I purchased it at a beauty store, and the smell is so pleasant so there is no way this is the same product. Im not using this crap on my hair because the alcohol will not only destroy my color, but it would probably fry my hair as well since I have thin but puffy hair. Never again! and hope you do yourself a favor and get it from a real supplier of Biosilk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok seems a little thin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again and I honestly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth $16. It does leave my hair soft but not incredibly soft as described by reviews. It smells good but I find  that the application feels almost waxy and it&#x27;s not very easy to ably on my hair. I also feel that because it&#x27;s sort of waxy it pulls off my hair more because it doesn&#x27;t go on smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I first had it applied to my hair by a hairdresser in NYC and it totally tamed my frizzy, humidity hair in the summer without making my hair feel heavy and greasy. I have been using it for 10 years in the summer and it&#x27;s an essential now in my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Have not purchased this from Amazon yet but I love this product! Smells so good and the scent stays in your hair throughout the day when used as a finishing serum. I use this after showering on damp hair and also after curling or flat ironing to smooth frizz and increase shine. I believe it has improved the look and feel of my hair</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shinny and not greasy at all. I absolutely love it... Oh and if you must know I have African American hair..</li>
            <li> I love this product for my hair!  It provides the moisture that I need for my hair without greasy build-up.  Thankfully, this seller provided it at a much more affordable price!</li>
            <li> Purchased product for wife.  She said it was a little watery than usual but ok.  I would not purchase online again.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum after trying it at my sister&#x27;s house.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried so far as it seems to be absorbed quickly by the hair and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  Use less than you estimate you&#x27;ll need, a teensy drop should be all you need.</li>
            <li> The price is much better than local Target. However, the serum comes out to be quite watery even when I shake it well before use. I&#x27;ve used it a long time ago and did not remember it being so watery...... It smells the same but wondering if its a watered down version.</li>
            <li> product as described, will order again</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I have thick wavy hair and need product to relax and flatten out.  I have used leave in conditioners, straighteners , morroccan oil, Mystic Oil, etc,  Biosilk eleimimates the frizz, relaxes the waves and my hair feels soft and not so thick.</li>
            <li> Item arrive when expected was as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using BioSilk Silk Therapy for a long time now and LOVE IT!! It leaves your hair super silky, tames frizzyness very well and smells awesome. If you haven&#x27;t tried it before, I highly recommend it!! Just remember, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Great product to tame frizzy hair and make it shinier. I try never to run out of it because it&#x27;s a real help on bad hair days, or on a day when, even when my hair looks good, I want more shine.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  I struggle to find products that stop the frizz of my curls but does not weight my hair down or make it look wet and greasy.  This product stops my frizz but doesn&#x27;t give me a greasy look.</li>
            <li> The serum was better than I expected. It was like slik, not heavy or sticky. My skin absorbed it in seconds. I love it !</li>
            <li> Have used forever, love the fragrance.  My store stopped carrying it, didn,&#x27;t feel like going from store to store looking for it.  So really appreciated the easy access.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much! My hair literally feels like silk without making my hair oily. I have thick bleached hair. A little biosilk and a blowout is all I need. No need for my straightner either.</li>
            <li> This is the &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; formula of Biosilk Therapy Serum. The other formula has more alcohol and different amounts of some of the ingredients. The other formula maybe a knock off or what is sold at a drug store not a hair salon. In any event, the product sold by Amazon.com LLC, was the right one- always read the ingredients on any beauty product so you know what you are paying for!</li>
            <li> I have been using silk therapy for quite some time now.  I have thick, somewhat frizzy, curly hair.. and a lot of it.  Tames my curls without being too sticky, greasy or heavy - just right.  My local beauty supply store discontinued it from their shelves (I suspect many are going over to argan oil products) so I came to amazon.  A little goes a very long way.  Nice product.</li>
            <li> A standby, nothing else compares to it that I&#x27;ve tried.  I have purchased this from Amazon and other retailers.  Once you get past the sticker shock at some places, you soon realize it is worth it because it last me forever.  The last bottle I bought was huge (like 12 inches high and wide) from Marshall&#x27;s for $19.99.  It has now lasted me two years and it barely has a dent in it.  Some background on my hair. I live in a very humid area and if I walk outside... my hair gets really frizzy in the summer. A drop of this (I use it year round) while wet before styling makes my hair do so much better.  It smells great and is very smoothing in my hair. LOVE it.  It looks super expensive compared to the ounces but since it lasts so long, it&#x27;s really not any more expensive than anything else. In fact less since it does last so long.  If you get it somewhere like Target or CVS, you will be paying full retail.  You can find it cheaper -- either on Amazon or elsewhere like that one I found at Marshalls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this anti-frizz serum for a long time and although I&#x27;ve tried others, I always keep coming back to this one. It&#x27;s light and effective.</li>
            <li> This Biosilk Therapy Serum is what my grandma uses for her short, fried, frizzy hair after showers or even before going out.  She cannot live without it.  Therefore, when I smell it, I think of her right away.  That&#x27;s how impressionable the scent is.  I know everyone knows about it or have used it before in their lifetime so I definitely know it&#x27;s a trusting product.  I have long, thick, coarse hair and this serum helps smooth the ends out really well.  The thing you should watch out for is using too much of it at once will make your hair greasy (or that&#x27;s what I experience).  If you are looking for an all natural product then this isn&#x27;t for you because it has silicone in it.  If you don&#x27;t mind, this is a pretty good investment!  As I said, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot so the bottle should last you quite a while!</li>
            <li> I liked it and I use it almost daily (just the tiniest little drop goes a long way)!  I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> this product was good, like store quality. i did feel that hte biosilk i ordered was a little &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; compared to the one i had from the store.</li>
            <li> The smell of the product drives me crazy. i just use a little bit and it&#x27;s already too strong. I really want to keep it but every time i put it on i felt like I just got allergy. Can&#x27;t take it so returned.</li>
            <li> While I like the way it makes my hair look, I didn&#x27;t realize how loaded with chemicals it is, so it&#x27;s sitting at the back of a draw somewhere.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Perfect on any kind of hair. This product makes your shine and keeps from getting burned when straighten or curled.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this.  She had been using it very sparingly so it would last as the only places she had found it charged a hefty price for it.  Through Amazon the price is about half of any place else she had found previously.  Now she can use it more often and anything that makes her happy makes life easier for me.</li>
            <li> this serum has too much fragrance in it and i dont particularly like how it smells.  I wish they would have a fragrance free serum.</li>
            <li> Authentic Biosilk. Not diluted or tampered with</li>
            <li> I could tell there was something wrong with this bottle before I even opened it because it was so watery.  It smells like Biosilk but is way too thin and watery.  I will be reporting this seller and returning this.  Make sure you buy from a reputable seller.  This stuff is amazing when you have the actual product.</li>
            <li> I really like e shampoo and conditioner I hope this really makes my hair stronger and longer I will use it as long as I can</li>
            <li> Just use a small bit and it makes hair soft and silky.  MUST shake well first. Do recommend  to all.</li>
            <li> I used to love Biosilk and was very happy with how it made my hair feel.  I live in Nevada and it is so dry here that you have to use something in your hair daily to counter the desert.  However, I am not certain if they changed the formula or if my hair is changing, but I do not LOVE it the way I used to.  It does not seem to work the way it used to.  Additionally, I used to be able to buy a bottle even bigger than this at Costco for about $11, then they quit selling it.  So, I am not near as enchanted as I once was.  Still, I have not found anything that compares, so I have no choice but to go with is.</li>
            <li> I have that thick, medium textured hair that tangles easily and doesn&#x27;t know if it wants to be straight or curly. I&#x27;ve used everything under the sun from expensive keratin products and moroccan oil to drug store stuff. Nothing works like this. I put it in damp hair and whether I blow it dry (which is best) or not, it keeps tangles to a minimum, but my favorite part is that my hair feels so silky and smooth without being greasy or feeling caked up with product. My hair is over halfway down my back so reducing styling time is essential.</li>
            <li> I got the 2.2oz one, which is exactly what I expected. Then I ordered the bigger 5.64 oz. It&#x27;s waterish, not like the oil in the 2.2 oz. It&#x27;s so waterish that there is no way to get \\&quot;a small amount\\&quot; in your hand! The cap is defect too, as there is always a large amount (some from side of the cap) get on my hand no matter how careful I am. I wanted to do exchange but Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow as the product is actually sold by 3rd but serviced by Amazon. The only choice is to return this one, and Amazon change 1/3 of the product price for shipping. I thought if the produce is defect, the shipping is free. This sucks! It&#x27;s the same as I just let Amazon charge me $6 for nothing.</li>
            <li> It was too greasy. But I have this hair so maybe it works best on thick hair.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time and am evry happy with it. Hair smells good and makes them soft and shiny :) delivery was on time and the packaging was great as well. :) 5 STARS FROM ME</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t ordered this from Amazon before so I don&#x27;t know yet if it&#x27;s going to be the watered down version like some reviewers said, but the last bottle I got (at a pharmacy) was wonderful and made my hair feel soft and LOOK soft, not to mention it smoothed my hair cuticles and smelled soooo nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this item, but didn&#x27;t use it right away, because i need to use up my old bottle which was purchased from Costco. Last week, when i tried to use it, i found this is a totally wrong thing inside. the correct product is dense liquid, with decent smell, but this one is like water, with strong chemical smell. i doubt this is a returned item which was returned by others with wrong stuffs inside the bottle. this is my 1st negative comments from Amazon shopping experience.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well for smoothing but don&#x27;t expect a miracle. If you have crazy undecided hair it isn&#x27;t magical. If you have well defined curly hair it&#x27;s top notch because it gives those defined curls without the feeling of having too much product in your hair. The only thing I wish I had been warned about was the smell. It smells very strong like cheap perfume and if you use too much, the smell is too much. I get the best results with keeping the smell down and getting results I want if I put it in while my hair is still damp. It&#x27;s good in a pinch though if you&#x27;re having a crazy unruly hair day. I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. The bottle leaks though so keep it upright. I will probably play around with different types of serums from this line and see if I can find a less smelly one.</li>
            <li> wonderful product!! I have been using this for years.. I have long, naturally curly hair and silk therapy makes it soft and less frizzy! great price for this product! definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered. Even recommended to family members. Ditch that baby oil! This is way better and non greasy! Great buy!</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the other negative reviews for this product. I have used biosilk for 15 years and this is not it! The bottled it watered down with alcohol. The sticker on the top of the bottle telling you to &amp;#34;shake well&amp;#34; so that you do not notice how watered down it is. I have never bought biosilk in the salon with a sticker on it telling you to &amp;#34;shake well&amp;#34; before use. So be aware you are not getting what you expect or pay for, and the alcohol will dry out your hair and make it smell bad!</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair. No matter what professional, salon-grade conditioner I buy, I still have tangles. A little dab of Silk Therapy and no worries all day - wouldn&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
            <li> This must be a problem with the seller but this is NOT the same quality of Biosilk that you would buy off the store shelves.  Someone is diluting it &amp; it is much more watery and has a thinner consistency.  The smell is right but the results are NOT the same.  Definitely NOT worth the savings.  Better to buy from a real store &amp; know you&#x27;re getting the real deal. :(</li>
            <li> Love this, use it after every wash</li>
            <li> I have used this product since I was 13...about 11 years. I have thick dirty blonde hair and it really helps to protect it from heat and keep down my frizz! Just use a dime sized amount. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I bought this on a recommendation from a good friend.  I love the way it makes my hair feel and it has calmed down the fly away dryness.  I have very thick, naturally curly hair and it is tough to find something that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it look greasy.  This was a great find and I&#x27;m happy to have something that works.</li>
