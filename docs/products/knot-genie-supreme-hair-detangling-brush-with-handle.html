            <li>Both my Granddaughters love this brush!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>and you can kind of hear an echo as it moves through your hair.  </li>
            <li>It honestly reminds me of a brush you would use on a baby doll&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>She will even try to brush her own hair with this and it doesn&#x27;t get stuck or hurt her.</li>
            <li>I had the original brush, which worked great but kept flying out of my hand.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and do not wish to pull anymore out while brushing, this is one which goes through my hair, through all the knots, even after waking up.  </li>
            <li>Really works good!</li>
            <li>This brush had good reviews, so I was excited.</li>
            <li>This is better than the Crave brush.</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased the one with the handle as well.  </li>
            <li>Hoping to find something that works better...</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>It works much better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to achieve fatter, more banana curls with this brush.  </li>
            <li>I would like a more &amp;#34;grown</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s supposed to better for her curly</li>
            <li>I have two mixed daughters works perfectly on thier curly tops.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I got the longer handle version so that it became more of a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; brush.  </li>
            <li>Plus it comes in cute colors!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Overall great buy!</li>
            <li>We have bought many de tangle brushes but this is my daughters favorite</li>
            <li>I love finding awesome buys on amazon and the reviews led me to believe this could be the next one.  </li>
            <li>When my Grandkids (ages 7 &amp;8) told me &amp;#34;Granny, those hair brushes you got us for Christmas don&#x27;t work, they hurt when we brush our hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This brush is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I would give more stars.</li>
            <li>Works better than i could have dreamed.</li>
            <li>Love this detangling brush.  </li>
            <li>this brush works pretty good if I brush her hair in layers</li>
            <li>We have the original (no handle) and this makes it easy for my daughter to brush her own hair.</li>
            <li>I have a happy 10 year old again.</li>
            <li>Works best on wet hair.</li>
            <li>In fact, she enjoys brushing her own hair with it with success.</li>
            <li>Works fine on tangles.</li>
            <li>Maybe would if she had fine hair</li>
            <li>I would imagine it would work on straight hair even better!</li>
            <li>Being a 4-year-old, I don&#x27;t know how accurate her assessment is, but she won&#x27;t let me use this brush.</li>
            <li>Cheap feeling, but</li>
            <li>We both need mousse or styling lotion to really hold the curl nicely.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important</li>
            <li>It really works and I am very happy to report back to you</li>
            <li>Its plastic, and pretty cheaply built, but I will gladly buy another when the bristles stop working or all get bent over.</li>
            <li>My girls love it, its easy to use and really helps get the tangles out.  </li>
            <li>I have original knot genie.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product before but it originally didn&#x27;t come with a handle (hence why I&#x27;m buying another knot genie).</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Works better than expected - this is great product that really works!</li>
            <li>I told her I got this special brush just for her</li>
            <li>And the pink is a great color.  </li>
            <li>works okay but did not get underneath very well</li>
            <li>a true believer once I received the product.  </li>
            <li>other than the dissapontment I experienced</li>
            <li>They quickly made me order them ones for at home.  </li>
            <li>this works on her super curly hair</li>
            <li>Love the Knot Genie, my daughter uses it on my grand baby&#x27;s hair and I got a second one to have at my house.</li>
            <li>It works best with wet hair, but is much better than others when her hair is dry</li>
            <li>Looks pretty cheap- metallic plastic.</li>
            <li>You can tell this brush is made pretty cheaply though</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t want to get it because a lot of reviews said it looked and felt cheap.  </li>
            <li>But, this is the first time we bought one with a handle!  </li>
            <li>Best brush ever no more problems getting my grand daughters hair brushed...</li>
            <li>My daughter has very fine hair, and this brush works better than any other that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>if it makes her happier, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>loves the look of it and made no hesitation to go spend the next 10 minutes in the bathroom by herself, brushing her own hair.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>but it saves me time yelling at my daughter so it is worth the money at that</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s far better then anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>The box makes it look like I spent a good 25$+ on this brush</li>
            <li>It is not 100% perfect though, I only brush it when it is wet</li>
            <li>but it is worth it to not have her screaming.</li>
            <li>The bristles are hard and feel good, like the massage your scalp has been dreaming of!  </li>
            <li>My four year old daughter has very fine, very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>She also happens to be extremely sensitive when it comes to her hair being brushed and will often resist having her hair done just to avoid brushing...leading to more tangles, leading to more of a problem.  </li>
            <li>I imagine it might work better for young children or those with thinner, straight hair.</li>
            <li>Screaming, temper tantrums, and whining have decreased 85% in the mornings thanks to this magic brush!!!!</li>
            <li>I am really surprised how easily the tangles brush out of her hair with this brush.  </li>
            <li>Both of our hair gets frizzy in humidity or when sweating and pretty tangled when we wear it out....</li>
            <li>is first amazon purchase that I did not like</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>My grandaughter lets us brush her very curly hair now!</li>
            <li>just be aware of it if you try the brush.</li>
            <li>I finally bought this and love it.  </li>
            <li>, i definitely do not feel confident this will last a year or more.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the bristles are a bit short, so you do have to brush more than with a paddle brush.  </li>
            <li>but it most definitely did not go</li>
            <li>Thanks for making eliminating the tears when we do her hair!</li>
            <li>and I did find a detangler at WF that works pretty well with this brush.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this brush but it it awesome.</li>
            <li>it goes much quicker!</li>
            <li>At least when my daughter brushes her own hair with this brush, she can tell when shes using too much pressure around her scalp and can easily adjust the pressure herself.  </li>
            <li>your child has tangly hair or you find yourself not your usual charming self, because of yelling at your child to get themselves together then this brush is for you.</li>
            <li>but today, utterly relaxed and fine with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s hollow</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for girls with very tangly hair.</li>
            <li>I used to have to fight my daughter on brushing her shoulder length hair every morning but getting her this brush has made life MUCH easier dealing with her hair routine.  </li>
            <li>Getting ready is much easier.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>but maybe that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t pull as much.</li>
            <li>Better than the wet brush.  </li>
            <li>I uploaded a pic for you guys to see how straight the hair comes out.  </li>
            <li>Bought 2 of these as Christmas gifts, paid way too much just to get the color my grandkids wanted.</li>
            <li>throughto daughters hair gently.</li>
            <li>So much easier to use, for me, and now for my daughter (who just turned 4).  </li>
            <li>My daughter has curly hair that can get very tangled and knotted.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is extremal tender headed but this brush as really helped with the ouches…..</li>
            <li>Thanks for the handle, as I have RA.</li>
            <li>Every morning she wakes up and her hair is knotty and she would run from the comb; and I am being gentle.</li>
            <li>I also started using Johnsons Shampoo and Conditioner to detangle her hair and the combination of the shampoo and the brush has really done the trick.  </li>
            <li>It works great on wet hair and brushes without pulling as much as other brushes etc.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m very surprised by it because it really works!</li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s big and fun.  </li>
            <li>It is more gentle overall, but still, you must work through tighter knots with caution, especially if you&#x27;ve got a super-sensitive kid like</li>
            <li>Sure, the novelty might wear off after some time, but this definitely is a step up from regular plastic-bristle brushes.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say this particular brush is for the thickest type of hair</li>
            <li>I love it and would get another one in the future once this one is on its last legs.</li>
            <li>The bristles are not long enough to get through my fine, but very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>My daughter was fine with a wide toothed comb but because this brush came so highly recommended from a friend who was using it on her daughters curls</li>
            <li>My daughter has mixed ethnicity (white and black) and this works great for her hair.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the handle and now my daughter can use it as well when her hair is wet.</li>
            <li>Works really well for my 2 year old.</li>
            <li>I really thought my child just made it part of the routine to fight and scream during brushing since we would do it so softly.</li>
            <li>With the two cons I would normally dock some stars but</li>
            <li>others have stated, the bristles are very sharp, so you need to use this with caution on more sensitive heads.  </li>
            <li>and they are still like new.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my own long hair and I have a lot less split ends.  </li>
            <li>If you plan to braid, you will need to wet the hair so that it lays more flat and manageable for braiding.  </li>
            <li>This brush is huge on her little head</li>
            <li>My 7 year old daughter loves this brush.</li>
            <li>The different length bristles really act as smothers as they separate the hair.  </li>
            <li>and wow this brush effortlessly removes knots without yanking my hair out.  </li>
            <li>I bought this brush with reservation, dismissing it as a gimmick, but my wife insisted and we couldn&#x27;t handle the fights from our 6 year old anymore when we try to brush</li>
            <li>My 7-year old does not like it at all.</li>
            <li>Our hair is corkscrew curly but not tight.  </li>
            <li>They do not move easily through her wet hair, and they poke her scalp when her hair is dry.</li>
            <li>Her hair is the exact same texture as mine, also of mixed race.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well on dry hair but not wet hair.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t exactly Crack up to what I expected.  </li>
            <li>My granddaughter hates to have her hair brushed or combed, except by mommy in the bath as part of the clean your little butt up</li>
            <li>It didnt pull my hair as much as my old regular brush.</li>
            <li>Wow this totally works!  </li>
            <li>It really works and takes out tangles in wet hair.  </li>
            <li>The big test, of course, is whether it will hurt my 5 yr old daughters hair/head.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used Knot Genie for years on my toddler daughter&#x27;s coarse, natural hair.  </li>
            <li>My daughter does have long thick hair, but the brush didn&#x27;t even make it through the top layer.</li>
            <li>up&amp;#34; version, but as long as it does the job, I can live with a fairy princess brush at the ripe age of 49.</li>
            <li>I bought almost every detangler and conditioner at Whole Foods, as I don&#x27;t like to use harsher chemicals on her that I find at other stores.  </li>
            <li>I mean it&#x27;s great for thin hair</li>
            <li>I have tried everything including combs, picks and brushes for my 5-year old&#x27;s curly long hair.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to find a brush to really make her hair less of a hassle.  </li>
            <li>I typically use detangler spray on her hair and then gently use this brush starting from the bottom of her hair heading towards her scalp.</li>
            <li>It works very well wet or dry and doesn&#x27;t hurt her when brushing tangles.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle on hair and very little hair is lost when I use it on my kids.  </li>
            <li>My little girl only wants me to use this one.  </li>
            <li>Occasionally there are a few tangles and knots that are hard to get out, but I would say our brushing experience is about 85-90% better than it was before I bought this brush.  </li>

            <li> I love finding awesome buys on amazon and the reviews led me to believe this could be the next one.  </li>
            <li> When my Grandkids (ages 7 &amp;8) told me &amp;#34;Granny, those hair brushes you got us for Christmas don&#x27;t work, they hurt when we brush our hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I would give more stars.</li>
            <li> Works better than i could have dreamed.</li>
            <li> Love this detangling brush.  </li>
            <li> this brush works pretty good if I brush her hair in layers</li>
            <li> We have the original (no handle) and this makes it easy for my daughter to brush her own hair.</li>
            <li> I have a happy 10 year old again.</li>
            <li> Works best on wet hair.</li>
            <li> In fact, she enjoys brushing her own hair with it with success.</li>
            <li> Works fine on tangles.</li>
            <li> Maybe would if she had fine hair</li>
            <li> I would imagine it would work on straight hair even better!</li>
            <li> Being a 4-year-old, I don&#x27;t know how accurate her assessment is, but she won&#x27;t let me use this brush.</li>
            <li> Cheap feeling, but</li>
            <li> We both need mousse or styling lotion to really hold the curl nicely.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important</li>
            <li> It really works and I am very happy to report back to you</li>
            <li> Its plastic, and pretty cheaply built, but I will gladly buy another when the bristles stop working or all get bent over.</li>
            <li> My girls love it, its easy to use and really helps get the tangles out.  </li>
            <li> I have original knot genie.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product before but it originally didn&#x27;t come with a handle (hence why I&#x27;m buying another knot genie).</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Works better than expected - this is great product that really works!</li>
            <li> I told her I got this special brush just for her</li>
            <li> And the pink is a great color.  </li>
            <li> works okay but did not get underneath very well</li>
            <li> a true believer once I received the product.  </li>
            <li> other than the dissapontment I experienced</li>
            <li> They quickly made me order them ones for at home.  </li>
            <li> this works on her super curly hair</li>
            <li> Love the Knot Genie, my daughter uses it on my grand baby&#x27;s hair and I got a second one to have at my house.</li>
            <li> It works best with wet hair, but is much better than others when her hair is dry</li>
            <li> Looks pretty cheap- metallic plastic.</li>
            <li> You can tell this brush is made pretty cheaply though</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t want to get it because a lot of reviews said it looked and felt cheap.  </li>
            <li> But, this is the first time we bought one with a handle!  </li>
            <li> Best brush ever no more problems getting my grand daughters hair brushed...</li>
            <li> My daughter has very fine hair, and this brush works better than any other that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> if it makes her happier, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> loves the look of it and made no hesitation to go spend the next 10 minutes in the bathroom by herself, brushing her own hair.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> but it saves me time yelling at my daughter so it is worth the money at that</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s far better then anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> The box makes it look like I spent a good 25$+ on this brush</li>
            <li> It is not 100% perfect though, I only brush it when it is wet</li>
            <li> but it is worth it to not have her screaming.</li>
            <li> The bristles are hard and feel good, like the massage your scalp has been dreaming of!  </li>
            <li> My four year old daughter has very fine, very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> She also happens to be extremely sensitive when it comes to her hair being brushed and will often resist having her hair done just to avoid brushing...leading to more tangles, leading to more of a problem.  </li>
            <li> I imagine it might work better for young children or those with thinner, straight hair.</li>
            <li> Screaming, temper tantrums, and whining have decreased 85% in the mornings thanks to this magic brush!!!!</li>
            <li> I am really surprised how easily the tangles brush out of her hair with this brush.  </li>
            <li> Both of our hair gets frizzy in humidity or when sweating and pretty tangled when we wear it out....</li>
            <li> is first amazon purchase that I did not like</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> My grandaughter lets us brush her very curly hair now!</li>
            <li> just be aware of it if you try the brush.</li>
            <li> I finally bought this and love it.  </li>
            <li> , i definitely do not feel confident this will last a year or more.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the bristles are a bit short, so you do have to brush more than with a paddle brush.  </li>
            <li> but it most definitely did not go</li>
            <li> Thanks for making eliminating the tears when we do her hair!</li>
            <li> and I did find a detangler at WF that works pretty well with this brush.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this brush but it it awesome.</li>
            <li> it goes much quicker!</li>
            <li> At least when my daughter brushes her own hair with this brush, she can tell when shes using too much pressure around her scalp and can easily adjust the pressure herself.  </li>
            <li> your child has tangly hair or you find yourself not your usual charming self, because of yelling at your child to get themselves together then this brush is for you.</li>
            <li> but today, utterly relaxed and fine with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s hollow</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for girls with very tangly hair.</li>
            <li> I used to have to fight my daughter on brushing her shoulder length hair every morning but getting her this brush has made life MUCH easier dealing with her hair routine.  </li>
            <li> Getting ready is much easier.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> but maybe that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t pull as much.</li>
            <li> Better than the wet brush.  </li>
            <li> I uploaded a pic for you guys to see how straight the hair comes out.  </li>
            <li> Bought 2 of these as Christmas gifts, paid way too much just to get the color my grandkids wanted.</li>
            <li> throughto daughters hair gently.</li>
            <li> So much easier to use, for me, and now for my daughter (who just turned 4).  </li>
            <li> My daughter has curly hair that can get very tangled and knotted.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is extremal tender headed but this brush as really helped with the ouches…..</li>
            <li> Thanks for the handle, as I have RA.</li>
            <li> Every morning she wakes up and her hair is knotty and she would run from the comb; and I am being gentle.</li>
            <li> I also started using Johnsons Shampoo and Conditioner to detangle her hair and the combination of the shampoo and the brush has really done the trick.  </li>
            <li> It works great on wet hair and brushes without pulling as much as other brushes etc.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m very surprised by it because it really works!</li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s big and fun.  </li>
            <li> It is more gentle overall, but still, you must work through tighter knots with caution, especially if you&#x27;ve got a super-sensitive kid like</li>
            <li> Sure, the novelty might wear off after some time, but this definitely is a step up from regular plastic-bristle brushes.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this particular brush is for the thickest type of hair</li>
            <li> I love it and would get another one in the future once this one is on its last legs.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not long enough to get through my fine, but very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> My daughter was fine with a wide toothed comb but because this brush came so highly recommended from a friend who was using it on her daughters curls</li>
            <li> My daughter has mixed ethnicity (white and black) and this works great for her hair.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the handle and now my daughter can use it as well when her hair is wet.</li>
            <li> Works really well for my 2 year old.</li>
            <li> I really thought my child just made it part of the routine to fight and scream during brushing since we would do it so softly.</li>
            <li> With the two cons I would normally dock some stars but</li>
            <li> others have stated, the bristles are very sharp, so you need to use this with caution on more sensitive heads.  </li>
            <li> and they are still like new.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my own long hair and I have a lot less split ends.  </li>
            <li> If you plan to braid, you will need to wet the hair so that it lays more flat and manageable for braiding.  </li>
            <li> This brush is huge on her little head</li>
            <li> My 7 year old daughter loves this brush.</li>
            <li> The different length bristles really act as smothers as they separate the hair.  </li>
            <li> and wow this brush effortlessly removes knots without yanking my hair out.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush with reservation, dismissing it as a gimmick, but my wife insisted and we couldn&#x27;t handle the fights from our 6 year old anymore when we try to brush</li>
            <li> My 7-year old does not like it at all.</li>
            <li> Our hair is corkscrew curly but not tight.  </li>
            <li> They do not move easily through her wet hair, and they poke her scalp when her hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Her hair is the exact same texture as mine, also of mixed race.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well on dry hair but not wet hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t exactly Crack up to what I expected.  </li>
            <li> My granddaughter hates to have her hair brushed or combed, except by mommy in the bath as part of the clean your little butt up</li>
            <li> It didnt pull my hair as much as my old regular brush.</li>
            <li> Wow this totally works!  </li>
            <li> It really works and takes out tangles in wet hair.  </li>
            <li> The big test, of course, is whether it will hurt my 5 yr old daughters hair/head.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used Knot Genie for years on my toddler daughter&#x27;s coarse, natural hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter does have long thick hair, but the brush didn&#x27;t even make it through the top layer.</li>
            <li> up&amp;#34; version, but as long as it does the job, I can live with a fairy princess brush at the ripe age of 49.</li>
            <li> I bought almost every detangler and conditioner at Whole Foods, as I don&#x27;t like to use harsher chemicals on her that I find at other stores.  </li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s great for thin hair</li>
            <li> I have tried everything including combs, picks and brushes for my 5-year old&#x27;s curly long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to find a brush to really make her hair less of a hassle.  </li>
            <li> I typically use detangler spray on her hair and then gently use this brush starting from the bottom of her hair heading towards her scalp.</li>
            <li> It works very well wet or dry and doesn&#x27;t hurt her when brushing tangles.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle on hair and very little hair is lost when I use it on my kids.  </li>
            <li> My little girl only wants me to use this one.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally there are a few tangles and knots that are hard to get out, but I would say our brushing experience is about 85-90% better than it was before I bought this brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I finally broken down and ordered this brush.  </li>
            <li> She sat there, allowed me to completely brush out every little bit of her hair and then afterwards, got up and went about her business as though not a thing happened.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The two four year olds when I go to brush their long hair say knot genie Nana.</li>
            <li> she uses it on my granddaughter who has long hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We would recommend this to anyone that has to brush long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I think this works for knots, but I&#x27;m not sure if it breaks the hair or not-the breaks could be coming from the new ponytails....</li>
            <li> The only thing I would keep in mind is that over time the little bristles will bend, but they still do the job.  </li>
            <li> It has been quite a challenge brushing my little ones hair prior to owning this brush.</li>
            <li> I start at the bottom and work my way up just like the wide toothed comb.  </li>
            <li> I have even used this while her hair is soaking wet in the shower to brush conditioner through.</li>
            <li> Attached is a picture of the type of hair my daughter has so maybe that will be helpful to someone curious about hair texture.</li>
            <li> I have 5 wet brushes and pray.  </li>
            <li> adn all the wet prushes.  </li>
            <li> I really do not feel that this product wprks as it claims.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick curly hair and it did help out but not as much as I thought it would, there is less crying</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first....</li>
            <li> I have also used it on my other daughter and son and even myself.  </li>
            <li> Bristles may be too soft to go through very thick hair.</li>
            <li> esp down by our necks.  </li>
            <li> Was recommended this for my child&#x27;s tangly hair, but it doesn&#x27;t work well on slightly curly hair and still causes tears.  </li>
            <li> I count 8 bristles that are bent, making me feel even less enthused after opening the box.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I have really long hard</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> It is no better than any other brush that I have used.</li>
            <li> If your little one has tangles and it is troublesome to brush their hair</li>
            <li> It is a little pricy</li>
            <li> You just have to be careful not to brush to hard on little ones scalps.  </li>
            <li> but she thinks they do, which has ended the crying and fighting over hair brushing.</li>
            <li> My daughter says this brush hurts worse than her regular brushes.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Paint is coming off it now, but its used heavily.</li>
            <li> everyday is easier.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 in case we misplaced one.</li>
            <li> The bristles are sharp and hard and they scratch my daughter&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> I have tried other detangling brushes, and this one pulls the least.</li>
            <li> Have ordered another one for my small niece.</li>
            <li> I got a green one for me!  </li>
            <li> No more tears</li>
            <li> No more crying!</li>
            <li> but you have to not press to hard.  </li>
            <li> Well, yes it is not a nice looking brush</li>
            <li> I was so excited to order this brush for my daughter but was very disappointed at the performance of this brush.</li>
            <li> those who like doing braids and styling the hair, this brush will make the hair, or at least my daughter&#x27;s thick hair, &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34;, if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li> Still pulls her hair which is thick and wavy.</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is to thick for this brush.  </li>
            <li> My daughter says she doesn&#x27;t know how they lived without it - no more tears!  </li>
            <li> No more knots!</li>
            <li> Definitely not a good use of my money.</li>
            <li> but it does not go all the way through her thick mass of hair!</li>
            <li> She has thick curly hair and it brushes through with no tears!</li>
            <li> but she has very thick hair.</li>
            <li> My four-year-old has very thick care</li>
            <li> A little awkward to hold</li>
            <li> Plastic, poorly constructed Did not take it, returned it immediately without trying it out</li>
            <li> , I can now brush my daughters hair without having the poor thing suffer.  </li>
            <li> My three year old hated this brush.  </li>
            <li> Worked on my sister in laws hair (thin hair)</li>
            <li> Not what I expected:(.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was a bit expensive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not doing its job, at least for us... :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this brush.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Combing my granddaughters hair was always horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I now us this for my daughter and my hair. This is better than the Crave brush. I will definitely buy again..</li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t work as well as the one without the handle. My daughter won&#x27;t wven use it. 👎</li>
            <li> My 7 year old daughter loves this brush. I don&#x27;tout know if  knots actually come outthesier with the brush versus a standard brush but she thinks they do, which has ended the crying and fighting over hair brushing.</li>
            <li> My little girl only wants me to use this one.  Cheap feeling, but if it makes her happier, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for granddaughter - it works!  My daughter says she doesn&#x27;t know how they lived without it - no more tears!  Yay!!</li>
            <li> Works fine on tangles. A little awkward to hold but I am getting used to it. My daughter loves that it looks like a wand.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to order this brush for my daughter but was very disappointed at the performance of this brush. Nothing has changed, she still cries, screams, and the brush still catches on the knots of her hair. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> works okay but did not get underneath very well</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and do not wish to pull anymore out while brushing, this is one which goes through my hair, through all the knots, even after waking up.  It does not scratch my head but you have to not press to hard.  So glad I purchased the one with the handle as well.  Have ordered another one for my small niece.</li>
            <li> Was recommended this for my child&#x27;s tangly hair, but it doesn&#x27;t work well on slightly curly hair and still causes tears.  Hoping to find something that works better...Looks pretty cheap- metallic plastic.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected:(. The brush bristols bent/broke while I was brushing my daughters hair</li>
            <li> this brush works surprisingly well!</li>
            <li> Okay. Bristles may be too soft to go through very thick hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing!  My daughter has long curly hair.  She is of mixed race.  Her hair is the exact same texture as mine, also of mixed race.  Our hair is corkscrew curly but not tight.  We both need mousse or styling lotion to really hold the curl nicely.  Both of our hair gets frizzy in humidity or when sweating and pretty tangled when we wear it out....especially in summer.  So, to the rescue comes this gem of a brush!  My daughter was fine with a wide toothed comb but because this brush came so highly recommended from a friend who was using it on her daughters curls I purchased it.  It&#x27;s simply amazing!  First of all, it&#x27;s big and fun.  Makes brushing your hair seem like a magnificent event instead of a chore.  I love that it&#x27;s hollow and you can kind of hear an echo as it moves through your hair.  The bristles are hard and feel good, like the massage your scalp has been dreaming of!  You just have to be careful not to brush to hard on little ones scalps.  My daughter is 6 and loves how this thing massages her head.  I start at the bottom and work my way up just like the wide toothed comb.  It works much better.  The different length bristles really act as smothers as they separate the hair.  I&#x27;m able to achieve fatter, more banana curls with this brush.  I liked it so much I got a green one for me!  So if that&#x27;s not a ringing endorsement I don&#x27;t know what is.  I love my Genie brush and so does my daughter!  We&#x27;ve had them about 4 months and they are still like new.  Some of the bristles do bend a bit but they are somewhat flexable and it has made no difference in performance.</li>
            <li> Plastic, poorly constructed Did not take it, returned it immediately without trying it out&lt;br /&gt;This is first amazon purchase that I did not like</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  Bought this for my daughter and it does not work as promised.  Maybe would if she had fine hair but she has very thick hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter says this brush hurts worse than her regular brushes.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!! Great quality! Like the pic.</li>
            <li> So here is something to consider. My granddaughter hates to have her hair brushed or combed, except by mommy in the bath as part of the clean your little butt up ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I bought this brush and used it today. She sat there, allowed me to completely brush out every little bit of her hair and then afterwards, got up and went about her business as though not a thing happened. For her, this is quite unusual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has SPD and she doesn&#x27;t care to have people screwing around with her hair and will occasionally even shake off my hand on her head but today, utterly relaxed and fine with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Impressive!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this brush for any one with tangly hair.</li>
            <li> My girls love it, its easy to use and really helps get the tangles out.  Paint is coming off it now, but its used heavily.</li>
            <li> My kid says this brush hurts. She finally settled on a brush she bought at a local store. Being a 4-year-old, I don&#x27;t know how accurate her assessment is, but she won&#x27;t let me use this brush.</li>
            <li> It feels like a doll brush</li>
            <li> Go figure, it actually does what it says it does. I would like a more &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34; version, but as long as it does the job, I can live with a fairy princess brush at the ripe age of 49.</li>
            <li> great product great value</li>
            <li> I have original knot genie.  I bought it to use on granddaughters.  They quickly made me order them ones for at home.  The two four year olds when I go to brush their long hair say knot genie Nana. I use it on my own long hair and I have a lot less split ends.  The only cons is don&#x27;t use it with your blow dryer you will melt the bristles.  Looking forward to having the knot genie with a handle.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this brush. she uses it on my granddaughter who has long hair. she has another brand she likes but prefers this one with the handle.</li>
            <li> My four-year-old has very thick care this brush works pretty good if I brush her hair in layers but it does not go all the way through her thick mass of hair!</li>
            <li> My four year old daughter has very fine, very curly hair.  She also happens to be extremely sensitive when it comes to her hair being brushed and will often resist having her hair done just to avoid brushing...leading to more tangles, leading to more of a problem.  I told her I got this special brush just for her and it&#x27;s supposed to better for her curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves the look of it and made no hesitation to go spend the next 10 minutes in the bathroom by herself, brushing her own hair.  Sure, the novelty might wear off after some time, but this definitely is a step up from regular plastic-bristle brushes.  It is more gentle overall, but still, you must work through tighter knots with caution, especially if you&#x27;ve got a super-sensitive kid like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have stated, the bristles are very sharp, so you need to use this with caution on more sensitive heads.  At least when my daughter brushes her own hair with this brush, she can tell when shes using too much pressure around her scalp and can easily adjust the pressure herself.  I could never get her to brush her hair by herself with a regular brush, so this is helpful for me for her to improve the state of her hair before I jump in and finish brushing or styling it.</li>
            <li> I have two mixed daughters works perfectly on thier curly tops.I&#x27;ve tried everything nothing worked until now..everyday is easier. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this brush.  The bristles are not long enough to get through my fine, but very curly hair.  I imagine it might work better for young children or those with thinner, straight hair.</li>
            <li> My grandaughter lets us brush her very curly hair now!</li>
            <li> I think this works for knots, but I&#x27;m not sure if it breaks the hair or not-the breaks could be coming from the new ponytails....just be aware of it if you try the brush.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected - this is great product that really works! I have a happy 10 year old again.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Really works good!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It didnt pull my hair as much as my old regular brush. Worth the money. I recommend this for girls with very tangly hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter now likes brushing her hair.  I used to have to fight my daughter on brushing her shoulder length hair every morning but getting her this brush has made life MUCH easier dealing with her hair routine.  I got the longer handle version so that it became more of a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; brush.  I thought it was a bit expensive but it saves me time yelling at my daughter so it is worth the money at that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who like doing braids and styling the hair, this brush will make the hair, or at least my daughter&#x27;s thick hair, &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34;, if that makes sense.  If you plan to braid, you will need to wet the hair so that it lays more flat and manageable for braiding.  It is not an issue since we do not braid, but it is something I noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your child has tangly hair or you find yourself not your usual charming self, because of yelling at your child to get themselves together then this brush is for you.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter HATES to have her hair brushed . I bought 2 in case we misplaced one. The tangles are easier to manage. Getting ready is much easier.</li>
            <li> My daughter has mixed ethnicity (white and black) and this works great for her hair. I bought this product before but it originally didn&#x27;t come with a handle (hence why I&#x27;m buying another knot genie). I really enjoy the handle and now my daughter can use it as well when her hair is wet. I typically use detangler spray on her hair and then gently use this brush starting from the bottom of her hair heading towards her scalp. Works like a charm. I have even used this while her hair is soaking wet in the shower to brush conditioner through. It&#x27;s the best brush I have found for her hair type! Plus it comes in cute colors!&lt;br /&gt;If this works on her super curly hair I would imagine it would work on straight hair even better! I&#x27;ve used it on my hair and it works great. Attached is a picture of the type of hair my daughter has so maybe that will be helpful to someone curious about hair texture.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has long, thick hair.  My daughter said she gets knots in it so I bought this Knot Genie with handle brush.  Her husband combs my granddaughters hair now and he loves the brush because of the handle.  No more knots!</li>
            <li> Love the Knot Genie, my daughter uses it on my grand baby&#x27;s hair and I got a second one to have at my house.</li>
            <li> I love this knot genie with the handle! We have the original (no handle) and this makes it easy for my daughter to brush her own hair. She has thick curly hair and it brushes through with no tears!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny! No more tears</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first....a true believer once I received the product.  For any parent that agonizes over brushing your daughters hair while she screams and cries.....you MUST buy this product.  It really works and I am very happy to report back to you, I can now brush my daughters hair without having the poor thing suffer.  She actually looks forward to brushing her hair now.  BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!</li>
            <li> Works really well for my 2 year old. We went from her screaming as soon as she saw a hairbrush to not even fighting or reacting at all. I told her it was Rapunzel&#x27;s brush and we were just borrowing it.</li>
            <li> This brush had good reviews, so I was excited. However, it did not perform as described. The bristles are sharp and hard and they scratch my daughter&#x27;s head. They do not move easily through her wet hair, and they poke her scalp when her hair is dry. It is no better than any other brush that I have used.</li>
            <li> It really works.  I have tried everything including combs, picks and brushes for my 5-year old&#x27;s curly long hair.  I finally bought this and love it.  It works very well wet or dry and doesn&#x27;t hurt her when brushing tangles.  The Knot Genie saved us from having to cut my daughters beautiful hair.  I have also used it on my other daughter and son and even myself.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> Wow this totally works!  I&#x27;m a 3a-b curly head and wow this brush effortlessly removes knots without yanking my hair out.  It&#x27;s everything advertised.</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly hair. This has its moment when it will pull her hair but it&#x27;s far better then anything else I&#x27;ve tried. This brush is huge on her little head but maybe that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t pull as much. Overall great buy!</li>
            <li> It honestly reminds me of a brush you would use on a baby doll&#x27;s hair. My daughter is now using it for her American girl doll since I didn&#x27;t want to return it. Definitely not a good use of my money. My daughter does have long thick hair, but the brush didn&#x27;t even make it through the top layer.</li>
            <li> Awesome hairbrush ! Tangles detangled in minutes without pulling out hair. Works best on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Better than the wet brush.  My daughter and I have really long hard and it&#x27;s curly and we get knots all the time.  esp down by our necks.  I have 5 wet brushes and pray.  Well this got rid of the pray adn all the wet prushes.  I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> The brush does what it says.  The only thing I would keep in mind is that over time the little bristles will bend, but they still do the job.  I wouldn&#x27;t say this particular brush is for the thickest type of hair but it works well for my kids.  It is very gentle on hair and very little hair is lost when I use it on my kids.  I love it and would get another one in the future once this one is on its last legs.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well on dry hair but not wet hair. Still pulls her hair which is thick and wavy.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush with reservation, dismissing it as a gimmick, but my wife insisted and we couldn&#x27;t handle the fights from our 6 year old anymore when we try to brush/comb her hair. I really thought my child just made it part of the routine to fight and scream during brushing since we would do it so softly. I have to say, I&#x27;m very surprised by it because it really works! Its still a struggle sometimes to brush her hair but it&#x27;s nothing like before. In fact, she enjoys brushing her own hair with it with success. Its plastic, and pretty cheaply built, but I will gladly buy another when the bristles stop working or all get bent over. Worth it.</li>
            <li> It really works and takes out tangles in wet hair.  The handle makes it easier to use.</li>
            <li> It works and delivered as stTed</li>
            <li> We have bought many de tangle brushes but this is my daughters favorite</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick curly hair and it did help out but not as much as I thought it would, there is less crying but I feel it doesn&#x27;t do as well as stated.</li>
            <li> Works great. My daughter has very fine hair, and this brush works better than any other that I&#x27;ve tried. It works best with wet hair, but is much better than others when her hair is dry</li>
            <li> The box makes it look like I spent a good 25$+ on this brush so that&#x27;s a good start.  I love finding awesome buys on amazon and the reviews led me to believe this could be the next one.  For the money this was a great buy.  You can tell this brush is made pretty cheaply though, i definitely do not feel confident this will last a year or more.  I count 8 bristles that are bent, making me feel even less enthused after opening the box.  The big test, of course, is whether it will hurt my 5 yr old daughters hair/head.  I&#x27;m happy to say it does not hurt her one bit!  Asking my daughter to brush her hair was always a nightmare for her.  It&#x27;s important so I searched for a solution.  Here it is guys.  I uploaded a pic for you guys to see how straight the hair comes out.  I asked 1000 times &amp;#34;Does it hurt your hair&amp;#34;  and she would respond &amp;#34;Not one bit, I don&#x27;t feel anything&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m happy.  I noticed the bristles are a bit short, so you do have to brush more than with a paddle brush.  I do think that&#x27;s one of the reasons this doesn&#x27;t hurt their hair though, so no foul if that&#x27;s the case.  With the two cons I would normally dock some stars but when you factor pricing in, there&#x27;s no denying this is a 5 star product.  Buy it now!</li>
            <li> Bought 2 of these as Christmas gifts, paid way too much just to get the color my grandkids wanted. When my Grandkids (ages 7 &amp;8) told me &amp;#34;Granny, those hair brushes you got us for Christmas don&#x27;t work, they hurt when we brush our hair&amp;#34;. I guess that says it all!!</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic! I wish I would have known about it sooner! Screaming, temper tantrums, and whining have decreased 85% in the mornings thanks to this magic brush!!!! Works great! My daughter has wavy hair which is constantly in knots! This brush is a life saver!</li>
            <li> My three year old hated this brush.  It seems to MAKE tangles instead of remove them.  I sent it back.  I&#x27;ll be sticking with the regular Goody brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not doing its job, at least for us... :(</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t exactly Crack up to what I expected.  I mean it&#x27;s great for thin hair but it most definitely did not go throughto daughters hair gently. I have yet to find a brush to really make her hair less of a hassle.  Worked on my sister in laws hair (thin hair) other than the dissapontment I experienced I would give more stars.</li>
            <li> Pro:  this was the only brush that would help brushing our daughters tangled hair.  The brush actually stopped the daily fight and tears for her hair brushing. Works well, on tangles and knots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:  We didn&#x27;t gave the brush earlier, even last year,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We would recommend this to anyone that has to brush long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, for us this brush was a great thing.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used Knot Genie for years on my toddler daughter&#x27;s coarse, natural hair.  But, this is the first time we bought one with a handle!  So much easier to use, for me, and now for my daughter (who just turned 4).  Thanks for making eliminating the tears when we do her hair!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves it.  Now she can comb her hair without hurting her scalp.</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly hair that can get very tangled and knotted.  I used to dread brushing her hair but this brush has truly worked miracles! I bought almost every detangler and conditioner at Whole Foods, as I don&#x27;t like to use harsher chemicals on her that I find at other stores.  None of these items worked.  I&#x27;m glad I finally broken down and ordered this brush.  At first I didn&#x27;t want to get it because a lot of reviews said it looked and felt cheap.  Well, yes it is not a nice looking brush and it does feel flimsy but it works! I am really surprised how easily the tangles brush out of her hair with this brush.  It is not 100% perfect though, I only brush it when it is wet and I did find a detangler at WF that works pretty well with this brush.  Occasionally there are a few tangles and knots that are hard to get out, but I would say our brushing experience is about 85-90% better than it was before I bought this brush.  It is not that pricey, so I would definitely give it a try!</li>
            <li> Great brush. I had the original brush, which worked great but kept flying out of my hand. This solved that problem.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever no more problems getting my grand daughters hair brushed...I also use it...Thank you</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this brush but it it awesome. My daughter is extremal tender headed but this brush as really helped with the ouches…..</li>
            <li> Amazing. Works better than i could have dreamed.</li>
            <li> Both my Granddaughters love this brush!</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is to thick for this brush.  It bends the bristles.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work good. i looked for hair brush and no tears, but this brush doesnt help</li>
            <li> It works! Combing my granddaughters hair was always horrible. She screamed from me trying to get out the knots. No more crying! She sits still and it doesn&#x27;t hurt and it goes much quicker! Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this detangling brush.  It works great on wet hair and brushes without pulling as much as other brushes etc.  My daughter won&#x27;t use anything else.  And the pink is a great color.  I have tried other detangling brushes, and this one pulls the least.</li>
            <li> Best brushes ever! Thanks for the handle, as I have RA.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift but the person I gave it to says it works great!</li>
            <li> I really do not feel that this product wprks as it claims. My 7-year old does not like it at all.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Everything it claims to be.</li>
            <li> Value? Yes. Saved me hours of hearing my daughter complain w/ mommy was brushing her hair. Win!!!</li>
            <li> Knot Genie works well</li>
            <li> It has been quite a challenge brushing my little ones hair prior to owning this brush. Every morning she wakes up and her hair is knotty and she would run from the comb; and I am being gentle. Now that we purchased this brush she doesn&#x27;t mind getting her hair brushed. She will even try to brush her own hair with this and it doesn&#x27;t get stuck or hurt her. I also started using Johnsons Shampoo and Conditioner to detangle her hair and the combination of the shampoo and the brush has really done the trick.  If your little one has tangles and it is troublesome to brush their hair I would highly recommend this brush. It is a little pricy but it is worth it to not have her screaming.</li>
