            <li>Best.</li>
            <li>Say yes to Carrots for an amazing product!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>A good product which I have since reordered.</li>
            <li>Please, do not buy YES to carrots from these seller if you want to get a good quality of YES to carrots.</li>
            <li>He loved that it calmed his flaky, flare-up patches by his eyebrows and soothed his skin after shaving.</li>
            <li>The thing is, I don&#x27;t feel that it is an exceptional moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>(this is my very favorite of all their products).</li>
            <li>I just love this product!</li>
            <li>The Yes to Carrots night cream is amazing</li>
            <li>I started using this cream at the beginning of winter, and I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>I still think this product is great and worth 5 stars for what it does without a waxy feeling.</li>
            <li>it is super moisturizing, smells great and the packaging makes it easy to use all of this product.</li>
            <li>My best friend recommended this product after I asked her why she looked so much different after not seeing her for a month.    </li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to some co-workers and was able to tell within 3-4 days when they started using this product without even asking.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>so I was over the top thankful that I found it on amazon.</li>
            <li>would buy this again but still searching for something better.</li>
            <li>I literally lather it on, and my skin immediately looks and feels better.  </li>
            <li>The makeup removing cleanser from this line is an all-time favorite of mine, too, and they don&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this cream in a clearance sale and when it was almost gone, I couldn&#x27;t wait up get another!</li>
            <li>He has problems with ingrown hairs as well and applying a hot towel to his face before applying the cream at night makes his skin feel so smooth and nice.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use too much, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I love using the day cream right after washing my face in the morning.</li>
            <li>It does a good job but for something made for dry skin I would have thought it would do a better job.  </li>
            <li>I received \\&quot;Yes to Carrots Nourishing, Rich Moisture Day</li>
            <li>Very Sun damaged skin on one of my co-workers was immediately better.</li>
            <li>It spreads on easy and is one of the fastest absorbing lotions/creams I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>Luckily, I did some googling since I wondered if there would be an extended life -- the Yes</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I am over 40 and do not like very many facial products on the market.</li>
            <li>I can only find it on amazon, but with free shipping, I don&#x27;t care:)</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews but feel I should warn everybody about this product.  </li>
            <li>Hence, rather than pumping out fresh product every morning, I have to stick my fingers in a jar and risk contamination.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it offensive or even that strong, and I have  a sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li>If you wanted to try one of the products first, the night cream is the one.</li>
            <li>, I realize that my skin definitely needed more moisture.</li>
            <li>First, the cream arrived not as pictured.</li>
            <li>For the first time, I purchased this product online and regret the purchase.</li>
            <li>It also smelled funny.</li>
            <li>I also use the Yes to Carrots facial exfoliating cream, Yes to Carrots Day time facial cream, and Yes to Carrots eye cream (also one of my very favorite products).</li>
            <li>and my face still felt smooth and not dry from just the cleanser.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;I found a cream that works better for MY dry winter skin, Lancome&#x27;s Nutrix Royale, which helps my skin regenerate fully by increasing lipid productivity.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves them as well.     </li>
            <li>Very helpful customer service.</li>
            <li>These Night cream and the Day cream are very thick, but this is misleading, because they soak very nicely into my skin.</li>
            <li>That being said, I go through this stuff pretty quickly (takes me about 2-2.5 months, with almost daily use).</li>
            <li>is really nice, I have been using it for a few weeks, and I wil be ordering it again!</li>
            <li>(Keep in mind, your skin absorbs any moisturizer best when it&#x27;s still \\&quot;damp\\&quot; from a wash, so I usually pat dry and let my face dry a little more and just apply right after.</li>
            <li>They eye cream has made the skin around my eyes more even-toned and less puffy</li>
            <li>This is literally the only facial moisturizer I have been able to find that works with my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin and my face sweats and turns red very easily.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Today I am now using the body lotion and so far I am just as pleased as with all of the other products.    </li>
            <li>It leaves &#x27;mature&#x27; skin looking very dewey.  </li>
            <li>If you have Oily skin, they have Yes to Tomatoes, and for normal skin, they have Yes to Cucumbers.    </li>
            <li>Other creams may calm my skin and make my skin feel a lot less tight after washing, but Nutrix Royale is the best for me, personally.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would provide more all day moisturizing for my very dry skin, but it really only lasts a couple hours</li>
            <li>The exfoliation facial cleanser is very gentle.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, sometimes oily skin</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s completely gone.</li>
            <li>My skin stays soft for hours.  </li>
            <li>Second, my face turned red and I had a burning sensation right after application.</li>
            <li>The product arrived in different packaging, which I normally wouldn&#x27;t care about, except it was also expired.</li>
            <li>Product is fine, packaging is not honest.</li>
            <li>I used it enough times before noticing the expiration date, so it was a little late to send it back, and I&#x27;m sure it still moisturizes relatively adequately.</li>
            <li>It was previously opened, re-wrapped to be sent to me and most probably stored in poor conditions that caused oxidation (demonstrated by the dark brown-ish color on the top of the cream).</li>
            <li>but it took me forever to realize that my skin was only oily because I was irritating my sensitive skin (by overwashing) and causing it to produce more oil than necessary to compensate.</li>
            <li>On the Amazon website the cream is advertised as \\&quot;Yes To Carrots Moisturizing Day Cream, Dry to Sensitive Skin\\&quot; in a pump style bottle.  </li>
            <li>&quot; no mention if it is formulated for dry or sensitive</li>
            <li>My skin is naturally dry and sensitive, so I order the day cream in multiples.  </li>
            <li>My fine lines are less noticeable already after just a few days and my skin feels younger and tighter.</li>

            <li> I have never considered myself to have sensitive skin and have never had problems with any other face cream.  </li>

            <li> I have ordered Yes To Carrots moisturizer in the past and am a big fan of the product but this seller sent a knock off product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not European date formatting as another reviewer suggested hers was; the largest number is a 10, meaning this expired at least 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer itself was brown (not white, like usual) and dried up.</li>
            <li> (dark rings are less noticeable even though this is not suppose to be one of the corrective actions).     </li>
            <li> It was not smooth but dried and chunky.</li>
            <li> so I just waste it.</li>
            <li> I was worried because thick moisturizers usually make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Some folks have complained about the smell of the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sad to say that I simply can&#x27;t use this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I hate putting my fingers in a jar of cream and repeating the action every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that this manufacturer &amp;#34;Yes to Carrots LTD&amp;#34; sent a very different product.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the texture, the feel, or the smell of &amp;#34;Yes</li>
            <li> I am not, to my knowledge, allergic to any of the individual ingredients,but something about this formula is very bad for</li>
            <li> I had a horrible reaction to it, my face is red and blistered, and my face, hands and tongue have swollen up.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the bait &amp; switch...</li>
            <li> Sadly, my husband commandeered it for himself.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that this seller did not deliver the product pictured.</li>
            <li> It was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> and I cannot even wear liquid base products let alone lotions.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I hate spf and the stickiness it leaves on your skin.  </li>
            <li> But this stuff is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I am over 40 and do not like very many facial products on the market. I have dry skin and my face sweats and turns red very easily. I have sensitive skin and I cannot even wear liquid base products let alone lotions. My best friend recommended this product after I asked her why she looked so much different after not seeing her for a month.    The Yes to Carrots night cream is amazing (this is my very favorite of all their products). My skin looked 5 years younger in just 3 days of use. If you wanted to try one of the products first, the night cream is the one. I also use the Yes to Carrots facial exfoliating cream, Yes to Carrots Day time facial cream, and Yes to Carrots eye cream (also one of my very favorite products). Today I am now using the body lotion and so far I am just as pleased as with all of the other products.    These Night cream and the Day cream are very thick, but this is misleading, because they soak very nicely into my skin. My fine lines are less noticeable already after just a few days and my skin feels younger and tighter. They eye cream has made the skin around my eyes more even-toned and less puffy (dark rings are less noticeable even though this is not suppose to be one of the corrective actions).     The exfoliation facial cleanser is very gentle. My face feels moisturized just from using that product. Believe me, I forget lotion a lot and my face still felt smooth and not dry from just the cleanser.    I have recommended this product to some co-workers and was able to tell within 3-4 days when they started using this product without even asking. Very Sun damaged skin on one of my co-workers was immediately better. She absolutely loves them as well.     If you have Oily skin, they have Yes to Tomatoes, and for normal skin, they have Yes to Cucumbers.    I will be a user of all of the Yes to Carrots for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, sometimes oily skin but it took me forever to realize that my skin was only oily because I was irritating my sensitive skin (by overwashing) and causing it to produce more oil than necessary to compensate. I think any of us who have had skin issues can relate to what a journey it is to actually finding your correct skin type and then buying products supposedly made for it. Despite not having *terribly* dry skin, I realize that my skin definitely needed more moisture. I love using the day cream right after washing my face in the morning. It spreads on easy and is one of the fastest absorbing lotions/creams I&#x27;ve tried! (Keep in mind, your skin absorbs any moisturizer best when it&#x27;s still \\&quot;damp\\&quot; from a wash, so I usually pat dry and let my face dry a little more and just apply right after. Absorbs within minutes - if not a minute).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of this item on Amazon is what moved me to buy this -- though it is still a little pricey if you ask me, but I am willing to give up a few extra bucks for something I know that works. That being said, I go through this stuff pretty quickly (takes me about 2-2.5 months, with almost daily use). I don&#x27;t know if I would constantly buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP TO BUYERS!* The expiration date on the item is in European format (unless you buy the Yes to SPF line). I received a cream (in Aug) that said it expired 01/10/2011 and was upset that I would have to return it (and probably end up paying $16-20 for it at drug stores). Luckily, I did some googling since I wondered if there would be an extended life -- the Yes To FAQ popped up and let me know that the exp date was in Euro format. So the cream doesn&#x27;t expire until October. Thank goodness.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I hate spf and the stickiness it leaves on your skin.  This has no spf (they sell another that does).  I think it goes on a bit thick for a day cream, so I apply with a clean wet brush as thinly as possible.  It keeps my skin moisturized all day.  I have very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in different packaging, which I normally wouldn&#x27;t care about, except it was also expired. It&#x27;s definitely not European date formatting as another reviewer suggested hers was; the largest number is a 10, meaning this expired at least 2 years ago. I used it enough times before noticing the expiration date, so it was a little late to send it back, and I&#x27;m sure it still moisturizes relatively adequately.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have very sensitive skin and this is the only moisturizer that does not break out my face. I can no longer find this item in any store so I was over the top thankful that I found it on amazon.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that this seller did not deliver the product pictured. I have ordered Yes To Carrots moisturizer in the past and am a big fan of the product but this seller sent a knock off product. Highly recommend Yes To Carrots manufactured by &amp;#34;Yes To Inc&amp;#34; in San Francisco. Disappointed that this manufacturer &amp;#34;Yes to Carrots LTD&amp;#34; sent a very different product. The moisturizer itself was brown (not white, like usual) and dried up. Had it been anything close to usable, I might have kept it but it isn&#x27;t. Avoid this seller.</li>
            <li> First, the cream arrived not as pictured. Second, my face turned red and I had a burning sensation right after application. I used Yes to Carrots cream before (the one that is pictured) and never had an issue. For the first time, I purchased this product online and regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> Best. brand. ever. I will never buy or try another product again. i use to have cystic acne and it&#x27;s completely gone. Thank you Say yes to Carrots for an amazing product!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever used.  It leaves &#x27;mature&#x27; skin looking very dewey.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> 1.  Item did not arrived as pictured.  On the Amazon website the cream is advertised as \\&quot;Yes To Carrots Moisturizing Day Cream, Dry to Sensitive Skin\\&quot; in a pump style bottle.  I received \\&quot;Yes to Carrots Nourishing, Rich Moisture Day Cream\\&quot; no mention if it is formulated for dry or sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The cream goes on well and I don&#x27;t have to use too much, which is nice. The thing is, I don&#x27;t feel that it is an exceptional moisturizer.  It does a good job but for something made for dry skin I would have thought it would do a better job.  My face still feels dry, may have to test drive some other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again but still searching for something better.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the texture, the feel, or the smell of &amp;#34;Yes To Carrots Moisturizing Cream.  I&#x27;ll pass next time on this product.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this cream in a clearance sale and when it was almost gone, I couldn&#x27;t wait up get another! I can only find it on amazon, but with free shipping, I don&#x27;t care:) it is super moisturizing, smells great and the packaging makes it easy to use all of this product.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and while this goes on quite thick and goopy it absorbs quickly.  My skin stays soft for hours.  Some folks have complained about the smell of the product.  I don&#x27;t find it offensive or even that strong, and I have  a sensitive nose.  A good product which I have since reordered.</li>
            <li> I was worried because thick moisturizers usually make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;This is really nice, I have been using it for a few weeks, and I wil be ordering it again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sad to say that I simply can&#x27;t use this moisturizer.  I had a horrible reaction to it, my face is red and blistered, and my face, hands and tongue have swollen up. I am not, to my knowledge, allergic to any of the individual ingredients,but something about this formula is very bad for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest testing it out on a day when you don&#x27;t have to worry about looking like a giant, blistered tomato.</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly. I appreciate that. I was hoping it would provide more all day moisturizing for my very dry skin, but it really only lasts a couple hours</li>
            <li> This is literally the only facial moisturizer I have been able to find that works with my skin.  I use it daily in the morning, and find that it moisturizes my face without leaving it feeling greasy or heavy.  I literally lather it on, and my skin immediately looks and feels better.  I keep one in the car, one in my gym bag, and one in my bathroom.  My skin is naturally dry and sensitive, so I order the day cream in multiples.  I don&#x27;t work for this company, by the way- I just love this product!</li>
            <li> I used to like the product before my last purchase (Sold by Hickoryspring). It was very disappointing. The cream was not new. It was not smooth but dried and chunky. It was previously opened, re-wrapped to be sent to me and most probably stored in poor conditions that caused oxidation (demonstrated by the dark brown-ish color on the top of the cream). It also smelled funny. I did not bothered to return it so I just waste it. Please, do not buy YES to carrots from these seller if you want to get a good quality of YES to carrots.</li>
            <li> I used this day cream twice. My face burned when I put this on. I called Yes to, and they said that some people are allergic to retinol (Vit A), and they sent out another face cream for me to try at no charge. Very helpful customer service. The scent reminds me of baby powder.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but feel I should warn everybody about this product.  It makes my skin horribly red and splotchy.  I have never considered myself to have sensitive skin and have never had problems with any other face cream.  But this stuff is horrible.</li>
            <li> The item I ordered was illustrated as a pump bottle of lotion. The item I received is a jar of cream. The packaging is misrepresented in the illustration. Hence, rather than pumping out fresh product every morning, I have to stick my fingers in a jar and risk contamination. Not impressed with the bait &amp; switch... I hate putting my fingers in a jar of cream and repeating the action every time I use it. Product is fine, packaging is not honest. You&#x27;re not getting what you&#x27;re seeing.</li>
            <li> I started using this cream at the beginning of winter, and I liked it a lot. Sadly, my husband commandeered it for himself. He loved that it calmed his flaky, flare-up patches by his eyebrows and soothed his skin after shaving. He has problems with ingrown hairs as well and applying a hot towel to his face before applying the cream at night makes his skin feel so smooth and nice. The makeup removing cleanser from this line is an all-time favorite of mine, too, and they don&#x27;t test on animals. The company is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a cream that works better for MY dry winter skin, Lancome&#x27;s Nutrix Royale, which helps my skin regenerate fully by increasing lipid productivity. It does science on my chronically-dry skin. Science! Other creams may calm my skin and make my skin feel a lot less tight after washing, but Nutrix Royale is the best for me, personally. I still think this product is great and worth 5 stars for what it does without a waxy feeling.</li>
