            <li>The skin care travel set is good to just figure out what products you like I guess.......</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is natural and that it contains a lot of vitamin C, which is one of the best, if not the best ingredient for your skin.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite skin care line!</li>
            <li>I will buy more products soon!</li>

            <li>My wife had sampled these products and liked them</li>
            <li>but honestly there are some things I could take or leave in the set given the price.  </li>
            <li>so I am happy to have a travel size kit to use while I gather the monies to get the full set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>skin has never looked more radiant, healthy and youthful than when I am using my arbonne!</li>
            <li>I chose this product because I have heard many good things about it, but since I had never used it before, I thought it a good idea to try the travel set first.  </li>
            <li>It is wonderful to have everything you need in that tiny bag!  </li>
            <li>Sure is beneficial to packing.  </li>
            <li>My skin is more supple.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>Her skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I love Arbonne products.  </li>
            <li>I love buying them on amazon too</li>
            <li>:) ) I have used a multitude of skin care lines/products (haven&#x27;t we all??</li>
            <li>:) )</li>
            <li>The products for my Face and eyes and Toner are something I have been looking for many years.</li>
            <li>love arbonne and</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of buying from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend this product, and the cute bag the products come in can be used for so many things.</li>
            <li>Perfect when you don&#x27;t want to or cannot take all your necessary lotions and potions along.  </li>
            <li>however, I have to say the bag is lovely but</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the skin care products but am not convinced that the make-up products are for me just yet.  </li>
            <li>I love how my skin looks and feels.  </li>
            <li>I love this line.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more for her!!!</li>
            <li>This was an easy way to take my favorite products on the road.</li>
            <li>Saw improved skin tone right away!!</li>
            <li>I thought the products were wonderful if a bit pricey.&lt;br /&gt;Since this set had so much of the product line in it, I am now able to purchase the single items I found most useful for me.&lt;br /&gt;Great item, arrived on time, and packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the RE9 Skin care....</li>
            <li>Fantastic product in a fantastic presentation &amp; size.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth and healty looking .</li>
            <li>and it was available for $45.  </li>
            <li>and i look younger and brighter and firmer and glowing how spectacular I feel and look!</li>
            <li>You skin is worth it!</li>
            <li>Choose the right consultant who&#x27;ll guarantee great future service instead of a one time overpriced deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you can&#x27;t afford the full size set.</li>
            <li>The RE9 Advanced Travel Set is very affordable.  </li>
            <li>This product dosent just sit on your skin, it&#x27;s absorbed, something I&#x27;ve never seen before.</li>
            <li>This stuff works and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This Travel sized kit is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I am able to take the basic skin care portion and fit it into my 1-quart travel bag along with my shampoo, conditioner, hair spray, hair gel, hair serum, shower gel, etc, and pack in my carry-on for air travel.  </li>
            <li>Nothing else makes your skin feel this good (not tight/dry) after just washing it, and my gosh---softer than my baby&#x27;s  behind :)</li>
            <li>Plus youdont have to use very much of the product.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred to get the large set but couldn&#x27;t afford at the time</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and I received it sooner than I planned.  </li>
            <li>It also gives me an opportunity to try items like the body cream at a reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li>Because of this I couldn&#x27;t even wear make-up or even press powder as the break outs really noticeable.</li>
            <li>I am the worlds most sensitive human when it comes to chemicals...</li>
            <li>I love the results and plan to buy the bigger size products individually as I run out.</li>
            <li>I love this little bag of travel size goodies.  </li>
            <li>all tucks away in this lovely little bag...</li>
            <li>Such a fun set of skin care products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However... it is available for MUCH LESS when a person contacts an Arbonne consultant.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t afford to buy the whole re9 set, so I bought the travel size, definitely enough to hold me over till I can buy the whole larger order of re9.</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>Skin is feeling soft and pampered.</li>
            <li>I did try to purchase this direct from Arbonne online.  </li>
            <li>I would reccommend this to anyone new to Arbonne and wanting to try out a large variety of their products for a less risky price.</li>
            <li>my skin stays smooth and no more dryness, red patches and itchiness all because of arbonne.</li>
            <li>A little of these products goes a very long way, so if you&#x27;re careful and judicious in how you use it, it will last you for many trips and vacations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> All of the products in this set are high quality and there is enough in the set to use for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> could only buy the travel set for now, but since you only use a little, it will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> for a long time.</li>
            <li> for 5 years I,ve been suffering or having this kinda some part dry and some part oily skin</li>
            <li> She had tried other products (like proactive) but had little to no results.</li>
            <li> and if the weather becomes too hot or cold</li>
            <li> I have used Arbonne for a few years now and i have not had any dissapoinments with the products or the seller</li>
            <li> Some things are just too small of a sample too.</li>
            <li> (b/c they are usually cheaper!</li>
            <li> It is a stiff and a little awkward.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> I would buy it all the time if it weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> However, the zipper on the travel bad did not work well.</li>
            <li> it gets so bad.</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s winter and very cold here in Canada</li>

            <li> I have used these prdts.  for years.  It is wonderful to have everything you need in that tiny bag!  Sure is beneficial to packing.  For anyone who is a fan of Arbonne, as I am, this is a must.</li>
            <li> I was out of almost everything and planning a trip.  This was an easy way to take my favorite products on the road.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get this deal on Arbonne.com so its a great way to try all the pruducts before spending money.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite skin care line! The price was reasonable and I received it sooner than I planned.  It was packaged nicely.  Great service! I will buy more products soon!</li>
            <li> Tried this product as it was recommended to me and have found it to be an effective system for my skin type.  I tried the travel kit to see how this product would react on my skin and I do believe I will be placing an order in the future.</li>
            <li> A friend gave me samples of re9 &amp; I saw instant results. I couldn&#x27;t afford to buy the whole re9 set, so I bought the travel size, definitely enough to hold me over till I can buy the whole larger order of re9. Plus youdont have to use very much of the product. Just a tiny bit works wonders!! Saw improved skin tone right away!! My skin is more supple. This product dosent just sit on your skin, it&#x27;s absorbed, something I&#x27;ve never seen before. Very happy :)</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years.  Happy to find it at Amazon. However, the zipper on the travel bad did not work well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product in a fantastic presentation &amp; size.  Have used this for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However... it is available for MUCH LESS when a person contacts an Arbonne consultant. AND... you will receive continued customer service and guarantees on any Arbonne product.  Choose the right consultant who&#x27;ll guarantee great future service instead of a one time overpriced deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the company site  arbonne.com to verify price.</li>
            <li> My wife had sampled these products and liked them so I bought this for her for Christmas. She loves it and her face has cleared up a lot. Her skin has never looked better. She had tried other products (like proactive) but had little to no results. This stuff works and is worth every penny. I will definitely be buying more for her!!!</li>
            <li> I love Arbonne products.  I love buying them on amazon too (b/c they are usually cheaper! :) ) I have used a multitude of skin care lines/products (haven&#x27;t we all?? :) ) And I think I am an Arbonne-for-lifer.  Nothing else makes your skin feel this good (not tight/dry) after just washing it, and my gosh---softer than my baby&#x27;s  behind :) Arbonne makes your skin feel HEALTHY!  The skin care travel set is good to just figure out what products you like I guess.......I know it&#x27;s a system but honestly there are some things I could take or leave in the set given the price.  Some things are just too small of a sample too.</li>
            <li> I have been using&lt;br /&gt;arbonnne for a long time. I find all the products the best I have had in many years. My skin is so smooth and healty looking . The products for my Face and eyes and Toner are something I have been looking for many years. I am very happy with all products&lt;br /&gt;Thank You&lt;br /&gt;Susan Lares</li>
            <li> love arbonne and I love the convenience of buying from Amazon.  This set is pefect for travel or if you just want to try the product before committing to the larger sizes.</li>
            <li> Yes, it was wonderful, and I use the bag to hole my make up when I travel, which is quite a bit.</li>
            <li> This Travel sized kit is worth it.  I am able to take the basic skin care portion and fit it into my 1-quart travel bag along with my shampoo, conditioner, hair spray, hair gel, hair serum, shower gel, etc, and pack in my carry-on for air travel.  A little of these products goes a very long way, so if you&#x27;re careful and judicious in how you use it, it will last you for many trips and vacations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product, and the cute bag the products come in can be used for so many things.</li>
            <li> it was great and i look younger and brighter and firmer and glowing how spectacular I feel and look! Wow</li>
            <li> Such a fun set of skin care products. Skin is feeling soft and pampered. I would reccommend this to anyone new to Arbonne and wanting to try out a large variety of their products for a less risky price. You skin is worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this little bag of travel size goodies.  Perfect when you don&#x27;t want to or cannot take all your necessary lotions and potions along.  It also gives me an opportunity to try items like the body cream at a reasonable cost.  I did try to purchase this direct from Arbonne online.  It was only for sale as a purchase with a purchase; needed to spend $250 and it was available for $45.  So this was a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all tucks away in this lovely little bag...however, I have to say the bag is lovely but whoever designed or approved the zipper system never tried to zip it.  It is a stiff and a little awkward.</li>
            <li> Expensive yes but a great alternative if you can&#x27;t afford the full size set. Some of it lasted me a month some of it longer but I tend to lather it on. I love the results and plan to buy the bigger size products individually as I run out.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I have heard many good things about it, but since I had never used it before, I thought it a good idea to try the travel set first.  I am pleased with the skin care products but am not convinced that the make-up products are for me just yet.  I would recommend Arbonne to others.</li>

            <li> I am a huge fan of the RE9 Skin care....I would have preferred to get the large set but couldn&#x27;t afford at the time so I am happy to have a travel size kit to use while I gather the monies to get the full set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has never looked more radiant, healthy and youthful than when I am using my arbonne!</li>
            <li> for 5 years I,ve been suffering or having this kinda some part dry and some part oily skin and if the weather becomes too hot or cold it gets so bad. Because of this I couldn&#x27;t even wear make-up or even press powder as the break outs really noticeable. I purchased this product just to try if it works as I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and none worked at all. But with arbonne, realistically within 3 days I saw and felt the difference and now it&#x27;s winter and very cold here in Canada my skin stays smooth and no more dryness, red patches and itchiness all because of arbonne.</li>
            <li> The RE9 Advanced Travel Set is very affordable.  I love how my skin looks and feels.  I would recommend these products.</li>
            <li> These are really great products that have no chemicals in them at all!!! I am the worlds most sensitive human when it comes to chemicals... and I can&#x27;t use anything in a grocery store! This product is the only thing I can use on my face and body! I love it!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I could only buy the travel set for now, but since you only use a little, it will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to everyone who is looking for a great skin product.</li>
            <li> I thought the products were wonderful if a bit pricey.&lt;br /&gt;Since this set had so much of the product line in it, I am now able to purchase the single items I found most useful for me.&lt;br /&gt;Great item, arrived on time, and packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> I love this line. I would buy it all the time if it weren&#x27;t so expensive. I love the fact that it is natural and that it contains a lot of vitamin C, which is one of the best, if not the best ingredient for your skin.</li>
            <li> All of the products in this set are high quality and there is enough in the set to use for a few weeks.  Great product!</li>
