            <li>Bath and Body works Warm Vanilla Sugar.</li>
            <li>It has sooo many good ingredients for your skin including...</li>
            <li>I have even had people ask me what kind of perfume I wear after I&#x27;ve been tanning</li>
            <li>I always keep some on hand because I know I can trust it to give me the kind of tan I like.</li>
            <li>I started tanning because I was going on a cruise soon and thought it was going to take a while for me to get a nice tan</li>
            <li>, It smells like honey and something else which is actually a nice smell for both guys &amp; girls, I don&#x27;t mind the girly frutie smells myself</li>
            <li>so I can get a nice brownish with an orangie tint</li>
            <li>It does smell mildly nice - nothing funky.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and creamy, smells nice and gives great results.</li>
            <li>It arrived nicely packed even before we before we thought or needed.</li>
            <li>I switched to Bellezza, loving the result I get from that one.</li>
            <li>A nice bronze tan that others comment on.</li>
            <li>Also hydrates my skin nicely... not drying.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a nice lotion</li>
            <li>I look nice and tan after using it.</li>
            <li>great product, fast shipping, great service.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin smelling really nice.</li>
            <li>Warm vanilla-sugary and</li>
            <li>I have a very good tan right now but am wishing to get darker.</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong and kind of stinky</li>
            <li>Best so far, makes me wonder if there is anything better than this out there!</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong..</li>
            <li>This lotion def made my top 5 favorite lotions list!</li>
            <li>but with this product I received a very nice tan and quickly.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best smelling tanning lotion i have ever used</li>
            <li>I love the smell This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>The love notes lotion smells amazing, and makes my skin feel like silk until I wash it off but doesnt make me darker</li>
            <li>it is a very light scent too, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Did ok for a starter lotion</li>
            <li>The seller estimated a week :) I tan alot and this is probably the best-smelling lotion that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>:) I use a facial lotion and this one on my body and the results are awesome!</li>
            <li>Will be returning for more.</li>
            <li>How in the world do you think that is OK???</li>
            <li>However my skin did have more of an orange tint to it</li>
            <li>the more I used it.  </li>
            <li>My best friend swears by this lotion and it is the only one she will use!</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love this lotion now</li>
            <li>I would even say i like it better then Luminary.</li>
            <li>Had been using another tanning lotion that did a much better job.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave you all greasy.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE SMELL.  </li>
            <li>I am fair skinned to begin with, but I rarely burn.</li>
            <li>you get instant color and it smells awesome!!!</li>
            <li>Love designer skin lotions.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite things about it is the consistency; it spreads a lot without being overly greasy like Tao is.  </li>
            <li>They just work better.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer describes the scent as \\&quot;warm tropical sugar,\\&quot; and I feel that&#x27;s accurate.  </li>
            <li>I love this designer skin product.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and either couldn&#x27;t find it in stores or it cost way more than it should.  </li>
            <li>Okay.. for starters.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy more no doubt about that.</li>
            <li>I have used sooo many tanning lotions   </li>
            <li>Used this trying to tan up for a trip to Mexico, as well as in Mexico, and then over the summer, and I think I&#x27;ve used better enhancers.</li>
            <li>I REALLY love the smell of this one.</li>
            <li>Most of the time, lotions smells make me nausous.</li>
            <li>This lotion was definitely better than the cheapy stuff I had before.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Worship Me lotion.  </li>
            <li>but I dont love it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>and smells better.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT, this is my all time favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I see a bit more color</li>
            <li>I like it much better than the one I ordered with it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I will be buying again! :)</li>
            <li>Has many moisturizers as well.</li>
            <li>And by far this is the best lotion that gets me dark but the winner in best smell \\&quot;TAO\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I am very familiar with the way it is supposed to look and smell.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion to get great color.</li>
            <li>The label on the salon&#x27;s bottle was perfect, and the label on the bottle I got from here was stretched, faded in some spots, and wrinkled.</li>
            <li>worth the cost, for sure!</li>
            <li>If you are not too sensitive to smell this lotion will be great for you.</li>
            <li>This sunless tanner has a great light fragrance and creates a great tan even after just a few minutes in a tanning bed.</li>
            <li>Smells good going on but not so much after you tan.</li>
            <li>and all I have to say is this product is such a good lotion!</li>
            <li>However, I wasn&#x27;t that impressed by the amount of color I&#x27;ve gotten with it, I do burn, and I have a somewhat orangish tint to me, perhaps due to the bronzing agent in it?</li>
            <li>This was a pretty decent lotion, it had a nice pleasant scent that wasn&#x27;t too overpowering and for having a bronzer it didn&#x27;t leave any funky streaks or make my skin look orange.</li>
            <li>This lotion goes on easily and seems to moisturize well, but I find the scent to be unbearable.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell doesn&#x27;t turn on my skin and gives great protection inside or outside tanning.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have as strong of a bronzer as some others I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>#34;this is by far the best&amp;#34; so this is just as good as most to me.</li>
            <li>As for full tanning effect, I&#x27;m not too sure.  </li>
            <li>In the first use my skin got a nice tan.</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>Having never bought tanning lotion online before I wanted to be sure this was a trust worthy company.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t one of the high silicone content lotions for the darkest tan possible, but it has great ingredients and smells really good.  </li>
            <li>I have an easy time tanning but this product really helped me get an even color throughout and an amazing tan color not that orange look.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Hero\\&quot; a very  light fresh cologne.</li>
            <li>Instant results, very pleased!</li>
            <li>The only reason I give it 4 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t smell that great after tanning like the 14 k gold does.</li>
            <li>I think that the lotion was deluted with another cheap lotion.</li>
            <li>Guilt free purchase.</li>
            <li>I stopped tanning for a few years, and when I decided to start up again, I bought this \\&quot;Worship Me\\&quot; bottle of tanning lotion, and it works great!</li>
            <li>I found this one to be a solid performer based on the great reviews it had gotten</li>
            <li>I do look more golden..</li>
            <li>just more golden kinda like this lotion.</li>
            <li>I just never by the stuff that is too cheap.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and supple.  </li>
            <li>They glide on so smooth, its not watery like some are, and it also feels like it protects.</li>
            <li>Good product, always liked Designer Skin brands, only thing has a real strong scent that stays with you for awhile, but gives you some color first time using, price half of what salons charge so Good Buy</li>
            <li>Normally this tanning lotion is amazing and one of my favorites to use</li>
            <li>I originally ordered this lotion for my fiance to use before going to florida for 2 weeks-</li>
            <li>Okay, I bought this item as a first time Tanning Salon patron.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews for this lotion and was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>My color has boosted significantly just after 2 tanning sessions with this lotion.</li>
            <li>and i could tell a significant difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s glides on easily and provides a light moisturising layer while and for right after you&#x27;re done tanning.</li>
            <li>Goes on super smooth</li>
            <li>Overall it worked nicely, I would say it&#x27;s more of a beginners lotion as it didn&#x27;t have any intensifiers and</li>
            <li>So far I love it!</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this lotion is that it has a very strong musky smell!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a beginner at tanning and saw how much my friends were paying at the salons and got this at a good price considering:) I love the smell not real strong and didn&#x27;t feel greasy</li>
            <li>no really this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>All in all I really like the designer skin products better than anything else and at the amazon prices who can beat it?</li>
            <li>Overall feel that I would get just as good of a tan from laying in bed with no lotion at all.</li>
            <li>I used this last year and got a really good tan.</li>
            <li>I am very finicky about scents, and this one smells beachy and lovely.</li>
            <li>a whole lot better.</li>
            <li>This is only good for beginners in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It is a nice thick lotion with a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>you get great colour that lasts longer than other lotions.</li>
            <li>It will tan you really quickly</li>
            <li>This is a perfect lotion for anyone- its a great starter lotion to build a base tan and at the same time it works amazing for advanced tanners too.</li>
            <li>Items were shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this Worship Me tanning lotion a couple of times and need to use more times to have a better judgement.</li>
            <li>gets u tan quick, I recommend to everyone trying to get tan quick</li>
            <li>I cant say that I have gotten super brown from this product, but I think its going into that direction.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and break out in hives very easily</li>
            <li>I noticed results after the first time I used it and I developed a nice brown color that I have never had from another lotion.</li>
            <li>Here, I bought it at a reasonable price and it came very quickly via mail.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and didn&#x27;t leave me greasy or make me breakout but left me nicely moisturized for the remainder of the day.  </li>
            <li>Hooray for giving my mom a little token of appreciation that she enjoys at a great value.</li>
            <li>(and with a free sample of another lotion), it was the real thing and nothing had been tampered with.    </li>
            <li>For the price it was WELL worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting Golden Ceremony by Designer Skin......</li>
            <li>I guess its good for the casual tanner but not so much for the experienced tanner...</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell after tanning, but that&#x27;s a personal preference.</li>
            <li>I so go for this one for your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>The wait is worth it.</li>
            <li>I have a bottle of Luminary, Smile</li>
            <li>I laugh at the idea..</li>
            <li>Deffenetly worth the money</li>
            <li>Smile</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As of right now I give it 1star because I expected it to be a good bronzer.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that I ordered this product after my Fiance&#x27; had bought a similar one from the same seller, This smells so good!</li>
            <li>and I could tell right away</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell too good after tanning, but that&#x27;s not very important to me since I do not tan on breaks at work or anything like that.</li>
            <li>It goes on kind of nice smelling - a little like chocolate with a tiny hint of mint - but the scent changes into a sickly sweet smell after tanning.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this lotion I could already see a visible difference my tan.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my mother as she was no longer able to find it locally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m open to suggestions on something that can beat this :)</li>
            <li>This was the first tanning lotion I ever tried once I started tanning.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this item in the tanning salon and paid $48 for it.</li>
            <li>This was the first lotion I ever used, I&#x27;ve tried many others and always have gone back to this one.</li>
            <li>I used to work at a tanning salon and was fully aware of exactly what the product should look and smell like when I purchased it from the seller.</li>
            <li>There are better ones out there in the same price range.</li>
            <li>and I first found Worship Me about 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>Worship Me makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The best word to describe this lotion is \\&quot;generic\\&quot;: generic smell, generic consistency, generic results.</li>
            <li>first trip to the tanning bed</li>
            <li>, they told me I had to purchase this, but would give me trial tube first time.</li>
            <li>I first started tanning about two years ago.</li>
            <li>so I was pretty bummed out.  </li>
            <li>first use</li>
            <li>: The other kind they got from the same company was twice as much at a salon/spa place locally so the price was also great.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this product was that I stayed moisterized and it was a big bottle.</li>
            <li>Pretty much an entry level lotion.</li>
            <li>It produces a nice, dark color.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They had used another kind from the same brand but really enjoyed this one primarily because of the smell, it has a sweet subtle smell where as the last one they used had an overpowering cherry smell</li>
            <li>IT LEAVES THE SKIN SUPER SOFT WITH NO STREAKS</li>
            <li>This product comes with a large bottle and I appreciate that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;re only going 3 times a week.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and didn&#x27;t make my skin greasy or dried out.</li>
            <li>Nothing to really bragg about.</li>
            <li>IT GIVES YOU SUCH A FABULOUS BRONZE COLOR AND YOUR TAN</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe real tanning lotion comes sealed anyhow...</li>
            <li>the reason I wonder if it is real is because it smells like all tanning lotioins do</li>
            <li>, then wake up the next day and be light again.</li>
            <li>I believe Designer Skin didn&#x27;t give this lotion as much credit as it deserves on the description of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Save your money and get the real thing from this vendor.</li>
            <li>The problem with that is that it takes twice as much Luminary to cover my body as it does a lotion like this.  </li>
            <li>Who pays that much ..</li>
            <li>The price was extremely reasonable compared to the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion to every tanner!</li>
            <li>And is also much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t think too much of it.  </li>
            <li>Then I used it for the first time and realized the shade of brown is not what it normally is.  </li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>And it was shipped fast, i received it 3 days after ordering.</li>
            <li>i really like this tanning lotion</li>
            <li>Received this order fast.</li>
            <li>This has a nice subtle coconut (I think) odor that fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll recommend this lotion to anyone willing to spend a decent amount for a decent tan.  </li>
            <li>Before even opening it, when comparing the outside of the bottles it is very easy to tell that they are not from the same manufacturing company.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than many other products that don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>I have used other bronzers that work way better.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was expecting more color to come out of this product, at least more color on my skin.</li>
            <li>Also, I noticed I didn&#x27;t get any decent color when using it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still a decent scent.</li>
            <li>The salons do highly mark up their pricing ($90 for lotion?</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend it to all.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My hands are never greasy and it leaves my body feeling so soft!!</li>
            <li>Goes on very smooth and doesn&#x27;t make a mess or feel greasy like some lotions!</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t help me tan any faster than normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna try and swtich it up and try a new one this time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new tanner</li>
            <li>I needed new tanning lotion and I was looking around at what they had at the place</li>
            <li>One of my new favorites.</li>
            <li>For me, I don&#x27;t really like the texture or scent as much as others, but I gave it a four because I think that&#x27;s personal preference.</li>
            <li>Definitely buy it if you are having trouble tanning or just want a nice natural color.</li>
            <li>I got to be pretty pale, so I needed something to help me gain a tan quick.</li>
            <li>When I received the bottle it was in the same packaging as normal and smelt pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li>I have run into no trouble at all with streaking or staining.</li>
            <li>LOOKS SO NATURAL.</li>
            <li>always a brown natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think so)and try to tell you if you buy outside the salon, &#x27;it&#x27;s not the real thing&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I think that this one delivers as far as tanning goes.</li>
            <li>It smells like vasiline and old perfume.</li>
            <li>so it can look natural.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t feel like I got much extra tanning power out of this.</li>
            <li>I get a natural looking tan from this as well, never burnt.</li>
            <li>By far my FAV</li>
            <li>Tried it once so far, for a 10 minute stand up</li>
            <li>When I first started tanning I was pretty pale</li>
            <li>, You&#x27;re Dark, Tao, JWOWW by Australian Gold, and I think the next I&#x27;ll be trying is Obsidian which is top of the line Designer Skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying from this vendor when wanting to buy tanning lotion outside of the salons.</li>
            <li>I took this to a high end tanning salon to compare this product to the same product they carry for $60.</li>
            <li>A very nostalgic scent, and it has great results.</li>
            <li>I started out using Smile, Your Dark by Designer Skin.</li>
            <li>caffein (good for cellulite),almond oil, olive oil, bannana extract, carrot seed oil, hemp seed oil, black walnut extract, white birch, milk thistle, jojoba seed oil, black cohosh, soy protien , white tea extract...and not to mention DHA.</li>
            <li>After just 3 sessions I&#x27;m super dark!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t see any major results in my tan.  </li>
            <li>The tan, i use a strong tanning bed, was still the same as ordinary lotions.</li>
            <li>Gives great color &amp; doesn&#x27;t make you smell bad after tanning.</li>
            <li>Not only did my product arrive EARLY</li>
            <li>I use different lotions every day for a broader spectrum of UV, but as far as I know Luminary and Obsidian are supposed to give the darkest color.  </li>
            <li>Not worth the money and not the real thing!</li>
            <li>As I expected the lotion did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>The smell is ok in the beginning but unless u really scrub yourself with a brush or something after a shower, the smell does not go away and has weird funky smell later.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have to use more than in the past for other lotions.</li>
            <li>Australian Gold&#x27;s Sinfully Dark spreads even further with an even less greasy feel, but the price is about the same and from what I&#x27;ve been able to gather Designer Skin is tops when it comes to tanning.  </li>
            <li>The bronzer in this lotion are not orange or fake looking, it gives you a really nice natural dark color.</li>
            <li>I started to get a little suspicious because I have heard of people ordering some type of beauty product online and receiving a fake product in the mail that had the same packaging but was left without major ingredients that make the product so good.  </li>
            <li>The quadruple bronzers just seem different than other high end lotions.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I always keep some on hand because I know I can trust it to give me the kind of tan I like.</li>
            <li> I started tanning because I was going on a cruise soon and thought it was going to take a while for me to get a nice tan</li>
            <li> , It smells like honey and something else which is actually a nice smell for both guys &amp; girls, I don&#x27;t mind the girly frutie smells myself</li>
            <li> so I can get a nice brownish with an orangie tint</li>
            <li> It does smell mildly nice - nothing funky.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and creamy, smells nice and gives great results.</li>
            <li> It arrived nicely packed even before we before we thought or needed.</li>
            <li> I switched to Bellezza, loving the result I get from that one.</li>
            <li> A nice bronze tan that others comment on.</li>
            <li> Also hydrates my skin nicely... not drying.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a nice lotion</li>
            <li> I look nice and tan after using it.</li>
            <li> great product, fast shipping, great service.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin smelling really nice.</li>
            <li> Warm vanilla-sugary and</li>
            <li> I have a very good tan right now but am wishing to get darker.</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong and kind of stinky</li>
            <li> Best so far, makes me wonder if there is anything better than this out there!</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong..</li>
            <li> This lotion def made my top 5 favorite lotions list!</li>
            <li> but with this product I received a very nice tan and quickly.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best smelling tanning lotion i have ever used</li>
            <li> I love the smell This stuff is amazing.</li>

            <li> it is a very light scent too, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Did ok for a starter lotion</li>
            <li> The seller estimated a week :) I tan alot and this is probably the best-smelling lotion that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> :) I use a facial lotion and this one on my body and the results are awesome!</li>
            <li> Will be returning for more.</li>
            <li> How in the world do you think that is OK???</li>
            <li> However my skin did have more of an orange tint to it</li>
            <li> the more I used it.  </li>
            <li> My best friend swears by this lotion and it is the only one she will use!</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love this lotion now</li>
            <li> I would even say i like it better then Luminary.</li>
            <li> Had been using another tanning lotion that did a much better job.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave you all greasy.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE SMELL.  </li>
            <li> I am fair skinned to begin with, but I rarely burn.</li>
            <li> you get instant color and it smells awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Love designer skin lotions.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite things about it is the consistency; it spreads a lot without being overly greasy like Tao is.  </li>
            <li> They just work better.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer describes the scent as \\&quot;warm tropical sugar,\\&quot; and I feel that&#x27;s accurate.  </li>
            <li> I love this designer skin product.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and either couldn&#x27;t find it in stores or it cost way more than it should.  </li>
            <li> Okay.. for starters.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy more no doubt about that.</li>
            <li> I have used sooo many tanning lotions   </li>
            <li> Used this trying to tan up for a trip to Mexico, as well as in Mexico, and then over the summer, and I think I&#x27;ve used better enhancers.</li>
            <li> I REALLY love the smell of this one.</li>
            <li> Most of the time, lotions smells make me nausous.</li>
            <li> This lotion was definitely better than the cheapy stuff I had before.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Worship Me lotion.  </li>
            <li> but I dont love it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> and smells better.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT, this is my all time favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I see a bit more color</li>
            <li> I like it much better than the one I ordered with it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I will be buying again! :)</li>
            <li> Has many moisturizers as well.</li>
            <li> And by far this is the best lotion that gets me dark but the winner in best smell \\&quot;TAO\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I am very familiar with the way it is supposed to look and smell.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion to get great color.</li>
            <li> The label on the salon&#x27;s bottle was perfect, and the label on the bottle I got from here was stretched, faded in some spots, and wrinkled.</li>
            <li> worth the cost, for sure!</li>
            <li> If you are not too sensitive to smell this lotion will be great for you.</li>
            <li> This sunless tanner has a great light fragrance and creates a great tan even after just a few minutes in a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Smells good going on but not so much after you tan.</li>
            <li> and all I have to say is this product is such a good lotion!</li>
            <li> However, I wasn&#x27;t that impressed by the amount of color I&#x27;ve gotten with it, I do burn, and I have a somewhat orangish tint to me, perhaps due to the bronzing agent in it?</li>
            <li> This was a pretty decent lotion, it had a nice pleasant scent that wasn&#x27;t too overpowering and for having a bronzer it didn&#x27;t leave any funky streaks or make my skin look orange.</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on easily and seems to moisturize well, but I find the scent to be unbearable.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell doesn&#x27;t turn on my skin and gives great protection inside or outside tanning.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have as strong of a bronzer as some others I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> #34;this is by far the best&amp;#34; so this is just as good as most to me.</li>
            <li> As for full tanning effect, I&#x27;m not too sure.  </li>
            <li> In the first use my skin got a nice tan.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> Having never bought tanning lotion online before I wanted to be sure this was a trust worthy company.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t one of the high silicone content lotions for the darkest tan possible, but it has great ingredients and smells really good.  </li>
            <li> I have an easy time tanning but this product really helped me get an even color throughout and an amazing tan color not that orange look.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Hero\\&quot; a very  light fresh cologne.</li>
            <li> Instant results, very pleased!</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it 4 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t smell that great after tanning like the 14 k gold does.</li>
            <li> I think that the lotion was deluted with another cheap lotion.</li>
            <li> Guilt free purchase.</li>
            <li> I stopped tanning for a few years, and when I decided to start up again, I bought this \\&quot;Worship Me\\&quot; bottle of tanning lotion, and it works great!</li>
            <li> I found this one to be a solid performer based on the great reviews it had gotten</li>
            <li> I do look more golden..</li>
            <li> just more golden kinda like this lotion.</li>
            <li> I just never by the stuff that is too cheap.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth and supple.  </li>
            <li> They glide on so smooth, its not watery like some are, and it also feels like it protects.</li>
            <li> Good product, always liked Designer Skin brands, only thing has a real strong scent that stays with you for awhile, but gives you some color first time using, price half of what salons charge so Good Buy</li>
            <li> Normally this tanning lotion is amazing and one of my favorites to use</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this lotion for my fiance to use before going to florida for 2 weeks-</li>
            <li> Okay, I bought this item as a first time Tanning Salon patron.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews for this lotion and was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> My color has boosted significantly just after 2 tanning sessions with this lotion.</li>
            <li> and i could tell a significant difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s glides on easily and provides a light moisturising layer while and for right after you&#x27;re done tanning.</li>
            <li> Goes on super smooth</li>
            <li> Overall it worked nicely, I would say it&#x27;s more of a beginners lotion as it didn&#x27;t have any intensifiers and</li>
            <li> So far I love it!</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this lotion is that it has a very strong musky smell!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner at tanning and saw how much my friends were paying at the salons and got this at a good price considering:) I love the smell not real strong and didn&#x27;t feel greasy</li>
            <li> no really this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> All in all I really like the designer skin products better than anything else and at the amazon prices who can beat it?</li>
            <li> Overall feel that I would get just as good of a tan from laying in bed with no lotion at all.</li>
            <li> I used this last year and got a really good tan.</li>
            <li> I am very finicky about scents, and this one smells beachy and lovely.</li>
            <li> a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> This is only good for beginners in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It is a nice thick lotion with a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> you get great colour that lasts longer than other lotions.</li>
            <li> It will tan you really quickly</li>
            <li> This is a perfect lotion for anyone- its a great starter lotion to build a base tan and at the same time it works amazing for advanced tanners too.</li>
            <li> Items were shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this Worship Me tanning lotion a couple of times and need to use more times to have a better judgement.</li>
            <li> gets u tan quick, I recommend to everyone trying to get tan quick</li>
            <li> I cant say that I have gotten super brown from this product, but I think its going into that direction.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and break out in hives very easily</li>
            <li> I noticed results after the first time I used it and I developed a nice brown color that I have never had from another lotion.</li>
            <li> Here, I bought it at a reasonable price and it came very quickly via mail.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and didn&#x27;t leave me greasy or make me breakout but left me nicely moisturized for the remainder of the day.  </li>
            <li> Hooray for giving my mom a little token of appreciation that she enjoys at a great value.</li>
            <li> (and with a free sample of another lotion), it was the real thing and nothing had been tampered with.    </li>
            <li> For the price it was WELL worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting Golden Ceremony by Designer Skin......</li>
            <li> I guess its good for the casual tanner but not so much for the experienced tanner...</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell after tanning, but that&#x27;s a personal preference.</li>
            <li> I so go for this one for your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> The wait is worth it.</li>
            <li> I have a bottle of Luminary, Smile</li>
            <li> I laugh at the idea..</li>
            <li> Deffenetly worth the money</li>
            <li> Smile</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As of right now I give it 1star because I expected it to be a good bronzer.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that I ordered this product after my Fiance&#x27; had bought a similar one from the same seller, This smells so good!</li>
            <li> and I could tell right away</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell too good after tanning, but that&#x27;s not very important to me since I do not tan on breaks at work or anything like that.</li>
            <li> It goes on kind of nice smelling - a little like chocolate with a tiny hint of mint - but the scent changes into a sickly sweet smell after tanning.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this lotion I could already see a visible difference my tan.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my mother as she was no longer able to find it locally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m open to suggestions on something that can beat this :)</li>
            <li> This was the first tanning lotion I ever tried once I started tanning.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this item in the tanning salon and paid $48 for it.</li>
            <li> This was the first lotion I ever used, I&#x27;ve tried many others and always have gone back to this one.</li>
            <li> I used to work at a tanning salon and was fully aware of exactly what the product should look and smell like when I purchased it from the seller.</li>
            <li> There are better ones out there in the same price range.</li>
            <li> and I first found Worship Me about 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> Worship Me makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The best word to describe this lotion is \\&quot;generic\\&quot;: generic smell, generic consistency, generic results.</li>
            <li> first trip to the tanning bed</li>
            <li> , they told me I had to purchase this, but would give me trial tube first time.</li>
            <li> I first started tanning about two years ago.</li>
            <li> so I was pretty bummed out.  </li>
            <li> first use</li>
            <li> : The other kind they got from the same company was twice as much at a salon/spa place locally so the price was also great.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this product was that I stayed moisterized and it was a big bottle.</li>
            <li> Pretty much an entry level lotion.</li>
            <li> It produces a nice, dark color.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They had used another kind from the same brand but really enjoyed this one primarily because of the smell, it has a sweet subtle smell where as the last one they used had an overpowering cherry smell</li>
            <li> IT LEAVES THE SKIN SUPER SOFT WITH NO STREAKS</li>
            <li> This product comes with a large bottle and I appreciate that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;re only going 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and didn&#x27;t make my skin greasy or dried out.</li>
            <li> Nothing to really bragg about.</li>
            <li> IT GIVES YOU SUCH A FABULOUS BRONZE COLOR AND YOUR TAN</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe real tanning lotion comes sealed anyhow...</li>
            <li> the reason I wonder if it is real is because it smells like all tanning lotioins do</li>
            <li> , then wake up the next day and be light again.</li>
            <li> I believe Designer Skin didn&#x27;t give this lotion as much credit as it deserves on the description of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Save your money and get the real thing from this vendor.</li>
            <li> The problem with that is that it takes twice as much Luminary to cover my body as it does a lotion like this.  </li>
            <li> Who pays that much ..</li>
            <li> The price was extremely reasonable compared to the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion to every tanner!</li>
            <li> And is also much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t think too much of it.  </li>
            <li> Then I used it for the first time and realized the shade of brown is not what it normally is.  </li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> And it was shipped fast, i received it 3 days after ordering.</li>
            <li> i really like this tanning lotion</li>
            <li> Received this order fast.</li>
            <li> This has a nice subtle coconut (I think) odor that fades quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll recommend this lotion to anyone willing to spend a decent amount for a decent tan.  </li>
            <li> Before even opening it, when comparing the outside of the bottles it is very easy to tell that they are not from the same manufacturing company.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than many other products that don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I have used other bronzers that work way better.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was expecting more color to come out of this product, at least more color on my skin.</li>
            <li> Also, I noticed I didn&#x27;t get any decent color when using it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still a decent scent.</li>
            <li> The salons do highly mark up their pricing ($90 for lotion?</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend it to all.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My hands are never greasy and it leaves my body feeling so soft!!</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth and doesn&#x27;t make a mess or feel greasy like some lotions!</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t help me tan any faster than normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna try and swtich it up and try a new one this time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new tanner</li>
            <li> I needed new tanning lotion and I was looking around at what they had at the place</li>
            <li> One of my new favorites.</li>
            <li> For me, I don&#x27;t really like the texture or scent as much as others, but I gave it a four because I think that&#x27;s personal preference.</li>
            <li> Definitely buy it if you are having trouble tanning or just want a nice natural color.</li>
            <li> I got to be pretty pale, so I needed something to help me gain a tan quick.</li>
            <li> When I received the bottle it was in the same packaging as normal and smelt pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li> I have run into no trouble at all with streaking or staining.</li>
            <li> LOOKS SO NATURAL.</li>
            <li> always a brown natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think so)and try to tell you if you buy outside the salon, &#x27;it&#x27;s not the real thing&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I think that this one delivers as far as tanning goes.</li>
            <li> It smells like vasiline and old perfume.</li>
            <li> so it can look natural.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t feel like I got much extra tanning power out of this.</li>
            <li> I get a natural looking tan from this as well, never burnt.</li>
            <li> By far my FAV</li>
            <li> Tried it once so far, for a 10 minute stand up</li>
            <li> When I first started tanning I was pretty pale</li>
            <li> , You&#x27;re Dark, Tao, JWOWW by Australian Gold, and I think the next I&#x27;ll be trying is Obsidian which is top of the line Designer Skin.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying from this vendor when wanting to buy tanning lotion outside of the salons.</li>
            <li> I took this to a high end tanning salon to compare this product to the same product they carry for $60.</li>
            <li> A very nostalgic scent, and it has great results.</li>
            <li> I started out using Smile, Your Dark by Designer Skin.</li>
            <li> caffein (good for cellulite),almond oil, olive oil, bannana extract, carrot seed oil, hemp seed oil, black walnut extract, white birch, milk thistle, jojoba seed oil, black cohosh, soy protien , white tea extract...and not to mention DHA.</li>
            <li> After just 3 sessions I&#x27;m super dark!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see any major results in my tan.  </li>
            <li> The tan, i use a strong tanning bed, was still the same as ordinary lotions.</li>
            <li> Gives great color &amp; doesn&#x27;t make you smell bad after tanning.</li>
            <li> Not only did my product arrive EARLY</li>
            <li> I use different lotions every day for a broader spectrum of UV, but as far as I know Luminary and Obsidian are supposed to give the darkest color.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money and not the real thing!</li>
            <li> As I expected the lotion did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> The smell is ok in the beginning but unless u really scrub yourself with a brush or something after a shower, the smell does not go away and has weird funky smell later.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have to use more than in the past for other lotions.</li>
            <li> Australian Gold&#x27;s Sinfully Dark spreads even further with an even less greasy feel, but the price is about the same and from what I&#x27;ve been able to gather Designer Skin is tops when it comes to tanning.  </li>
            <li> The bronzer in this lotion are not orange or fake looking, it gives you a really nice natural dark color.</li>
            <li> I started to get a little suspicious because I have heard of people ordering some type of beauty product online and receiving a fake product in the mail that had the same packaging but was left without major ingredients that make the product so good.  </li>
            <li> The quadruple bronzers just seem different than other high end lotions.</li>
            <li> this is not the right product for that, not for me at least.</li>
            <li> The scent was a little stronger then normal</li>
            <li> Gives you a dark natural looking tan that lasts.</li>
            <li> not sure how much the lotion helped or if it was just the bed itself.</li>
            <li> The lady at the salon recommended I not use lotion for the first like 7 visits, so I refrained for at least 3, then I started using this product.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I decided to check on Amazon because the exact same lotions are literally HALF the price or LESS!</li>
            <li> Everybody&#x27;s skin is a little different and people definitely have different preferences about scent</li>
            <li> My skin is getting so dark that a nurse at my doctor&#x27;s office asked me recently if I was mixed.  &#x3D;p</li>
            <li> And it lingers... for about as long as the colour.</li>
            <li> I sometimes alternate with other products just to try them</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t even feel as dry.</li>
            <li> I use it even when I am not tanning as a moisturizer for winter dry skin.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase again only because of the strong unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> The bronzers left my skin alost greyish in color not golden.</li>
            <li> Same &amp;#34;tanny&amp;#34; smell but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When I ordered a new bottle on Amazon as usual I should have gone with my previous seller but the price was cheaper here</li>
            <li> This lotion is very thick which is good because it moisturizes like crazy.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the only one that gets me dark and lets me stay dark.</li>
            <li> You dont have to be as cautious and careful with wiping your hands after application.  </li>
            <li> It arrived exactly as expected and works as expected.</li>
            <li> I spent the money</li>
            <li> Delivered faster than expected, but cap was not sealed, just covered over plastic bag.</li>
            <li> I have never really found a tanning lotion where i just wanted to say &amp;</li>
            <li> then I&#x27;d thought and we will see how the next few times go.</li>
            <li> And after I get done tanning, I actually smell really good rather than burnt and nasty.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past, but seemed different.</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend of mine who likes to use a standing high-pressure tan bed.&lt;br /&gt;Personally haven&#x27;t used it (other than to help apply it, teehee)</li>
            <li> So we opened the bottles and poured a little bit of each into a little plastic cup and again there was a BIG diff.</li>
            <li> Relatively dark bronzer, I was going 2 times a week to maintain the tan and got too dark, so I had to cut it to once a week.</li>
            <li> and I got really dark with it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I find that I can be dark the day I tan</li>
            <li> and it got me really dark.</li>
            <li> The aroma is not overpowering in any way and people are unable to smell it until they get very close.  </li>
            <li> I think it would get me to dark that I am going to have to take turns between SINFULLY BLACK &amp; WORSHIP ME</li>
            <li> I am alternating between this and 14k gold (which I was using alone previously).</li>
            <li> I found it on here and paid half.</li>
            <li> Black market.</li>
            <li> It Black</li>
            <li> 50X, Insanely Black 60X Tingle, Sun Skin Spa, Sinfully Black 15X, 3othear lotions,)</li>
            <li> beautifully black lotion made me way darker and is WAY cheaper.</li>
            <li> It is a little to \\&quot;beach-y\\&quot; of a scent for me though.  </li>
            <li> I realized I got my first fake beauty product!  </li>
            <li> he used it a few times, but doesnt like going tanning, so eventually it became mine</li>
            <li> but if you tan everyday I can make you orange.</li>
            <li> I have trouble tanning.</li>
            <li> I tried contacting them on a few occassions regarding suggestions for legs that don&#x27;t tan</li>
            <li> I ordered this product have using many Designer Skin lotions previously, I was very disappointed with this one however.</li>
            <li> It gradually tans me and it doesn&#x27;t turn my skin orange like some of the lotions I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face and was expecting to have a few pimples as that&#x27;s common</li>
            <li> The only bad side is the smell, its a little too perfumy to me and the smell stayed with me all day.</li>
            <li> The salon sold it for at least three times the Amazon price.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;BOOSTER.\\&quot;  As for the optimizing complex and quad-bronzer..</li>
            <li> The shipping was slow I ordered Wednesday and received Monday...  </li>
            <li> if you know what I mean...</li>
            <li> I mean it is like it doesn&#x27;t have any bronzer in it at all.</li>
            <li> I have a decent base tan and I am halfway through the bottle and see some color but not all that I had hoped for...</li>
            <li> Not sure if this seller gives out fake bottles often or not so beware of ordering here...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not VERY impressed</li>
            <li> Lotion is thin, doesn&#x27;t mosturize and smell is overpowering, scent gets on clothes and even after washing you can still smell lotion in clothes.</li>
            <li> It gets me darker than other lotions I have used, but it smells bad.</li>
            <li> Seriously?!</li>
            <li> Nothing orange or fake.  </li>
            <li> but all of them were ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li> but she was unable to smell it until that point.  </li>
            <li> However, and I&#x27;m not really sensitive to smell, it smells horrible.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t unhappy with it</li>
            <li> My biggest disappointment was that I couldn&#x27;t see a difference with the bronzer.  </li>
            <li> I find that the smell is so unpleasant that I&#x27;m having to wash it off soon after tanning - which defeats the bronzer part of the lotion.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> To me it has a licorce smell to it, which isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad bottle...</li>
            <li> After I had a base going I needed a stronger bronzer.</li>
            <li> With that being said, I absolutely hate the smell and cannot use the product.</li>
            <li> I use Designer Skin products all the time but was very disappointed in this one.  </li>
            <li> Disgusting!</li>
            <li> Customer Service at Designer Skin is awful.</li>

            <li> Nothing to really bragg about. Did ok for a starter lotion but cant tell its done anything since 2nd time using it.</li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful, goes on smoothly and even. I have no complaints at all. The first time I used this lotion I could already see a visible difference my tan.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a bronzing product that did not leave me smelling like a rotting coconut, and this product works! It will tan you really quickly and you come out smelling like you have perfume on! Wonderful!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my mother as she was no longer able to find it locally. She couldn&#x27;t believe the great value of buying from Amazon, and loved having it delivered right to her door step! Hooray for giving my mom a little token of appreciation that she enjoys at a great value.</li>
            <li> I received this item about 3 days after I ordered it. The seller estimated a week :) I tan alot and this is probably the best-smelling lotion that I&#x27;ve used. Whenever I go out after tanning, I always get compliments on how good I smell. :) I use a facial lotion and this one on my body and the results are awesome! My hands are never greasy and it leaves my body feeling so soft!! For the price it was WELL worth it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, can tell a difference after one use. I am alternating between this and 14k gold (which I was using alone previously). It feels great going on and does not leave that eeky greasy feeling after. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t smell that great after tanning like the 14 k gold does. All in all I really like the designer skin products better than anything else and at the amazon prices who can beat it? My salon charges 50-70 bucks so I feel like I got a great deal. Will be returning for more.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great! It gradually tans me and it doesn&#x27;t turn my skin orange like some of the lotions I have used in the past. Not even at my wrist, ankle, and foot areas. My skin doesn&#x27;t even feel as dry. I would recommend it for anyone!!!</li>
            <li> I received this item today (on time) but it was USED! Crusty product on the lid and on the bottle. Disgusting! Who knows who used this and returned it only to be sold again to ME! How in the world do you think that is OK??? BUYER BEWARE!</li>
            <li> I have actually had a bottle of this for YEARS now &amp; it&#x27;s still effective. It is the best accelerator I have ever tried. I&#x27;m gonna try and swtich it up and try a new one this time. I&#x27;m getting Golden Ceremony by Designer Skin......hope it does even better!! I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Instant results, very pleased! Best so far, makes me wonder if there is anything better than this out there! I&#x27;m open to suggestions on something that can beat this :)</li>
            <li> Like I mentioned before I feel like i&#x27;m losing my tan with this product. I have a very good tan right now but am wishing to get darker. this is not the right product for that, not for me at least. I guess its good for the casual tanner but not so much for the experienced tanner...</li>
            <li> This was the first tanning lotion I ever tried once I started tanning.  The salon sold it for at least three times the Amazon price.  I like the smell and it did give me really good color.  However my skin did have more of an orange tint to it the more I used it.  My best friend swears by this lotion and it is the only one she will use!</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this lotion for my fiance to use before going to florida for 2 weeks- he used it a few times, but doesnt like going tanning, so eventually it became mine :) I love this lotion now and i&#x27;m so glad i started using it!   This is a perfect lotion for anyone- its a great starter lotion to build a base tan and at the same time it works amazing for advanced tanners too. The bronzer in this lotion are not orange or fake looking, it gives you a really nice natural dark color. You dont have to be as cautious and careful with wiping your hands after application.  I have run into no trouble at all with streaking or staining. This lotion def made my top 5 favorite lotions list! I would even say i like it better then Luminary. And the smell is amazing!! It smells like Bath and Body works Warm Vanilla Sugar. It is by far the best smelling tanning lotion i have ever used (....ive used, ALOT) it is a very light scent too, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Relatively dark bronzer, I was going 2 times a week to maintain the tan and got too dark, so I had to cut it to once a week. Has a nice smell after tanning, but that&#x27;s a personal preference.</li>
            <li> I first bought this item in the tanning salon and paid $48 for it. I found it on here and paid half. I was so happy and it works just as great! It has bronzers in it but it doesn&#x27;t streak, smells good, and moisturizes! Wouldn&#x27;t get anything else.</li>
            <li> Made by Designer Skin but not the big price of their upper line stuff....I so go for this one for your money&#x27;s worth. Love it!</li>
            <li> I loved this lotion! It smells great and I got really dark with it. I will definately buy it again.</li>
            <li> Had been using another tanning lotion that did a much better job. Lotion is thin, doesn&#x27;t mosturize and smell is overpowering, scent gets on clothes and even after washing you can still smell lotion in clothes. Can&#x27;t tell that it has any bronzer in it. Overall feel that I would get just as good of a tan from laying in bed with no lotion at all.</li>
            <li> Does what it says, works great!!! Would recommend to everyone, saw results in a couple of days! Thank you Designer Skin!!!</li>
            <li> This was the first lotion I ever used, I&#x27;ve tried many others and always have gone back to this one. Gives you a dark natural looking tan that lasts. Love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave you all greasy. I have sensitive skin and break out in hives very easily and this lotion doesn&#x27;t give me hives. I would reccomend this to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on easily and seems to moisturize well, but I find the scent to be unbearable.  It goes on kind of nice smelling - a little like chocolate with a tiny hint of mint - but the scent changes into a sickly sweet smell after tanning.  I find that the smell is so unpleasant that I&#x27;m having to wash it off soon after tanning - which defeats the bronzer part of the lotion.  It seems that my hunt for the perfect lotion continues!</li>
            <li> Great Lotion but if you tan everyday I can make you orange. It&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;re only going 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> THIS LOTION IS THE BEST.....I&#x27;VE USED IT FOR 2 YEARS, FOR INDOOR AND OUTDOOR TANNING. I LOVE THE SMELL.  ITS CREAMY AND NOT OILY. IT GIVES YOU SUCH A FABULOUS BRONZE COLOR AND YOUR TAN LOOKS SO NATURAL.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe real tanning lotion comes sealed anyhow...the reason I wonder if it is real is because it smells like all tanning lotioins do if you know what I mean...like the tanning oil stuff. My girl works at a salon and she loves it so I&#x27;m going to give it 4 stars and say it&#x27;s great as she is the expert not me.</li>
            <li> I have trouble tanning. Sometimes I find that I can be dark the day I tan, then wake up the next day and be light again. This lotion is the only one that gets me dark and lets me stay dark. I am fair skinned to begin with, but I rarely burn. I highly recommend this lotion to get great color. No orange shade at all... always a brown natural looking tan.  Doesn&#x27;t smell too good after tanning, but that&#x27;s not very important to me since I do not tan on breaks at work or anything like that. Definitely buy it if you are having trouble tanning or just want a nice natural color.</li>
            <li> I believe Designer Skin didn&#x27;t give this lotion as much credit as it deserves on the description of the bottle. It has sooo many good ingredients for your skin including...caffein (good for cellulite),almond oil, olive oil, bannana extract, carrot seed oil, hemp seed oil, black walnut extract, white birch, milk thistle, jojoba seed oil, black cohosh, soy protien , white tea extract...and not to mention DHA. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this lotion is that it has a very strong musky smell!</li>
            <li> I used to work at a tanning salon and was fully aware of exactly what the product should look and smell like when I purchased it from the seller. Having never bought tanning lotion online before I wanted to be sure this was a trust worthy company. Good news - they are! Not only did my product arrive EARLY (and with a free sample of another lotion), it was the real thing and nothing had been tampered with.    I highly recommend buying from this vendor when wanting to buy tanning lotion outside of the salons. The salons do highly mark up their pricing ($90 for lotion? I don&#x27;t think so)and try to tell you if you buy outside the salon, &#x27;it&#x27;s not the real thing&#x27;. Save your money and get the real thing from this vendor. The wait is worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of different tanning lotions. I think that this one delivers as far as tanning goes. It gets me darker than other lotions I have used, but it smells bad. To me it smells like the mystic Tan spray, or something similar. I would not buy it again after my bottle is gone because of that reason. There are better ones out there in the same price range.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for a while and I first found Worship Me about 2 years ago. I noticed results after the first time I used it and I developed a nice brown color that I have never had from another lotion. Worship Me makes my skin soft and smooth. I know I can use it if I want to get good color. Everybody&#x27;s skin is a little different and people definitely have different preferences about scent but I think the fragrance is very nice. I have even had people ask me what kind of perfume I wear after I&#x27;ve been tanning and I always tell them how great Worship Me is! I sometimes alternate with other products just to try them but I haven&#x27;t found one that I like as well as Worship Me. Also, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than many other products that don&#x27;t work as well. I always keep some on hand because I know I can trust it to give me the kind of tan I like. I definitely recommend Worship Me!!</li>
            <li> This is very good lotion that works well and smells good.  It arrived exactly as expected and works as expected.</li>
            <li> The best word to describe this lotion is \\&quot;generic\\&quot;: generic smell, generic consistency, generic results. I wasn&#x27;t unhappy with it but it&#x27;s not something I would spend a lot of money on.</li>
            <li> This is a great bronzer...you get instant color and it smells awesome!!! Love designer skin lotions.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion for just getting started on the tanning season.  It gives a great base tan for a lower price before moving up to a stronger bronzer.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t one of the high silicone content lotions for the darkest tan possible, but it has great ingredients and smells really good.  One of my favorite things about it is the consistency; it spreads a lot without being overly greasy like Tao is.  As for full tanning effect, I&#x27;m not too sure.  I use different lotions every day for a broader spectrum of UV, but as far as I know Luminary and Obsidian are supposed to give the darkest color.  The problem with that is that it takes twice as much Luminary to cover my body as it does a lotion like this.  Australian Gold&#x27;s Sinfully Dark spreads even further with an even less greasy feel, but the price is about the same and from what I&#x27;ve been able to gather Designer Skin is tops when it comes to tanning.  All in all a great lotion for the Amazon&#x27;s price, and I&#x27;ll recommend this lotion to anyone willing to spend a decent amount for a decent tan.  I have a bottle of Luminary, Smile, You&#x27;re Dark, Tao, JWOWW by Australian Gold, and I think the next I&#x27;ll be trying is Obsidian which is top of the line Designer Skin.  My skin is getting so dark that a nurse at my doctor&#x27;s office asked me recently if I was mixed.  &#x3D;p</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple/different indoor tanning lotions, and this one works the best for me.  It produces a nice, dark color.  Nothing orange or fake.  The quadruple bronzers just seem different than other high end lotions. They just work better. The manufacturer describes the scent as \\&quot;warm tropical sugar,\\&quot; and I feel that&#x27;s accurate.  No indoor tanning lotion smells great when it contains a bronzer, but results are all that matters. I would not hesitate to purchase this again!  Designer Skin does make the best tanning lotions, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this designer skin product.  It can be used in indoor tanning beds or outdoors.  Items were shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Black market. I smelled and tried the same lotion from a tanning salon. Totally different. I think that the lotion was deluted with another cheap lotion. Not worth the money and not the real thing!</li>
            <li> When I first started tanning I was pretty pale and I&#x27;ve been going for a month and I only goes 3 days a week. And this lotion has gave me great results I get complimented all the time on how I have very nice color now. I started tanning because I was going on a cruise soon and thought it was going to take a while for me to get a nice tan but with this product I received a very nice tan and quickly. I highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion. The smell is amazing, I have compliments after I get out all the time. Goes on super smooth and you don&#x27;t have to use alot. The bronzing is great to help you get a base tan, especially in a bronzing bed.Would def buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and either couldn&#x27;t find it in stores or it cost way more than it should.  Here, I bought it at a reasonable price and it came very quickly via mail.</li>
            <li> Love the smell doesn&#x27;t turn on my skin and gives great protection inside or outside tanning.Highly reccomend it to all.</li>
            <li> I decided to try some different lotions and purchased this off of Amazon. It is a nice thick lotion with a pleasant scent. It doesn&#x27;t have as strong of a bronzer as some others I&#x27;ve used but I didn&#x27;t turn red. It also won&#x27;t stain your clothes. It is a good value for the money. I use it even when I am not tanning as a moisturizer for winter dry skin.</li>
            <li> Okay.. for starters. I love the smell This stuff is amazing. It works great. I&#x27;m a new tanner so its a great starter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.......NOT TO MENTION THE PRICE! My salon is literally selling this at 105% mark up................................. Seriously?! Who pays that much .. For tanning lotion? I laugh at the idea.. Ha HA HAAA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But no really this stuff is great. I&#x27;ll buy more no doubt about that. Guilt free purchase.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very thick which is good because it moisturizes like crazy. However, and I&#x27;m not really sensitive to smell, it smells horrible. It smells like vasiline and old perfume. I spent the money so I&#x27;m going to try to just deal with it. I would not purchase again only because of the strong unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> I got mines from \\&quot;TheeTanman\\&quot; on Amazon. I am 19 guy and been tanning since I was 16 and all I have to say is this product is such a good lotion! I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times and I swear it has tanned me so swell, It smells like honey and something else which is actually a nice smell for both guys &amp; girls, I don&#x27;t mind the girly frutie smells myself but this lotion is made for both genders and no after tan odor at all *AWSOME*. I have used sooo many tanning lotions   (Tao, Aphrodisiac, Paint It Black 50X, Insanely Black 60X Tingle, Sun Skin Spa, Sinfully Black 15X, 3othear lotions,) And by far this is the best lotion that gets me dark but the winner in best smell \\&quot;TAO\\&quot;. I think it would get me to dark that I am going to have to take turns between SINFULLY BLACK &amp; WORSHIP ME so I can get a nice brownish with an orangie tint so it can look natural. The shipping was slow I ordered Wednesday and received Monday...  Deffenetly worth the money AND BTW IT LEAVES THE SKIN SUPER SOFT WITH NO STREAKS I EVEN PUT IT ON MY FACE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this Worship Me tanning lotion a couple of times and need to use more times to have a better judgement. It does smell mildly nice - nothing funky. It&#x27;s glides on easily and provides a light moisturising layer while and for right after you&#x27;re done tanning. I did notice a tan - but not sure how much the lotion helped or if it was just the bed itself. I would rather use this instead of nothing at all.</li>
            <li> Used this trying to tan up for a trip to Mexico, as well as in Mexico, and then over the summer, and I think I&#x27;ve used better enhancers. I really didn&#x27;t feel like I got much extra tanning power out of this.</li>
            <li> Very good lotion. I used this last year and got a really good tan. The only bad side is the smell, its a little too perfumy to me and the smell stayed with me all day. But over all a good product.</li>
            <li> This is a great tanning product!   It smells great, and spreads very easy on your skin, without using alot.  Great color!</li>
            <li> Okay, I bought this item as a first time Tanning Salon patron. I had never been before and I wanted a product with good reviews to help my tan along. I am very finicky about scents, and this one smells beachy and lovely. I REALLY love the smell of this one. Most of the time, lotions smells make me nausous. I like this smell.     This product comes with a large bottle and I appreciate that. However, I wasn&#x27;t that impressed by the amount of color I&#x27;ve gotten with it, I do burn, and I have a somewhat orangish tint to me, perhaps due to the bronzing agent in it? Overall, I was expecting more color to come out of this product, at least more color on my skin. But the smell alone is enough to make me want to keep using it.     The lady at the salon recommended I not use lotion for the first like 7 visits, so I refrained for at least 3, then I started using this product. I&#x27;m not VERY impressed but I am somewhat impressed.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth and doesn&#x27;t make a mess or feel greasy like some lotions! And after I get done tanning, I actually smell really good rather than burnt and nasty. I would definitely recommend this lotion to any guy! I get a natural looking tan from this as well, never burnt.</li>
            <li> Designer Skin puts out quality skin care products, and this one is too. For me, I don&#x27;t really like the texture or scent as much as others, but I gave it a four because I think that&#x27;s personal preference. The lotion worked.</li>
            <li> This smells good and is a good size bottle. It works well and I would buy it again at a later time.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see any results on my fair skin</li>
            <li> **NEVER BUY LOTION FROM A SALON!!!** I needed new tanning lotion and I was looking around at what they had at the place I tan but all of them were ridiculously expensive. Thank goodness I decided to check on Amazon because the exact same lotions are literally HALF the price or LESS! I don&#x27;t know who prices lotion in salons but it&#x27;s highway robbery. This lotion was definitely better than the cheapy stuff I had before. It is smooth and creamy, smells nice and gives great results.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best tanning lotions I&#x27;ve ever used.   I would highly recommend it to everyone. It is one of the best values offered as well.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews for this lotion and was excited to try it. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t stain but is just ok possibly good. I have a decent base tan and I am halfway through the bottle and see some color but not all that I had hoped for... I feel like I have to use more than in the past for other lotions. I guess it is on to the next one.....</li>
            <li> love this stuff will always use it to tan with smells great and goes on great. very good stuff to tan with</li>
            <li> gets u tan quick, I recommend to everyone trying to get tan quick</li>
            <li> My wife feels this is the best for her. It arrived nicely packed even before we before we thought or needed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Worship Me lotion.  It is the best smelling and best overall lotion I have ever used.  My color has boosted significantly just after 2 tanning sessions with this lotion. The after tan smell is great too! The price was extremely reasonable compared to the tanning salon. I highly recommend this lotion to every tanner!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful- you get great colour that lasts longer than other lotions. The SMELL however is awfully reminiscent of mystic tans. And it lingers... for about as long as the colour.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product have using many Designer Skin lotions previously, I was very disappointed with this one however. The smell was just so so, leaving a nastly after tan smell. Also, I noticed I didn&#x27;t get any decent color when using it. The bronzers left my skin alost greyish in color not golden. I switched to Bellezza, loving the result I get from that one. The only good thing about this product was that I stayed moisterized and it was a big bottle.</li>
            <li> I stopped tanning for a few years, and when I decided to start up again, I bought this \\&quot;Worship Me\\&quot; bottle of tanning lotion, and it works great! I got to be pretty pale, so I needed something to help me gain a tan quick. After just 3 sessions I&#x27;m super dark! It smells really good too!</li>
            <li> I used this all last summer in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first trip to the tanning bed, they told me I had to purchase this, but would give me trial tube first time. I never went back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was $80 in the salon and at the time I purchased it on Amazon, it was on sale 2 for $50, so I bought 2. Still have one left because it doesn&#x27;t take much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the sun, you tan immediately. A nice bronze tan that others comment on.</li>
            <li> I first started tanning about two years ago. I started out using Smile, Your Dark by Designer Skin. Pretty much an entry level lotion. Loved the scent. I wish this one had the same but it&#x27;s still a decent scent. After I had a base going I needed a stronger bronzer. I found this one to be a solid performer based on the great reviews it had gotten and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. Customer Service at Designer Skin is awful. I tried contacting them on a few occassions regarding suggestions for legs that don&#x27;t tan and they never got back to me. I need to find a tingler lotion for my legs since they don&#x27;t tan. Otherwise, this lotion is an excellent bronzer!</li>
            <li> I do like the hint of musk in it. The smell isn&#x27;t bad.  My boy friend likes it.  It is a little to \\&quot;beach-y\\&quot; of a scent for me though.  I didnt see a noticable difference in darkness of my color from one use of this \\&quot;BOOSTER.\\&quot;  As for the optimizing complex and quad-bronzer.. I DEFINITELY do see a noticable \\&quot;healthy/rosy glow\\&quot; after one use. I do look more golden.. Also hydrates my skin nicely... not drying.  a lot of intersting ingredients in this lotion and in tanning lotions in general.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone know of any good ones without parabens or alcohol.. etc?&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a nice lotion but I dont love it.&lt;br /&gt;The beautifully black lotion made me way darker and is WAY cheaper. and smells better.  The love notes lotion smells amazing, and makes my skin feel like silk until I wash it off but doesnt make me darker just more golden kinda like this lotion. And is also much cheaper.  Just see my other reviews if youre interested in those other lotions.</li>
            <li> I use Designer Skin products all the time but was very disappointed in this one.  The smell is very strong and kind of stinky and I didn&#x27;t see any major results in my tan.  I like Smile You&#x27;re Darker a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, this is my all time favorite tanning lotion. Gives great color &amp; doesn&#x27;t make you smell bad after tanning. Everbody that tans should use this lotion. THX</li>
            <li> Delivered faster than expected, but cap was not sealed, just covered over plastic bag. I have used this product in the past, but seemed different. The smell is ok in the beginning but unless u really scrub yourself with a brush or something after a shower, the smell does not go away and has weird funky smell later. The tan, i use a strong tanning bed, was still the same as ordinary lotions. This is only good for beginners in my opinion.</li>
            <li> A very nostalgic scent, and it has great results. I definitely recommend this to others. worth the cost, for sure!</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine. I have never really found a tanning lotion where i just wanted to say &amp;#34;this is by far the best&amp;#34; so this is just as good as most to me. I just never by the stuff that is too cheap. The price and quality is good for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for the last 7 years I&#x27;ve tanned.  I am very familiar with the way it is supposed to look and smell.  When I ordered a new bottle on Amazon as usual I should have gone with my previous seller but the price was cheaper here so I chose this one.  When I received the bottle it was in the same packaging as normal and smelt pretty much the same.  The scent was a little stronger then normal but I didn&#x27;t think too much of it.  Then I used it for the first time and realized the shade of brown is not what it normally is.  I started to get a little suspicious because I have heard of people ordering some type of beauty product online and receiving a fake product in the mail that had the same packaging but was left without major ingredients that make the product so good.  I then used the lotion about 3-4 times a week for 3 weeks and tried to give it a shot.  As I expected the lotion did absolutely nothing for me.  I realized I got my first fake beauty product!  Normally this tanning lotion is amazing and one of my favorites to use so I was pretty bummed out.  Not sure if this seller gives out fake bottles often or not so beware of ordering here...</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. To me it has a licorce smell to it, which isn&#x27;t too bad. No streaking and I look nice and tan after using it.</li>
            <li> great product, fast shipping, great service.  love the lotion, smells good and work wonderfully.  will order again while tanning in tanning bed</li>
            <li> Just received the lotion today and tried it out soon after, I&#x27;m a beginner at tanning and saw how much my friends were paying at the salons and got this at a good price considering:) I love the smell not real strong and didn&#x27;t feel greasy first use I see a bit more color then I&#x27;d thought and we will see how the next few times go. I&#x27;m happy with this product and recommend it to anyone :)</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend of mine who likes to use a standing high-pressure tan bed.&lt;br /&gt;Personally haven&#x27;t used it (other than to help apply it, teehee) but they loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They had used another kind from the same brand but really enjoyed this one primarily because of the smell, it has a sweet subtle smell where as the last one they used had an overpowering cherry smell and they couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it off.. this stuff, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She seems to be getting darker and loves this stuff so.. second-hand review from me to you, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also: The other kind they got from the same company was twice as much at a salon/spa place locally so the price was also great.</li>
            <li> Good product, always liked Designer Skin brands, only thing has a real strong scent that stays with you for awhile, but gives you some color first time using, price half of what salons charge so Good Buy...Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I was sceptical about using a tanning lotion that wasnt a tingle but this works just as good without the itchiness. Leaves skin smooth and supple.  Smells good going on but not so much after you tan. You cant beat the quality of the tan you get though. One of my new favorites.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!! I took this to a high end tanning salon to compare this product to the same product they carry for $60. Before even opening it, when comparing the outside of the bottles it is very easy to tell that they are not from the same manufacturing company. The label on the salon&#x27;s bottle was perfect, and the label on the bottle I got from here was stretched, faded in some spots, and wrinkled. The cap was not made out of the same material either. So we opened the bottles and poured a little bit of each into a little plastic cup and again there was a BIG diff. The smell was not anything alike, the color was diff and the consistency is diff as well. I DO NOT recommend buying this especially if you are paying to tan at a salon because you are wasting money with this product!!</li>
            <li> Smells phenomonmonmon and I don&#x27;t look orange. By far my FAV</li>
            <li> Love it! I had hit a plateau and used this lotion once and saw an immediate change, probably an entire shade difference. Definitely love it!</li>
            <li> This product works great. I noticed a difference in just one session of use and it got me really dark. With that being said, I absolutely hate the smell and cannot use the product. I ended up giving it to my roommate, the smell does not bother her at all. If you are not too sensitive to smell this lotion will be great for you.</li>
            <li> The best tanning lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin smelling really nice. I like it much better than the one I ordered with it. In the first use my skin got a nice tan.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that I ordered this product after my Fiance&#x27; had bought a similar one from the same seller, This smells so good! Warm vanilla-sugary and maybe a bit of smokiness to it. His also smells so good too...\\&quot;Hero\\&quot; a very  light fresh cologne. Neither have been over-powering.  They glide on so smooth, its not watery like some are, and it also feels like it protects. I cant say that I have gotten super brown from this product, but I think its going into that direction. We also both have very fair skin, and its working.:)</li>
            <li> Bought this product from theetanman and it works perfectly. No orange color at all. Got compliments from my friends that this is the tannest they&#x27;ve ever seen me. I love it. Will definitely by again.</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong..its not aweful if you like a brown sugar..vanilla..type smell. My biggest disappointment was that I couldn&#x27;t see a difference with the bronzer.  I mean it is like it doesn&#x27;t have any bronzer in it at all. I have used other bronzers that work way better. I even tried not washing my hands after applying just to see if I got the bronzer streaks between my fingers and hand creases...nothing. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad bottle...but I will not buy this again. I basically got bottle of scented lotion.  I will update if I notice it helps any with UV/sun  tanning. As of right now I give it 1star because I expected it to be a good bronzer.</li>
            <li> I ordered designer skin worship me and i love it! I used it twice in one week laying outside and i could tell a significant difference. And it was shipped fast, i received it 3 days after ordering. I will be buying again! :)</li>
            <li> This sunless tanner has a great light fragrance and creates a great tan even after just a few minutes in a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> This was a pretty decent lotion, it had a nice pleasant scent that wasn&#x27;t too overpowering and for having a bronzer it didn&#x27;t leave any funky streaks or make my skin look orange. Overall it worked nicely, I would say it&#x27;s more of a beginners lotion as it didn&#x27;t have any intensifiers and it didn&#x27;t help me tan any faster than normal.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is basically your run-of-the-mill lotion. Same &amp;#34;tanny&amp;#34; smell but a little goes a long way. Has many moisturizers as well.</li>
            <li> i really like this tanning lotion it smells great and goes on perfectly. also so much cheaper than in the salon i saved quite a few bucks</li>
            <li> As a guy I&#x27;m worried about stuff that&#x27;s not specifically targeted to men so I don&#x27;t smell girly.  This has a nice subtle coconut (I think) odor that fades quickly.  The aroma is not overpowering in any way and people are unable to smell it until they get very close.  I wore it all day after tanning and got a comment after a hug that I smelled wonderful but she was unable to smell it until that point.  It absorbs quickly and didn&#x27;t leave me greasy or make me breakout but left me nicely moisturized for the remainder of the day.  I used it on my face and was expecting to have a few pimples as that&#x27;s common (I have a quite oily face), but had NO issues with this at all.  This is a great product for men and women and every body part.  It didn&#x27;t turn me orange (I believe it has bronzers).  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Received this order fast. Tried it once so far, for a 10 minute stand up tan and I could tell right away I was darker. The smell is amazing and didn&#x27;t make my skin greasy or dried out. I will keep using it and probably order another bottle once this one is done.</li>
            <li> Just received my lotion last week, already used it twice. So far I love it! It smells amazing, as well as helps with my tan. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have an easy time tanning but this product really helped me get an even color throughout and an amazing tan color not that orange look.</li>
