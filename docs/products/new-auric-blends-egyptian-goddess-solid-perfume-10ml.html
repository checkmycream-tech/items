    <ol>
            <li>The scent is still wonderful</li>
            <li>Very nice, I like solids.</li>
            <li>What has happened to this once beloved scent?</li>
            <li>good one-time purchase.</li>
            <li>Smells great but not any better than the oil and the oil is cheaper</li>
            <li>but i still love it!</li>
            <li>An amazing fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love , love.</li>
            <li>It came in a roll on, and nothing has compared after spending $$$ and many dissapointing returns.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen this fragrance in solid perfume before, and it&#x27;s delightful.  </li>
            <li>I love EG, but will stick with the roll-on version of this</li>
            <li>Smells lovely and lasts</li>
            <li>I like the oil better</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both love this scent.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as the oil.</li>
            <li>A very nice solid perfume, though not as strong as i would like</li>
            <li>thanks so much for a great item</li>
            <li>I enjoy E Goddess in all forms and the solid is a great addition to the collection.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this E Goddess solid perfume.  </li>
            <li>The vendor shipped it very fast.</li>
            <li>I got this because I love the oil version, but find it very, very strong - too obtrusive for common wear.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last as long as the perfume oil but smells wonderful all the same .</li>
            <li>is the classic EG scent, but it somehow disappears from the skin more rapidly than the roll-on version; plus, there&#x27;s a very tiny amount in the jar--pretty as the jar</li>
            <li>I thought it would be convenient for traveling or touchups on the go, but it really doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have much smell at all.</li>
            <li>Need to use quite a bit for the scent to last, but it&#x27;s also nice when added along with other of my fragrances.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very soft and feminine fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is a lot softer and more subdued...and has the added bonus of being much less likely to leak in pocket or purse.</li>
            <li>I have been searcing high and low to replace my egyptian goddess</li>
            <li>I love this scent, I was just a little disappointed that the scent wasn&#x27;t very strong, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t re-order.  </li>
            <li>I take away one star because when first applied, there&#x27;s an unpleasant plastic note to the scent, though happily it seems to fade swiftly into a subtle version of the oil&#x27;s scent.</li>

            <li> Although E Goddess is not a strong fragrance, the new solid is a winner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t realize 4 grams was so little for the price..</li>
            <li> Hardly detectable.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering, but subtle.</li>
            <li> Very faint aroma.</li>
