            <li>Great price and keeps me smelling clean and not like onions.</li>
            <li>Works well and has a very mild, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I saw fewer bumps in just a couple of days and now I am irritation free and loving it!</li>
            <li>I really am happy with this product, and I think the cost is definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>I decided to go with a clinical strength deodorant a month ago and since most don&#x27;t have nice scents I chose Dove&#x27;s Cucumber scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent was nice and refreshing without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would never find a product that could be able to help me.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>One of them stained the marble on top of our dresser.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the way Dove Clinical Protection works.</li>
            <li>and I am unwilling to spend extra money on a superb product in faulty packaging.</li>
            <li>I love the scent as well.</li>
            <li>Love the deodorant.</li>
            <li>Love getting the tailback so that I never seem to run out, and a way better price than from the store.</li>
            <li>I still buy this despite these issues because there&#x27;s nothing better on the market</li>
            <li>I apply it once, as directed, and it lasts for a full day (or more!)</li>
            <li>This one is an excellent product, helps not to wet the clothes for the excess of sweat.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend to try this one.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it works really well for me and the scent is really nice.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, but the fact I am dry is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great product, but it seems they still have to work on it.</li>
            <li>This is a great buy here compared to your local store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooth glide on</li>
            <li>It really works!!!</li>
            <li>it didnt even have to be hot out!!</li>
            <li>Mild fresh cucumber aroma, very clean.</li>
            <li>It is light, fresh, and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It was quite a lot more effective than the regular stuff.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try Dove Clinical Protection, Cool Essentials.</li>
            <li>(combo of mild sweat and deodorant - yuck, right?!?  </li>
            <li>This does nothing but keep me so fresh and so clean.  </li>
            <li>-It dries quickly after being applied.  </li>
            <li>allergies and sensitivities to scented stuff, this one isn&#x27;t strong and really has a clean scent to it.</li>
            <li>I am very hot natured</li>
            <li>-I still smell nice at the end of the day or after being outside.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the wetness protection, and it doesn&#x27;t cause my underarms to breakout the way Secret Clinical Strength did.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>want an antiperspirant and deodorant that will work with my fluctuating body temperature and keep me feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li>Unlike many of the reviewers, I purchased this not because I was part of a special program to try new Amazon products, but because I was really searching for something that works.  </li>
            <li>I sweat right through it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always applied antiperspirant in the morning after my shower, so it did feel strange doing it this way, but it is well worth getting used to it so that it will work effectively.</li>
            <li>There are no white marks, no burning on my armpits (Even after shaving), just smooth, lightly scented,</li>
            <li>I used the regular Dove Cool Essentials before, and while it smelled nice in the tube, it didn&#x27;t smell nice under my arms after an hour or two of hard work.  </li>
            <li>First one I had worked like a charm until I went camping.</li>
            <li>so anyway ;))</li>
            <li>It started off messy smelled good at first after awhile</li>
            <li>This Dove Clinical Strength really delivers!  </li>
            <li>I was also pleased with the fact that I had no residue on my clothing……no white marks!  </li>
            <li>It is gentle on my skin, helps me to sweat less, and it smells so good.</li>
            <li>I went back to my old favorite antiperspirant, Dove Cool Essentials, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years, and would still be a happy customer today if the container wasn&#x27;t oozing a clear oily substance all the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this for a long time - was my favorite antiperspirant/deodorant.  </li>
            <li>The night was cool, nowhere near freezing though, it was summer.</li>
            <li>It smells refreshing and keep you dry all day.</li>
            <li>It really does what it says it will.</li>
            <li>I contacted Dove and they were very apologetic, offered to send me a replacement coupon.</li>
            <li>This product really does what it says.  </li>
            <li>I would buy this again in a heartbeat and really wish I had found it sooner.  </li>
            <li>I even was ready for surgical removal of sweating glans.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent.  </li>
            <li>I really like this scent.</li>
            <li>After over a year of not using any anitiperspirant (just used deodorant), I&#x27;ve been going through a very stressful period in my life and began having profuse armpit sweating.</li>
            <li>i had a real problem with one armpit perspiring ALL of the time.</li>
            <li>it really works to stop sweat.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes too much.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really &amp;#34;sweat&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>However, my most recent container of it has been leaking this oily, clear liquid out the bottom.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work better than any other Antiperspirant/Deodorant I&#x27;ve used, so I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re getting what you&#x27;re paying for here.</li>
            <li>have super sensitive skin and have been using a men&#x27;s clear gel for a year.</li>
            <li>I achieve odor control by layering the regular Cool Essentials.  </li>
            <li>Biggest thing for me is that it does not leave ANY residue of clothes, even tight fitting.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the extra cost to not have to apply a cheaper deodorant 3x a day!</li>
            <li>product is very pricy compared to its regular strength counterparts, but it is something I am willing to keep around.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for protection and for that feeling fresh feeling all day long...</li>
            <li>I went on a job interview the other day and stayed nice and dry!</li>
            <li>The second one I bought broke within the first week.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>After trying many other deodorants, this is the one I finally settled on.  </li>
            <li>This product keeps me smelling fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not especially sweaty, but I work outdoors for a large part of my job.</li>
            <li>Other deodorants have strong, perfumey smells or leave white</li>
            <li>I have heard that some people had had problem with their clothes getting stained but thus far, it hasn’t happened to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I probably won’t use it everyday due to the price, but it will be nice to have for those days when you are expecting a high level of stress, anxiety or physical exertion.</li>
            <li>If I just put it on at night, then the regular Cool Essentials in the morning, I still get the wetness control, and minimal odor control.</li>
            <li>next purchase resulted in the same problem, at that point I decided to contact Dove, a company that spends millions of dollars a year to tell us how much they care about their customers.</li>
            <li>I had the same experience as others-the packaging leaks all over the place and makes it gross to touch the whole outside.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that I have to be suuuuuuper careful to not get it on my shirts when applying it because it is a soft cream, not a solid stick like most deodorants.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it will leave deodorantmarks on your clothes if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Negative? It does leaves white marks on dark colored shirts if you apply too much.</li>
            <li>and I have tried to many products to try and slow the sweating down.</li>

            <li> Other deodorants have strong, perfumey smells or leave white</li>
            <li> I have heard that some people had had problem with their clothes getting stained but thus far, it hasn’t happened to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I probably won’t use it everyday due to the price, but it will be nice to have for those days when you are expecting a high level of stress, anxiety or physical exertion.</li>
            <li> If I just put it on at night, then the regular Cool Essentials in the morning, I still get the wetness control, and minimal odor control.</li>
            <li> next purchase resulted in the same problem, at that point I decided to contact Dove, a company that spends millions of dollars a year to tell us how much they care about their customers.</li>
            <li> I had the same experience as others-the packaging leaks all over the place and makes it gross to touch the whole outside.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I have to be suuuuuuper careful to not get it on my shirts when applying it because it is a soft cream, not a solid stick like most deodorants.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it will leave deodorantmarks on your clothes if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Negative? It does leaves white marks on dark colored shirts if you apply too much.</li>
            <li> and I have tried to many products to try and slow the sweating down.</li>
            <li> and I imagine makes the product not last as long as well.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is long lasting and gives me the protection that I need for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Secret is every bit worth the extra money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also switched all my other Dove items to different brands, how can I support a company that won&#x27;t even reply to a simple question?</li>
            <li> I rarely ever leave bad reviews, but I just had to share that this product really does not work for me.</li>
            <li> and I am dry all day.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant has keep me extremely dry and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> its dry dry dry from here on out!</li>
            <li> but I found very little difference between this extra strength product and the standard Dove deodorant products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT the dispenser leaks out the bottom and leaves a big oily mess on the surface it sits on.  </li>
            <li> Despite showers and d.o., I was used to wet pits and stink</li>
            <li> Wasted money with entire deodorant still inside.    </li>
            <li> - I don&#x27;t perspire heavily, just wanted extra odor control and this takes care of it.  </li>
            <li> It works for 8+ hours and leaves me with absolutely no scent or odor.</li>
            <li> i was constatnly irritated by the wet mark that would happen to my clothing...</li>
            <li> and I have not received any reply at all other than the automatic \\&quot;we&#x27;ve received your message and will be contacting you shortly\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It covers up odor almost as well as I would like it to, but about as well as any other deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, this is one to stay for now.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why I waited so long to try this</li>
            <li> BUT  when I tried this one for 10 days, I was confused and surprised.</li>
            <li> Smelled nice, but I hated how my underarms felt when I used this.</li>
            <li> I can only use certain scents under my arms or it will smell so bad.</li>
            <li> Other deodorants dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li> No true odor control was achieved until I started layering.  </li>
            <li> I had to reapply it often and it would still leave me a little stinky at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I never found out if this product worked because the \\&quot;click dial\\&quot; delivery of the product through the little plastic holes didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy this product again for these two resaons: messy and no customer service.</li>
            <li> Why would you want to be stinky and sweaty just to save a few bucks?</li>
            <li> I had problems with heavy sweating for 25 years, and yet no solution.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re suffering from body odor you have to try Secret clinical strength as it is the ONLY deodorant that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really messy</li>
            <li> This is not cheap stuff</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing it out - a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It takes very little to do the job.</li>
            <li> I have always had excessive sweating under the arms</li>
            <li> This is the products I have been using for the past 6 months because it works so well.</li>
            <li> After just a couple of days of using it, I had no more armpit sweat.</li>
            <li> started noticing the issue about a year ago, and thought it might just be a bad batch and just put a big paper towel under the container to sop up the oily mess.</li>
            <li> This deodorant will make you forget to sniff your armpits over worries you might have stinky and sweaty armpits after a day&#x27;s hard work.</li>
            <li> It hardened and was very hard to squeeze through.    </li>
            <li> I have been using Secret or Degree clinical strength deodarant.</li>
            <li> since switched to Secret Sport Clinical Protection, and it works just as well.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have a too-strong smell like some clinical strength deodorants (secret).  </li>
            <li> I never had body odor before until I started using Nuvaring, and then suddenly I had really bad body odor!</li>
            <li> I have given it a few chances, thinking maybe I had gotten a bad container, but they all leak.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I never received it.    </li>
            <li> So disappointed because it seems this leaking issue is a very common problem.</li>
            <li> It was still a hassle because the oil would get on my hands when I twisted the dial, and it was nearly impossible to wash</li>
            <li> i found this (very expensive in pharmacies/grocery store)...</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This product was so terrible.</li>
            <li> However, it does have terrible packaging.  </li>

            <li> I am not sure why I waited so long to try this but L.O.V.E.  Despite showers and d.o., I was used to wet pits and stink (combo of mild sweat and deodorant - yuck, right?!?  I use this at night and I am dry all day.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s happened since I was 5!  I have even used it in the AM and it seemed to work just as well.  The scent is nice, but the fact I am dry is amazing!  I am hooked!</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant ever.&lt;br /&gt;I have super sensitive skin and have been using a men&#x27;s clear gel for a year. I had to reapply it often and it would still leave me a little stinky at the end of the day. Other deodorants have strong, perfumey smells or leave white marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant does none of those things. I apply it once, as directed, and it lasts for a full day (or more!) even after yard work, errands, and a workout! There are no white marks, no burning on my armpits (Even after shaving), just smooth, lightly scented, protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best. It&#x27;s well worth the extra cost to not have to apply a cheaper deodorant 3x a day!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product.  It really does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> The deodorant itself is great. It doesn&#x27;t give 100% protection, but I don&#x27;t think anyone expects that. Biggest thing for me is that it does not leave ANY residue of clothes, even tight fitting. Everything I tried before left marks (even if the product claimed not to), eventually ruining my clothes.    I&#x27;ve had two of the Dove Clinical Protection deodorants and here&#x27;s why there&#x27;s 4 out of 5 stars in my review.    First one I had worked like a charm until I went camping. The night was cool, nowhere near freezing though, it was summer. In the morning I discovered the consistency of the deodorant changed. It hardened and was very hard to squeeze through.    The second one I bought broke within the first week. The turning wheel could be spun infinitely and no product came out. Wasted money with entire deodorant still inside.    I contacted Dove and they were very apologetic, offered to send me a replacement coupon. Needless to say, I never received it.    Overall, it&#x27;s a great product, but it seems they still have to work on it. I switched to Degree.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year now and I find it works well - I don&#x27;t perspire heavily, just wanted extra odor control and this takes care of it.  BUT the dispenser leaks out the bottom and leaves a big oily mess on the surface it sits on.  I have given it a few chances, thinking maybe I had gotten a bad container, but they all leak.  When I e-mailed the company to ask if this was going to be addressed, they never replied to me, so I assume it will be an ongoing problem, AND I am irritated that they didn&#x27;t have the courtesy to reply to me.  Won&#x27;t buy this product again for these two resaons: messy and no customer service.</li>
            <li> Unlike many of the reviewers, I purchased this not because I was part of a special program to try new Amazon products, but because I was really searching for something that works.  I used the regular Dove Cool Essentials before, and while it smelled nice in the tube, it didn&#x27;t smell nice under my arms after an hour or two of hard work.  It also didn&#x27;t keep me from perspiring.      This product really does what it says.  It&#x27;s different from the regular Dove product in the following ways:    -It is dispensed through holes in plastic, it&#x27;s not a stick.  -It dries quickly after being applied.  -I do not notice it getting white streaks on clothing, as I did with the regular one.  -It&#x27;s not as  silky/creamy as the regular one.  -It prevents or severely limits perspiration!!!  -I still smell nice at the end of the day or after being outside.  -The scent is lighter than the regular product.    I really am happy with this product, and I think the cost is definitely worth it.  Why would you want to be stinky and sweaty just to save a few bucks? I would buy this again in a heartbeat and really wish I had found it sooner.  It will extend the life of my clothes.</li>
            <li> I thought I would never find a product that could be able to help me.  I had problems with heavy sweating for 25 years, and yet no solution. Nothing could help me. I even was ready for surgical removal of sweating glans. But my physician recommended to use \\&quot;Dove Clinical Protection\\&quot;, which I did with no enthusiasm, just to prove that nothing works for me. BUT  when I tried this one for 10 days, I was confused and surprised. IT IS WORKING. WOW! I strongly recommend to try this one. I have been using it for 6 months now and it has literally changed my life.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite antiperspirant. Works well and has a very mild, pleasant scent. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Great product.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works great but the containers leak oil on the bottom. One of them stained the marble on top of our dresser. So disappointed because it seems this leaking issue is a very common problem.</li>
            <li> This one is an excellent product, helps not to wet the clothes for the excess of sweat.</li>
            <li> I rarely ever leave bad reviews, but I just had to share that this product really does not work for me. I never had body odor before until I started using Nuvaring, and then suddenly I had really bad body odor! It was incredibly embarrassing. I used Dove deodorant for years, the solid version as well, and even Dove&#x27;s clinical protection did not work for me at all. Even if it kept me a bit drier than without deodorant, the odor was still there and would not go away. If you&#x27;re suffering from body odor you have to try Secret clinical strength as it is the ONLY deodorant that has worked for me. It works for 8+ hours and leaves me with absolutely no scent or odor.</li>
            <li> I have been using Secret or Degree clinical strength deodarant. The deal Amazon had on Dove was awesome. It costs $9 in a store. I use it more often, but the price is great</li>
            <li> excelent item as described</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the wetness protection, and it doesn&#x27;t cause my underarms to breakout the way Secret Clinical Strength did.  But, as for odor protection?  I still have a stinky armpit.  I achieve odor control by layering the regular Cool Essentials.  I used it according to the directions (2 clicks, in the evening); started using 3 clicks, morning and evening.  No true odor control was achieved until I started layering.  If I just put it on at night, then the regular Cool Essentials in the morning, I still get the wetness control, and minimal odor control.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the way Dove Clinical Protection works. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years, and would still be a happy customer today if the container wasn&#x27;t oozing a clear oily substance all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started noticing the issue about a year ago, and thought it might just be a bad batch and just put a big paper towel under the container to sop up the oily mess. It was still a hassle because the oil would get on my hands when I twisted the dial, and it was nearly impossible to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next purchase resulted in the same problem, at that point I decided to contact Dove, a company that spends millions of dollars a year to tell us how much they care about their customers. I sent them the specifics of the problem, including lot and batch numbers from the two containers I had. I waited 3 weeks and hadn&#x27;t received a reply, so sent another email. No reply. Another 4 weeks and I sent a third email. It&#x27;s been 3 months and I have not received any reply at all other than the automatic \\&quot;we&#x27;ve received your message and will be contacting you shortly\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since switched to Secret Sport Clinical Protection, and it works just as well. I&#x27;ve also switched all my other Dove items to different brands, how can I support a company that won&#x27;t even reply to a simple question?</li>
            <li> Great product. As a nurse who works 12hr shifts, I know this lasts (well I hope so anyway ;))</li>
            <li> I have tried several deodorants including organic ones to help with the red bumps and burning after applying. I decided to go with a clinical strength deodorant a month ago and since most don&#x27;t have nice scents I chose Dove&#x27;s Cucumber scent. It is light, fresh, and I really enjoy it. It works perfectly as well. I saw fewer bumps in just a couple of days and now I am irritation free and loving it! It is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative? It does leaves white marks on dark colored shirts if you apply too much.</li>
            <li> Other deodorants dried out my skin.  This does nothing but keep me so fresh and so clean.  Doesnt clump, doesnt get on my clothes.  After trying many other deodorants, this is the one I finally settled on.  It covers up odor almost as well as I would like it to, but about as well as any other deodorant.  I recommend subscribing to this product.  I have it shipped every 3 months and get an additional discount.  Check it out.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it works really well for me and the scent is really nice. However, my most recent container of it has been leaking this oily, clear liquid out the bottom. It&#x27;s really messy and I imagine makes the product not last as long as well. This is not cheap stuff and I am unwilling to spend extra money on a superb product in faulty packaging. I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to for some time. I really like the scent.  It works great for me.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used this for a long time - was my favorite antiperspirant/deodorant.  Have stopped only because of price.  works good tho.</li>
            <li> This made my underarms feel chalky and pasty. It was quite a lot more effective than the regular stuff. I&#x27;m not especially sweaty, but I work outdoors for a large part of my job. Smelled nice, but I hated how my underarms felt when I used this.</li>
            <li> This product was so terrible. It started off messy smelled good at first after awhile it gave off a skunk smell. Yuck! I never had that happen before. I gave it one star cause I had to. I have tried different clinical deodorants just to see if I can save some money. Secret is every bit worth the extra money!</li>
            <li> The best deodorant I have found. I love the scent as well. This deodorant gets the job done!</li>
            <li> This smells oh so good.  A great product by dove.  It smells refreshing and keep you dry all day. I highly recommend this product for protection and for that feeling fresh feeling all day long...</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work better than any other Antiperspirant/Deodorant I&#x27;ve used, so I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re getting what you&#x27;re paying for here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing! I always had sweat spots from the smallest amount of activity, I put this on before I go to bed and once in the morning and I&#x27;m good for the rest of the day! I love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing deal! Love the deodorant.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is long lasting and gives me the protection that I need for an affordable price. I really like this scent.</li>
            <li> doing the job I thought it would!</li>
            <li> I have always had excessive sweating under the arms and I have tried to many products to try and slow the sweating down. This is the products I have been using for the past 6 months because it works so well. It is gentle on my skin, helps me to sweat less, and it smells so good. I can only use certain scents under my arms or it will smell so bad. This product keeps me smelling fresh all day long. I buy it in bulk on Amazon and use it daily. The price is good in my opinion as well.</li>
            <li> Mild fresh cucumber aroma, very clean. And works great!  Love getting the tailback so that I never seem to run out, and a way better price than from the store. Would be awesome if amazon placed it on subscribe &amp; save!</li>
            <li> Works great. The only downside is that it will leave deodorantmarks on your clothes if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> Works great even for men.</li>
            <li> After over a year of not using any anitiperspirant (just used deodorant), I&#x27;ve been going through a very stressful period in my life and began having profuse armpit sweating. I went back to my old favorite antiperspirant, Dove Cool Essentials, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I sweat right through it. So I decided to try Dove Clinical Protection, Cool Essentials. It really works!!! After just a couple of days of using it, I had no more armpit sweat. I went on a job interview the other day and stayed nice and dry! I followed the directions and applied it before going to bed. The protection does NOT wash off if you shower in the morning. I&#x27;ve always applied antiperspirant in the morning after my shower, so it did feel strange doing it this way, but it is well worth getting used to it so that it will work effectively. Give this product a try and use it as directed. You won&#x27;t be disappointed! Also, excellent price here on Amazon! I paid $8.99 for one in the supermarket.</li>
            <li> i had a real problem with one armpit perspiring ALL of the time. it didnt even have to be hot out!! i was constatnly irritated by the wet mark that would happen to my clothing...until....i found this (very expensive in pharmacies/grocery store)...its dry dry dry from here on out! AND it smells great</li>
            <li> This deodorant will make you forget to sniff your armpits over worries you might have stinky and sweaty armpits after a day&#x27;s hard work. It&#x27;s reliable and trustworthy. As soon as you put it on, it starts working. It takes very little to do the job. The only complaint I have is that I have to be suuuuuuper careful to not get it on my shirts when applying it because it is a soft cream, not a solid stick like most deodorants. Other than that, this is one to stay for now. It works until I take a shower and rinse it off!&lt;br /&gt;With allergies and sensitivities to scented stuff, this one isn&#x27;t strong and really has a clean scent to it. [:</li>
            <li> Great price and keeps me smelling clean and not like onions. lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order again. Price was lower than I paid before. Excellent condition, shipped on time.</li>
            <li> This product works so well, isn&#x27;t sticky or rub off.  Has a very pleasant fragrance and one can feel confident.  They are different fragrances.</li>
            <li> doesnt work as well as the dove i buy in the store</li>
            <li> The product is great.  it doesn&#x27;t have a too-strong smell like some clinical strength deodorants (secret).  it really works to stop sweat.  it doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes too much.  However, it does have terrible packaging.  I had the same experience as others-the packaging leaks all over the place and makes it gross to touch the whole outside.  this is especially a problem when traveling-I always put it in a ziplock.  I still buy this despite these issues because there&#x27;s nothing better on the market</li>
            <li> This is a great buy here compared to your local store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant works great. Smooth glide on</li>
            <li> I never found out if this product worked because the \\&quot;click dial\\&quot; delivery of the product through the little plastic holes didn&#x27;t work.  I ended up throwing it out - a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been really impressed with this product.  I am one of those people you work with who likes to keep the temperature around 65 degree in the office and I freeze everyone to death!  I am very hot natured but I don&#x27;t really &amp;#34;sweat&amp;#34; a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want an antiperspirant and deodorant that will work with my fluctuating body temperature and keep me feeling fresh.  This Dove Clinical Strength really delivers!  I have been using it for about 3 or 4 days and I can tell a big difference.  This deodorant has keep me extremely dry and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the change in the formula to make the product “clinical strength” I was worried that the consistency would be yucky but I found very little difference between this extra strength product and the standard Dove deodorant products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent was nice and refreshing without being overpowering.  I was also pleased with the fact that I had no residue on my clothing……no white marks!  I have heard that some people had had problem with their clothes getting stained but thus far, it hasn’t happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very pricy compared to its regular strength counterparts, but it is something I am willing to keep around.  I probably won’t use it everyday due to the price, but it will be nice to have for those days when you are expecting a high level of stress, anxiety or physical exertion.</li>
