            <li> I have such dry sensitive skin and this stuff is perfect for it, goes on thick, last long and does not irritate my skin.

            <li> Makes me skin feel so soft and alive</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It makes your hands feel silky but not greasy. It&#x27;s my go-to lotion. I&#x27;m totally gunna buy it again.</li>
            <li> I agree wholeheartedly with all the other reviews.  There just isn&#x27;t a better product on the market.  I am in my early 50&#x27;s and remember \\&quot;Gold Bond\\&quot; as a product my grandmother used.  I also remember it not having the most pleasant of smells when applied.  This lotion is marvelous feeling going on and hours later still feeling the same.  I have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin with dryness in the \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone.  This product has made my hands look like a teenagers again.    I have tried MANY products - both MORE expensive and the same price and nothing compares.  I am hopeful that the manufacturer of this product realizes what they have on their hands and won&#x27;t change the ingredients or stop making this product.  I paid $8.00 for mine.  I just hope the price doesn&#x27;t sky rocket - but you know - I&#x27;m always willing to pay for a product that works.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and this seems to be the only lotion that helps. This is a very good product that helps eliminate dry skin without that greasy feel.</li>
            <li> The lotion is great  for the neck area and the arms. After about two weeks of using the lotion on the neck, there is a visible difference  with less wrinkles. Best lotion I have used, and I have tried many of them. This is the best</li>
            <li> This lotion is the only thing that works for my dry hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is even better than some prescription steroid creams from my dermatologist. I highly Recommend this one!</li>
            <li> Though I have started using it just recently I am convinced of its richness. It certainly works miracles for dry skins without making them greasy or oily. I think this is the wonder therapy for dry skins.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion....I do not have rough skin to start but it does get dry and itchy this lotion keeps me from being dry or itchy from the time I put it on my skin til I take my next shower. It has a soft light scent so if you wear perfume it will not affect that and it you don&#x27;t or can&#x27;t it smells great on it own. It&#x27;s my new must have. I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Happy with moisture content. Pirce is a little expensive. I could go with Jergens shea butter but I would still recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great for softening skin and feels so good on your hands when applying it. I use it on my feet and it does a really good job of keeping my feet soft.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time! And the lotion is amazing, keep my skin extra hydrated about 24 hours. Love it!</li>
            <li> Gold Bond is the best around. If you&#x27;ve got dry skin and you don&#x27;t want to smell too flowery, you can&#x27;t go wrong. It&#x27;s super thick yet it dissolves quickly right into your skin so you don&#x27;t look or feel greasy. Even after you&#x27;ve wash your hands, they still feel moisturized. You don&#x27;t need a lot; this cream is RICH a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;ve got a manboy or just a regular boy in your house who doesn&#x27;t like to wear creams because they leave him \\&quot;stinky\\&quot; then this is the lotion for him.</li>

I discovered this lotion and it has much such an incredible difference in my skin. It&#x27;s not greasy like some other lotions I&#x27;ve tried and that&#x27;s a definite bonus for me. It has a very, very light cocoa butter scent to it so I can put it on and  it worry about my perfume or body spray not mixing with it. If you&#x27;re looking for a new lotion thrn this is it!</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the moisturizing wash and I definitely notice a difference, it absorbs quickly no greasiness left on skin and leaves skin feeling super soft and smooth all day</li>

            <li> I have very dry skin especially around my fingernails. I purchased this product because it contains urea. It goes on thick but not greasy. It soaks in well and lasts quite a while.</li>
