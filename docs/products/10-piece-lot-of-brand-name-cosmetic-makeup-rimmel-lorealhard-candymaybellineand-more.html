            <li>Had nice brands.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!!!</li>
            <li>I love the stuff I got</li>
            <li>so it was ok, but would not have purchased something like this for myself.  </li>
            <li>Products were ok.</li>
            <li>but i love make up</li>
            <li>this isnt for everyone if your a person eho stays with one look ect prob not for you bit if you love make up</li>
            <li>I love this package is like a surprise</li>
            <li>Ehhhhh I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with the items I received, it was ok</li>
            <li>Its an ok lot.</li>
            <li>Wish it was more varirty</li>
            <li>but it was ehhh ok</li>
            <li>tje lipsticks melted from the summer heat in the mail the shadows very high quality very pleased</li>
            <li>Lots of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;, but not much that was very good quality or particularly useful.  </li>
            <li>Just looking at the picture I can tell that 90% of these items I know for certain are available or were recently available at the dollar tree.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Alright we would be nice to get a little more things</li>
            <li>you like it nice quality only thing</li>
            <li>The items were new, still wrapped and a good variety of different things.</li>
            <li>only one thing was showen, I love the quality</li>
            <li>I love it all and would definitely get again.</li>
            <li>those are all the exact some ones that you can walk into a dollar tree and purchase for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The eye pads, the eyeshadow little black books, the proffusion eyeshadow pallets, most of the physician&#x27;s formumla, all of the NYC and L.A. Colors stuff, The soft lips stuff, the uddely smooth cream, all the nail stuff except the color quick, and a good chuck of those lip glosses.  </li>
            <li>lip gloss is more for an older woman and not a teen</li>
            <li>then highly think you should order this.</li>
            <li>Everything was new &amp; shipped like 3 days after I ordered it.</li>
            <li>I got the package early and opened it up</li>
            <li>and it was all old makeup.</li>
            <li>They should really post a picture with literally 10 items because people might think 10 peaces of different brands of make up that&#x27;s what I thought</li>
            <li>i would prefer less lipgloss and my lipsticks more pink and red</li>
            <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t to say they&#x27;re BAD, but really, save yourself some money and just go to Dollar tree and buy them, and make sure you get colors you like and will wear.</li>

            <li> Had a little bit of eveything u need with different colors for different skin tones.</li>
            <li> but Hey to everyone giving it bad reviews... it&#x27;s pretty much a surprise lot.</li>
            <li> but it came with only a little</li>
            <li> So I could only use a little before the makeup ran out.</li>
            <li> The wet slicks</li>
            <li> but the skin stuff was to dark</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get what I was expecting half didn&#x27;t even have brands on them</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money!</li>
            <li> BAD only junk came with this was not happy at all.</li>
            <li> but I think that they should email u for ur skin color or somthing and the rest be random</li>
            <li> It is terrible, mine came with tiny travel sized makeup.</li>
            <li> Some makeup came broken :(</li>
            <li> I was a lil worried because of bad reviews</li>
            <li> Honestly disappointed</li>
            <li> My daughter was quite disappointed with this package.  </li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t get what I was expecting half didn&#x27;t even have brands on them and it was all old makeup. Waste of money I didn&#x27;t get any products of the brands listed. It was all a bunch of junk</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this! It is terrible, mine came with tiny travel sized makeup. So I could only use a little before the makeup ran out. It&#x27;s a waste of money!</li>

            <li> I recommend it, it&#x27;s a very good quality. People always ask me where I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a variety of beautiful make up.</li>
            <li> None of the items I received from this lot were ANY of the brands listed. Some items were repeats and nothing was name brand. Honestly disappointed</li>
            <li> Will be buying this again. Love it!</li>
            <li> I can use each color sent to me as if they had an idea of my skin color. Thank you I am glad I bought this beautiful gift for myself</li>

            <li> My daughter was quite disappointed with this package.  Lots of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;, but not much that was very good quality or particularly useful.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Ehhhhh I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with the items I received, it was ok</li>

            <li> I like what I received</li>
            <li> Its an ok lot. Had nice brands. Wish it was more varirty but it was ehhh ok</li>
            <li> There were many fake brands that I cannot even gift...</li>
            <li> i was very happy with the 10 items that were chosen for me. The items were new, still wrapped and a good variety of different things.</li>

So u were expecting to get stuff that u didn&#x27;t plan to get. I love it all and would definitely get again. Had a little bit of eveything u need with different colors for different skin tones. Everything was new &amp; shipped like 3 days after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing ever. I got it for my girlfriend and she loved it, it your looking for good quality for cheep then highly think you should order this.</li>

            <li> They should really post a picture with literally 10 items because people might think 10 peaces of different brands of make up that&#x27;s what I thought</li>
