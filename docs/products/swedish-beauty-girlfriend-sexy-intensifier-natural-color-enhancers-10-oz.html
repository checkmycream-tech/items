            <li>I love the smell of it! :)</li>
            <li>The color is nice, scent is not overpowering and no horrible smell after you are done tanning.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin nice and silky with a light, sweet, and attractive scent.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>I am VERY light skinned and dont tan..</li>
            <li>Love this  tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this lotion and it never feels greasy.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I was just expecting more from this after hearing everyone rave about it.</li>
            <li>It smells just as wonderful as the extender, which is enough for me to continue using it.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good deal and great smell.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been tanning for many years now</li>
            <li>One of my favorite to use.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light skinned and don&#x27;t tan very easily.  </li>
            <li>but this one is my new favorite to use because the smell is so great</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the Girlfriend Sexy Extender, so I decided to try the tanner.</li>
            <li>I tried a sample of the Girlfriend Sexy and really liked it mainly because it didn&#x27;t break me out and did not stink.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>The smell and texture are fantastic and it helps boost your tan without making it look too brownish.</li>
            <li>It gives you more of a golden tone.</li>
            <li>It kind of smells like gently roasted marshmallows after you&#x27;ve tanned.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m significantly darker</li>
            <li>Smells great like the other Swedish product.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>I tried this lotion in the tanning salon and knew I liked the smell and product in general..</li>
            <li>Exact lotion that I tested in the tanning salon!</li>
            <li>, i saw this online and was like wow awesome half off</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bronzer, but more like an enhancer, makes your tan look natural.</li>
            <li>I have the most sensitive skin known to man and this lotion only leaves my skin feeling silky soft and smelling amazing!</li>
            <li>The only thing that they all have in common that&#x27;s good is that they smell good.</li>
            <li>The product smells AMAZING and sinks right into the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seriously incredible, especially because the scent doesn&#x27;t change after you tan with it on, like some other lotions tend to do.  </li>
            <li>Sounds absurd, but smells SO delicious.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid tanner and am used to tingling and bronzing lotions but was looking to intensify my tan</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little sweet, but not TOO sweet, and not sickeningly so.  </li>
            <li>The lotion itself smells AMAZING and makes my skin really silky soft, which is a big plus.</li>
            <li>It does enhance your tan and really help prevent unevenness &amp; whatnot.  </li>
            <li>So you know your real color aftrr your tanning session.</li>
            <li>I would like smething that makes my tan really</li>
            <li>be careful for fakes the real stuff is thick and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>This did help me build a good base tan, but I feel that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s good for.</li>
            <li>It definitely leaves my skin sillllllkkkyyyyyyy smooth and soft after every use.  </li>
            <li>I live in MN and am wondering if it froze in the mail</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite for quality, since I haven&#x27;t seen as much of a difference in my color when I tan as I do with other lotions, but it&#x27;s not really a bronzer anyways.</li>
            <li>FYI, I got my lotion at a professional tanning salon, not on Amazon.</li>
            <li>An intensifier that didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and gave me a natural looking tan result.</li>
            <li>and my skin is soft.</li>
            <li>As for actual effectiveness, I&#x27;d most likely give it a 4.5 out of 5: I was tanner after the first use, but after that it definitely takes a little bit of time to build</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it such a low rating is because I didn&#x27;t get much of a tan boost when I used this lotion.</li>
            <li>Of course, if you&#x27;re someone who wants to look as dark as a Samoan, this might not be intense enough for you.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like to use my tanning lotions on my face (simply because I like a nice, even tan, but I don&#x27;t want to pay the extra money for a lotion specifically for my face), but every time I have put this lotion on my face, it&#x27;s actually pretty painful.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t make me that dark either, but I am going to try it again now that I have got over the plateau.</li>
            <li>I only give it 2 stars because it has a good smell and doesn&#x27;t have a bad ato.</li>

            <li> I did see a difference in how much darker it made me in just a few visits!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not sure if it&#x27;s just because the skin on my face is sensitive, it&#x27;s just that no other lotion has done that</li>
            <li> However, unlike a few of the other reviews, my lotion is thick and creamy, which I love.</li>
            <li> I love amazon to start off, but she told me a lot of times that the place you order it from tamper with it and its not really the product in it, and they put random stuff and pee in it.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4/5 is because I think it may be too harsh for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve only been using this lotion on my legs and upper body and the rash has gone down.</li>
            <li> Being an esthetician, I&#x27;m an ingredient junky and this product has solid ingredients that actively work to hydrate the skin so your skin doesn&#x27;t feel parched after playing in the sun.</li>
            <li> It falls into the same category as the other products that I rated on, the Tan Extender and the other Tan Lotion.</li>
            <li> However, the texture is really gritty and leaves little chunks on my body when I put it on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to be soooo careful with application, etc.</li>
            <li> It is fairly thin, which I like because you don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li> Tanning lotion bottles were heavily wrapped and sealed but upon removing wrapping the bottles had heavy wear and appear to be used, I bought three different kinds also.</li>
            <li> But whenever I get out, my cheeks are a little pink, the burning sensation goes away after about 10-20 minutes</li>
            <li> I used this one before I got the Kardashian  Glow Dark Bronzer.</li>
            <li> I was already dark but wanted to be darker</li>
            <li> Like another poster said it does have a grainy-ness to it which is odd but again...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been tanning for less than a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little uneasy about</li>
            <li> It is a little concerning to me considering it&#x27;s not a tingling lotion.</li>
            <li> My stomach does have a little rash</li>
            <li> However, this had some little flecks in it.</li>
            <li> So my bottle came and i opened it and cap was messy with lotion like on the bottle under the cap and on the cap, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days now, and I&#x27;m getting tanner a lot quicker than I was when I was using Ravish Me.</li>
            <li> is how harsh this product is.</li>
            <li> Its an intensifier and not filled with all that bronzing stuff.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that I basically got it here for half the price of the ones in the store!</li>
            <li> It is very odd.</li>
            <li> (Usually see this lotion selling for $50 in tanning salons)</li>
            <li> I am hard to tan, but these seemed to help me keep the color.</li>
            <li> Get if you are new to tanning and need to develop a base tan</li>
            <li> This is one of the few tanning lotions I can use, that doesn&#x27;t make me feel nauseous or ill from the scent.  </li>
            <li> It feels like my face is burning, and it&#x27;s extremely uncomfortable, which is unfortunate because tanning used to be relaxing for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know.. :(</li>
            <li> I hate bronzers</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this because I smelt it at my local tanning salon. The smell is super awesome! I must admit I have a couple tanning lotions but this one is my new favorite to use because the smell is so great and it does help give you a great tan!</li>
            <li> Love it, smells and works great!</li>
            <li> Ihave not noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> Teen daughter loves it and she doesn&#x27;t have to sit out in the sun and damage her skin!</li>
            <li> Love this  tanning lotion.  It works good and has a great smell to it too</li>
            <li> This was not out of date, it is everything I purchased only it cost a baby fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> This product came wrapped , and had not been opened , I really liked that , I loved it , it made my skin look so good , and the price was great the best I had found ,, would order again</li>
            <li> Exact lotion that I tested in the tanning salon! 50% cheaper. Smells and feels amazing! I&#x27;m a lotion snob and I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product, as described..</li>

            <li> Good product.  Smells great like the other Swedish product.  I am hard to tan, but these seemed to help me keep the color.</li>
            <li> Tanning lotion bottles were heavily wrapped and sealed but upon removing wrapping the bottles had heavy wear and appear to be used, I bought three different kinds also. if seller corrects this, I will update</li>
            <li> My friend bought this at a tanning salon and I LOVED it, i saw this online and was like wow awesome half off so i ordered it. I then went to my tanning salon and one of the girls was trying to sell me a bottle there and I was like no I already have one i ordered on off amazon. I love amazon to start off, but she told me a lot of times that the place you order it from tamper with it and its not really the product in it, and they put random stuff and pee in it. So my bottle came and i opened it and cap was messy with lotion like on the bottle under the cap and on the cap, so I thought the tanning lady was just trying to scare me into buying her bottle, but the condition mine came in scared me. WHAT SHOULD I DO?!</li>
            <li> Great lotion for indoor tanning. The smell and texture are fantastic and it helps boost your tan without making it look too brownish. It gives you more of a golden tone.</li>
            <li> be careful for fakes the real stuff is thick and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Get if you are new to tanning and need to develop a base tan</li>
            <li> I am VERY light skinned and dont tan..this is a great way to build a base tan. I had mine after 4-5 sessions. Liquid lust by synergy is a great one as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days now, and I&#x27;m getting tanner a lot quicker than I was when I was using Ravish Me. However, unlike a few of the other reviews, my lotion is thick and creamy, which I love. It leaves my skin nice and silky with a light, sweet, and attractive scent.&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m a little uneasy about is how harsh this product is. I like to use my tanning lotions on my face (simply because I like a nice, even tan, but I don&#x27;t want to pay the extra money for a lotion specifically for my face), but every time I have put this lotion on my face, it&#x27;s actually pretty painful. It feels like my face is burning, and it&#x27;s extremely uncomfortable, which is unfortunate because tanning used to be relaxing for me. No lotion I have ever had has reacted quite like that on my face. But whenever I get out, my cheeks are a little pink, the burning sensation goes away after about 10-20 minutes and it&#x27;s fine. It is a little concerning to me considering it&#x27;s not a tingling lotion. I&#x27;m also not sure if it&#x27;s just because the skin on my face is sensitive, it&#x27;s just that no other lotion has done that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just FYI, I got my lotion at a professional tanning salon, not on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It falls into the same category as the other products that I rated on, the Tan Extender and the other Tan Lotion. The only thing that they all have in common that&#x27;s good is that they smell good.</li>
            <li> Great lotion and smells yummy. I use this all the time even if I don&#x27;t go tanning I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle so it must be good!</li>
            <li> Maybe I was just expecting more from this after hearing everyone rave about it. I have used it twice and I got burnt both times. It really didn&#x27;t make me that dark either, but I am going to try it again now that I have got over the plateau. The lotion itself smells AMAZING and makes my skin really silky soft, which is a big plus. I am gonna give it another try,</li>
            <li> I bought this at a tanning salon and have been using for almost a month going 2-3 times a week. The color is nice, scent is not overpowering and no horrible smell after you are done tanning. Like another poster said it does have a grainy-ness to it which is odd but again...I thought it was just my bottle. Must not be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it isn&#x27;t a tingly lotion and I do like it not being a bronzer...I don&#x27;t have to be soooo careful with application, etc.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing! I hate bronzers so that&#x27;s why I decide to go with an intensifier. I&#x27;m significantly darker and I&#x27;ve been tanning for less than a month. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4/5 is because I think it may be too harsh for sensitive skin. My stomach does have a little rash so I&#x27;ve only been using this lotion on my legs and upper body and the rash has gone down. Definitely recommend trying it out!</li>
            <li> Great lotion. I used this one before I got the Kardashian  Glow Dark Bronzer. Girlfriend sexy gives you great color.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the Girlfriend Sexy Extender, so I decided to try the tanner. It smells just as wonderful as the extender, which is enough for me to continue using it. However, the texture is really gritty and leaves little chunks on my body when I put it on. It&#x27;s not my favorite for quality, since I haven&#x27;t seen as much of a difference in my color when I tan as I do with other lotions, but it&#x27;s not really a bronzer anyways. Overall, a good deal and great smell.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few tanning lotions I can use, that doesn&#x27;t make me feel nauseous or ill from the scent.  It does enhance your tan and really help prevent unevenness &amp; whatnot.  Of course, if you&#x27;re someone who wants to look as dark as a Samoan, this might not be intense enough for you.&lt;br /&gt;  But I love it for it&#x27;s fragrance alone, nevermind the cheesy name of it.  &#x3D;)  It&#x27;s a little sweet, but not TOO sweet, and not sickeningly so.  It kind of smells like gently roasted marshmallows after you&#x27;ve tanned.  Sounds absurd, but smells SO delicious.  &#x3D;D  Try it!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells really good and is moisturizing. I also like the fact that I basically got it here for half the price of the ones in the store!</li>
            <li> I only give it 2 stars because it has a good smell and doesn&#x27;t have a bad ato. It smells like bubble yum bubble gum. The reason I gave it such a low rating is because I didn&#x27;t get much of a tan boost when I used this lotion. I am an avid tanner and am used to tingling and bronzing lotions but was looking to intensify my tan this product did nothing for me. I was already dark but wanted to be darker so maybe that&#x27;s why. This might be good for beginner tanners who knows?</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin known to man and this lotion only leaves my skin feeling silky soft and smelling amazing! Definitely amps up your color when tanning whether in the sun or in a bed. It is fairly thin, which I like because you don&#x27;t have to use as much. And it does NOT leave you greasy! Being an esthetician, I&#x27;m an ingredient junky and this product has solid ingredients that actively work to hydrate the skin so your skin doesn&#x27;t feel parched after playing in the sun. And for a price like this, who could resist?! (Usually see this lotion selling for $50 in tanning salons) Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> An intensifier that didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and gave me a natural looking tan result.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!! Its an intensifier and not filled with all that bronzing stuff. So you know your real color aftrr your tanning session. It is moisturing and smells good.</li>
            <li> I tried this lotion in the tanning salon and knew I liked the smell and product in general.. However, this had some little flecks in it. It is very odd. It&#x27;s like it has grains of sand in it. I don&#x27;t like that, but otherwise it&#x27;s a good lotion. I live in MN and am wondering if it froze in the mail and that&#x27;s when it happened. I don&#x27;t know.. :(</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion at my local tanning salon when they had it on sale. It is a great buy - even better with the pricing on here! I feel like it provides immediate color and you can&#x27;t beat the scent. I&#x27;ve been tanning for many years now and I can honestly say that I&#x27;ve never found lotion with a smell as amazing as this one.</li>
            <li> I have always used Swedish Beauty products. When I was in college I worked part time at a local tanning salon and got to know a lot about the products from the brand reps. I tried a sample of the Girlfriend Sexy and really liked it mainly because it didn&#x27;t break me out and did not stink. It&#x27;s not a bronzer, but more like an enhancer, makes your tan look natural.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me.  I wanted this because it didn&#x27;t have a bronzer.  I&#x27;m light skinned and don&#x27;t tan very easily.  It did smell good though, no burnt smell afterwards.</li>
            <li> Works Great! One of my favorite to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion mostly for how DELICIOUS it smells.  It&#x27;s seriously incredible, especially because the scent doesn&#x27;t change after you tan with it on, like some other lotions tend to do.  It definitely leaves my skin sillllllkkkyyyyyyy smooth and soft after every use.  As for actual effectiveness, I&#x27;d most likely give it a 4.5 out of 5: I was tanner after the first use, but after that it definitely takes a little bit of time to build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the smell and the silky smoothness, though, it&#x27;s definitely a staple for me!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and packaged well. The product smells AMAZING and sinks right into the skin. No greasy feeling at all and my skin is soft. Love it.</li>
            <li> Within two uses of this lotion I was already tan with no redness or burning... Great smell and great price here</li>
            <li> This did help me build a good base tan, but I feel that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s good for. i&#x27;m not seeing myself getting any darker.. It does smell good tho, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> It was ok. I would like smething that makes my tan really &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; more! I love the smell of it! :)</li>
