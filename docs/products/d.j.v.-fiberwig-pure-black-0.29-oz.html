            <li>This is the best mascara ever at stay put!</li>
            <li>I like this mascara--it does lengthen quite a bit and the curved brush is perfect to get your lashes coated from root to tip.</li>
            <li>It does add length and fullness, but the best feature of it is that it does not smear.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST I have ever used.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>

            <li>Best mascara ever.</li>
            <li>, I am just sooooooo happy I found it!</li>
            <li>And the best part for me, is that it doesn&#x27;t flake or run.</li>
            <li>This is the best mascara!</li>
            <li>BEST MASCARA FOR OILY SKIN IN HUMID AREA!</li>
            <li>This mascara is INCREDIBLE!</li>
            <li>As always Fiberwig is very good.</li>
            <li>One of the best parts about this stuff is that you don&#x27;t need eye make up remover to get it off, it comes off in warm water!</li>
            <li>Sometimes it goes on really beautifully.</li>
            <li>It does all it promises and looks great.</li>
            <li>This is a great mascara if you have oily eyes and are prone to smudging.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve done it for years and still have great lashes.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to locate it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great product if you want mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li>It has great staying power.</li>
            <li>Wish it held my curl better, but otherwise best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and I still will NEVER buy anything else, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>I heard good things about this mascara</li>
            <li>However, once it was on, it&#x27;s on for good until you take it off.</li>
            <li>NOW, there is Fiberwig which is 95% as good as Shiseido.  </li>
            <li>Depending on how good it is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend having a good eyelash comb to separate some if needed.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to survive on Blink which isn&#x27;t nearly as good.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great and it doesn&#x27;t smudge or come off if your eyes water, but it easily comes off with warm water!</li>
            <li>Favorite mascara ever!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I used to always buy two mascaras at a time, one to keep at my vanity, and one to keep in my purse for touch ups, but this product never needs touching up!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I will by a couple of more soon!</li>
            <li>Absolutely  love this product !</li>
            <li>oh so amazing.</li>
            <li>My eyes lashes look amazing.</li>
            <li>i also like the chantecaille mascara that smells like rose water.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever used, and it really is easy to get off with just warm water!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump or streak and it comes off very easily with warm water.</li>
            <li>Great mascara makes my short lashes look amazing!!</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was it seemed sort of &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; coming out of the tube, but I figured it was all of the wonderful fibers just waiting to bond with my eyelashes to make them full and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>I think that if the product was new, it would of been the perfect mascara</li>
            <li>You will never have to use anything but warm water to get it off, NO BLACK circles under my eyes at the end of the day ( that I always seem to get even with the best water proof)</li>
            <li>The is by far the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of lash-thickening maskeras and fiberwig is by far the best !</li>
            <li>anyone has a recommendation for a good cruelty free mascara that makes lashes look feathery, please leave a comment.</li>
            <li>anyone has a recommendation for a good cruelty free mascara that makes lashes look feathery, please leave a comment.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I read the reviews for this mascara, it seemed like the perfect &amp;#34;do-all&amp;#34; every woman wants!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to remove with warm water.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara</li>
            <li>(&#x3D;])</li>
            <li>It is a bit thicker and doesn&#x27;t contain as many fibers, but eventually you can get even the puniest lashes to string out.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me,  every time you wear eye makeup the under eye portion ends up with more makeup than your eyelid at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara and can&#x27;t find it in the stores any more.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this mascara goes on and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>and by the morning most of the fibers are gone</li>
            <li>And I know all the experts say don&#x27;t wear your mascara more than a day</li>
            <li>I had put off trying them because I was so in love with this product, and can officially say that this mascara beats them all.</li>
            <li>i LOVE this mascara --</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I am so glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Fabulous!  </li>
            <li>Problem is that I can not find it anywhere except Amazon any more.</li>
            <li>I also love that it washes away with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>love, love, love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this and plan to make it my mascara from now on.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>You can then layer volumizing mascara on top if you like.  </li>
            <li>I would give more stars.</li>
            <li>I really like the concept of this mascara, and it looks great on.</li>
            <li>I prefer a more feathery, separated-last look.</li>
            <li>My all time favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>Love It~~~  </li>
            <li>GREAT FOR SENSITIVE EYES!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use &amp; easy to take off with warm soapy water &amp; it never runs.</li>
            <li>The only kind I&#x27;ll ever use again!!</li>
            <li>I have NEVER tried a mascara that stays on better, and yet was so easy to remove.</li>
            <li>So it will take longer than most would like to achieve the best looking lashes, but it makes mine super long.</li>
            <li>This is the best mascara ever for someone who is active and works out a lot.</li>
            <li>and I want something that&#x27;s one-step and easy -</li>
            <li>It comes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily - and stays on until you wash it off with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>Never smudges and you can take it off so easily.</li>
            <li>It came off easy as well without having raccoon eyes</li>
            <li>It lengthens my eye lashes and washes off easily.  </li>
            <li>do like how easy it is to remove.</li>
            <li>Thank you to the wonderful girl at Sephora who recommended this to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For other ladies/people!</li>
            <li>Got it so quickly!  </li>
            <li>Goes on easy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Makes my lashes long and natural looking,  great for below lashes, doesn&#x27;t smudge and comes of so easily and nice!</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s a huge money and time saver.</li>
            <li>counter fit product DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but this one was worth it.</li>
            <li>It takes a few weeks of use to get to the consistency I like best - but works like a charm and lasts forever.</li>
            <li>Great, same formula as ever</li>
            <li>however, it is much cheaper than getting eyelash extensions at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;i love this product and was so glad to find it on amazon after sephora discontinued selling it.</li>
            <li>But I was so confident it was same good product as before and trow the package away.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I still love, LOVE this mascara for one main reason - NO panda eye.</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t go on just right the first time, lashes get thicker, more clumped together, and more spidery as you apply or attempt to comb through and separate them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is super easy to get off without damaging your lashes.</li>
            <li>It stays on the whole day and is very easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Easy and quick to use and gives you great Long Lashes!  </li>
            <li>It sure makes my lashes look long and nice.</li>
            <li>Truly hypoallergenic ...and absolutely, for real, does not smear or rub off on eyelids!!!!</li>
            <li>Also, it comes off easy with mild facial soap and warm water in &amp;#34;tubes.&amp;#34; Leaves no residue on lashes</li>
            <li>It might not be super volumizing but it does make your lashes look fuller without clumps or smudges.</li>
            <li>So much better than your regular mascara available in the U.S.!</li>
            <li>would be happy if it would come in Navy and Dark Brown, too.</li>
            <li>so much fuller, never smears, and comes off super easy.  </li>
            <li>Not cold water</li>
            <li>Might work better for those whose lashes are already naturally curled.</li>
            <li>People tell me my eyelashes are beautiful and even though they know I&#x27;m wearing mascara, they assume my natural lashes are long.</li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s worth the effort.</li>
            <li>this mascara only needs warm water to be taken off.</li>
            <li>and i think it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I originally fell in love with another brand of similar quality which my go-to beauty store decided to stop carrying.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t get dry and clumpy, and comes off so easily.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge but comes right off in shower.</li>
            <li>During my search for a good lengthening mascara that does not flake or smudge, I have tried easily in the double digits of different mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really use a comb, pin, or clean spoolie to separate your lashes after applying, because doing that makes the fibers pull out away from the lashes.</li>
            <li>if i want thicker, darker eyelashes for when i go out in the evening, i have applied other mascaras (christian dior blackout) over the fiberwig.&lt;br /&gt;i love that this products does not flake into my eyes (i wear contacts), it lasts all day without smearing and then easily washes off with warm water.</li>
            <li>Brush is always too full of product, and really didn&#x27;t make lashes look thicker or longer.</li>
            <li>Amazing my eye lashes are so long</li>
            <li>works well on lower lashes (clings right to them whereas most mascara just skips my bottom lashes and gets right on my skin), but it is a pain to apply (use a piece of paper or shield), and mustn&#x27;t be rushed, or the big brush makes it get all over (</li>
            <li>I have tried all manner of drugstore mascaras and high end ones such as Dior... and while many of them make my lashes look full, they all smear eventually on my face.</li>
            <li>I also take hot yoga</li>
            <li>This went in the trash after the first use.</li>
            <li>I tried to find a replacement for this as Sephora was no longer carrying it, but this is the only mascara I love.</li>
            <li>Very possible that I have defective eyelashes, but my Loreal Voluminous works much better.</li>
            <li>My friend brought this back from Japan for me &amp; I fell in love.</li>
            <li>It might be better for someone with short lashes.</li>
            <li>Not the same Fiberwig formula, this used to be my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>the neck where normally in most mascara&#x27;s take off the excess is not tight enough on this product so you get a wand full of mascara, and who wants to apply that right?</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t exactly thicken but certainly lengthens with each coat.</li>
            <li>Love Fiberwig and have used it for a long time.  </li>
            <li>but then easy to remove with regular face wash.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long lasting and fairly priced.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;You have to work fast to apply many layers while its wet, because once it starts to dry, the wand drags and product just piles up on top, with fibers going in all directions.</li>
            <li>True tubing mascara that I&#x27;ve used has given me major spider lashes, but I don&#x27;t have to worry about it with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Mascara snob and very picky with it.</li>
            <li>I found it very tricky to apply though.  </li>
            <li>Lengthened my lashes as promised, but did not keep a curl very well.</li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t tell the difference between my real lashes with this mascara and my extensions.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look real at all.</li>
            <li>And it really does lengthen dramatically.  </li>
            <li>That said, it really doesn&#x27;t work as well as some of the dime store brands (which are about 1/4 of the price).  </li>
            <li>I suppose if you have really sensitive eyes, this might be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lengthen very well and the brush tends to clump the lashes together instead of separating them.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It seems to be luck of the draw, depending on how much product is on the want when I pull it out of the tube.</li>
            <li>If you work too fast, however, it gets on the skin, or makes lashes stick together wet.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I can build however much I want with this formula and they don&#x27;t look like spider eyes.</li>
            <li>Very customizable mascara.</li>
            <li>so too much mascara comes out on the wand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first that really lengthens and when it&#x27;s time to take it off, you just wash your face normally</li>
            <li>It removes easily, and gives me long glamorous lashes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m taking a one month break from my eyelash extensions right now and my lashes are in the middle of their growth cycle right now.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t flake under your eye like most other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  </li>
            <li>You have to clean the brush of mascara about every fourth or fifth use because it gets gloppy.</li>
            <li>My thinning eyelashes are given new life and come off at night with a little warm water.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a huge plus, especially for people who live or work in humid/hot areas.</li>
            <li>Now, I need to find some decent eyeliner.</li>
            <li>seriously, i NEVER get raccoon eyes with this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I usually never spend this much money on mascara, but I bit the bullet and pretended I was Paris Hilton for a day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not meant to make your lashes super thick or long but it works great for me.</li>
            <li>Most of the fibers didn&#x27;t stick and the ones that did looked clumpy and messy.</li>
            <li>I have extensions, but when I&#x27;m looking pretty bare and need a fill, I use this stuff</li>
            <li>Usually, the first eye looks nice, then the second one is a mess.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>You can make your look natural or dark by applying more.</li>
            <li>and if you want the longest lashes possible you must wait after its dry then apply more then wait then</li>
            <li>AND it makes your lashes look super long.</li>
            <li>No clumps, and super duper long lashes.</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t live without this mascara.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really subtle and light, and is never going to hold a candle to those super volumizing brands.</li>
            <li>OR I can make it look very natural</li>
            <li>good news is, if you get it on your skin, you can usually just wait for it to dry, then flick it off with a q-tip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought for sure other mascaras would follow suit and use the same formula</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that isn&#x27;t going to come off without hot water and pressure, this isn&#x27;t the stuff, but it does stay on without flaking and smearing like regular mascara.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best mascara for those that want a tiny water resistance for the occasional rain storm that randomly occurs.</li>
            <li>No dark circles!!</li>
            <li>so I use the base with a different mascara applicator, because frankly the product itself is pretty darn good, long full lashes and no mess under the eyes,,,,,,,,,,,, so with a bit of work ladies you will enjoy this product,,,,</li>
            <li>When it dries (in just a few seconds) excess can easily be removed with a moist cotton swab.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so sad too that Sephora got rid of this mascara, it is hands down the BEST mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Oh and a little tip is using the tip of the mascara wand to do the bottom lashes and to extend the length to the tips of the top lashes once you put it on like you would regularly.</li>
            <li>Buy it today and you will be happily surprised At the glow it adds to you eyes.</li>
            <li>and you have the soft smudgy look like from a pencil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m outside too much.</li>
            <li>However, my tube must have been old.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this cosmetic is all natural.  </li>
            <li>You can apply multiple coats to really build up your lashes without clumping.</li>
            <li>(but all skinny brushes seem to do that to me), but I just chucked it and use a fat brush from another old mascara that I cleaned off.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stick like most mascaras, so I don&#x27;t have to tug at my delicate eye skin to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This gives a natural fuller, longer look without a lot of hassle and struggle.</li>
            <li>Fiberwig is not quite as lush as some, but stays put all day and night without a smear until I remove it with water.</li>
            <li>the softer, more subtle natural look is what i prefer.  </li>
            <li>I have super oily eyelids and whatnot, so every single mascara I&#x27;ve used before would inevitably lead to raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>, warm sweat will remove it a bit, sometimes leaving you with a few &amp;#34;eraser&amp;#34; like black dots under your eyes, no problem there, just wipe them off, NO black circles or smudging.</li>
            <li>The only con, takes longer to wash off, but not hard to get off like waterproof or anything.</li>
            <li>Like no other mascara</li>
            <li>I am a big laugher, and crinkle smiler, I guess, because my eye makeup very quickly is all over my face usually by the time I arrive to work.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m not careful, I end up looking like Tammy Faye Baker.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m not careful, I end up looking like Tammy Faye Baker.</li>
            <li>A little dusting of black eyeshadow on top</li>
            <li>I also love that it comes off in little tubes, instead of a smudgy mess.</li>
            <li>Cannot say enough about it, there is no other on the market like it.</li>
            <li>the first time i used this product several years ago, the fibers made my eyelashes appear long and pretty -- not overly voluminous and thick.  </li>
            <li>; The only thing is you will have to buy a new tube at least every couple of months; it does dry out quicker than regular mascara, but its So worth it, No reason for  buying mascara remover</li>
            <li>I have sparse tiny little light black lashes.</li>
            <li>this makes it a little pricier buy for a mascara -- although you&#x27;re not suppose to keep your mascara for much longer anyways.</li>
            <li>I just put a little oil or makeup remover on a baby wipe, dab it on my eyes, wait a minute, then gently pinch the mascara off.</li>

            <li> This is the best mascara ever at stay put!</li>
            <li> I like this mascara--it does lengthen quite a bit and the curved brush is perfect to get your lashes coated from root to tip.</li>
            <li> It does add length and fullness, but the best feature of it is that it does not smear.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST I have ever used.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>

            <li> Best mascara ever.</li>
            <li> , I am just sooooooo happy I found it!</li>
            <li> And the best part for me, is that it doesn&#x27;t flake or run.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara!</li>
            <li> BEST MASCARA FOR OILY SKIN IN HUMID AREA!</li>
            <li> This mascara is INCREDIBLE!</li>
            <li> As always Fiberwig is very good.</li>
            <li> One of the best parts about this stuff is that you don&#x27;t need eye make up remover to get it off, it comes off in warm water!</li>
            <li> Sometimes it goes on really beautifully.</li>
            <li> It does all it promises and looks great.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara if you have oily eyes and are prone to smudging.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve done it for years and still have great lashes.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to locate it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product if you want mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> It has great staying power.</li>
            <li> Wish it held my curl better, but otherwise best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and I still will NEVER buy anything else, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> I heard good things about this mascara</li>
            <li> However, once it was on, it&#x27;s on for good until you take it off.</li>
            <li> NOW, there is Fiberwig which is 95% as good as Shiseido.  </li>
            <li> Depending on how good it is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend having a good eyelash comb to separate some if needed.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to survive on Blink which isn&#x27;t nearly as good.  </li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and it doesn&#x27;t smudge or come off if your eyes water, but it easily comes off with warm water!</li>
            <li> Favorite mascara ever!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I used to always buy two mascaras at a time, one to keep at my vanity, and one to keep in my purse for touch ups, but this product never needs touching up!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I will by a couple of more soon!</li>
            <li> Absolutely  love this product !</li>
            <li> oh so amazing.</li>
            <li> My eyes lashes look amazing.</li>
            <li> i also like the chantecaille mascara that smells like rose water.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever used, and it really is easy to get off with just warm water!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump or streak and it comes off very easily with warm water.</li>
            <li> Great mascara makes my short lashes look amazing!!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was it seemed sort of &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; coming out of the tube, but I figured it was all of the wonderful fibers just waiting to bond with my eyelashes to make them full and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> I think that if the product was new, it would of been the perfect mascara</li>
            <li> You will never have to use anything but warm water to get it off, NO BLACK circles under my eyes at the end of the day ( that I always seem to get even with the best water proof)</li>
            <li> The is by far the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of lash-thickening maskeras and fiberwig is by far the best !</li>
            <li> anyone has a recommendation for a good cruelty free mascara that makes lashes look feathery, please leave a comment.</li>
            <li> anyone has a recommendation for a good cruelty free mascara that makes lashes look feathery, please leave a comment.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I read the reviews for this mascara, it seemed like the perfect &amp;#34;do-all&amp;#34; every woman wants!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to remove with warm water.  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara</li>
            <li> (&#x3D;])</li>
            <li> It is a bit thicker and doesn&#x27;t contain as many fibers, but eventually you can get even the puniest lashes to string out.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me,  every time you wear eye makeup the under eye portion ends up with more makeup than your eyelid at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara and can&#x27;t find it in the stores any more.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this mascara goes on and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li> and by the morning most of the fibers are gone</li>
            <li> And I know all the experts say don&#x27;t wear your mascara more than a day</li>
            <li> I had put off trying them because I was so in love with this product, and can officially say that this mascara beats them all.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this mascara --</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I am so glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!  </li>
            <li> Problem is that I can not find it anywhere except Amazon any more.</li>
            <li> I also love that it washes away with soap and water.  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> love, love, love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this and plan to make it my mascara from now on.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> You can then layer volumizing mascara on top if you like.  </li>
            <li> I would give more stars.</li>
            <li> I really like the concept of this mascara, and it looks great on.</li>
            <li> I prefer a more feathery, separated-last look.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li> Love It~~~  </li>
            <li> GREAT FOR SENSITIVE EYES!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use &amp; easy to take off with warm soapy water &amp; it never runs.</li>
            <li> The only kind I&#x27;ll ever use again!!</li>
            <li> I have NEVER tried a mascara that stays on better, and yet was so easy to remove.</li>
            <li> So it will take longer than most would like to achieve the best looking lashes, but it makes mine super long.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara ever for someone who is active and works out a lot.</li>
            <li> and I want something that&#x27;s one-step and easy -</li>
            <li> It comes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily - and stays on until you wash it off with soap and water.  </li>
            <li> Never smudges and you can take it off so easily.</li>
            <li> It came off easy as well without having raccoon eyes</li>
            <li> It lengthens my eye lashes and washes off easily.  </li>
            <li> do like how easy it is to remove.</li>
            <li> Thank you to the wonderful girl at Sephora who recommended this to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For other ladies/people!</li>
            <li> Got it so quickly!  </li>
            <li> Goes on easy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes long and natural looking,  great for below lashes, doesn&#x27;t smudge and comes of so easily and nice!</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s a huge money and time saver.</li>
            <li> counter fit product DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but this one was worth it.</li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks of use to get to the consistency I like best - but works like a charm and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Great, same formula as ever</li>
            <li> however, it is much cheaper than getting eyelash extensions at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;i love this product and was so glad to find it on amazon after sephora discontinued selling it.</li>
            <li> But I was so confident it was same good product as before and trow the package away.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I still love, LOVE this mascara for one main reason - NO panda eye.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t go on just right the first time, lashes get thicker, more clumped together, and more spidery as you apply or attempt to comb through and separate them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is super easy to get off without damaging your lashes.</li>
            <li> It stays on the whole day and is very easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Easy and quick to use and gives you great Long Lashes!  </li>
            <li> It sure makes my lashes look long and nice.</li>
            <li> Truly hypoallergenic ...and absolutely, for real, does not smear or rub off on eyelids!!!!</li>
            <li> Also, it comes off easy with mild facial soap and warm water in &amp;#34;tubes.&amp;#34; Leaves no residue on lashes</li>
            <li> It might not be super volumizing but it does make your lashes look fuller without clumps or smudges.</li>
            <li> So much better than your regular mascara available in the U.S.!</li>
            <li> would be happy if it would come in Navy and Dark Brown, too.</li>
            <li> so much fuller, never smears, and comes off super easy.  </li>
            <li> Not cold water</li>
            <li> Might work better for those whose lashes are already naturally curled.</li>
            <li> People tell me my eyelashes are beautiful and even though they know I&#x27;m wearing mascara, they assume my natural lashes are long.</li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s worth the effort.</li>
            <li> this mascara only needs warm water to be taken off.</li>
            <li> and i think it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I originally fell in love with another brand of similar quality which my go-to beauty store decided to stop carrying.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t get dry and clumpy, and comes off so easily.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge but comes right off in shower.</li>
            <li> During my search for a good lengthening mascara that does not flake or smudge, I have tried easily in the double digits of different mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really use a comb, pin, or clean spoolie to separate your lashes after applying, because doing that makes the fibers pull out away from the lashes.</li>
            <li> if i want thicker, darker eyelashes for when i go out in the evening, i have applied other mascaras (christian dior blackout) over the fiberwig.&lt;br /&gt;i love that this products does not flake into my eyes (i wear contacts), it lasts all day without smearing and then easily washes off with warm water.</li>
            <li> Brush is always too full of product, and really didn&#x27;t make lashes look thicker or longer.</li>
            <li> Amazing my eye lashes are so long</li>
            <li> works well on lower lashes (clings right to them whereas most mascara just skips my bottom lashes and gets right on my skin), but it is a pain to apply (use a piece of paper or shield), and mustn&#x27;t be rushed, or the big brush makes it get all over (</li>
            <li> I have tried all manner of drugstore mascaras and high end ones such as Dior... and while many of them make my lashes look full, they all smear eventually on my face.</li>
            <li> I also take hot yoga</li>
            <li> This went in the trash after the first use.</li>
            <li> I tried to find a replacement for this as Sephora was no longer carrying it, but this is the only mascara I love.</li>
            <li> Very possible that I have defective eyelashes, but my Loreal Voluminous works much better.</li>
            <li> My friend brought this back from Japan for me &amp; I fell in love.</li>
            <li> It might be better for someone with short lashes.</li>
            <li> Not the same Fiberwig formula, this used to be my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> the neck where normally in most mascara&#x27;s take off the excess is not tight enough on this product so you get a wand full of mascara, and who wants to apply that right?</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t exactly thicken but certainly lengthens with each coat.</li>
            <li> Love Fiberwig and have used it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> but then easy to remove with regular face wash.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting and fairly priced.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;You have to work fast to apply many layers while its wet, because once it starts to dry, the wand drags and product just piles up on top, with fibers going in all directions.</li>
            <li> True tubing mascara that I&#x27;ve used has given me major spider lashes, but I don&#x27;t have to worry about it with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Mascara snob and very picky with it.</li>
            <li> I found it very tricky to apply though.  </li>
            <li> Lengthened my lashes as promised, but did not keep a curl very well.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t tell the difference between my real lashes with this mascara and my extensions.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look real at all.</li>
            <li> And it really does lengthen dramatically.  </li>
            <li> That said, it really doesn&#x27;t work as well as some of the dime store brands (which are about 1/4 of the price).  </li>
            <li> I suppose if you have really sensitive eyes, this might be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lengthen very well and the brush tends to clump the lashes together instead of separating them.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It seems to be luck of the draw, depending on how much product is on the want when I pull it out of the tube.</li>
            <li> If you work too fast, however, it gets on the skin, or makes lashes stick together wet.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I can build however much I want with this formula and they don&#x27;t look like spider eyes.</li>
            <li> Very customizable mascara.</li>
            <li> so too much mascara comes out on the wand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first that really lengthens and when it&#x27;s time to take it off, you just wash your face normally</li>
            <li> It removes easily, and gives me long glamorous lashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking a one month break from my eyelash extensions right now and my lashes are in the middle of their growth cycle right now.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t flake under your eye like most other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  </li>
            <li> You have to clean the brush of mascara about every fourth or fifth use because it gets gloppy.</li>
            <li> My thinning eyelashes are given new life and come off at night with a little warm water.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a huge plus, especially for people who live or work in humid/hot areas.</li>
            <li> Now, I need to find some decent eyeliner.</li>
            <li> seriously, i NEVER get raccoon eyes with this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I usually never spend this much money on mascara, but I bit the bullet and pretended I was Paris Hilton for a day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not meant to make your lashes super thick or long but it works great for me.</li>
            <li> Most of the fibers didn&#x27;t stick and the ones that did looked clumpy and messy.</li>
            <li> I have extensions, but when I&#x27;m looking pretty bare and need a fill, I use this stuff</li>
            <li> Usually, the first eye looks nice, then the second one is a mess.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> You can make your look natural or dark by applying more.</li>
            <li> and if you want the longest lashes possible you must wait after its dry then apply more then wait then</li>
            <li> AND it makes your lashes look super long.</li>
            <li> No clumps, and super duper long lashes.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t live without this mascara.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really subtle and light, and is never going to hold a candle to those super volumizing brands.</li>
            <li> OR I can make it look very natural</li>
            <li> good news is, if you get it on your skin, you can usually just wait for it to dry, then flick it off with a q-tip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought for sure other mascaras would follow suit and use the same formula</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that isn&#x27;t going to come off without hot water and pressure, this isn&#x27;t the stuff, but it does stay on without flaking and smearing like regular mascara.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mascara for those that want a tiny water resistance for the occasional rain storm that randomly occurs.</li>
            <li> No dark circles!!</li>
            <li> so I use the base with a different mascara applicator, because frankly the product itself is pretty darn good, long full lashes and no mess under the eyes,,,,,,,,,,,, so with a bit of work ladies you will enjoy this product,,,,</li>
            <li> When it dries (in just a few seconds) excess can easily be removed with a moist cotton swab.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so sad too that Sephora got rid of this mascara, it is hands down the BEST mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Oh and a little tip is using the tip of the mascara wand to do the bottom lashes and to extend the length to the tips of the top lashes once you put it on like you would regularly.</li>
            <li> Buy it today and you will be happily surprised At the glow it adds to you eyes.</li>
            <li> and you have the soft smudgy look like from a pencil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m outside too much.</li>
            <li> However, my tube must have been old.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this cosmetic is all natural.  </li>
            <li> You can apply multiple coats to really build up your lashes without clumping.</li>
            <li> (but all skinny brushes seem to do that to me), but I just chucked it and use a fat brush from another old mascara that I cleaned off.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick like most mascaras, so I don&#x27;t have to tug at my delicate eye skin to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This gives a natural fuller, longer look without a lot of hassle and struggle.</li>
            <li> Fiberwig is not quite as lush as some, but stays put all day and night without a smear until I remove it with water.</li>
            <li> the softer, more subtle natural look is what i prefer.  </li>
            <li> I have super oily eyelids and whatnot, so every single mascara I&#x27;ve used before would inevitably lead to raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> , warm sweat will remove it a bit, sometimes leaving you with a few &amp;#34;eraser&amp;#34; like black dots under your eyes, no problem there, just wipe them off, NO black circles or smudging.</li>
            <li> The only con, takes longer to wash off, but not hard to get off like waterproof or anything.</li>
            <li> Like no other mascara</li>
            <li> I am a big laugher, and crinkle smiler, I guess, because my eye makeup very quickly is all over my face usually by the time I arrive to work.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m not careful, I end up looking like Tammy Faye Baker.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m not careful, I end up looking like Tammy Faye Baker.</li>
            <li> A little dusting of black eyeshadow on top</li>
            <li> I also love that it comes off in little tubes, instead of a smudgy mess.</li>
            <li> Cannot say enough about it, there is no other on the market like it.</li>
            <li> the first time i used this product several years ago, the fibers made my eyelashes appear long and pretty -- not overly voluminous and thick.  </li>
            <li> ; The only thing is you will have to buy a new tube at least every couple of months; it does dry out quicker than regular mascara, but its So worth it, No reason for  buying mascara remover</li>
            <li> I have sparse tiny little light black lashes.</li>
            <li> this makes it a little pricier buy for a mascara -- although you&#x27;re not suppose to keep your mascara for much longer anyways.</li>
            <li> I just put a little oil or makeup remover on a baby wipe, dab it on my eyes, wait a minute, then gently pinch the mascara off.</li>
            <li> The fibers are small, not super dramatic, so it&#x27;s perfect for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is not the original product because the package was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Dejavu extra long fiberwig mascara to this one...</li>
            <li> I have somewhat long lashes, and they are constantly hitting the skin below my eyes, and if I&#x27;m wearing any type of moisturizer (and as a woman in my 50&#x27;s, I&#x27;m ALWAYS wearing a moisturizer!)</li>
            <li> Tiny fibers stand on the tips of each lash to give you long, but not clumpy, doll like lashes.  </li>
            <li> With summer being here it won&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> especially if you have long lower lashes like me).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Mine are quite long, blonde and somewhat sparse.</li>
            <li> I love how I can make my eyes look very Dramatic</li>
            <li> find that this mascara flakes off throughout the day, especially on the ends of lashes, but I am reluctant to reapply, because it gets clumpy and the we product doesn&#x27;t comb through dry</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;ve put on several layers, it just takes a little gentle rubbing with my fingertips and the mascara just slides off in little tube.  </li>
            <li> i will use the d.j.v. fiberwig for as long as they continue to make it.</li>
            <li> LONG DEFINED LASHES</li>
            <li> and although is become harder to find, it&#x27;s my one and only.</li>
            <li> I feel like there&#x27;s some strange Amazon racket going on -</li>
            <li> AT all, no matter how long I have it</li>
            <li> They are long and they don&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> I am a teacher and work long hours (and spend about an hour on the playground).</li>
            <li> So now I have an expensive mascara that has to be doctored up by first using a primer or as suggested by other users layered over other mascaras ...defeats the whole purpose.</li>
            <li> I have dry eye</li>
            <li> Every single mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried, so matter how waterproof or smudge-proof it is, has given me smears below my eyes in a matter of hours.</li>
            <li> the only down side, if you must have one, the tube lasts about 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I can wear this mascara to bed and wake up in the morning without a single smudge!</li>
            <li> I will occasionally leave small &amp;#34;flakes&amp;#34; below and/or around my eyes, but these are easily brushed away, and are generally too small to be noticed.  </li>
            <li> It took me a little bit to get used to and get my technique for application, just like with switching to any different Mascara.</li>
            <li> Anyways, this doesn&#x27;t move all day, until night when I use a little soap (just regular facial soap, I use low-chem products like Origins) and it comes off easily in little clumps.</li>
            <li> The mascara is thin and leaves my lashes sticking out straight.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes looked thin and wimpy, no matter how much I put on.  </li>
            <li> I have the typical asian eyelashes that go down in an angle.</li>
            <li> I left it for a while for a few other mascaras but came crawling back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also less tugging and pulling on your skin&#x3D; less wrinkles in the future.</li>
            <li> Unlike other &amp;#34;tubing&amp;#34; mascaras (like Blinc, which goes on in liquid form THEN tubes up around your lashes), this product was &amp;</li>
            <li> Had to take off one star because they cannot seem to make the hole in the tube small enough to remove excess from the brush.  </li>
            <li> so I am not able to review it properly.</li>
            <li> Got this the other day</li>
            <li> Other times it just globs.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m OBSESSED with eyelashes and mascara.</li>
            <li> It can get a little dry and flaky by the end of the day, but the flakes can just be wiped away.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is it&#x27;s not easy to apply - it will clump and it takes a few coats for thicker lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely runny like it&#x27;s been watered down and also stringy when appied.</li>
            <li> any other product will leave black smudges, I don&#x27;t care how waterproof it claims to be.  </li>
            <li> This is long lasting and maximizes my thin lashes.</li>
            <li> I have never found another mascara that doesn&#x27;t smear by the end of the day, leaving dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> The mascara stays on all day, never puts dark spots under the eyes.</li>
            <li> Just takes few tries to make it work.</li>
            <li> No paint dripping down your face when washing or testy.</li>
            <li> which typically happens to me with non-waterproof mascaras.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t smudge and make you look like you have a black eye(s).</li>
            <li> Seriously guys, I can&#x27;t stress this enough.</li>
            <li> but I have no smeared black on my face.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;black flakes&#x27;  DO NOT WORRY.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for less than a month</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a miracle that it doesn&#x27;t make a mess on my face.</li>
            <li> It dissolves into little fibers (hence the name).</li>
            <li> Not worth the money!  </li>
            <li> One less step at night and one less product to buy!</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to mascara for a little over a year now.</li>
            <li> Cold water doesn&#x27;t really take it off as well.</li>
            <li> i have skimpy short and thin eyelashes.</li>
            <li> you will have to build the fibers on and it does take a few coats.</li>
            <li> and sometimes I do like to put on a few lashes</li>
            <li> I discovered this mascara from a friend who is a make up artist a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday.</li>
            <li> But in reality - it&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li> The mascara came all dried up</li>
            <li> While being dried up it still gave a lot of volume and lengthening to my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> A waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a few years now</li>
            <li> lashes are stubby and Fiberwig is one of the few mascaras that make me look like I have fuller, longer lashes.</li>
            <li> mascara is messy to apply, and it makes my lashes look like hair spider legs.</li>
            <li> It adds length and volume without the fibers getting messy or clumpy.  </li>
            <li> So my lashes look a little shorter than usual.</li>
            <li> Your lashes will droop down and lose their curl, but at least you don&#x27;t have to worry about your mascara running.</li>
            <li> This means less pulling and tugging on your delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> so the occasional fiber dropping into my eyes can be difficult to cope with</li>
            <li> But frankly, I&#x27;m lazy</li>
            <li> was dried out!</li>
            <li> Occasionally, I will try a different product, and am always disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended in the news magazine The Week - not your usual source for makeup information.  </li>
            <li> I usually just sort of rub it off at the end of the day and it comes off a bit like latex paint.</li>
            <li> Really messy!  </li>
            <li> I have very thin and blonde eyelashes</li>
            <li> It comes off in a way hard to explain, it doesn&#x27;t smear all over</li>
            <li> At least they introduced me to it in one of their sampler packs, so I will be forever grateful to them for that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 56 and have been wearing mascara for at least a couple of days from one application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terrible at putting on false eyelashes, but I love the fuller look of them.</li>
            <li> When they say no more raccoon eyes, they are not kidding!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump, and I&#x27;m very lazy when it comes to make-up application.</li>
            <li> Seriously, none.  </li>
            <li> , I want to return it so badly and get my money back!</li>
            <li> Not a good look on anyone.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Not a good look on anyone.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I had a bad batch or what, but like trying to line up little needles on your lashes.</li>
            <li> I was addicted to Shiseido Fiber Mascara until they discontinued it.  </li>
            <li> I looked like I had broken spider leg lashes.</li>
            <li> looks like fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> maybe I was doing something wrong?</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t doing anything wrong.</li>
            <li> I was so sad when Sephora no longer carried this mascara.</li>
            <li> My disappointment stems from the product itself.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this product in Sephora, but they inexplicably stopped selling it.  </li>
            <li> I always describe it to people as fake eyelashes in a tube!</li>
            <li> I was so sad when Sephora stopped selling amd nothing I had bought after that even compared!</li>
            <li> it adds the length without being thick and clumpy, while looking like nasty spider-legs.</li>
            <li> I was very sad when Sephora stopped selling it.</li>
            <li> Even on my impossible eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Package was in bad shape upon arrival.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> It extends lashes like crazy!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when Sephora stopped selling it.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when I found out they weren&#x27;t selling this at Sephora anymore.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the quality of the mascara.</li>
            <li> Shocked me!  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Its shocking to me.  </li>
            <li> Plus it never irritates my eyes and I have terrible allergies in the spring and summer.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> OILY SKIN GIRLS LISTEN UP!&lt;br /&gt;I have NEVER found another mascara that repels oil like this one, and I used to work at Sephora. I have tried everrrrything and this is the only mascara that doesn&#x27;t mysteriously end up all over under my eyes by the end of the day. I don&#x27;t like the brush at all and I still will NEVER buy anything else, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> counter fit product DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> I wanted the &amp;#34;tubular&amp;#34; mascara that makes the tube around each lash which makes it not clumpy and safer for eyes, but with all the fibers on this one the effect of that is lost.</li>
            <li> It the best product I have ever used!!!! I have been using it for years.  Goes on easy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> i have skimpy short and thin eyelashes. the first time i used this product several years ago, the fibers made my eyelashes appear long and pretty -- not overly voluminous and thick.  the softer, more subtle natural look is what i prefer.  you will have to build the fibers on and it does take a few coats. if i want thicker, darker eyelashes for when i go out in the evening, i have applied other mascaras (christian dior blackout) over the fiberwig.&lt;br /&gt;i love that this products does not flake into my eyes (i wear contacts), it lasts all day without smearing and then easily washes off with warm water. the only down side, if you must have one, the tube lasts about 6 weeks.  this makes it a little pricier buy for a mascara -- although you&#x27;re not suppose to keep your mascara for much longer anyways. however, it is much cheaper than getting eyelash extensions at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;i love this product and was so glad to find it on amazon after sephora discontinued selling it. i will use the d.j.v. fiberwig for as long as they continue to make it.</li>
            <li> Favorite mascara ever!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for several years</li>
            <li> This is long lasting and maximizes my thin lashes. I have dry eye so the occasional fiber dropping into my eyes can be difficult to cope with</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara ever for someone who is active and works out a lot. It&#x27;s such a shame that Sephora stopped selling it and you can only buy from amazon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get this. This is not the same product as sold previosuly from sephora. It actually irratates my eyes.</li>
            <li> I heard good things about this mascara so I gave it a shot. Very impressed. It doesn&#x27;t exactly thicken but certainly lengthens with each coat. It stays on all day, even during exercising. Doesn&#x27;t give me &amp;#34;racoons eyes&amp;#34; which typically happens to me with non-waterproof mascaras. And I know it&#x27;s possible to prevent this by adding primer, powder, etc. But frankly, I&#x27;m lazy and I want something that&#x27;s one-step and easy - and this is it. Definitely would recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note - upon removal, it doesn&#x27;t smudge and make you look like you have a black eye(s). It dissolves into little fibers (hence the name).</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t get dry and clumpy, and comes off so easily. I like that I can add a second coat if I want, and it still looks silky.&lt;br /&gt;I would be happy if it would come in Navy and Dark Brown, too.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! And I&#x27;ve been around the block when it comes to Mascara. I&#x27;m a Mascara snob and very picky with it. I have very thin and blonde eyelashes so I need  a mascara that will add either Volume or Length, or Both! What I like about this stuff is it adds the length without being thick and clumpy, while looking like nasty spider-legs. It took me a little bit to get used to and get my technique for application, just like with switching to any different Mascara. I love how I can make my eyes look very Dramatic OR I can make it look very natural and you can&#x27;t even tell I have mascara on it looks like fake eyelashes. I always describe it to people as fake eyelashes in a tube! One of the best parts about this stuff is that you don&#x27;t need eye make up remover to get it off, it comes off in warm water! Not cold water so you can swim at the lake with it, but like shower water. It comes off in a way hard to explain, it doesn&#x27;t smear all over you&#x27;re face like raccoon eyes but just wipes off, like wiping eyelashes off. Just slides off. This means less pulling and tugging on your delicate eye area. Oh and a little tip is using the tip of the mascara wand to do the bottom lashes and to extend the length to the tips of the top lashes once you put it on like you would regularly. (&#x3D;]) ~Female*Age 25~</li>
            <li> Love Fiberwig and have used it for a long time.  The Fiberwig I received this time was dried out!</li>
            <li> I have been looking everywhere for this mascara. I was so sad when Sephora stopped selling amd nothing I had bought after that even compared! Great mascara makes my short lashes look amazing!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and it doesn&#x27;t smudge or come off if your eyes water, but it easily comes off with warm water! Awesome.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product. My disappointment stems from the product itself. The mascara is thin and leaves my lashes sticking out straight. It does not lengthen them and definitely does not provide any volume whatsoever. I searched the internet for suggestions on how to apply the mascara...maybe I was doing something wrong? I wasn&#x27;t doing anything wrong. Seller should amend the description of this item. I found the description of what I could expect misleading. So now I have an expensive mascara that has to be doctored up by first using a primer or as suggested by other users layered over other mascaras ...defeats the whole purpose.</li>
            <li> It does all it promises and looks great. Buy it today and you will be happily surprised At the glow it adds to you eyes.</li>
            <li> I am not kidding. I am a big laugher, and crinkle smiler, I guess, because my eye makeup very quickly is all over my face usually by the time I arrive to work. (And who am I smiling at on the NYC subways??) Anyways, this doesn&#x27;t move all day, until night when I use a little soap (just regular facial soap, I use low-chem products like Origins) and it comes off easily in little clumps. Thank you to the wonderful girl at Sephora who recommended this to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For other ladies/people! with this eye makeup issue - I also found eyeko liquid felt tip eyeliner (same Sephora trip) and it changed my life too. Again, doesn&#x27;t move all day. A little dusting of black eyeshadow on top and you have the soft smudgy look like from a pencil.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;d read a review of it in The Week and knew it was what I was looking for. It doesn&#x27;t smear and it&#x27;s a cinch to remove.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for carrying this product! I was so sad when Sephora no longer carried this mascara. You will never have to use anything but warm water to get it off, NO BLACK circles under my eyes at the end of the day ( that I always seem to get even with the best water proof) LONG DEFINED LASHES AS WELL&amp;#62; The only thing is you will have to buy a new tube at least every couple of months; it does dry out quicker than regular mascara, but its So worth it, No reason for  buying mascara remover, that&#x27;s a huge money and time saver. Also less tugging and pulling on your skin&#x3D; less wrinkles in the future. Also this is not like the &amp;#34; blinc Mascera&amp;#34; that burns my eyes if I work out in it ( and still runs a bit)  I also take hot yoga and sometimes I do like to put on a few lashes, warm sweat will remove it a bit, sometimes leaving you with a few &amp;#34;eraser&amp;#34; like black dots under your eyes, no problem there, just wipe them off, NO black circles or smudging. GREAT FOR SENSITIVE EYES!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara if you have oily eyes and are prone to smudging.  As a tubing mascara, you won&#x27;t have to worry about that with this product. I found it very tricky to apply though.  Unlike other &amp;#34;tubing&amp;#34; mascaras (like Blinc, which goes on in liquid form THEN tubes up around your lashes), this product was &amp;#34;tubed up&amp;#34; before it even got off the applicator. I&#x27;m not sure if I had a bad batch or what, but like trying to line up little needles on your lashes. However, once it was on, it&#x27;s on for good until you take it off.</li>
            <li> I was addicted to Shiseido Fiber Mascara until they discontinued it.  NOW, there is Fiberwig which is 95% as good as Shiseido.  It is a bit thicker and doesn&#x27;t contain as many fibers, but eventually you can get even the puniest lashes to string out.  I love this stuff!!!!  Discontinued at Sephora, it is great to get via Amazon!</li>
            <li> best.mascara.ever.  I discovered this mascara from a friend who is a make up artist a few years ago.  It&#x27;s 100% smudgeproof.  I thought for sure other mascaras would follow suit and use the same formula but it&#x27;s been years and they haven&#x27;t.  Its shocking to me.  It flakes off when you wash it but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Dejavu extra long fiberwig mascara to this one... but I didn&#x27;t realize that they were different products until I used both.</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for years.  Occasionally, I will try a different product, and am always disappointed.  This is just the best mascara ever for me.  I have somewhat long lashes, and they are constantly hitting the skin below my eyes, and if I&#x27;m wearing any type of moisturizer (and as a woman in my 50&#x27;s, I&#x27;m ALWAYS wearing a moisturizer!) any other product will leave black smudges, I don&#x27;t care how waterproof it claims to be.  This product has NEVER smudged.  I will occasionally leave small &amp;#34;flakes&amp;#34; below and/or around my eyes, but these are easily brushed away, and are generally too small to be noticed.  It removes easily, and gives me long glamorous lashes.  I used to always buy two mascaras at a time, one to keep at my vanity, and one to keep in my purse for touch ups, but this product never needs touching up!</li>
            <li> Every single mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried, so matter how waterproof or smudge-proof it is, has given me smears below my eyes in a matter of hours. For whatever reason. I figured that I was just destined to never, ever wear mascara. In a final attempt to find something that works, I bought a Sephora mascara pack with lots of different mascaras to try. The d.j.v. Fiberwig was one of those mascaras, and I was astonished to find it doesn&#x27;t smudge. At all. Even on my impossible eyelashes. It dries like latex, so it rolls off, which is why it doesn&#x27;t leave any marks. It&#x27;s a miracle that it doesn&#x27;t make a mess on my face. Seriously guys, I can&#x27;t stress this enough. A miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But at the same time this is not the flashiest mascara you will ever use. It&#x27;s really subtle and light, and is never going to hold a candle to those super volumizing brands.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me,  every time you wear eye makeup the under eye portion ends up with more makeup than your eyelid at the end of the day. This mascara is awesome for staying on your lashes! Now, I need to find some decent eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Had to take off one star because they cannot seem to make the hole in the tube small enough to remove excess from the brush.  Always clumpy, but I work around it.  I have actually found it easier just to slap on the mascara without worrying about getting over and under lashes.  When it dries (in just a few seconds) excess can easily be removed with a moist cotton swab.&lt;br /&gt;However, I still love, LOVE this mascara for one main reason - NO panda eye. Ever.  Stays on even when swimming but then easy to remove with regular face wash.  Will continue to buy this product!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara and can&#x27;t find it in the stores any more.  Doesn&#x27;t flake under your eye like most other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  I&#x27;m going to stick with this one.</li>
            <li> I love the way this mascara goes on and stays on all day.  It comes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I am so sad too that Sephora got rid of this mascara, it is hands down the BEST mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  It makes my eyes look so much fuller, never smears, and comes off super easy.  I&#x27;m actually notorious for not washing my face before I go to bed (I know...) and by the morning most of the fibers are gone but I have no smeared black on my face.  Seriously, none.  Why Sephora?!  Why?!?!  At least they introduced me to it in one of their sampler packs, so I will be forever grateful to them for that.  Thankful I can still find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Lengthened my lashes as promised, but did not keep a curl very well. My lashes drooped almost immediately despite a vigorous pre-curling with a lash curler. Might work better for those whose lashes are already naturally curled.</li>
            <li> The only mascara that truly lengthens your lashes.  Tiny fibers stand on the tips of each lash to give you long, but not clumpy, doll like lashes.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years and although is become harder to find, it&#x27;s my one and only.</li>
            <li> This went in the trash after the first use. Most of the fibers didn&#x27;t stick and the ones that did looked clumpy and messy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday. And I know all the experts say don&#x27;t wear your mascara more than a day but I&#x27;ve done it for years and still have great lashes. I&#x27;m 56 and have been wearing mascara for at least a couple of days from one application. Depending on how good it is. This brand will stay on my eye lashes 3 to 4 days, depending on what I&#x27;m doing. With summer being here it won&#x27;t last that long. I&#x27;m outside too much. It sure makes my lashes look long and nice.</li>
            <li> I can wear this mascara to bed and wake up in the morning without a single smudge! This is the best mascara ever at stay put! It extends lashes like crazy!</li>
            <li> I like this mascara--it does lengthen quite a bit and the curved brush is perfect to get your lashes coated from root to tip.</li>
            <li> The is by far the best mascara I have ever used. I was so disappointed when Sephora stopped selling it. It does add length and fullness, but the best feature of it is that it does not smear. I have never found another mascara that doesn&#x27;t smear by the end of the day, leaving dark circles around my eyes. This will eventually flake if you leave it on over night but it is super easy to get off without damaging your lashes.</li>
            <li> I have used this a couple times now.  During my search for a good lengthening mascara that does not flake or smudge, I have tried easily in the double digits of different mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first that really lengthens and when it&#x27;s time to take it off, you just wash your face normally and then the mascara literally slides off the lashes in one clump.  No flakes during the day and the fibers allow you to build to whatever length you want.  It doesn&#x27;t&#x27; feel like you have tarantulas on your eyes either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend having a good eyelash comb to separate some if needed.</li>
            <li> I ran out of this, and decided to use up a bunch of mascaras I&#x27;ve had lying around the house for awhile. I had put off trying them because I was so in love with this product, and can officially say that this mascara beats them all. I have NEVER tried a mascara that stays on better, and yet was so easy to remove. It&#x27;s long lasting and fairly priced. I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but this one was worth it.</li>
            <li> Took me awhile to figure out how to apply without fibers falling into my eyes.  Got it so quickly!  Shocked me!  Thank you</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara! You used to get it at Sephora but no longer. Love it!</li>
            <li> Makes your lashes look like you have extensions!  I have extensions, but when I&#x27;m looking pretty bare and need a fill, I use this stuff and you can&#x27;t tell the difference between my real lashes with this mascara and my extensions. The only con, takes longer to wash off, but not hard to get off like waterproof or anything.</li>
            <li> seriously, i NEVER get raccoon eyes with this mascara.  AND it makes your lashes look super long. i LOVE this mascara -- no clue why sephora stopped carrying it but i prefer amazon.com fore everything anyway because amazon ROCKS.  WHEN YOU TAKE OFF THIS MASCARA YOU WILL THINK YOUR EYELASHES ARE FALLING OUT BUT THEY ARE NOT!  it&#x27;s just that the mascara goes on -- and comes off -- in &#x27;black flakes&#x27;  DO NOT WORRY. i can&#x27;t live without this mascara.  i also like the chantecaille mascara that smells like rose water.  :)</li>
            <li> I Will be buying this product again... Love it</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Not at all as described. Wondering if same product as it came fro Asia</li>
            <li> This is the BEST I have ever used. It stays on and no raccoon eyes. I wear contacts and there is no sloughing of product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using fiberwig for years and it&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried. It doesn&#x27;t clump or streak and it comes off very easily with warm water. Can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> I tried to find a replacement for this as Sephora was no longer carrying it, but this is the only mascara I love. It doesn&#x27;t clump, and I&#x27;m very lazy when it comes to make-up application. My profession, at times, requires me to wear makeup, and I often don&#x27;t have the time to go home to do so, yet this product stays and doesn&#x27;t cause rings under my eyes. Perfect.</li>
            <li> I feel like there&#x27;s some strange Amazon racket going on - because there&#x27;s just no way people can think this mascara is oh so amazing. It&#x27;s not. if you&#x27;ve never used a fiber mascara then maybe you&#x27;ll be impressed. But in reality - it&#x27;s messy. It&#x27;s clumpy. It doesn&#x27;t look real at all.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for less than a month and it&#x27;s so clumped that I can&#x27;t use it anymore.  Not worth the money!  I feel like this is not the original product because the package was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> This is revolutionary mascara!  It goes on easily - and stays on until you wash it off with soap and water.  I hadn&#x27;t worn mascara in years but now put this on every day.  It was recommended in the news magazine The Week - not your usual source for makeup information.  The Amazon price is competitive.</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever. I was devastated when Sephora stopped carrying it. I have been trying to survive on Blink which isn&#x27;t nearly as good.  I am so glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The mascara came all dried up so I am not able to review it properly. While being dried up it still gave a lot of volume and lengthening to my eyelashes. I think that if the product was new, it would of been the perfect mascara</li>
            <li> When they say no more raccoon eyes, they are not kidding! This is the best stay in place mascara I&#x27;ve ever used, and it really is easy to get off with just warm water! The only kind I&#x27;ll ever use again!!</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever. Never smudges and you can take it off so easily.</li>
            <li> Unimpressed. Brush is always too full of product, and really didn&#x27;t make lashes look thicker or longer. A waste.</li>
            <li> Was dissappointed in this mascara for its price! Doesnt make my lashes look any longer than what Revlon or Loreal does.</li>
            <li> This is truly the world&#x27;s best mascara ever. Cannot say enough about it, there is no other on the market like it. No clumps, and super duper long lashes. However, my tube must have been old. It is getting cakey already. I wish this was still for sale in the US so I didn&#x27;t have to order online!</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I wear now.   It doesn&#x27;t smudge but comes right off in shower.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!  Truly hypoallergenic ...and absolutely, for real, does not smear or rub off on eyelids!!!!</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever. No paint dripping down your face when washing or testy.</li>
            <li> This is the only one my girlfriend will use... bought as a gift!</li>
            <li> I used to buy this product in Sephora, but they inexplicably stopped selling it.  My thinning eyelashes are given new life and come off at night with a little warm water.  People tell me my eyelashes are beautiful and even though they know I&#x27;m wearing mascara, they assume my natural lashes are long. I wouldn&#x27;t be without this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever tried. I was very sad when Sephora stopped selling it. It stays on the whole day and is very easy to remove. It might not be super volumizing but it does make your lashes look fuller without clumps or smudges.</li>
            <li> No big deal. Package was in bad shape upon arrival. I will return to my clinique mascara designed for contact lense use. It makes lashes look lo get and fuller with no flaking.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for over 5 years. I LOVE IT! Problem is that I can not find it anywhere except Amazon any more. It works great to make my eyelashes pop! I bought 2 this time just in case I will not find it again. I will by a couple of more soon!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I read the reviews for this mascara, it seemed like the perfect &amp;#34;do-all&amp;#34; every woman wants!  I usually never spend this much money on mascara, but I bit the bullet and pretended I was Paris Hilton for a day.  The first thing I noticed was it seemed sort of &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; coming out of the tube, but I figured it was all of the wonderful fibers just waiting to bond with my eyelashes to make them full and gorgeous.  Well, that didn&#x27;t happen either.  My eyelashes looked thin and wimpy, no matter how much I put on.  Very possible that I have defective eyelashes, but my Loreal Voluminous works much better.</li>
            <li> No matter what type/brand of mascara I buy, I ALWAYS end up with raccoon eyes, but not with this one!  I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a few years now and I will never use another one.</li>
            <li> With an oily T-zone, every waterproof, smudge-proof mascara runs and smudges on me within a couple hours.  This is the only one that never does.  It can get a little dry and flaky by the end of the day, but the flakes can just be wiped away.  And it really does lengthen dramatically.  I also love that it washes away with soap and water.  If I&#x27;ve put on several layers, it just takes a little gentle rubbing with my fingertips and the mascara just slides off in little tube.  One less step at night and one less product to buy!</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to mascara for a little over a year now. I originally fell in love with another brand of similar quality which my go-to beauty store decided to stop carrying. After reading about a thousand reviews, I figured this deserved a shot. It takes a few weeks of use to get to the consistency I like best - but works like a charm and lasts forever. I also love that it comes off in little tubes, instead of a smudgy mess.</li>
            <li> I always buy this brand but my last order wich I received today I was totally dissapointed they change the formula , is like a regular mascara no fibers at all, I want to return it so badly and get my money back! But I was so confident it was same good product as before and trow the package away.  I guess got to search for another brand no moreeee fiberwig for me .</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever. Tried a half dozen others when Sephora stopped carrying this particular brand, none of which even came close to measuring up to Fiberwig. God bless you Amazon bringing us together again.</li>
            <li> My friend brought this back from Japan for me &amp; I fell in love. Always purchased from Sephora..but they stopped selling it. I was so happy to locate it on Amazon. It&#x27;s easy to use &amp; easy to take off with warm soapy water &amp; it never runs.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this cosmetic is all natural.  That said, it really doesn&#x27;t work as well as some of the dime store brands (which are about 1/4 of the price).  I suppose if you have really sensitive eyes, this might be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lengthen very well and the brush tends to clump the lashes together instead of separating them.</li>
            <li> the neck where normally in most mascara&#x27;s take off the excess is not tight enough on this product so you get a wand full of mascara, and who wants to apply that right? so I use the base with a different mascara applicator, because frankly the product itself is pretty darn good, long full lashes and no mess under the eyes,,,,,,,,,,,, so with a bit of work ladies you will enjoy this product,,,,</li>
            <li> As always Fiberwig is very good.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. You can apply multiple coats to really build up your lashes without clumping. True tubing mascara that I&#x27;ve used has given me major spider lashes, but I don&#x27;t have to worry about it with this stuff. If you&#x27;re looking for something that isn&#x27;t going to come off without hot water and pressure, this isn&#x27;t the stuff, but it does stay on without flaking and smearing like regular mascara. I usually just sort of rub it off at the end of the day and it comes off a bit like latex paint.</li>
            <li> I have super oily eyelids and whatnot, so every single mascara I&#x27;ve used before would inevitably lead to raccoon eyes. Not so with Fiberwig. I ADORE this stuff. I left it for a while for a few other mascaras but came crawling back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes are stubby and Fiberwig is one of the few mascaras that make me look like I have fuller, longer lashes. The fibers are small, not super dramatic, so it&#x27;s perfect for everyday wear. It also doesn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes AT all, no matter how long I have it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love, love, love this mascara.</li>
            <li> Got this the other day and I have to say, I am just sooooooo happy I found it! Like no other mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Makes my lashes long and natural looking,  great for below lashes, doesn&#x27;t smudge and comes of so easily and nice! I am in love with this and plan to make it my mascara from now on.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. My eyes lashes look amazing. They are long and they don&#x27;t clump. It came off easy as well without having raccoon eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of lash-thickening maskeras and fiberwig is by far the best ! It doesn&#x27;t smear, my lashes look twice the size, and it comes off with water (soap not required!). I&#x27;ve been using it for years!! Love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 6 years, I stand by this product.  If you are looking for volume, look elsewhere.  This is strictly for lengthening.  Once applied, use a heated eyelash curler.  You can then layer volumizing mascara on top if you like.  I have the typical asian eyelashes that go down in an angle.</li>
            <li> This stuff works.  It lengthens my eye lashes and washes off easily.  What else could I ask for.  I would give more stars.</li>
            <li> Great product if you want mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge. The only drawback is it&#x27;s not easy to apply - it will clump and it takes a few coats for thicker lashes. For me it&#x27;s worth the effort. No eye remover required.</li>
            <li> I really like the concept of this mascara, and it looks great on. And the best part for me, is that it doesn&#x27;t flake or run. That&#x27;s a huge plus, especially for people who live or work in humid/hot areas. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the brush, which for me seems like it clumps my lashes (but all skinny brushes seem to do that to me), but I just chucked it and use a fat brush from another old mascara that I cleaned off. Problem solved!</li>
            <li> My fave mascara! Works well, stays on all day and comes off with my tea tree oil facial tissues. I wear contacts and do not have any issues with this mascara.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it goes on really beautifully. Other times it just globs. It seems to be luck of the draw, depending on how much product is on the want when I pull it out of the tube. Usually, the first eye looks nice, then the second one is a mess.&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is messy to apply, and it makes my lashes look like hair spider legs. I prefer a more feathery, separated-last look. You can&#x27;t really use a comb, pin, or clean spoolie to separate your lashes after applying, because doing that makes the fibers pull out away from the lashes. If it doesn&#x27;t go on just right the first time, lashes get thicker, more clumped together, and more spidery as you apply or attempt to comb through and separate them.&lt;br /&gt;It works well on lower lashes (clings right to them whereas most mascara just skips my bottom lashes and gets right on my skin), but it is a pain to apply (use a piece of paper or shield), and mustn&#x27;t be rushed, or the big brush makes it get all over (especially if you have long lower lashes like me).&lt;br /&gt;I do like how easy it is to remove. I just put a little oil or makeup remover on a baby wipe, dab it on my eyes, wait a minute, then gently pinch the mascara off. It doesn&#x27;t stick like most mascaras, so I don&#x27;t have to tug at my delicate eye skin to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;I find that this mascara flakes off throughout the day, especially on the ends of lashes, but I am reluctant to reapply, because it gets clumpy and the we product doesn&#x27;t comb through dry product.&lt;br /&gt;You have to work fast to apply many layers while its wet, because once it starts to dry, the wand drags and product just piles up on top, with fibers going in all directions. If you work too fast, however, it gets on the skin, or makes lashes stick together wet.&lt;br /&gt;The good news is, if you get it on your skin, you can usually just wait for it to dry, then flick it off with a q-tip.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t think I will buy this again. It might be better for someone with short lashes. Mine are quite long, blonde and somewhat sparse. If I&#x27;m not careful, I end up looking like Tammy Faye Baker. Not a good look on anyone.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has a recommendation for a good cruelty free mascara that makes lashes look feathery, please leave a comment. Thanks.and somewhat sparse. If I&#x27;m not careful, I end up looking like Tammy Faye Baker. Not a good look on anyone.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has a recommendation for a good cruelty free mascara that makes lashes look feathery, please leave a comment. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Absolutely  love this product !</li>
            <li> My all time favorite mascara.  Easy and quick to use and gives you great Long Lashes!  Love It~~~  Please keep selling this product.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when I found out they weren&#x27;t selling this at Sephora anymore. I&#x27;m terrible at putting on false eyelashes, but I love the fuller look of them. This gives a natural fuller, longer look without a lot of hassle and struggle. Will be repurchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Does not clump, smudge, or run. I am a teacher and work long hours (and spend about an hour on the playground). This mascara is the only one I&#x27;ve found that is up to the task of a 12+ hour day. Also, it comes off easy with mild facial soap and warm water in &amp;#34;tubes.&amp;#34; Leaves no residue on lashes and you don&#x27;t need a makeup remover. This is the best mascara!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mascara for those that want a tiny water resistance for the occasional rain storm that randomly occurs. Your lashes will droop down and lose their curl, but at least you don&#x27;t have to worry about your mascara running. I like that this mascara only needs warm water to be taken off. Cold water doesn&#x27;t really take it off as well. I like that I can build however much I want with this formula and they don&#x27;t look like spider eyes. It does take time to get used to it and if you want the longest lashes possible you must wait after its dry then apply more then wait then apply then wait to curl. So it will take longer than most would like to achieve the best looking lashes, but it makes mine super long. I have sparse tiny little light black lashes. You can make your look natural or dark by applying more. Very customizable mascara. Wish it held my curl better, but otherwise best I&#x27;ve tried. Just takes few tries to make it work.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Sephora years ago and I loved it. I bought it through this seller recently and it was totally different. The bottle opening is way too big so too much mascara comes out on the wand. It&#x27;s extremely runny like it&#x27;s been watered down and also stringy when appied. I looked like I had broken spider leg lashes. I am very disappointed and won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Amazing my eye lashes are so long and it lasts until I wash my face at night</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the quality of the mascara.</li>
            <li> BEST MASCARA FOR OILY SKIN IN HUMID AREA!</li>
            <li> Not the same Fiberwig formula, this used to be my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m OBSESSED with eyelashes and mascara. I&#x27;m taking a one month break from my eyelash extensions right now and my lashes are in the middle of their growth cycle right now. So my lashes look a little shorter than usual. This mascara is INCREDIBLE! It adds length and volume without the fibers getting messy or clumpy.  It wears well too with no smudging or flaking until the evening after wearing it all day. It&#x27;s also easy to remove with warm water.  No scrubbing your lashes! Will definitely order this mascara again!</li>
            <li> As advertised and quicker than promised</li>
            <li> I have tried all manner of drugstore mascaras and high end ones such as Dior... and while many of them make my lashes look full, they all smear eventually on my face. Fiberwig is not quite as lush as some, but stays put all day and night without a smear until I remove it with water. That makes it my number one choice for mascara!</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. You have to clean the brush of mascara about every fourth or fifth use because it gets gloppy. The mascara stays on all day, never puts dark spots under the eyes. It has great staying power. It is unlike anything I have ever used before. I can&#x27;t see myself using another mascara after using this. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and i think it&#x27;s well worth the price. Plus it never irritates my eyes and I have terrible allergies in the spring and summer.</li>
            <li> I have found my forever mascara.  It never smudges, a problem I had for decades until I found this.</li>
            <li> different product not the same</li>
            <li> Great, same formula as ever, I didn&#x27;t have any troubles.(-;</li>
            <li> So much better than your regular mascara available in the U.S.! No dark circles!!! It&#x27;s definitely not meant to make your lashes super thick or long but it works great for me.</li>
            <li> Really messy!  Its also prone ti clump.</li>
    </ol>
