            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>I have to say the dryer is incredible light but to my relief this didn’t sacrifice any of the power (1875w) and heat (hot!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t get the problem where it shuts off and needs to be reset that most inexpensive blow dryers have.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this dryer.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>As much as I love this dryer, there are a couple of cons:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This is lighter-weight than most dryers.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>, I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Maybe because I&#x27;m use to the handle but maybe in time it will get better.</li>
            <li>The handless feature is ok.</li>
            <li>Now, I have used many dryers in my years</li>
            <li>Also, the price on this dryer tends to be better</li>
            <li>I love my new blow Dyer works great</li>
            <li>Very light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I really love the cool touch grip on this blowdryer!</li>
            <li>I traded out the air concentration for one with a smaller opening and a diffuser would have been nice, but still a great dryer.</li>
            <li>Love, love my dryer, it really save your wrist!!!</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am very happy with the dryer over all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to maneuver</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use</li>
            <li>I still like it though because it&#x27;s really easy to handle and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Easy to use no hassle reaching the root of your hair.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight like the description states and it&#x27;s easy to manage while straightening with the attached comb.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong with no issues whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Its super light weight and easy to handle!</li>
            <li>I love that it has a cool setting and two heat settings and that it comes with 3 attachments.</li>
            <li>However as this product claims, it is truly Handle-less and extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li>the value this dryer brings (comfortable, power, durability), you won’t anything like this in the market.</li>
            <li>It did a great job of straightening my hair to prepare it to be flat ironed.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I kind of wish the cool shot was a press button that you could click in or out instead of completely changing the heat</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is &#x27;ok&#x27;, don&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
            <li>A cool shot.</li>
            <li>- the cool doesn&#x27;t work for me like in the video.</li>
            <li>&amp; the barrel stays cool to the touch.</li>
            <li>and I wanted a dryer that would be cool to the touch when using a pik attachment.</li>
            <li>It stays cool without sacrificing heat &amp; power of the dryer.</li>
            <li>Overall it was a good purchase for the price I don&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>This is an adequate blow-dryer, but now I am spoiled by technology - not just ionic-whatever, infra-red, too.  </li>
            <li>and it came to s quick.</li>
            <li>this has helped tremendously to prevent tangles. .</li>
            <li>I use it on medium heat and it still dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>How did I live without this?!?!?!?!</li>
            <li>I have very easy to manage hair too, so I was surprised.</li>
            <li>I love love love this dryer , it so much easier to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty thick hair and if my hair isn&#x27;t perfectly detangled at the root, the comb will pop off.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to maneuver and the fact that it&#x27;s handleless makes it that much easier to use.</li>
            <li>The cool touch grip does prevent the neck part of the dryer from getting too hot and had no problem holding it after both drying and pik straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>One con is that the comb seemed super sturdy but one of the teeth fell off, but with that being said it is still a million times better than the many replacement combs I had to buy for my previous dryer!</li>
            <li>If I need to repurchase it before then, well it&#x27;s still good in my book since I paid less than $30 for</li>
            <li>It dries my hair very fast</li>
            <li>She use the cool setting and was able to blow dry with NO HEAT!</li>
            <li>Much easier and quicker drying my hair with this blow dryer!</li>
            <li>I started using the hot setting but it defeats the purpose of trying not to use heat on my hair</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot when I hold it.  </li>
            <li>I have to adjust my comb on the dryer so that my hand doesn&#x27;t ache as much!</li>
            <li>but it is quite large.</li>
            <li>This is now my secret weapon for a great silk press.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier since acquiring this tool, because it&#x27;s allowed me to consolidate tools and use another hand to hold my hair taught.</li>
            <li>Maneuvering is so much easier and faster with this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>It dries hair fast.</li>
            <li>My roots got straight without hurting my scalp.</li>
            <li>I really did like the results that this dryer gave me.</li>
            <li>After using for a few months, everyone else in my family keeps stealing mine from me too--despite my mom having the popular Conair Infiniti pro dryer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very expensive.</li>
            <li>So easy to blow dry my hair now!</li>
            <li>I feel like it is a decent product for what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>I still highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li>The only thing I did not like too much is I expected the blow dryer to be smaller and to fit better into my hands</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The key feature that I like the most is the cool setting that I&#x27;m starting to dry my hair on.</li>
            <li>Then when it&#x27;s mostly dry, I dry the rest of it on a warm setting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used this with the comb attachment to get straight and soft results</li>
            <li>Handle-less makes this easier to hold than normal hair dryers (actually, normal hair dryers seem unwieldy after using this).</li>
            <li>My relaxed hair dried in half the time with straighter results which I am happy with.</li>
            <li>but when I am in the a rush I use the the tension dry method on the cool setting for my roots...</li>
            <li>If you ever tried using a dryer this way you would know how hot it can get and how the handle gets in the way when I try doing the back of my head.</li>
            <li>Also, sometimes the low heat gets hot and when I try to turn it off, it still runs.</li>
            <li>Oh, and this dryer can really get the job done on low heat, no need to use high.</li>
            <li>I used a texturizer several months ago and this blow dryer gets my hair straight to the point</li>
            <li>I had watched a you tube video where a young lady was blow drying her hair and using this dryer and Sebastian Trillian Thermal Protection.</li>
            <li>She says she never used the handle on her old hair dryer and this was the hair dryer she wanted.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>Also, after watching a YouTube video, I thought it would produce straight results without having to use a flat iron, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li>it makes it so much easier to blow dry my natural hair!</li>
            <li>If you have highly textured hair, I totally recommend this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>but after a few minutes of fumbling I got it right!  </li>
            <li>I have lots of long straight medium-textured hair.</li>
            <li>I have never blow dried my hair so quickly.</li>
            <li>The only dryer that I have used in the past that would give results equal to this dryer or better is the Conair Hair Infiniti Hair Designer, but I like that this dryer doesn&#x27;t pull and tug at your hair like the Hair Designer does.</li>
            <li>so you get your hair as straight as possible before flat ironing.</li>
            <li>Will recommend to anyone looking to get their hair straight as possible before flat ironing</li>
            <li>how managed to get near the intake vent in the back and the dryer sucked up some of my hair and pulled it out.</li>
            <li>I wrap my hand around the barrel of the dryer (where it is labeled &amp;#34;Handle Less 1875W&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>I am AA with fine thin natural hair.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair just as fast as my other dryers.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>sometimes it&#x27;s just barely cool--not actually</li>
            <li>the only thing that bothers me is that the comb attachment comes off when I&#x27;m blow drying my hair, but I am African American with natural hair</li>

            <li> Then when it&#x27;s mostly dry, I dry the rest of it on a warm setting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used this with the comb attachment to get straight and soft results</li>
            <li> Handle-less makes this easier to hold than normal hair dryers (actually, normal hair dryers seem unwieldy after using this).</li>
            <li> My relaxed hair dried in half the time with straighter results which I am happy with.</li>
            <li> but when I am in the a rush I use the the tension dry method on the cool setting for my roots...</li>
            <li> If you ever tried using a dryer this way you would know how hot it can get and how the handle gets in the way when I try doing the back of my head.</li>
            <li> Also, sometimes the low heat gets hot and when I try to turn it off, it still runs.</li>
            <li> Oh, and this dryer can really get the job done on low heat, no need to use high.</li>
            <li> I used a texturizer several months ago and this blow dryer gets my hair straight to the point</li>
            <li> I had watched a you tube video where a young lady was blow drying her hair and using this dryer and Sebastian Trillian Thermal Protection.</li>
            <li> She says she never used the handle on her old hair dryer and this was the hair dryer she wanted.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> Also, after watching a YouTube video, I thought it would produce straight results without having to use a flat iron, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> it makes it so much easier to blow dry my natural hair!</li>
            <li> If you have highly textured hair, I totally recommend this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> but after a few minutes of fumbling I got it right!  </li>
            <li> I have lots of long straight medium-textured hair.</li>
            <li> I have never blow dried my hair so quickly.</li>
            <li> The only dryer that I have used in the past that would give results equal to this dryer or better is the Conair Hair Infiniti Hair Designer, but I like that this dryer doesn&#x27;t pull and tug at your hair like the Hair Designer does.</li>
            <li> so you get your hair as straight as possible before flat ironing.</li>
            <li> Will recommend to anyone looking to get their hair straight as possible before flat ironing</li>
            <li> how managed to get near the intake vent in the back and the dryer sucked up some of my hair and pulled it out.</li>
            <li> I wrap my hand around the barrel of the dryer (where it is labeled &amp;#34;Handle Less 1875W&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> I am AA with fine thin natural hair.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair just as fast as my other dryers.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> sometimes it&#x27;s just barely cool--not actually</li>
            <li> the only thing that bothers me is that the comb attachment comes off when I&#x27;m blow drying my hair, but I am African American with natural hair</li>
            <li> Very small and light-weight, but powerful.</li>
            <li> Before I used a regular blow dryer and and  flat paddle brush to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It gets my hair flat iron straight after just a few passes on dripping wet hair.</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to hold the cold button.</li>
            <li> BUT I&#x27;ll take that over the teeth breaking, which I&#x27;ve used this for a few months, and no missing teeth yet.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it does not get as hot as my common brand beauty supply store bought blow dryer.</li>
            <li> After running styling cream through my hair, I use the dryer on the hottest setting and just dry my damp hair</li>
            <li> and it takes forever to air dry my roots.</li>
            <li> I blew my hair dry on &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am a natural girl with very thick, coarse and kinky hair.</li>
            <li> Not having a handle is not really an improvement for me.  </li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s lightweight, but the comb teeth broke with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> I have (partial natural) kinky thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have mid back length texlaxed thick hair</li>
            <li> The comb attachments were a godsend as the plastic is extremely durable and thick and not like the cheap plastic thin ones that break off after a couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It was always a but awkward in handling the conventional dryers and having to use a styling tool, but this lil beauty right here made it simple!</li>
            <li> The comes are soo hard and hurt my scalp if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li> The absence of the handle keeps my arm from wearing out after long days or clients with ultra thick hair.</li>
            <li> I will never purchase any other blow dryer with a handle again.</li>
            <li> The barrel of the dryer is not hot to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> An ionic setting--to help with frizz when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other than the con&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The cord is short and I noticed my hair was feeling dried out after using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> I have 4C natural hair and recently have decided to start a low heat regiment; this makes blow drying a breeze, no more tired arms and weird positions trying to dry the back of my head.</li>
            <li> Needs a cool shot button, the switch is a little inconvenient.</li>
            <li> up-side down.</li>
            <li> and it takes a lot less time to do my hair.</li>
            <li> Blow drying time is cut in half.</li>
            <li> Less hair sheds now than before.</li>
            <li> but the pieces don&#x27;t stay on tight as I&#x27;d like them to.</li>
            <li> However, there was one thing that I was not very happy about that anyone with long hair may want to keep in mind when using this dryer.</li>
            <li> My hands does feel kinda cramp after a little bit of trying to style my hair.</li>
            <li> I had a little differculty with holding it.</li>
            <li> Blowing drying was the most hated step in doing my hair--and it still is--</li>
            <li> The buttons are a little hard to move up and down.  </li>
            <li> I usually require.</li>
            <li> unfortunately my hair didn&#x27;t even come close to turning out the same as the video.</li>
            <li> so I look past these offsets.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t hate it as much now.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t multiple speeds or heat setting combination, but I like that this is a very simplistic tool.</li>
            <li> I find myself reaching for my old one :(</li>
            <li> Seriously I have no idea how I lived without a handle-less hair dryer</li>
            <li> so it is very thick.</li>
            <li> My wrist is also tired of holding this hand held dryer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to find blow dryers with comb attachments now, but this one has not one but 2 AND a concentrator nozzle.</li>
            <li> Not to bad, they slip off from time to time when I use it on my hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The best blow dryer ever!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and the body doesn&#x27;t get warm.</li>
            <li> Great blow dryer for naturals. I have 4C natural hair and recently have decided to start a low heat regiment; this makes blow drying a breeze, no more tired arms and weird positions trying to dry the back of my head. Would defiantly recommend. Oh, and this dryer can really get the job done on low heat, no need to use high.</li>
            <li> Not having a handle is not really an improvement for me.  This is an adequate blow-dryer, but now I am spoiled by technology - not just ionic-whatever, infra-red, too.  I need infra-red.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is &#x27;ok&#x27;, don&#x27;t use it very often. The cord is short and I noticed my hair was feeling dried out after using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> I will never purchase any other blow dryer with a handle again. I absolutely love this blow dryer. I&#x27;ve even dropped it a couple of times and nothing and it didn&#x27;t crack or dent or break in any way. Very light and easy to use. I almost couldn&#x27;t believe there was something in the box. Well if I ever need another one then I&#x27;ll def re purchase</li>
            <li> Good dryer but with my kinky hair, the comb part keeps coming off.  lol.  My wrist is also tired of holding this hand held dryer.  But does the job with no problem drying the hair.</li>
            <li> I am natural and this baby is awesome!!</li>
            <li> Perfect blow dryer! I haven&#x27;t touched my Solia since I got this one. It&#x27;s easy to maneuver so you get your hair as straight as possible before flat ironing. And I don&#x27;t get the problem where it shuts off and needs to be reset that most inexpensive blow dryers have. I&#x27;ve had mine since October, and if it lasts me for over a year, I&#x27;ll have considered it a great investment. If I need to repurchase it before then, well it&#x27;s still good in my book since I paid less than $30 for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s been a year and it&#x27;s still going strong with no issues whatsoever. I still highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> Love, love my dryer, it really save your wrist!!!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this dryer.  It is so easy to use and it takes a lot less time to do my hair. It gets my hair flat iron straight after just a few passes on dripping wet hair. One con is that the comb seemed super sturdy but one of the teeth fell off, but with that being said it is still a million times better than the many replacement combs I had to buy for my previous dryer!</li>
            <li> I have an FHI blow dryer and I use this solely since I&#x27;ve purchased it. I LOVE IT. If you have highly textured hair, I totally recommend this blow dryer. It&#x27;s almost impossible to find blow dryers with comb attachments now, but this one has not one but 2 AND a concentrator nozzle. This is now my secret weapon for a great silk press. Before I used a regular blow dryer and and  flat paddle brush to blow dry my hair. It makes it so much easier since acquiring this tool, because it&#x27;s allowed me to consolidate tools and use another hand to hold my hair taught. Maneuvering is so much easier and faster with this blow dryer. Blowing drying was the most hated step in doing my hair--and it still is-- but I don&#x27;t hate it as much now. There aren&#x27;t multiple speeds or heat setting combination, but I like that this is a very simplistic tool. As much as I love this dryer, there are a couple of cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The buttons are a little hard to move up and down.  It requires 2 hands to change the setting on this for me.&lt;br /&gt;- I kind of wish the cool shot was a press button that you could click in or out instead of completely changing the heat setting.&lt;br /&gt;- The attachments don&#x27;t stay on too well. I have pretty thick hair and if my hair isn&#x27;t perfectly detangled at the root, the comb will pop off. BUT I&#x27;ll take that over the teeth breaking, which I&#x27;ve used this for a few months, and no missing teeth yet.</li>
            <li> I do like this handle-less blow dryer. It dries my hair very fast and I love it. The only thing I did not like too much is I expected the blow dryer to be smaller and to fit better into my hands but it is quite large. Sometimes I like to use the blow dryer to do blowouts and styling. My hands does feel kinda cramp after a little bit of trying to style my hair.</li>
            <li> Much easier and quicker drying my hair with this blow dryer! Reduced drying time by about 50%!</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer ever in life.</li>
            <li> I bought this bc a hair stylist mentioned this dryer in a beauty blog post. She claimed it was convenient to pack away in her gym bag AND is now her go-to dryer while she&#x27;s at home. After using for a few months, everyone else in my family keeps stealing mine from me too--despite my mom having the popular Conair Infiniti pro dryer. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Handle-less makes this easier to hold than normal hair dryers (actually, normal hair dryers seem unwieldy after using this). NO JOKE. I wrap my hand around the barrel of the dryer (where it is labeled &amp;#34;Handle Less 1875W&amp;#34;). The barrel of the dryer is not hot to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;2. This is lighter-weight than most dryers.&lt;br /&gt;3. It dries my hair just as fast as my other dryers.&lt;br /&gt;4. It suits my needs. I have lots of long straight medium-textured hair. After running styling cream through my hair, I use the dryer on the hottest setting and just dry my damp hair up-side down. Then when it&#x27;s mostly dry, I dry the rest of it on a warm setting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked off one star bc I wish this had:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. A longer power cord.&lt;br /&gt;2. A cool shot. There is a &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34; setting but sometimes it&#x27;s just barely cool--not actually cold.&lt;br /&gt;3. A nozzle that didn&#x27;t fall off so easily.&lt;br /&gt;4. An ionic setting--to help with frizz when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other than the con&#x27;s, I love this dryer. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after seeing it on youtube and was intrigued by the design. I have a tendency to hold a dryer by the “neck” especially when I use a pik attachment to straighten out my curls. If you ever tried using a dryer this way you would know how hot it can get and how the handle gets in the way when I try doing the back of my head. However as this product claims, it is truly Handle-less and extremely comfortable. The cool touch grip does prevent the neck part of the dryer from getting too hot and had no problem holding it after both drying and pik straightening my hair. I have to say the dryer is incredible light but to my relief this didn’t sacrifice any of the power (1875w) and heat (hot!) I usually require. The comb attachments were a godsend as the plastic is extremely durable and thick and not like the cheap plastic thin ones that break off after a couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the value this dryer brings (comfortable, power, durability), you won’t anything like this in the market. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Produces great results!</li>
            <li> It was always a but awkward in handling the conventional dryers and having to use a styling tool, but this lil beauty right here made it simple! It takes a bit of getting use to but after a few minutes of fumbling I got it right!  Great tool you will not regret it and the cool touch nozzle works like a charm! Awesomeness!!!!</li>
            <li> I really love the cool touch grip on this blowdryer! it makes it so much easier to blow dry my natural hair!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Love love love it!</li>
            <li> I love my new blow Dyer works great</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s lightweight, but the comb teeth broke with minimal effort. Also, after watching a YouTube video, I thought it would produce straight results without having to use a flat iron, but that wasn&#x27;t the case. I still like it though because it&#x27;s really easy to handle and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I love it the only thing that bothers me is that the comb attachment comes off when I&#x27;m blow drying my hair, but I am African American with natural hair so it is very thick.</li>
            <li> Cord could be longer, but good dryer</li>
            <li> This is an amazing blow dryer. I have (partial natural) kinky thick curly hair. I used a texturizer several months ago and this blow dryer gets my hair straight to the point I can run my fingers through my hair. I love it. Blow drying time is cut in half. Less hair sheds now than before. Would repurchase and already have a family member planning on purchasing.</li>
            <li> Used this with the comb attachment to get straight and soft results</li>
            <li> this is very good. I love that I don&#x27;t have to hold the cold button. and it came to s quick.</li>
            <li> Easy to use no hassle reaching the root of your hair.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is by far the best!!!</li>
            <li> I had watched a you tube video where a young lady was blow drying her hair and using this dryer and Sebastian Trillian Thermal Protection. Her hair turned out so beautiful and smooth and shiny. She use the cool setting and was able to blow dry with NO HEAT! I bought both products and unfortunately my hair didn&#x27;t even come close to turning out the same as the video. I have very easy to manage hair too, so I was surprised. I started using the hot setting but it defeats the purpose of trying not to use heat on my hair - the cool doesn&#x27;t work for me like in the video. You get what you pay for. It&#x27;s not very expensive. The only plus is the versatility of the handle-less property.</li>
            <li> It dries hair fast. Its super light weight and easy to handle!</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer!!!!! My best investment ever!!!</li>
            <li> I love love love this dryer , it so much easier to dry my hair.  I have mid back length texlaxed thick hair and it takes forever to air dry my roots. I still have a lot of texture in my hair and as result the hair closer to my scalp air dries tangled. The scarf method works as well but when I am in the a rush I use the the tension dry method on the cool setting for my roots... this has helped tremendously to prevent tangles. . All my sisters will be getting this for xmas this year. If I could give this ten stars I would.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it does not get as hot as my common brand beauty supply store bought blow dryer. I am AA with fine thin natural hair. Very easy to use though &amp; the barrel stays cool to the touch.</li>
            <li> Great blow dryer! It is easy to use but the pieces don&#x27;t stay on tight as I&#x27;d like them to. Not to bad, they slip off from time to time when I use it on my hair. I suppose because I have textured hair. Also, sometimes the low heat gets hot and when I try to turn it off, it still runs. It still is an amazing dryer so I look past these offsets.</li>
            <li> How did I live without this?!?!?!?! So easy to blow dry my hair now! I love that it has a cool setting and two heat settings and that it comes with 3 attachments. Seriously I have no idea how I lived without a handle-less hair dryer</li>
            <li> Worth every penny! I purchased this product after seeing it on YouTube. I have never blow dried my hair so quickly. I went from taking 20-25 minutes to only taking 15. My roots got straight without hurting my scalp. This thing is small but it gets hot and it works no problem. It&#x27;s very light so it&#x27;s easy to maneuver and the fact that it&#x27;s handleless makes it that much easier to use. Definitely get this product.</li>
            <li> I got this hair dryer for my wife and she loves it. She says she never used the handle on her old hair dryer and this was the hair dryer she wanted. Happy wife, happy life.</li>
            <li> I had a little differculty with holding it. Maybe because I&#x27;m use to the handle but maybe in time it will get better. The comes are soo hard and hurt my scalp if I&#x27;m not careful. So I&#x27;m still on the fence about this one. I find myself reaching for my old one :(</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot when I hold it.  I blew my hair dry on &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34; who would have thunk that.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and I wanted a dryer that would be cool to the touch when using a pik attachment. I always tend to hold the neck of the dryer when straightening with a pik attachment. I love this dryer! It stays cool without sacrificing heat &amp; power of the dryer. I saw reviews of this dryer on youtube and it has lived up to everything they said it would do.</li>
            <li> The handle-less blow dryer is a great product. I feel like it is a decent product for what I paid for it. The key feature that I like the most is the cool setting that I&#x27;m starting to dry my hair on. The handless feature is ok. I feel like when I get to the back of my head I have to adjust my comb on the dryer so that my hand doesn&#x27;t ache as much! Overall it was a good purchase for the price I don&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> My relaxed hair dried in half the time with straighter results which I am happy with. Will recommend to anyone looking to get their hair straight as possible before flat ironing</li>
            <li> Very small and light-weight, but powerful. Needs a cool shot button, the switch is a little inconvenient. I traded out the air concentration for one with a smaller opening and a diffuser would have been nice, but still a great dryer. The absence of the handle keeps my arm from wearing out after long days or clients with ultra thick hair.</li>
            <li> I am a natural girl with very thick, coarse and kinky hair. Let me just say this product is amazing. Love it! It&#x27;s lightweight like the description states and it&#x27;s easy to manage while straightening with the attached comb. I use it on medium heat and it still dries my hair quickly.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and I would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Straightest i have ever got my relaxed hair with a blow dryer love it !!!!</li>
            <li> I really did like the results that this dryer gave me. It did a great job of straightening my hair to prepare it to be flat ironed. However, there was one thing that I was not very happy about that anyone with long hair may want to keep in mind when using this dryer. I had my hair sectioned off with clips and some of my hair some how managed to get near the intake vent in the back and the dryer sucked up some of my hair and pulled it out. Now, I have used many dryers in my years and I have never had that happen before! I had to turn the dryer off and remove the now tangled and somewhat melted hair out of the intake vent to continue drying my hair. Other than that, I am very happy with the dryer over all. The only dryer that I have used in the past that would give results equal to this dryer or better is the Conair Hair Infiniti Hair Designer, but I like that this dryer doesn&#x27;t pull and tug at your hair like the Hair Designer does. Also, the price on this dryer tends to be better that the price for the Hair Desiger.</li>
