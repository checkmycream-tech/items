            <li>So when I was offered this Makeup Brush Set from Soobest for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a set.  </li>
            <li>very soft and great bristles on brushes</li>
            <li>Excellenct quality and my new favorite brushes!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made from somewhat cheap materials, but its colors and design are completely adorable.</li>
            <li>Good pack of brushes, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Soft, beautiful, and so easy to clean.</li>
            <li>If you need a great set, for low cost or need a beginner&#x27;s set for someone I can&#x27;t recommend this set more.</li>
            <li>This is the first brush set that I have bought and I am pretty happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I own the same set in Sigma Brushes and this set I ordered, and also a good amount of Sedona Lace Brushes.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for high quality brushes for a good price.  </li>
            <li>The brushes really are great right out of the case.  </li>
            <li>First off I would like to say my package arrived on time and fully secured!&lt;br /&gt;The brush case that contains the brushes is an extremely nice size.</li>
            <li>Great range of brushes and super soft!</li>
            <li>I got the black with gold and they are perfect!</li>
            <li>They make blending a breeze, and precise placement easy peasy.</li>
            <li>These definitely fit both of those things.  </li>
            <li>They clean so easy.  </li>
            <li>I just got them today and had to use them as soon as the delivery was confirmed.</li>
            <li>but they really did an awesome job at blending and keeping the color to a specific area.</li>
            <li>Love most of the brushes the others I really didn&#x27;t care for</li>
            <li>The cute case they come in is a huge plus, very sturdy and useful!</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and smooth while the handles at nice and study.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and you get a nice array of sizes.  </li>
            <li>the brushes are pretty smooth and no shedding at all not to mention that they are easy to clean.and</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these brushes to anyone who is looking for affordable good qualitt brushes.</li>
            <li>The opinion in this review is unbiased and 100% true.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s only good for contouring.</li>
            <li>Contouring was easy with these brushes and the carrying case is so pretty</li>
            <li>If you are looking for some GOOD quality brushes pay a little more and go with either Sigma Brushes or Sedona Lace.....</li>
            <li>The case is plastic and had a chemical smell, but luckily it didn&#x27;t effect the brushes since they were wrapped well in plastic.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with these and would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>and I love the little bag the came in very stylish</li>
            <li>Very soft and elegant</li>
            <li>They are super soft and they hold the color so you don&#x27;t drop any on the counter top.</li>
            <li>They have little weight for great application.</li>
            <li>These are some great little brushes at the price point.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>The case they came in is soft and okay to store them in but being that the smell probably came from the case I won&#x27;t be using it.</li>
            <li>I really love these brushes and they&#x27;re just what I needed to complete my makeup brush set.</li>
            <li>These are high quality soft brushes that can honestly handle any makeup task.</li>
            <li>Literally my life right now used them to  blend my foundation</li>
            <li>I just received these brushes in the mail today, I tried them out right away</li>
            <li>I washed the brushes right away.</li>
            <li>Hopefully its just because they&#x27;re new  &amp; they&#x27;ll work fine from now on.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and it&#x27;s so easy to apply makeup with them.</li>
            <li>Pretty brushes though.</li>
            <li>It came with a pretty make up pouch.</li>
            <li>I opened the package, I was first hit by the cuteness of the carrying pouch.</li>
            <li>I will say that in my completely honest opinion, I will not need any other brushes.  </li>
            <li>the smell was pretty much gone</li>
            <li>Super soft.</li>
            <li>The are dense but super soft.</li>
            <li>Brushes are super soft.</li>
            <li>and I am going to have to invest in high-end brushes or stick with Real Techniques.  </li>
            <li>Much better than expected.</li>
            <li>These brushes are smaller than they appear and are really cheap.</li>
            <li>This set is really comparable to my Sigma kabuki set in that it has the softness and density of the Sigma brushes.  </li>
            <li>I really thought what the heck... for $10</li>
            <li>and I love the retro pink color.  </li>
            <li>I am finally ready to review these brushes.</li>
            <li>The hairs in these are very flimsy, not firm/</li>
            <li>The face brushes are very compact and sturdy with use.</li>
            <li>The seller shipped out extremely fast and it was packaged well.</li>

            <li>Thanks Soobest...</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re not too concerned with name brands and want an everyday set that is worth more than what you&#x27;re paying for this is the set to purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found the right brushes for me!</li>
            <li>At the price, I hoped to be getting some decent, emergency-use or traveling brushes, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting fireworks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes if you&#x27;re looking for high quality at a bargain price.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a brush junkie and have everything from high end to $1 brushes.</li>
            <li>They do not feel cheap or hollow at the handle.</li>
            <li>They are extremely soft and gentle to the touch.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so amazingly soft and work really well too except the shadow brushes.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft and I haven&#x27;t  had any issues with shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking for high quality brushes without the high pricing, these are it.  </li>
            <li>I did leave my brushed in my car so the case got a little warm and stuck to one of the brushes.</li>
            <li>Also this is claimed to be new, but the brushes have scratches.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and the hairs do not shed when I use them.</li>
            <li>No shedding and they are very soft.</li>
            <li>These brushes are perfect for beginnersüôã A little thick for tiny details</li>
            <li>Soft and does the job!</li>
            <li>The brushes did have a slight chemical smell but was fine after washing.  </li>
            <li>The bag that they come in is a little cheap and the snaps will probably come off eventually</li>
            <li>Makeup brushes are soft.</li>
            <li>They are soft and even come with a chart to help with what brush to use when.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft, but if the hairs fall out they are of no use to me..</li>
            <li>These brushes are incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes are supper soft to the touch</li>

            <li>they are so soft</li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft but not too soft just right.might</li>
            <li>These are fantastically soft and durable.  </li>
            <li>It was like opening old Tupperware that&#x27;s been in the cabinet with a lid on.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fall apart, the brushes feel so soft, applys</li>
            <li>I mean it doesn&#x27;t get better.</li>
            <li>I usually just use the ones that the product comes with but they fall apart easily.  </li>
            <li>I have only recently started using brushes to apply my makeup, so I cannot compare to any of the higher end brushes out there.  </li>
            <li>There is some light shedding, but far less than I&#x27;d expected.</li>
            <li>The case seems like it might come apart at the buttons if you are not careful, but I am not worried about the case.  </li>
            <li>I have been needing to get some new make-up brushes for a long time now.</li>
            <li>They did have a slight smell to them when I first got them</li>
            <li>A few were shedding when I first opened.  </li>
            <li>Already had a few hairs/bristles shed during first use.</li>
            <li>They did shed a little on the first wash but that&#x27;s the only thing keeping them from 5 stars!</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re so large and makes quite the mess.</li>
            <li>I had previously purchased I more expensive set that I ended up returning because the brushes would shed too much.</li>

            <li> I washed the brushes right away.</li>
            <li> Hopefully its just because they&#x27;re new  &amp; they&#x27;ll work fine from now on.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and it&#x27;s so easy to apply makeup with them.</li>
            <li> Pretty brushes though.</li>

            <li> The bristles are so soft and I haven&#x27;t  had any issues with shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking for high quality brushes without the high pricing, these are it.  </li>
            <li> I did leave my brushed in my car so the case got a little warm and stuck to one of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Also this is claimed to be new, but the brushes have scratches.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and the hairs do not shed when I use them.</li>
            <li> No shedding and they are very soft.</li>

            <li> The brushes did have a slight chemical smell but was fine after washing.  </li>

            <li> They are soft and even come with a chart to help with what brush to use when.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, but if the hairs fall out they are of no use to me..</li>
            <li> These brushes are incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes are supper soft to the touch</li>
            <li> I like how dense and soft this set is.</li>

            <li> These are fantastically soft and durable.  </li>
            <li> It was like opening old Tupperware that&#x27;s been in the cabinet with a lid on.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fall apart, the brushes feel so soft, applys</li>
            <li> I mean it doesn&#x27;t get better.</li>
            <li> I usually just use the ones that the product comes with but they fall apart easily.  </li>
            <li> I have only recently started using brushes to apply my makeup, so I cannot compare to any of the higher end brushes out there.  </li>
            <li> There is some light shedding, but far less than I&#x27;d expected.</li>
            <li> The case seems like it might come apart at the buttons if you are not careful, but I am not worried about the case.  </li>
            <li> I have been needing to get some new make-up brushes for a long time now.</li>
            <li> They did have a slight smell to them when I first got them</li>
            <li> A few were shedding when I first opened.  </li>
            <li> Already had a few hairs/bristles shed during first use.</li>
            <li> They did shed a little on the first wash but that&#x27;s the only thing keeping them from 5 stars!</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re so large and makes quite the mess.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased I more expensive set that I ended up returning because the brushes would shed too much.</li>
            <li> I find myself picking up the slanted flat which I will call as SB80 instead of my Sigma F80.  </li>
            <li> I use them everyday, they feel so soft!</li>
            <li> The case is cute, but it really stinks.</li>
            <li> She a make-up artist and the set is cheap in price but expensive in quality.</li>
            <li> other than that I think I would definitely recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> I needed to really use them for a few months and wash them a few times first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They seemed a little big</li>
            <li> There was minimal shedding.  </li>

            <li> I also think a couple are cut unevenly.  </li>
            <li> I bought a face brush set from Luxe a few months ago.</li>
            <li> The eye brushes are also thick but not to stiff.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Literally my life right now used them to  blend my foundation and it was heaven. Contouring was easy with these brushes and the carrying case is so pretty</li>
            <li> A few were shedding when I first opened.  I also think a couple are cut unevenly.  I did not notice a chemical smell. I think you get what you pay for and I am going to have to invest in high-end brushes or stick with Real Techniques.  Pretty brushes though.</li>
            <li> these brushes are beautiful!!! and they work great! I&#x27;ve finally found the right brushes for me! i love these brushes and the softness of them. my makeup glides on perfectly.</li>
            <li> Much better than expected.Soft and does the job!</li>
            <li> Makeup brushes are soft. Not as dense as sigma brushes, but a still very good. The brushes  had a terrible odor when I took them out of the package.. I washed them twice to get rid of the scent. There was minimal shedding.  For the price it is was a great deal. These brushes are best for beginners who don&#x27;t wait to invest too much into brushes yet. For a makeup addict such as myself, I prefer sigma and morphe brushes.</li>
            <li> Very soft and elegant</li>
            <li> I love this brushes! I bought make up brushes from Amazon before but it smelled. I didn&#x27;t even bother using it. But this one didn&#x27;t. It came with a pretty make up pouch. It&#x27;s soft and I&#x27;m glad I bought it. I would have to get another one for my sister. I definitely recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> i love this set! I got the black with gold and they are perfect! the brushes are pretty smooth and no shedding at all not to mention that they are easy to clean.and also they come with a very nice looking case.. I was afraid to buy this here because of some negative review but I still gave it a try and I am vey much happy!</li>
            <li> These are a nice inexpensive set of make up brushes. They are soft and even come with a chart to help with what brush to use when.</li>
            <li> These brushes are smaller than they appear and are really cheap. The brushes are falling apart and doesn&#x27;t blend makeup well. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> These are okay for beginners. There is some light shedding, but far less than I&#x27;d expected. The case is the most hideous thing I have ever seen and I hope to replace it.</li>
            <li> The hairs are falling out in clumps from the brushes. The brushes are soft, but if the hairs fall out they are of no use to me..Also this is claimed to be new, but the brushes have scratches. The case is cute, but it really stinks. It smells like permanent marker.</li>
            <li> I have been needing to get some new make-up brushes for a long time now. I usually just use the ones that the product comes with but they fall apart easily.  So when I was offered this Makeup Brush Set from Soobest for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a set.  They arrived and i wanted to test out a couple brushes. The smaller tipped brushes work great for eye shadow!! They seemed a little big but they really did an awesome job at blending and keeping the color to a specific area. The bigger brushes work perfectly at giving all over bronzing or blushing cheeks. They are super soft and they hold the color so you don&#x27;t drop any on the counter top. I definitely recommend this Makeup Brush Set for anyone who puts on makeup.</li>
            <li> I like them very nice quality</li>
            <li> very soft and great bristles on brushes and I love the little bag the came in very stylish</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this make brushüíù</li>
            <li> I own a Sigma brush set and I thought I would try this brush set because of the name (yeah, LOL) and the color but was so NOT disappointed!  This set is really comparable to my Sigma kabuki set in that it has the softness and density of the Sigma brushes.  I find myself picking up the slanted flat which I will call as SB80 instead of my Sigma F80.  I really thought what the heck... for $10 and I love the retro pink color.  The brushes did have a slight chemical smell but was fine after washing.  The case is adorable too.  Soobest is pretty good, soo go for it.</li>
            <li> I am finally ready to review these brushes. I needed to really use them for a few months and wash them a few times first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these brushes. I really honestly can&#x27;t believe the quality of these brushes. Some of the reviews i read about them before i bought them seemed like they were written the day they were received. I love the way they apply my make up and blend in products for a seemless and flawless look. I do wish the brush intended for powder was a bit fluffier but i have repurposed it to use for highlighting and it works like a dream. I would definitely recommend these brushes to anyone who is looking for affordable good qualitt brushes. Obviously these are not my dream brushes. BUT i love using them and have had great success with them ... contouring ans everything.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brushes if you&#x27;re looking for high quality at a bargain price. They grab and deposit the perfect amount of product and blend flawlessly. The case is great too!</li>
            <li> Love this brushes! Quality is fantastic and no shedding! My one complaint is that I wish they were numbered.</li>
            <li> I own the same set in Sigma Brushes and this set I ordered, and also a good amount of Sedona Lace Brushes. THESE BRUSHES DO NOT COMPARE in quality to the brushes I mentioned. The hairs in these are very flimsy, not firm/dense at all! They do have a chemical scent to them, which washing would probably take care of. If you are looking for some GOOD quality brushes pay a little more and go with either Sigma Brushes or Sedona Lace..... these in my opinion will not give you that airbrush look</li>
            <li> I just got these today. Just opening them and they smell like glue.I don&#x27;t think the smell is from the brushes. I think it is the from the cute case they came wrapped in. These brushes are incredibly soft. They do not feel cheap or hollow at the handle. They feel like quality brushes. The case they came in is soft and okay to store them in but being that the smell probably came from the case I won&#x27;t be using it. The only reason for four stars instead of 5 is the smell. other than that I think I would definitely recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! I use them everyday, they feel so soft!</li>
            <li> Super soft. I was very excited to be chosen to review this. I read other review saying they smelled weird. When I opened package the scent is what stuff smells like when wrapped in plastic. These feel wonderful when used. And absolutely love the brush holder it came with.only down fall is I wish they would put what kind of brush it was o  brush</li>
            <li> great value for the price!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing</li>
            <li> Excellenct quality and my new favorite brushes!!</li>
            <li> First off I would like to say my package arrived on time and fully secured!&lt;br /&gt;The brush case that contains the brushes is an extremely nice size. I would use it as a traveling case because its not to big. The face brushes are very compact and sturdy with use. The eye brushes are also thick but not to stiff. All the brushes pick up the makeup product very well and distribute wonderfully. Also, the blending ability these brushes have is phenomenal. They are extremely soft and gentle to the touch. I was extremely impressed by this product and would defiantly recommend it to a friend!</li>
            <li> I am so impressed. No shedding either. These brushes feel so good on my face! Highly recommend. I did leave my brushed in my car so the case got a little warm and stuck to one of the brushes. I pulled it too hard and the gold piece and brush head popped off :( I just stuck it back on and viola!</li>
            <li> These are high quality soft brushes that can honestly handle any makeup task. I am very impressed with them considering what a bargain they are. The seller shipped out extremely fast and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li> What a great deal.I bought a face brush set from Luxe a few months ago. They are high end great brushes. This is the perfect dupe and I wish I had bought these instead. They have little weight for great application. The are dense but super soft. The case is plastic and had a chemical smell, but luckily it didn&#x27;t effect the brushes since they were wrapped well in plastic. I&#x27;m so very excited about the eye shadow brushes. I mean it doesn&#x27;t get better. They make blending a breeze, and precise placement easy peasy. I received at a discount for an honest review and paying full price is steal. If you need a great set, for low cost or need a beginner&#x27;s set for someone I can&#x27;t recommend this set more.</li>
            <li> In love!!! So happy I bought 2! Hair does not fall out and doesn&#x27;t leave streaky, perfect full coverage!</li>
            <li> The brushes are Incredible and awesome deal!</li>
            <li> These are some great little brushes at the price point.  They are very soft and you get a nice array of sizes.  Unlike other reviews I did not notice any smell when I opened them.  This is the first brush set that I have bought and I am pretty happy with this purchase.  The bag that they come in is a little cheap and the snaps will probably come off eventually but it is just a bonus and does not affect the functionality of the brushes at all.  I received these at as part of a promotion for my honest opinion.  I would recommend these to friends and family who love makeup but are on a budget.</li>
            <li> I just received these brushes in the mail today, I tried them out right away and I must say they are amazing! They are so soft and it&#x27;s so easy to apply makeup with them. I love them!</li>
            <li> Great range of brushes and super soft! Haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding, and brushes seem to be well attached to the handles. Came in a nice case for storing or carrying- will likely use these as my set when I travel being as they are so convo entirely packaged.  Might buy another set to gift to my swap sister in the makeup group I am apart of!</li>
            <li> I really love these makeup brushes! They are very soft and the hairs do not shed when I use them. They did have a slight smell to them when I first got them but that was just because of the bag they came in. I let them air out and the smell was pretty much gone and once I washed them, it was 100% gone! The opinion in this review is unbiased and 100% true.</li>
            <li> I have had these brushes a couple days. When I opened the package, their was slight odor from the packaging. It was coming from the cute caring case that the brushes came in. I washed the brushes right away. I did notice a little sheading from the brushes, but very minimal. The brushes are supper soft to the touch and they do apply my makeup flawlessly. I would recommend these brushes to my friends and family. I am very happy with the brushes for the price range. I did receive a discount for review.</li>
            <li> Would like 2 re purchase 1 day.</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes!</li>
            <li> I like how dense and soft this set is. I had previously purchased I more expensive set that I ended up returning because the brushes would shed too much. Not this set, I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not too concerned with name brands and want an everyday set that is worth more than what you&#x27;re paying for this is the set to purchase.</li>
            <li> I got these brushes as a review trader deal. I&#x27;m a brush junkie and have everything from high end to $1 brushes. I was surprisingly happy with how well these brushes hold up! I didn&#x27;t have any plastic smell when I opened them and I washed them and have been using them ever since. They did shed a little on the first wash but that&#x27;s the only thing keeping them from 5 stars! The cute case they come in is a huge plus, very sturdy and useful! Overall I am very happy with these and would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes and they&#x27;re just what I needed to complete my makeup brush set. The bristles are soft and smooth while the handles at nice and study. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The absolute BEST brushes I have ever owned. Soft, beautiful, and so easy to clean. Well be buying again. Wonderful service also! I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect brushes and these were definitely by far the best!</li>
            <li> Wife love the set. I got her two sets for back up. She a make-up artist and the set is cheap in price but expensive in quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this with a discount and I love them they are so soft I wouldn&#x27;t think twice about buying then again.</li>
            <li> Good pack of brushes, fast shipping. Already had a few hairs/bristles shed during first use. Hopefully its just because they&#x27;re new  &amp; they&#x27;ll work fine from now on.</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect for beginnersüôã A little thick for tiny details so it&#x27;s only good for contouring. The brushes are really soft but not too soft just right.might I add that the packaging is gorgeous! So happy with my buy.</li>
            <li> Love this adorable set of make up brushes.  I have been looking for high quality brushes for a good price.  These definitely fit both of those things.  The bristles are so soft and I haven&#x27;t  had any issues with shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking for high quality brushes without the high pricing, these are it.  Thanks soobest</li>
            <li> I have only recently started using brushes to apply my makeup, so I cannot compare to any of the higher end brushes out there.  I will say that in my completely honest opinion, I will not need any other brushes.  These are fantastically soft and durable.  The case seems like it might come apart at the buttons if you are not careful, but I am not worried about the case.  The brushes really are great right out of the case.  The are a perfect fit to my hand, apply and blend my makeup like a pro.  They do not have an odor and I have had no problem with shedding.  They clean so easy.  I am so happy to have these brushes in my arsenal!  Thanks Soobest...these are amazing!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes because I have a weakness for makeup brushes, end of story. At the price, I hoped to be getting some decent, emergency-use or traveling brushes, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting fireworks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the package, I was first hit by the cuteness of the carrying pouch. It&#x27;s made from somewhat cheap materials, but its colors and design are completely adorable. It Also appears to be fairly well constructed, despite the quality of the materials themselves, and I don&#x27;t expect this pouch to be falling apart any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening the carrying case was a different experience. The SMELL got on my nerves immediately. It was like opening old Tupperware that&#x27;s been in the cabinet with a lid on. That stale, plastic smell that most people mistake for paint. I took the plastic sleeves off the brushes and let them air overnight. However, the smell was still lingering the next day, so I decided to wash the brushes before I used them. Wh</li>
            <li> I love these. I just got them today and had to use them as soon as the delivery was confirmed. They&#x27;re so amazingly soft and work really well too except the shadow brushes. they are really hard to apply with. they&#x27;re so large and makes quite the mess.</li>
            <li> Honestly im so inlove with COSMETICS, very good brushes. They don&#x27;t fall apart, the brushes feel so soft, applys my make up so good (:</li>
            <li> Brushes are super soft. Very nice for this price point!</li>
            <li> The texture of these brushes are so nice. No shedding and they are very soft. Minimal smell</li>
            <li> Love most of the brushes the others I really didn&#x27;t care for</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase</li>
