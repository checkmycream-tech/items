            <li>I just wish we could find it in more stores or beauty supply houses as in Sallys!!</li>
            <li>This is the best thickening spray for fine hair EVER.  </li>
            <li>I wish Pureology still made this product, it was the best thing on the market for Fine Hair.</li>
            <li>If you have money to throw away and like salon brand products, this is good.  </li>

            <li>Great product for easily adding body.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for women that have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>whole Pureology line is great!</li>
            <li>Having said that, blow drying the hair really does give you the best results.</li>
            <li>I was told that Loreal bought the company, and is  reformulating many of their products ( some having a good outcome, but not in this case)  </li>
            <li>I am a no-fuss kind of girl when it comes to my hair and this product hits the mark.</li>
            <li>It has a light, pleasant scent....</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and need a boost..</li>
            <li>Pureology products, (especially the volume line of products) is in my opinion the best product on the market.  </li>
            <li>It does not make your hair have static like so many others do.  </li>
            <li>The thickening spray is way better than the aveda stuff.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I love Pureology products.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair and this smooths and gives my hair more body without getting frizzy.</li>
            <li>I particularly LOVE this product, I have fine hair and it has worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li>Looks great and the coat still feels &#x27;natural&#x27;</li>
            <li>It makes your hair thicker and full !</li>
            <li>This product has two great aspects:  one, there isn&#x27;t a fragrance to it that is noticeable, so it doesn&#x27;t compete with my cologne or give my hair a particular fragrance; two, it really does give me a lot more volume.  </li>
            <li>I love this product for my super fine/thin hair but the salon price was almost $25</li>
            <li>Great product for just enough voluminizing.</li>
            <li>I love this product because my hairstyle lasts and the volume even stays in hot, humid weather.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a product that really works, but everything else I&#x27;ve tried worked better than this.</li>
            <li>Excellent for fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>This product gives great body to hair without build-up and weighting the hair down.</li>
            <li>It actually gives my hair texture and volume that lasts all day and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>Not all my local beauty supply stores carry this product so I was glad to find it on on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>That product did great if I went through the trouble of actually blow drying, but that was rare for me.</li>
            <li>Not sure why some are not getting good results with pureology products...</li>
            <li>I got a pureology pure volume sample sizes of the shampoo, conditioner, and this thickening spray.</li>
            <li>I have very short and fairly fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It provided more body for the first day, then felt like it was weighing my hair down.  </li>
            <li>GREAT for fine thin hair!!</li>
            <li>The bottle lasts months, as I only give sections of my hair a quick \\&quot;spritz\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Next day, just the right amount of body.</li>
            <li>Most of these type of products give very little to no volume added to your hair.  </li>
            <li>The price charged here was reasonable; most are charging a ridiculous amount for 4oz of hair product.</li>
            <li>Well maybe complete fraud.</li>
            <li>Its also a fantastic product because it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li>I used to use [[ASIN:B002T5IL8C Pureology Pure Volume Blowdry Amplifier, 7 Ounce]], applied to washed, damp hair then combed through and allowed to dry naturally.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair and need all the help I can get.  </li>
            <li>It really makes my hair fuller and thicker without weighing it down</li>
            <li>I spray and comb it through towel-dried hair and let it dry naturally overnight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I have a little natural body for about 4 hours after it dries naturally, then *pffft</li>

            <li> Pureology products, (especially the volume line of products) is in my opinion the best product on the market.  I just wish we could find it in more stores or beauty supply houses as in Sallys!!</li>
            <li> Excellent for fine, thin hair.  I love this product because my hairstyle lasts and the volume even stays in hot, humid weather.  A great product.</li>
            <li> If you have money to throw away and like salon brand products, this is good.  I have shoulder length wavy/curly hair and my hair dresser (Red Door Salon) recommened this for volume (spray some between layers towards the roots, not ends).  It does nothing that $2.99 hair-spray can&#x27;t do.  Overall I&#x27;m not impressed, especially for the cost.</li>
            <li> This is the best thickening spray for fine hair EVER.  It does not make your hair have static like so many others do.  It makes your hair thicker and full !</li>
            <li> Great product for just enough voluminizing. Would recommend but use sparingly or can cause stiffness. Would recommend spraying at root line on areas where you need some volume.</li>
            <li> I have very short and fairly fine hair.  This product has two great aspects:  one, there isn&#x27;t a fragrance to it that is noticeable, so it doesn&#x27;t compete with my cologne or give my hair a particular fragrance; two, it really does give me a lot more volume.  I spray it on, &amp;#34;mess up&amp;#34; my hair with my fingers, and just let it dry.  Once dry, I sometimes add a gel or texturizing pomade, but not always.</li>
            <li> Thickens my hair and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I will continue to purchase this product as it&#x27;s the best I have found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had fine, thin hair. It&#x27;s about an inch or 2 past my shoulders and I&#x27;ve always had trouble getting volume in my hair without getting it greasy. This spray is great! I&#x27;ve been using the Aveda thickening spray which isn&#x27;t too bad. I got a pureology pure volume sample sizes of the shampoo, conditioner, and this thickening spray. The thickening spray is way better than the aveda stuff. It actually gives my hair texture and volume that lasts all day and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> GREAT for fine thin hair!! spend the money at get it!!!! I love this stuff! will be ordering this stuff again</li>
            <li> I love Pureology and this thickening spray does what it says it will do. I have fine curly hair and this smooths and gives my hair more body without getting frizzy.</li>
            <li> This product gives volume to my baby-fine hair without weighing it down.  It has a light, pleasant scent....not at all overpowering. The bottle lasts months, as I only give sections of my hair a quick \\&quot;spritz\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Great price! Will buy again along with shampoo &amp; conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best product that I&#x27;ve used in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole Pureology line is great!</li>
            <li> Not sure why some are not getting good results with pureology products...I particularly LOVE this product, I have fine hair and it has worked wonders for me. Having said that, blow drying the hair really does give you the best results.</li>
            <li> Most of these type of products give very little to no volume added to your hair.  This product, however, makes your hair &#x3D; va-va-voom fluffy big hair!  I love Pureology products.</li>
            <li> I wish Pureology still made this product, it was the best thing on the market for Fine Hair. I was told that Loreal bought the company, and is  reformulating many of their products ( some having a good outcome, but not in this case)  I have had to do a lot of experimentation to find a comparable hair product.</li>
            <li> Great product for easily adding body. I am a no-fuss kind of girl when it comes to my hair and this product hits the mark. I spray and comb it through towel-dried hair and let it dry naturally overnight. Next day, just the right amount of body. Haven&#x27;t tried blow-drying to see if it amps up the volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal hair - not thick, not fine, not full, not sparse. I have a little natural body for about 4 hours after it dries naturally, then *pffft* flat. I used to use [[ASIN:B002T5IL8C Pureology Pure Volume Blowdry Amplifier, 7 Ounce]], applied to washed, damp hair then combed through and allowed to dry naturally. It provided more body for the first day, then felt like it was weighing my hair down.  That product did great if I went through the trouble of actually blow drying, but that was rare for me.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Thats all I can say. Well maybe complete fraud.</li>
            <li> I use it on my dog prior to dog shows to give his hair some volume.  Looks great and the coat still feels &#x27;natural&#x27;</li>
            <li> I love this product and am so disappointed that Pureology quit making it.  The price charged here was reasonable; most are charging a ridiculous amount for 4oz of hair product. This product gives great body to hair without build-up and weighting the hair down.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser told me about this.. I have very fine hair and need a boost.. This works without making things stiff or sticky. love it</li>
            <li> I love this product for my super fine/thin hair but the salon price was almost $25 and I could see splurging . I use the product almost every day and the bottle last a long time. It really makes my hair fuller and thicker without weighing it down</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair.  I sprayed this in while still damp, then blow dried.  All it did was make my hair feel dirty.  I haven&#x27;t found a product that really works, but everything else I&#x27;ve tried worked better than this.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for women that have fine hair.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot.  The key is to spray in wet/damp hair and blow dry on low to medium heat.  Use a barrel brush for added volume.  Its also a fantastic product because it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am quite happy with this product, it makes my hair look bouncy and full, without the sticky residue ! Def. recommend....</li>
            <li> I have been using this volume thickening spray for about two years.  Not all my local beauty supply stores carry this product so I was glad to find it on on Amazon.  I have used other volumizing sprays but I like the results  of this product best.  I have very fine, thin hair and need all the help I can get.  This is it!</li>
