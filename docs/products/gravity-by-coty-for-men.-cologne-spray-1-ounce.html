    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This company appears to respect there customer&#x27;s and give excellent service.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best men&#x27;s cologne, it&#x27;s not too musky or woodsy.  </li>
            <li>This is the best of the &amp;#34;cheap colognes &amp;#34; people don&#x27;t know what it is but do notice.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful!</li>

            <li>GREAT stuff...</li>
            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>The cologne isn&#x27;t as good as I remembered.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So glad someone still sells it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice scent without being over-powering.</li>
            <li>When this came in the mail i was hoping it was going to be a decent fragrance,but it turned out to be in EXCELLENT fragrance.</li>
            <li>Thanks and very good job by coty.</li>
            <li>was what I wanted and delivered quick!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the smell of Gravity . . .</li>
            <li>I love when he wears it.  </li>
            <li>The scent is musky, sexy and isn&#x27;t overpowering - I don&#x27;t like cologne that you can smell on someone from a mile</li>
            <li>Reminded me of a more pungent Axe Body Spray, which isn&#x27;t a compliment.</li>
            <li>im buying it at sears and its a 2pack for $15 that is a better deal</li>
            <li>I love it....</li>
            <li>I use to wear this fragrance quite often until many stores stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li>For those of us who still enjoy it its nice to see someone still sells it.</li>
            <li>I of course love the scent too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alright, but I think there are better choices now.  </li>
            <li>Like many things found in ones child hood</li>
            <li>I thought it would be cool to own again.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect, not too strong and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>This one is unique and have received many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>This was a gift and very well received, he was very pleased with it</li>
            <li>so the company is just fine...</li>
            <li>thank you for the availability and quick delivery!</li>
            <li>A great manly smell that last and not to over powering.</li>
            <li>what can you expect for something so cheap I guess?</li>
            <li>Was so excited to find this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this if you like good clean, smooth.</li>
            <li>Gravity has the quality scent that  i was looking for that has a good scent that last without blowing your nose away !</li>
            <li>One or two sprays should be good enough!</li>
            <li>I have been wearing different brands of cologne for many years and I have always made sure I have had this in my cologne collection.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and came in in one piece.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband YEARS ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any stores where we live.</li>
            <li>Not being a constant user of cologne, I thought I&#x27;d re-order something I liked.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product due to the fair price and they had the amount I needed in stock.</li>
            <li>well, it smells like cologne all right.</li>
            <li>Received this mysterious purple bottle as a gift eighteen years ago and I have never bought a bottle of anything else thereafter, its &#x27;light&#x27; and very unintrusive, but extremely memorable.</li>
            <li>After eighteen years I still get asked in public (especially in an elevator, lol)</li>
            <li>I used this way back in the days of High School and forgot about but remember all the girlfriends loving it.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a better bargain to buy individually here on Amazon than store gift sets...</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as describedðŸ˜„</li>
            <li>Priced right and delivery prompt with product whole.</li>
            <li>Not as popular as other colognes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this cologne for about 20 years now, although I wore it a lot more 10 to 20 years ago when I was single.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this cologne!</li>
            <li>As I no longer see it available in the stores, I will be looking online again in the future!</li>
            <li>I love it, smells manly but subtle and not too strong.</li>
            <li>it is true that smells can bring back memories!</li>
            <li>didtn expect nothing more, nothing less, its wut i wanted and didnt take forever to get here.</li>
            <li>lol I have &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; countless pillows, t-shirts and even a pair of shades to girls as &#x27;forced gifts&#x27; because of this stuff lingering on them.</li>
            <li>I used to wear this when I was in high school.  </li>
            <li>Definitely has what I&#x27;d call a &#x27;sweet but mature&#x27; scent...</li>
            <li>The scent was good but two of the bottles spray heads were broken.</li>
            <li>Very well priced and this is the only place I could find it.</li>
            <li>I once had a bottle of Gravity that lasted nearly four years.</li>
            <li>and I looked in almost every department and drug store near me--</li>
            <li>Oh, and like most colognes,  a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Its sparked conversations with randoms whom later became friends that I still cherish today, now I&#x27;m not saying this stuff charmed these people, but if more than a few strangers were honestly curious enough to ask about Gravity, its gotta be doing something right.</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding this at the local stores, however I would have liked to buy the bigger bottle (not offered).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in a pretty blue bottle, and sold everywhere, but now harder to find!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this cologne but hate paying 20$ for it in the store.</li>
            <li> Every time I went in the store and walked down that aisle, I would smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyway, I never found a girl who did not like this smell, and I typically had girls hugging me</li>
            <li> Really disappointed with the size and for such a high price.</li>
            <li> It was a larger bottle, and less expensive.</li>
            <li> My son loves Gravity and it is hard to find</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought my dad this cologne every year for his birthday, for at least 12 years.</li>
            <li> Sick of all the weak &amp;#34;cleaning supply&amp;#34; smelling products sold by high end suppliers.  </li>
            <li> serious review aside,</li>
            <li> I was in search of Gravity Cologne 1.7 oz ,but was unable find a vendor that had this product in stock and for the price advertised.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I sprayed it on and,</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I think I&#x27;ll stick to deodorant.</li>
            <li> you gave me the wrong one</li>
            <li> Very strongly of bad cologne.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely disgusting.</li>

            <li> Have used this product A long time, I like them.</li>
            <li> I was in search of Gravity Cologne 1.7 oz ,but was unable find a vendor that had this product in stock and for the price advertised. I came across this company where I could purchase 2oz for the same price as 1.7oz. I ordered this product due to the fair price and they had the amount I needed in stock. They also gave me an additional discount upon check. My order was received with in 4-7 days.    This company appears to respect there customer&#x27;s and give excellent service.</li>
            <li> didtn expect nothing more, nothing less, its wut i wanted and didnt take forever to get here. so the company is just fine...</li>
            <li> I have been wearing different brands of cologne for many years and I have always made sure I have had this in my cologne collection. A great manly smell that last and not to over powering. I would definitely recommend this if you like good clean, smooth. smell.</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne my husband loves and uses it all the time. I like how it smells on him too. Very well priced and this is the only place I could find it.</li>
            <li> When this came in the mail i was hoping it was going to be a decent fragrance,but it turned out to be in EXCELLENT fragrance. (Nick Carter use to wear this cologne,so im bsb inspired) Thanks and very good job by coty.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne for my husband for Christmas. It is the cologne he used to wear when we were dating in highschool.... it is true that smells can bring back memories! It is perfect, not too strong and lasts a long time. Highly recommend this cologne!</li>
            <li> The scent was good but two of the bottles spray heads were broken. Kinda of a bummer what can you expect for something so cheap I guess?</li>
            <li> Received this mysterious purple bottle as a gift eighteen years ago and I have never bought a bottle of anything else thereafter, its &#x27;light&#x27; and very unintrusive, but extremely memorable. Definitely has what I&#x27;d call a &#x27;sweet but mature&#x27; scent...serious review aside, lol I have &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; countless pillows, t-shirts and even a pair of shades to girls as &#x27;forced gifts&#x27; because of this stuff lingering on them. After eighteen years I still get asked in public (especially in an elevator, lol) what cologne I&#x27;m wearing. Its sparked conversations with randoms whom later became friends that I still cherish today, now I&#x27;m not saying this stuff charmed these people, but if more than a few strangers were honestly curious enough to ask about Gravity, its gotta be doing something right.</li>
            <li> GREAT stuff...I almost always get compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought my dad this cologne every year for his birthday, for at least 12 years. It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find, so I&#x27;ve bought it online the past 2 years. (Wal-mart still has it sometimes.) He loves it. It&#x27;s a nice scent without being over-powering.</li>
            <li> I once had a bottle of Gravity that lasted nearly four years. Not being a constant user of cologne, I thought I&#x27;d re-order something I liked. It is Gravity.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the smell of Gravity . . . it&#x27;s the best men&#x27;s cologne, it&#x27;s not too musky or woodsy.  I can&#x27;t get enough when my husband puts it on!  It&#x27;s in a pretty blue bottle, and sold everywhere, but now harder to find!</li>
            <li> was what I wanted and delivered quick!!</li>
            <li> Gravity has the quality scent that  i was looking for that has a good scent that last without blowing your nose away !</li>
            <li> Just like I remember it smelling. Priced right and delivery prompt with product whole. This is the best of the &amp;#34;cheap colognes &amp;#34; people don&#x27;t know what it is but do notice.</li>
            <li> I wanted to purchase a larger size, but was not available at the time.  Shipped quickly and came in in one piece.</li>
            <li> I remembered this cologne being in stores in the 90s.  Every time I went in the store and walked down that aisle, I would smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t remember the name of it for a long time, I just remembered it was in a blue container.  I finally found it and bought it for my fiance.  I love when he wears it.  The scent is musky, sexy and isn&#x27;t overpowering - I don&#x27;t like cologne that you can smell on someone from a mile away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad someone still sells it!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne but hate paying 20$ for it in the store. Will be getting it this way from now on.</li>
            <li> I get a Gravity gift set every year for my dad for Christmas. I couldn&#x27;t find it in any retailer this year. Was so excited to find this on Amazon. It was a larger bottle, and less expensive. Definitely a better bargain to buy individually here on Amazon than store gift sets...</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift. My sister thought I needed some classier odor-enhancers to get the ladies. Needless to say, I sprayed it on and, well, it smells like cologne all right. Very strongly of bad cologne. Reminded me of a more pungent Axe Body Spray, which isn&#x27;t a compliment. Needless to say, I think I&#x27;ll stick to deodorant.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful! I bought this for my husband YEARS ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any stores where we live. I love it, smells manly but subtle and not too strong.</li>
            <li> My son loves Gravity and it is hard to find and I looked in almost every department and drug store near me--thank you for the availability and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> ...it is the cologne of choice for me, and of course the price was great! As I no longer see it available in the stores, I will be looking online again in the future!</li>
            <li> I thought the product might be a little bit bigger. Really disappointed with the size and for such a high price. Next time im buying it at sears and its a 2pack for $15 that is a better deal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne for about 20 years now, although I wore it a lot more 10 to 20 years ago when I was single. I guess you get a little lazy after you get married; I need to repent I suppose now that I think about it. Anyway, I never found a girl who did not like this smell, and I typically had girls hugging me all the time just to smell it. I like that it&#x27;s an affordable cologne. Oh, and like most colognes,  a little goes a long way. One or two sprays should be good enough!</li>
            <li> this cologne is the bomb.... I love it.... women love it!!!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the cologne I chose.. you gave me the wrong one and I couldn&#x27;t return it because it was liquid..</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as describedðŸ˜„</li>
            <li> I use to wear this fragrance quite often until many stores stopped carrying it. Great price plus I don&#x27;t have to drive around looking for it. Not as popular as other colognes. For those of us who still enjoy it its nice to see someone still sells it.</li>
            <li> I used this way back in the days of High School and forgot about but remember all the girlfriends loving it.  Saw it online and purchased it and now my wife loves it.  I of course love the scent too.  Sick of all the weak &amp;#34;cleaning supply&amp;#34; smelling products sold by high end suppliers.  This one is unique and have received many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely disgusting. The constant smell of it almost made me throw up. I&#x27;m not even kidding. Like another reviewer said, it smells like an overpowering gone-wrong version of an axe body spray.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and very well received, he was very pleased with it</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding this at the local stores, however I would have liked to buy the bigger bottle (not offered).</li>
            <li> I used to wear this when I was in high school.  I thought it would be cool to own again.  The cologne isn&#x27;t as good as I remembered.  It&#x27;s alright, but I think there are better choices now.  Like many things found in ones child hood, it&#x27;s best to leave them as memories.</li>
