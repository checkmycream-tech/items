    <ol>
            <li>the seller was one of the best, excellent communication and he/</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very happy that I did!</li>
            <li>Great product, reduces the visibility of stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use it twice a day!!</li>
            <li>But this stuff is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>All I can say is this product seem to work good for me.</li>
            <li>I have had stretch marks around my stomach and arms for a good 15 years, and they are something that I just kinda lived with.</li>
            <li>And some of the excess cream that runned into my hands had improved the many scars I have in my hands!</li>
            <li>and I had so many, but now they are almost invisible!  </li>
            <li>it is good and it really makes me a very happy person for sure... :)</li>
            <li>i have very light stretch marks on the sides of my hips as well as on my breasts.  </li>
            <li>and I do it mostly for the benefit of people who had struggled with stretchmarks like me.</li>
            <li>in fact I chopped a piece of my finger with a mandoline many years ago...</li>
            <li>But it does a better job of removing discoloration of the skin, which u can see visible results in a week.</li>
            <li>I am on a weight loss journey, and in the process of losing weight my stretch marks have become a bit more noticeable.</li>
            <li>This product makes a great facial cream, I ran out of my normal skin cream so used this and its wonderful under your makeup...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>for the price, the product should be more effective at lightening or removing the marks; however, it does really soften the skin.  </li>
            <li>It rubs in fairly easy, and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or greasy residue.</li>
            <li>far I am pleased with my results, and I am loving the amount of confidence I am already gaining as a result of this Revitagen-FX.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do follow the instructions and when I clean my skin</li>
            <li>They are now even with my normal unscarred skin, instead of huge \\&quot;cracks/dents\\&quot; for lack of better words.  </li>
            <li>she did everything to serve me better, plus fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but this one is actually true.</li>
            <li>, I can NOT believe how much they have improved!!  </li>
            <li>and i will surely get another one when this finish, so i will be able to give my opinion more specific after two-three months later.</li>
            <li>So I gave this cream a try, mostly because of their delivery system, and I was amazed on just two weeks how quickly my old stretch marks improved, those are my oldest scars</li>
            <li>I have many stretchmarks and scars mostly on my belly area, I dropped 85 lbs and between being overweight before and loosing the weight I developed a lot of very long stretch marks, I tried everything, I tried Mederma</li>
            <li>I am so confident in my legs now that I will actually be wearing a swim suit this summer!</li>
            <li>I would say that one tube lasts almost exactly one month.</li>
            <li>I just finished my first month</li>
            <li>this is my first review ever, I just wanted to let you all my skeptic people that you are not alone</li>
            <li>The cream has a nice peppermint smell to it, so I can apply it and put on my clothes without worrying about smelling like other creams I have tried.</li>
            <li>After much research, I bought my first tube of Revitagen about a month ago.</li>
            <li>I knew they were there, but I didn&#x27;t realize how much more confident I feel now that their appearance is becoming less and less.</li>
            <li>but I was very skeptic</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s doing way more than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>considering the marks are so light, i assumed the product would eradicate them (especially since many of the reviews addressed removal of very dark marks); however, i have been using the product (as directed) for 4+ weeks and have observed no visible changes.  </li>
            <li>They are blending in super well and not blood red anymore.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take out my older one</li>
            <li>After one month of use I see that marks are fading slowly but surely!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream.  </li>
            <li>but it help to stop the new one from coming up.</li>
            <li>the scar for that was big and bulgy, almost like if it was filled with liquid underneath, and without really trying with the cream that got into my finger that scar became thinner and smaller and now my finger looks much much normal, to me that was the ultimate proof that this thing really works.</li>
            <li>I talked to a doctor and he told me the only way to get them away was to do an abdominoplastly which means removing the skin of all that area which is a very intense surgery</li>
            <li>Stretch marks look and feel exactly the same.</li>
            <li>For a while there at first they seemed to be getting worse and more pronounced, but I kept using it twice a day as instructed.  </li>
            <li>I still have about 3 more weeks left to use this, I am half way through week number 3 now.</li>
            <li>I use a soft shower brush</li>
            <li>my middle secction stretch marks were very noticeable.</li>
            <li>&quot; that never really improved, but this cream definitively is worth it.</li>
            <li>so they keep improving every day, the new stretchmarks that I had in my arms which were redish became thin and almost unnoticeable very quickly.</li>
            <li>It may be because my stretch marks are several years old (received during puberty), but the cream had no effect on the target areas.</li>
            <li>My sister in law kept bugging me about trying a cream since I complained about them all the time, so I got 4 tubes of this-they had a special on their website.  </li>
            <li>I was VERY skeptical but this had some really good reviews, so I went ahead and bought it...  </li>
            <li>I started getting stretch marks in high school due to growth spurts.</li>

            <li> I was super skeptical about it, especially after my other sis in law said she thought creams are hypes.  </li>
            <li> I have a few newer stretch marks and a few older ones</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 months now as directed twice a day with absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> My wife has been applying this cream for her child birth stretch mark from last three months, and absolutely no result...don&#x27;t waste your money.. will try something else...</li>
            <li> It is on the medium to thick range as far as texture and density.</li>
            <li> and I was not willing to do that.</li>
            <li> but now they are the same and are surly not better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s what prompted the red burning bumps everywhere but</li>
            <li> Now they are more flesh colored, and this helps reduce their visibility like crazy!</li>
            <li> Only down side is that it&#x27;s a little smelly!</li>
            <li> My old white/silvery stretch marks seem to be slowly disappearing!</li>
            <li> It has a slight, very minimal scent.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> I have noticed an EXTREME difference in the appearance of my stretch marks!</li>
            <li> I have stretch marks all over my body due to pregnancy!</li>
            <li> To me ever so slightly minty scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was at first very skeptical about ordering This product due to the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a difficult time trying to get rid of my stretch marks on my thighs, back of my thighs, hips and some small marks on the back of my calves.</li>
            <li> Also, my newer marks that were pinkish purple are now white and are also slowly disappearing!</li>
            <li> I started using cocoa butter everyday, but it didn&#x27;t seem to do a thing.</li>
            <li> I have been using it twice a day, everyday.</li>
            <li> Actually there for about a week I started to think the stretch marks were getting worse</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Revitagen-FX as directed for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> With my first and second pregnancies I got horrible stretch marks all over my belly and sides.  </li>
            <li> Wasted $70 on it, but at least I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I am quite anxious to see what my results are like at the end of the 6 week</li>
            <li> Seriously amazed.  </li>
            <li> either way, I had to send it back and deal with a painful rash (that will hopefully go away soon).</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t worked for me, I tried doing laser treatments who were extremely expensive and they didn&#x27;t worked either.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think ANYTHING would work after my disappointment with Strivectin.</li>
            <li> disappointed and would not recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> This gave me an awful rash all over my body.</li>
            <li> I know this product contains Parabins which are awful for you.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> the seller was one of the best, excellent communication and he/she did everything to serve me better, plus fast shipping. the second ti me i order the item came to me in two business days. as concerning revitagen fx, i&#x27;ve been use this for some weeks, haven&#x27;t see any results yet, but i will continue use this and i will surely get another one when this finish, so i will be able to give my opinion more specific after two-three months later.</li>
            <li> This product makes a great facial cream, I ran out of my normal skin cream so used this and its wonderful under your makeup...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t review anything ever, in fact I am not very prone to providing feedback in general, but I believe this product deserve it and I do it mostly for the benefit of people who had struggled with stretchmarks like me. I have many stretchmarks and scars mostly on my belly area, I dropped 85 lbs and between being overweight before and loosing the weight I developed a lot of very long stretch marks, I tried everything, I tried Mederma and it didn&#x27;t worked for me, I tried doing laser treatments who were extremely expensive and they didn&#x27;t worked either. I talked to a doctor and he told me the only way to get them away was to do an abdominoplastly which means removing the skin of all that area which is a very intense surgery and I was not willing to do that. So I gave this cream a try, mostly because of their delivery system, and I was amazed on just two weeks how quickly my old stretch marks improved, those are my oldest scars so they keep improving every day, the new stretchmarks that I had in my arms which were redish became thin and almost unnoticeable very quickly.

I wasted so much money in other remedies and \\&quot;medicines\\&quot; that never really improved, but this cream definitively is worth it. I do follow the instructions and when I clean my skin I use a soft shower brush and I apply the cream at night and in the morning.</li>
            <li> My wife has been applying this cream for her child birth stretch mark from last three months, and absolutely no result...don&#x27;t waste your money.. will try something else...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review for anything before--ever!  But this stuff is AMAZING!  I was VERY skeptical but this had some really good reviews, so I went ahead and bought it...  I had my baby 9 weeks ago, and as I test I have used this only on my stomach, not my sides, thighs, or breasts...  My stretch marks on my stomach were very deep and I had so many, but now they are almost invisible!  Seriously amazed.  Now I have to use it on the rest of the stretch marks to catch up!  I don&#x27;t know if this helps or not, but I use a sugar scrub in the shower twice a week and put it on after that.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical about this product. Especially at a $50 price tag. I&#x27;ve had a difficult time trying to get rid of my stretch marks on my thighs, back of my thighs, hips and some small marks on the back of my calves. I started getting stretch marks in high school due to growth spurts. I started using cocoa butter everyday, but it didn&#x27;t seem to do a thing. After much research, I bought my first tube of Revitagen about a month ago. I have been using it twice a day, everyday. I have noticed an EXTREME difference in the appearance of my stretch marks! My old white/silvery stretch marks seem to be slowly disappearing! Also, my newer marks that were pinkish purple are now white and are also slowly disappearing! I am so confident in my legs now that I will actually be wearing a swim suit this summer! I haven&#x27;t worn a swim suit in front of anyone in over 3 years because of my stretch marks. Its miraculous! The cream has a nice peppermint smell to it, so I can apply it and put on my clothes without worrying about smelling like other creams I have tried. I am telling all my friends about this product! I didn&#x27;t think ANYTHING would work after my disappointment with Strivectin. But this product has changed my mind and I just ordered my second tube. Please give it a try.</li>
            <li> after reading the reviews for this product, i was definitely hopeful.  i have very light stretch marks on the sides of my hips as well as on my breasts.  considering the marks are so light, i assumed the product would eradicate them (especially since many of the reviews addressed removal of very dark marks); however, i have been using the product (as directed) for 4+ weeks and have observed no visible changes.  for the price, the product should be more effective at lightening or removing the marks; however, it does really soften the skin.  disappointed and would not recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> After several of months of daily usage there has been zero results from this product. I have a few newer stretch marks and a few older ones and it did not do anything for either of them. It might just be my skin type but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. Another product bites the dust for me!</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month,  haven&#x27;t noticed any changes,  except the skin feels smoother to the touch. Stretch marks look and feel exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream.  I had tried several creams and noticed no difference.  Within weeks of using this cream twice a day, I noticed my stretch marks fading!!!! It also helped my skin gain elasticity back!</li>
            <li> Great product, reduces the visibility of stretch marks. But it does a better job of removing discoloration of the skin, which u can see visible results in a week.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 months now as directed twice a day with absolutely no results. Actually there for about a week I started to think the stretch marks were getting worse but now they are the same and are surly not better. Not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> With my first and second pregnancies I got horrible stretch marks all over my belly and sides.  I also have them on my legs.  I couldn&#x27;t stand them!!  My sister in law kept bugging me about trying a cream since I complained about them all the time, so I got 4 tubes of this-they had a special on their website.  I was super skeptical about it, especially after my other sis in law said she thought creams are hypes.  I have been using it for almost one month, I can NOT believe how much they have improved!!  They are now even with my normal unscarred skin, instead of huge \\&quot;cracks/dents\\&quot; for lack of better words.  They are blending in super well and not blood red anymore.  I&#x27;m really impressed.  For a while there at first they seemed to be getting worse and more pronounced, but I kept using it twice a day as instructed.  I&#x27;m going to keep on keeping on!  I am hopeful that they will continue to improve!  I&#x27;m on my second tube already.  I would say that one tube lasts almost exactly one month.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff ...a lot... it is good and it really makes me a very happy person for sure... :)</li>
            <li> This gave me an awful rash all over my body. I know this product contains Parabins which are awful for you. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s what prompted the red burning bumps everywhere but either way, I had to send it back and deal with a painful rash (that will hopefully go away soon).</li>
            <li> I bought it but I was very skeptic, ive lost a lot of weight and my middle secction stretch marks were very noticeable. I just finished my first month and I am about to place my second order. It works!! who actually thought it would. this is my first review ever, I just wanted to let you all my skeptic people that you are not alone but this one is actually true. This thing works!</li>
            <li> Not one stretch mark! Only down side is that it&#x27;s a little smelly! But it didn&#x27;t bother me. Just my husband. Make sure to use it twice a day!!</li>
            <li> It may be because my stretch marks are several years old (received during puberty), but the cream had no effect on the target areas. The cream itself could work as a moisturizer, but that&#x27;s it. Does nothing to reduce the appearance of stretch marks, or even scars, even after a month of application. I applied the cream to some scars that are discolored (not white yet), and it did nothing to heal or reduce its appearance. Wasted $70 on it, but at least I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I was at first very skeptical about ordering This product due to the price but I&#x27;m very happy that I did! I have stretch marks all over my body due to pregnancy! After one month of use I see that marks are fading slowly but surely! It&#x27;s doing way more than any other product I&#x27;ve used. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> All I can say is this product seem to work good for me. It didn&#x27;t take out my older one but it help to stop the new one from coming up.</li>
            <li> I am on a weight loss journey, and in the process of losing weight my stretch marks have become a bit more noticeable. While improving, they still had a darker pigmentation to them, and were quite visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Revitagen-FX as directed for a few weeks now. I have noticed that the color of my stretch marks has changed quite a bit. Before they were reddish, purple hue. Now they are more flesh colored, and this helps reduce their visibility like crazy! I have had stretch marks around my stomach and arms for a good 15 years, and they are something that I just kinda lived with. I knew they were there, but I didn&#x27;t realize how much more confident I feel now that their appearance is becoming less and less. I still have about 3 more weeks left to use this, I am half way through week number 3 now. I am quite anxious to see what my results are like at the end of the 6 week period!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is tan in color. As you rub it in, it turns white. It is on the medium to thick range as far as texture and density. It rubs in fairly easy, and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or greasy residue. It has a slight, very minimal scent. To me ever so slightly minty scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am pleased with my results, and I am loving the amount of confidence I am already gaining as a result of this Revitagen-FX.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
