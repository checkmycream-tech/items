            <li>Have used it for years, it works better than anything I have used.  </li>
            <li>it works better than rembrandt</li>
            <li>I just read most of the reviews saying they don&#x27;t sell it at walmart...</li>
            <li>I have been using this toothpaste and gel for many years now.</li>
            <li>Also the deal for six boxes was fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love it keep my teeth and keep the stain away ....</li>
            <li>okay ..</li>
            <li>It is more manageable than using the strips since I have to brush anyway.</li>
            <li>My favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste ...</li>
            <li>that over time some have experienced sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>very good as expected</li>
            <li>My elderly parents&#x27; dentist recommended Plus White Xtra whitening toothpaste, and it keeps their teeth in great condition.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to brush one&#x27;s teeth for a few minutes rather than 30 seconds of fly-by.  </li>
            <li>I can smile about that!</li>
            <li>Love this product and fast shipping</li>
            <li>around the second week though, I could also tell that my teeth were becoming more sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this toothpaste because it does whiten teeth.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to my friends but caution that you follow the instructions as it says and not to expect a million dollar smile from a $6 bottle of tooth paste.</li>
            <li>I believe it keeps my teeth nice and white.</li>
            <li>This seems to do a nice job of whitening teeth if used on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>which is nice, in a strange sort of way.</li>
            <li>I wasnt hoping or expecting to have a brilliant white smile that looks like I spent thousands in a dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>Plus White keeps my smile bright white, without having to visit the dentist for whitening.</li>
            <li>When I got home tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li>I will make this review short and sweet!   </li>
            <li>Regular flossing is STRONGLY recommended.</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t like Crest.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a visit to the dentist yesterday and really looking at my stained grayish teeth (I am 62), decided to do something.</li>
            <li>but I do enjoy espresso and red wines.</li>
            <li>They were pretty new, I had just noticed them.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>This toothpaste has EXACTLY the same and EXACTLY</li>
            <li>If that does happen, I will simply cut back on the use, but surely will not quit using.</li>
            <li>I seen a color difference in my teeth the first two weeks of not using Plus White.</li>
            <li>I am a tea drinker and smoke sometimes, but this keeps my teeth pretty white.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I could actually see a difference the first time.</li>
            <li>Plus White toothpaste works very well without having to use additional products like whitening strips.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to peroxide based teeth whitener kits and can&#x27;t use them.  </li>
            <li>I use it after every meal and like what I see so far.</li>
            <li>Made my teeth sensitive.  </li>
            <li>The tooth paste doesnt have a great or bad taste it is tooth paste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my sixties, and teeth gray as you age, but apparently using this toothpaste has beat the problem.  </li>
            <li>I have given this a try as a replacement of the white strips and so far it is working.  </li>
            <li>This is the only whitening toothpaste that had ever worked on my old coffee, red wine, and pipe smoking stained teeth.</li>

            <li> One of the few toothpastes without a taste of mint that is too sharp and biting.</li>
            <li> well I bought some from walmart a few days ago for less than $4...</li>
            <li> I see my teeth a little whiter.  </li>
            <li> Discovered this toothpaste quite a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> In the past I bought this at the usual stores</li>
            <li> I had horrible brown stains on my front two top teeth.</li>
            <li> Recommend this, although it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t seen it anywhere lately.  </li>
            <li> Just brush as usual , once in morning and once at night!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the products like the instructions recommend and have seen a dramatic improvement.</li>
            <li> I hated it.</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Plus White toothpaste works very well without having to use additional products like whitening strips.  I see a noticeable difference with routine use .  Although, I don&#x27;t know how well it would work for any type of difficult staining, you&#x27;ll notice an improvement for mild discolorations due to coffee drinking, etc.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Walmart stopped carrying it, so I had to start ordering if from Amazon. As soon as I started using it again people noticed.......can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for at least 16 years because it keeps my teeth very white. Being a coffee and tea drinker...not to mention some red wine as well...Plus White keeps my smile bright white, without having to visit the dentist for whitening. Strangers always complement me on how white my teeth are...which is nice, in a strange sort of way. Moreover, it&#x27;s something I buy all the time and availing of Amazon, and their subscription service, saves me almost $2.00/tube over store prices. I can smile about that!</li>
            <li> I did not like this product!  It&#x27;s says it whiten your teeth, good luck!&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A really good toothpaste we think it is very good cleans teeth really well.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste, and have been using it for years.  My dentist recently had to match my tooth color for a crown, and told me that my shade was whiter than her entire range of sample shades.  I&#x27;m in my sixties, and teeth gray as you age, but apparently using this toothpaste has beat the problem.  I&#x27;m sensitive to peroxide based teeth whitener kits and can&#x27;t use them.  This toothpaste is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite whitening toothpaste (I&#x27;ve tried so many)&amp; what a great deal this was!</li>
            <li> My elderly parents&#x27; dentist recommended Plus White Xtra whitening toothpaste, and it keeps their teeth in great condition.  We have trouble finding it locally.  It&#x27;s great to be able to stock up at a good price.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste. I have been using it now for about three years. They don&#x27;t sell it at Wal-Mart anymore so I order it off of Amazon cheaper than if I did buy it at Wal-Mart. I left the country for 6 months and had to switch brands of toothpaste. I hated it. I seen a color difference in my teeth the first two weeks of not using Plus White. I&#x27;m a coffee drinker and a smoker. I get lots of compliments on my teeth all the time on how white they are. I hope this review helps. I will never switch brands. Ever..</li>
            <li> Does good job of whitening.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years, I stopped after wal-xxxx stopped selling it, and tried Crest.&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t like Crest.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I found this on Amazon, I set it up for the subscription package.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years, it works better than anything I have used.  I am a coffee drinker but you would not know it!</li>
            <li> This is the only whitening toothpaste that had ever worked on my old coffee, red wine, and pipe smoking stained teeth.</li>
            <li> it works better than rembrandt</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this wonderful toothpaste in the stores anymore, and was so happy to be able to continue a sensititive toothpaste that is pleasant and effective.  It decreases the discoloration which comes with aging.  It is a very effective plaque preventer when used with an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product and the 5 minute speed whitening system in hopes of removing years of built up coffee stains on my teeth. I wasnt hoping or expecting to have a brilliant white smile that looks like I spent thousands in a dentist&#x27;s office. I have been using the products like the instructions recommend and have seen a dramatic improvement. The tooth paste doesnt have a great or bad taste it is tooth paste. I use it after every meal and like what I see so far. I would recommend this product to my friends but caution that you follow the instructions as it says and not to expect a million dollar smile from a $6 bottle of tooth paste.</li>
            <li> Terrible! I don&#x27;t see any difference. These people must be paid to leave good feedbacks on the products.  B c</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste ever.</li>
            <li> One of the few toothpastes without a taste of mint that is too sharp and biting. In the past I bought this at the usual stores but I haven&#x27;t seen it anywhere lately.  Hence I&#x27;m now ordering TOOTHPASTE from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Discovered this toothpaste quite a few years ago.  Best I have ever used.  Recommend this, although it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.  No problem finding it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I will make this review short and sweet!   This toothpaste has EXACTLY the same and EXACTLY THE SAME AMOUNT of active whitening ingredient as Rembrandt toothpaste at only a fraction of the cost.   Great tootpaste.       Paul  Texas</li>
            <li> Love it! The best whitening toothpaste that cleans so good, whitens, and yet is gentle on gums!</li>
            <li> Does a great job cleaning coffee stains.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. I believe it keeps my teeth nice and white. My dad is a smoker and this is the only toothpaste he uses. I think it keeps his teeth white too. I recommend this product. And buying it in bulk is cheaper.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT AND LIGHTNING QUICK ON DELIVERY!  BUY WITH CONFIDENCE!</li>
            <li> I just read most of the reviews saying they don&#x27;t sell it at walmart...well I bought some from walmart a few days ago for less than $4...I guess it just depends where your from?</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste and gel for many years now. I came looking for it on Amazon, because it&#x27;s so hard to find it in the local pharmacies here. I am a tea drinker and smoke sometimes, but this keeps my teeth pretty white. Also the deal for six boxes was fantastic! I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great product .. Recommend for anyone that want a whiter smile!! Just brush as usual , once in morning and once at night!!</li>
            <li> It works really good!!!! It can whiten your tooth, my dad is also using it. It works really good</li>
            <li> I love it keep my teeth and keep the stain away ....</li>
            <li> Made my teeth sensitive.  The product whitened okay .. Discontinued in one week&#x27;s time.  I would not re purchase ... I already have 5 tubes I won&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> Very good product, very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This product works great at whitening my teeth! Within about a week I could definitely notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By around the second week though, I could also tell that my teeth were becoming more sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this toothpaste because it does whiten teeth. I cut back to using it about 3 times per week which helps with the sensitivity issue.</li>
            <li> I have given this a try as a replacement of the white strips and so far it is working.  I see my teeth a little whiter.  It is more manageable than using the strips since I have to brush anyway.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste. Definitely keeps my teeth whiter than any other brand.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find locally.  Love this product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I had horrible brown stains on my front two top teeth. They were pretty new, I had just noticed them. Probably coffee. I only used this once and they were gone!!! Truly amazing!</li>
            <li> This seems to do a nice job of whitening teeth if used on a regular basis.  It&#x27;s best to brush one&#x27;s teeth for a few minutes rather than 30 seconds of fly-by.  Regular flossing is STRONGLY recommended.</li>
            <li> After a visit to the dentist yesterday and really looking at my stained grayish teeth (I am 62), decided to do something. While at Winco decided to pick up a tube of Plus White. When I got home tried it for the first time. WOW! I could actually see a difference the first time. It will be something I use every day and can&#x27;t wait to see in time my results. Have read reviews that over time some have experienced sensitive teeth. If that does happen, I will simply cut back on the use, but surely will not quit using.</li>
            <li> very good as expected</li>
            <li> Great whitening toothpaste. I don&#x27;t smoke but I do enjoy espresso and red wines. My hygienist didn&#x27;t mention any staining this time around!</li>
            <li> I noticed my teeth are whiter. It does the job really good and my mouth fee4ls cleaner. I even gave a tube to a friend and he likes it too.</li>
            <li> Works well in controlling coffee and wine stains and has a pleasant taste. The best I&#x27;ve found since Topol became unavailable.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste ... It arrived in great time !</li>
