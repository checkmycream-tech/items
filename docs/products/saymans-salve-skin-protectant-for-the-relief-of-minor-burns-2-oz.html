            <li> Perfect item for dry chapped cheeks, elbows and knees. I use on my baby&#x27;s dry cheeks and it works great on diaper rash too! Not oily &amp; absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Sayman&#x27;s Salve is a very old-time remedy my aunt got me started using in 1969 when my daughter had a very serious diaper rash.  It cleared up the rash and takes the redness out of any burn instantly.  It is kind of greasy, but worth the trouble since it works so well.  My daughter used it on her daughter for a diaper cream and also my daughter-in-law used it on her girls as well.  I have found over the years it is no longer on the store shelf, but thanks to Amazon, I can still order it.  Thanks Amazon for making such a great product available.</li>
            <li> This is NOT the same formula as you are use to.  It is not even manufactured by Lee Pharmaceuticals.  The name has been bought out and who knows what changes the manufacturer made to the formula.  Buy at own risk!!!</li>
            <li> When reviewing this purchase I thought I ordered the two pack of this item as shown to me. But I only received one. I ordered this for my mother as a gift. She has used this product for some time now and she enjoys it.</li>
            <li> We still have a bottle of Sayman Salve from 1975-my husband still uses it. Great stuff-I&#x27;m going to buy some more, since that&#x27;s getting a bit old! But it still works!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mother...she loves Sayman Salve.</li>
            <li> Awesome product have used for years</li>
            <li> This item was purchased in 2011 but when we received the item it had expired in 2009. It was right on the box. Bought 3 and they all said the same. This should atleast be stated in description. Be careful when you purchase an item that would have a date and ask.</li>
            <li> Fully met expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Carpenter work outside all year round. The Winters are hard on my hands, they get very dry and crack. This is the only thing I have found that will heal the open cracks on my hands. I put it my hands and wear gloves when I go to bed and most cracks will close up over night.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased that my purchase arrived so quickly.  I had looked for Saymon&#x27;s Salve in all the local drug stores to no avail and was happy to find it online.  This salve has been around for at least 70 years that I know of and works well for many skin conditions.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much but I&#x27;m sure it will be good--it is&lt;br /&gt;basically zinc oxide ointment ( which I could have&lt;br /&gt;bought OTC).</li>
            <li> My family has used this for years and love it.  I have tried other products, but none work as well as Saymans does.  Will continue to buy it as long as they sell it.</li>
            <li> Saymans salve helps the skin with burns, cuts, rash, etc. --it&#x27;s great  for most skin woes and groans--try it today!!</li>
            <li> Was looking for LEE pharmaceuticals and got some other places stuff.</li>
            <li> it works wonderfully i use it on flea and mosquito bites and it stops the itching and brings infection to a head</li>
            <li> I have used this product since I was a little girl. My Gramma  use to put  it on everything, cuts, burns, and rashes. It is longer sold in our area. Now everyone in my family wants me to get a jar for them. My son has a 3 year old and has ttaken my jar to use on his daughters rash. We love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Best stuff on earth&lt;br /&gt;been using since little girl</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend while on vacation.  My son and I had a sunburn and my friend shared Sayman Salve.  The burn was relieved instantly and we both felt better in just a few hours.  The sting and pain of the burn was relieved.  After ordering my own, I&#x27;ve since used it for poison ivy, minor cuts and mosquito bites.  Everytime, the sting and itch was relieved and helped to heal faster.  I now swear by this and use it almost daily!</li>
            <li> A lot of times I have very dry hands and fingertips from washing my hands so much at work.  Sayman Salve was a remedy my father used, and now I have found it again and it does work miracles, just as he proclaimed many years.  My fingertips were beginning to look like my feet!  Not now.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. I like to use it to draw out soreness from splinters etc</li>
            <li> Best salve for skin issues ever! My grandfather, an early 20th century, independent barber, used and recommended it always. Our family uses it to this day. And it heals!</li>
            <li> I hope they never stop making this product because it is a real find. We have been using it for years and have recommended it to many friends and family. They all love it because of the great results when other products fail. It is amazing how that over night there is such improvement on healing scratches, skin problems and wounds. You would be lucky get it if you have not tried it yet. My family cannot be without it!</li>
            <li> Been using it for years,  good healing ointment for bruises and sores</li>
            <li> I have been using it since I was a kid and my dad, a physician swore by it.  Excellent basic first aid cream!</li>
            <li> This is a miracle salve.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it since I was  kid in the 50&#x27;s. It works just as well today. Thank you for locating it. Your price was about $10 less than Walgreens special order service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;s not the same as the original.&lt;br /&gt;The origanalmcolor was yellow, and smelled stronger. Something is left out.&lt;br /&gt;Not as efective.</li>
            <li> Have used Saymans salve for many many years.  It&#x27;s a must in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 85 years old and my folks used Saymans salve. I have never found anything that works better.</li>
