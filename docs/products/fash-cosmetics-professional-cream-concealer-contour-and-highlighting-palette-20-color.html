            <li>It was a good deal for what I paid.  </li>
            <li>I thought this may not have been good quality since it was under $30</li>
            <li>Good selection of colours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product and great for the price but for me, there are too many colors that don&#x27;t even match my skin tone</li>

            <li>I love this concealer set!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m loving this palette, the color variety works well for me</li>
            <li>make up stays perfect even when its wet all the colors blend in beautifully</li>
            <li>The concealers are super pigmented, they stay in place and provide great coverage.</li>
            <li>I found another product called dermablend that is amazing and works a lot better.</li>
            <li>Very Nice Case and Make up is smooth and really easy to blend.</li>
            <li>This is just okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I really love this palette.</li>
            <li>Much better alternative for the most pricey brands charging $40+ for their cream contour kit.</li>
            <li>All in all satisfied.</li>
            <li>These worked ok.</li>
            <li>I got the one with 15 colors before and that one had more colors that I could use.</li>
            <li>It is much better than the stuff you would find in the makeup section of the store.</li>
            <li>I would love to buy again</li>
            <li>I tried the flash palate for the first time to do contouring makeup and loved it.</li>
            <li>The quality of the concealers are pretty good</li>
            <li>For the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything fabulous, but I do wish the concealer was more pigmented.</li>
            <li>Thanks, good product, I lived it</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; concealers are exceptional, I tried the green to cover some redness and it works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve no major complaints - good product!</li>
            <li>Delivered accordingly, helps conceal blemishes doesn&#x27;t give such a &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; look.&lt;br /&gt;Liked the variety of concealer colors able to mix them to get my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;Overall very pleased with the product</li>
            <li>The Concealer is not hard at all, it&#x27;s very easy to apply, some of the colors were a little smudgy but everything else works perfectly!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t belive the price I paid for such an amazing palette!</li>
            <li>so i was happy about that since my under-eye area is rather dry.</li>
            <li>the end its not bad</li>
            <li>I found the sponge applicators useless but i have concealer brushes that fit perfectly in the groove where these come, i give it 4 stars</li>
            <li>Wow, I&#x27;m so glad that I decided to order this concealer palette.</li>
            <li>I thought that this was a very nice product but the browns included in the kit dont really work with medium to dark skin tones.</li>
            <li>Exactly what you see in the pictures.</li>
            <li>First off let me say that use this palette every day.</li>
            <li>I tried the pinkish/salmon for my under eye bag and dark circles and it also works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>and seems to have a pretty decent range of color.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product especially for the price!</li>
            <li>It seems that for the most part all the colors are pink undertones.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and blends really well.  </li>
            <li>The dark chocolate is perfect to contour (I use it on my nose), and the white can be used by itself or with the other colors to highlight or lighten up any part of the face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Decent quality of cover up</li>
            <li>Decent coverage..</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to experiment with the different shades.</li>
            <li>Very creamy, enlarging  pores, pigment is very low.</li>
            <li>I have excema on my Face this time of year and so far I can see it is not messing up my skin anymore than whats already done.</li>
            <li>however i see how it would not be as useful for medium to darker skin tones, the consistency of the product is creamier than other palettes i&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>SO confused as to how anyone enjoyed this product.</li>

            <li> SO confused as to how anyone enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> So if you are yellow (myself) or olive undertoned your going to end up mixing quite a few colors together to find your tone.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Only thing I hate is that the colours all seem to have pink undertones and if you&#x27;re a bit of a yellow base you might have some issues using it to cover large areas but great for contouring and covering up small blemishes and under eyes.</li>
            <li> so I could&#x27;ve just got the one with less colors.  </li>
            <li> texture is creamy but not tacky or heavy, it doesn&#x27;t leave a cakey look at all.</li>
            <li> The consistency is exactly like spreading gum on the face: heavy, impossible to spread evenly, drying, and cakey.</li>
            <li> Works just as well if not better!</li>
            <li> The brushes it comes with are terrible for application, so I used a different applicator instead.</li>
            <li> But I was wrong, this palette is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> You would never even know that this isn&#x27;t an expensive product.</li>
            <li> Hated it and am returning.</li>

            <li> i&#x27;m loving this palette, the color variety works well for me but i&#x27;m light/medium and use pink/salmon/peach undertones to correct and conceal however i see how it would not be as useful for medium to darker skin tones, the consistency of the product is creamier than other palettes i&#x27;ve tried so i was happy about that since my under-eye area is rather dry. I found the sponge applicators useless but i have concealer brushes that fit perfectly in the groove where these come, i give it 4 stars cause i wish it had a mirror</li>
            <li> Is amazing!! Covers everything anywhere!!! I&#x27;m in Florida so I&#x27;m always in the pool make up stays perfect even when its wet all the colors blend in beautifully</li>

            <li> I have melasma on my face and was looking for something to cover the hyper pigmentation. These worked ok. I found another product called dermablend that is amazing and works a lot better. This is cheaper, it just didn&#x27;t cover as well as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> Very Nice Case and Make up is smooth and really easy to blend. I have excema on my Face this time of year and so far I can see it is not messing up my skin anymore than whats already done. I wish they made a powder pallette as well to go along with it. Awesome find for the price I will be ordering again!</li>

            <li> SO confused as to how anyone enjoyed this product. The consistency is exactly like spreading gum on the face: heavy, impossible to spread evenly, drying, and cakey. They all melt off the face in about one hour. Hated it and am returning.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer set! It is perfect to contour with</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and great for the price but for me, there are too many colors that don&#x27;t even match my skin tone so I could&#x27;ve just got the one with less colors.  I got the one with 15 colors before and that one had more colors that I could use.</li>
            <li> You would never even know that this isn&#x27;t an expensive product. I use it to do my concealing as well as my highlighting and contouring. I will be coming back to this product from now on.</li>
            <li> First off let me say that use this palette every day. The quality of the concealers are pretty good and I have no complaints there. The only issues that I have with the palette is the color variety. It seems that for the most part all the colors are pink undertones. So if you are yellow (myself) or olive undertoned your going to end up mixing quite a few colors together to find your tone.&lt;br /&gt;In the end its not bad</li>

            <li> This palate is a lot bigger than I thought it would be. Good selection of colours. Only thing I hate is that the colours all seem to have pink undertones and if you&#x27;re a bit of a yellow base you might have some issues using it to cover large areas but great for contouring and covering up small blemishes and under eyes.</li>
            <li> The Concealer is not hard at all, it&#x27;s very easy to apply, some of the colors were a little smudgy but everything else works perfectly! Plenty of colors for highlighting and shading, or to find the perfect match!</li>
