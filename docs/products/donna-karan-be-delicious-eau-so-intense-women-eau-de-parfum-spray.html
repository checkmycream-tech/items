            <li>I just received my purchase today, and I must say the Donna Karen Be Delicious</li>

            <li>This perfume is one of the best that I ever owned!</li>
            <li>and I receive great compliments ALL THE TIME!!</li>
            <li>And one of the best things also is THE PRICE!!</li>
            <li>very good product recommend</li>
            <li>my girls are always saying mom you smell so good!  </li>
            <li>Loved it!  </li>
            <li>This made a great Christmas gift for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>Great bargain.</li>
            <li>Still has an amazing smell!</li>
            <li>Be Delicious scents &amp; like all of them, but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to have a delicious smell all day though.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells really good.</li>
            <li>Good deal.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful bottle, smells nice and but not so intense like &#x27;Donna Karen Be Delicious Eau De Parfum&#x27;.</li>
            <li>This is authentic perfume and a great buy.</li>
            <li>I Will purchase it again, love it!</li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments on it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>so cute &amp; so customer service oriented!</li>
            <li>It was very nicely packaged &amp; factory sealed so the perfume is NOT a fake!!</li>
            <li>I love my DKNY Be Delicious &amp; had a sample version of the So Intense &amp; had to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My fave...period! :-)</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>What can I say I love it</li>
            <li>I was not so sure to buy a perfume</li>
            <li>10-15 min in, it softened &amp; I was in love &amp; looked like a coke head sniffing my wrist like there was no tomorrow.</li>
            <li>Smells delicious, but not for too long.</li>
            <li>Fair price and exactly what my Wife wanted.</li>
            <li>Good deal and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and stays all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and strong at first, but, like Princess Diana (according to Elton John), this scent&#x27;s flame burns brightly at first and then just dies.</li>
            <li>Factory sealed, original packaging</li>
            <li>In amazon the price is right!</li>
            <li>The smell is way too strong for me, and makes me really dizzy.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I will be back to order some more &amp; not buying from anyone except this company!</li>
            <li>Good for old and young alike.</li>
            <li>A definite recommendation for anyone who likes light, fresh but strong fragrances.</li>
            <li>So Intense definitely has more staying power than the original.</li>
            <li>Intense is the same scent as Be Delicious except when you 1st apply it, its slightly stronger.</li>
            <li>It last for so many hours</li>
            <li>She loves it with a sweet smell that&#x27;s not too overwhelming like some of her other perfumes.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>Smells great, I got this intense version because I thought it would be much different from the regular one, but I personally have not noticed a difference-</li>
            <li>This is the real deal....</li>
            <li>I live in a really warm city, maybe it works better in the cold.</li>
            <li>In a few hours nobody can notice you&#x27;re using more than soap.</li>
            <li>This is such a fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed, the original strength Be Delicious is way stronger than this Eau so intense.</li>
            <li>This is the second perfume I ordered directly from Amazon, and it is right on the money.</li>
            <li>Ill never order this again and just stick with the original!!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nowhere near as strong as we had expected!!!</li>
            <li>NOT imitation!</li>
            <li>I had bad experiences before but this one is 100% authentic!!</li>

            <li> Even a nicer surprise to see that they included samples of other perfumes, a facial cream &amp; a small nail clipper...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for a few years.  </li>
            <li> In stores is $80 plus taxes way too expensive!</li>

            <li> This is such a fresh fragrance. Good for old and young alike.</li>
            <li> This made a great Christmas gift for my daughter.  She loves it and it didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg like in the department stores!</li>
            <li> This is authentic perfume and a great buy.You will not be disappointed. I Will purchase it again, love it! Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Fair price and exactly what my Wife wanted.</li>

            <li> My fave...period! :-)</li>
            <li> Amazon does it again! I just received my purchase today, and I must say the Donna Karen Be Delicious So Intense definitely has more staying power than the original. This is the second perfume I ordered directly from Amazon, and it is right on the money. It arrived in 2 days! I always visit the department store and get a sample to compare it to the one that I order online-and so far Amazon has not let me down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for a few years.  Actually wear a few diff of the DK Be Delicious scents &amp; like all of them, but this is my favorite.  Good deal.  Found it to be about $20+ cheaper then buying it in the store that I found had it the cheapest.</li>
            <li> I can&#x60;t stand the smell of this perfume....</li>
            <li> Smells great, I got this intense version because I thought it would be much different from the regular one, but I personally have not noticed a difference- neither in the intensity nor it lasting longer.</li>
            <li> Good deal and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Beautiful bottle, smells nice and but not so intense like &#x27;Donna Karen Be Delicious Eau De Parfum&#x27;. Be sure to have a delicious smell all day though.</li>
            <li> The smell is way too strong for me, and makes me really dizzy.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to finish it, but that will probably be another three years....&lt;br /&gt;:/</li>
            <li> very good product recommend</li>
            <li> She loves it with a sweet smell that&#x27;s not too overwhelming like some of her other perfumes.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It&#x27;s nice and strong at first, but, like Princess Diana (according to Elton John), this scent&#x27;s flame burns brightly at first and then just dies. Or something like that.</li>
            <li> Shipping was speedy and the perfume was just as advertised. The smell is light and stays all day. A definite recommendation for anyone who likes light, fresh but strong fragrances.</li>
            <li> This is so very DELICIOUS!!!  What can I say I love it and so does everyone I run into...my girls are always saying mom you smell so good!  I love it!</li>
            <li> This perfume is one of the best that I ever owned! I was not so sure to buy a perfume online cause I had bad experiences before but this one is 100% authentic!! Factory sealed, original packaging and it smells DIVINE!!!! It last for so many hours and I receive great compliments ALL THE TIME!! Definitely I would buy it here again! And one of the best things also is THE PRICE!! In stores is $80 plus taxes way too expensive! In amazon the price is right!</li>
            <li> I love my DKNY Be Delicious &amp; had a sample version of the So Intense &amp; had to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Intense is the same scent as Be Delicious except when you 1st apply it, its slightly stronger. 10-15 min in, it softened &amp; I was in love &amp; looked like a coke head sniffing my wrist like there was no tomorrow. Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why did I take off a star? After an hour, the scent was no longer there. Its not that I got used to it because to test it out, I only applied a dash to my wrist and sniffed it once I applied it, 10 min later &amp; then in 30 min. intervals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the seller, not counting Sunday, I receved this in 3 days! It was very nicely packaged &amp; factory sealed so the perfume is NOT a fake!! This is the real deal....NOT imitation! Even a nicer surprise to see that they included samples of other perfumes, a facial cream &amp; a small nail clipper...so cute &amp; so customer service oriented! 4 stars for the perfume &amp; for the Seller, I give them 5 stars A++++. I will be back to order some more &amp; not buying from anyone except this company!</li>
            <li> Loved it!  Great bargain.</li>
