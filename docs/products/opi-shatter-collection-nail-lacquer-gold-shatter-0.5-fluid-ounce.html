            <li>..make sure u take something elso like unknow brand</li>
            <li>This color worked for me I added a glitter coating on top of it as I was looking more for the color then</li>
            <li>Maybe it would have been better in another color, but it just looked like was chipping on my.  </li>
            <li>My husband used the term &amp;#34;tawdry&amp;#34; to describe the look!:)</li>
            <li>Just love Shatter and the more sparkles the better</li>
            <li>made the gold glitter shine even more, which isn&#x27;t something i even thought about at all.</li>
            <li>This is mostly my fault for not putting two and two together that this would be a &amp;#34;shatter&amp;#34; polish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love O.P.I nail</li>
            <li>One more coat and still nothing, but a translucent gold shimmer.</li>
            <li>It looks OK, but not anything like we were after.</li>
            <li>... I Love it.</li>
            <li>i will buy more for price</li>
            <li>Love the effects of this polish.  </li>
            <li>I love OPI.  </li>
            <li>I am really glad I got this color.  </li>
            <li>I can still use the gold color &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>At first I loved using this crackle polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price!!</li>
            <li>This polish is amazing, as most OPI Polish is, and is especially effective when applied over black...at least in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Other than that the nail polish works great!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s easy to remove.</li>
            <li>It was super easy to apply, and looks super cute!</li>
            <li>Great color rich looking most of my friends asked me about this polish,&lt;br /&gt;Great product hope to see colors same brand.</li>
            <li>It looks great over red polish.</li>
            <li>I like a smooth look.</li>
            <li>pleasantly surprised at how good this polish is.</li>
            <li>I love this polish because it has the perfect sort of subtle gold colour.</li>
            <li>however the color is great, now its time to use it effectively on the nail not sure if i will have the salon do it or attempt it myself</li>
            <li>I own the Silver Shatter by OPI, and had high hopes for this one.</li>
            <li>So if you love salon looks for less money but great value,&lt;br /&gt;get</li>
            <li>this Gold color is so pretty and sparkles like it should just love it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m excited to try it</li>
            <li>it cheap  and true to color.</li>
            <li>I was sooo excited to try this.  </li>
            <li>so yea success!</li>
            <li>It works well if you wait to apply it for a full day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, and I plan to purchase other colors.</li>
            <li>I have 8 other shatter polishes from OPI and they are all great.</li>
            <li>Looks great over any other nail polish.</li>
            <li>Shatter polishes are to be applied in one quick coat to get the desired effect.</li>
            <li>If you apply more than one coat to reach a good level of coverage, it won&#x27;t crack well and it will look chunky and messy.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and shiny.</li>
            <li>It has the flat brush that allows you to cover your entire nail with one stroke which is perfect for crackle or shatter polish.</li>
            <li>first the good shatter looked lovely, a slight gold sheen.</li>
            <li>Great color and great look under any strong color like black , red , blue</li>
            <li>As it is so bright, it made it more difficult to find choices with which to combine it and still be work appropriate.</li>
            <li>EXPERMENT AND HAVE FUN.</li>
            <li>This shatter product is so fun.</li>
            <li>Those shatter nicely and you only have to use one coat.</li>
            <li>I bought it right away without reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>I painted my nails with it right away.</li>
            <li>This product is a good idea and a little bit of fun</li>
            <li>arrived far sooner than expected and looks great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Love the gold especially for the holidays</li>
            <li>But regardless of how pretty it is, it doesn&#x27;t do what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>but I did not get the desired effect after using it and the crackle was not as evident as the manufacturer said it would be.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter who is ten, and I love to have manicures together.</li>
            <li>you love the color last along time really pretty buy it</li>
            <li>First of all, I noticed it wasn&#x27;t shattering at all.</li>
            <li>The color was really pretty.</li>
            <li>the color last for about a week more.</li>
            <li>The shatter effective isn&#x27;t as obvious with the Gold Shatter as it was with the Silver, and it ends up looking more like a gold sparkle over top the original color, with an occasional small shatter.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t look nearly as nice as the other shatters.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty, but it doesn&#x27;t block out sections of the color underneath, just gives certain areas of your colored nail some sparkle.  </li>
            <li>Works just as it says painted it over black and looks really amazing</li>
            <li>Fast delivery..</li>
            <li>expected more from opi.</li>
            <li>, this is a real Opi product</li>
            <li>OPI is a very reliable and quality polish.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li>For one thing, since it is more translucent than most OPI polishes it goes on thin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this over many colors and find it looks nice with black, red and blue</li>
            <li>the shatter worked out really well and putting a clear top coat over it when it&#x27;s completely dry</li>
            <li>I highly recommend OPI.</li>
            <li>I put it on top of metallic green and ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to do a few more tests with it, and perhaps find a color that it works well with, but thus far, I prefer the Silver over the Gold.</li>
            <li>it can&#x27;t be applied evenly and the color is less strong as it shows on the picture.</li>
            <li>Also, even when applied lightly it has a really undesirable chunkiness when it begins to crack, probably due to the metal flakes in it pulling up a bit and not laying flat as they should.</li>
            <li>love this color over pink, and the gold crackle is classic, I prefer to paint my nails other than going to the nail salon and it takes a while getting used to using this stuff</li>
            <li>It goes on kinda clear</li>
            <li>that wow factor I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>This shatter nail polish is by far the prettiest i&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li>Unlike most other OPI shatters, this one was harder to apply.  </li>
            <li>I let it dry, and about an hour later I noticed it was falling right off my nails.</li>
            <li>But if you only apply one coat you can hardly see more than the suggestion of a gold shimmer.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m disappointed i can&#x27;t show a picture of what it looks like on my nails, but i&#x27;m sure you can imagine how fabulous it looks.</li>
            <li>They only look decent with certain colors, which is not many colors.</li>
            <li>It also shatters in very wide, thick pieces, most of the other OPI Shatters give more delicate looking results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I used this product correctly, but the crackle didn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li>In stores they cost too much money for me on my tight budget.</li>

            <li> the shatter worked out really well and putting a clear top coat over it when it&#x27;s completely dry</li>
            <li> I highly recommend OPI.</li>
            <li> I put it on top of metallic green and ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to do a few more tests with it, and perhaps find a color that it works well with, but thus far, I prefer the Silver over the Gold.</li>
            <li> it can&#x27;t be applied evenly and the color is less strong as it shows on the picture.</li>
            <li> Also, even when applied lightly it has a really undesirable chunkiness when it begins to crack, probably due to the metal flakes in it pulling up a bit and not laying flat as they should.</li>
            <li> love this color over pink, and the gold crackle is classic, I prefer to paint my nails other than going to the nail salon and it takes a while getting used to using this stuff</li>
            <li> It goes on kinda clear</li>
            <li> that wow factor I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> This shatter nail polish is by far the prettiest i&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> Unlike most other OPI shatters, this one was harder to apply.  </li>
            <li> I let it dry, and about an hour later I noticed it was falling right off my nails.</li>
            <li> But if you only apply one coat you can hardly see more than the suggestion of a gold shimmer.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m disappointed i can&#x27;t show a picture of what it looks like on my nails, but i&#x27;m sure you can imagine how fabulous it looks.</li>
            <li> They only look decent with certain colors, which is not many colors.</li>
            <li> It also shatters in very wide, thick pieces, most of the other OPI Shatters give more delicate looking results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I used this product correctly, but the crackle didn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li> In stores they cost too much money for me on my tight budget.</li>
            <li> This polish is very thin and translucent, unlike most of OPI&#x27;s other shatters.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the over all color I think was kind of ugly and misleading from this picture.</li>
            <li> Stays on without chipping for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It stays on for a long time too!</li>
            <li> Hopefully get some other color later</li>
            <li> We use it quite but it tends to dry up while its still in the bottle</li>
            <li> Dry</li>
            <li> It last a long time so less touch ups.</li>
            <li> Stick to black or blue or purple</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like other OPI products that have nearly no fumes smell.</li>
            <li> OR EVEN RED OR GREEN POLISH WITH SILVER OR GOLD SHATTER.  </li>
            <li> It barely cracked and just looked like I lazily put on some nail polish.</li>
            <li> It does not really crack so it worked for what I was trying to do with it.</li>
            <li> and then the polish completely dried out leaving only the gold flakes.</li>
            <li> The overall effect is that your nails look messy.  </li>
            <li> This is the most disappointed I&#x27;ve ever been in an OPI nail polish.</li>
            <li> maybe other color will be nicer</li>
            <li> but I will probably just let it sit with all the other rejected polish I have.</li>
            <li> I own almost all the shatter colors and gold, silver and white all make horrible shatters.</li>
            <li> but after a few tries I had it down</li>
            <li> It was delivered faster than expected (yay!!) and was affordable.</li>
            <li> Im Going To Buy The Black Shatter</li>
            <li> I put this over dark green for my school colors.</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail a little while ago.</li>
            <li> It basically disintegrated all off in little pieces.</li>
            <li> money wasted.</li>
            <li> Got it to wear with my black and gold!  </li>
            <li> We like to be wild and crazy at times with our nail polish.</li>
            <li> We like to choose out of the ordinary colors, when we are together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I acknowledge there may be some trick to using it that I missed, but I have to rate it down for not being terribly user friendly.</li>
            <li> it looks like a sloppy glitter polish applied by a little kid.</li>
            <li> Lately I have been a bit of a magpie!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing since I had only used it a handful of times.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product at all.</li>
            <li> The shipping wasn&#x27;t that bad, it was average.</li>
            <li> The polish goes on so thinly that whether it crackles or not is irrelevant.</li>
            <li> Sorry OPI</li>
            <li> really bad.</li>
            <li> hate shatter polishes.</li>
            <li> Just as soon as I figure out what base to use to get the shatter look.</li>

            <li> I got this shatter just because. I&#x27;m glad I did because it&#x27;s stunning! Metalic gold with tiny sparkles, mine, mine, all mine!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.. Great price, shipping included.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have the same affect as regular colored shatter...it&#x27;s pretty, but it doesn&#x27;t block out sections of the color underneath, just gives certain areas of your colored nail some sparkle.  It&#x27;s pretty and I like it, but will have to decide what colors it works best with...  I put it on top of metallic green and ...just didn&#x27;t give it that wow factor I was looking for.  Everyone else liked it though...</li>
            <li> WANT THE LATEST GLAM FOR THE HOLIDAYS?  SHATTER NAIL POLISH IN GOLD OR SILVER!!  HOW ABOUT ORANGE POLISH WITH GOLD SHATTER FOR HALLOWEEN OR THANKSGIVING.  OR EVEN RED OR GREEN POLISH WITH SILVER OR GOLD SHATTER.  THERE ARE LOTS MORE COMBINATIONS YOU CAN USE.  EXPERMENT AND HAVE FUN.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shatter. money wasted. it looks like a sloppy glitter polish applied by a little kid. really bad. expected more from opi.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish, the crackle goes on perfectly and dries quicker than I anticipated. It was delivered faster than expected (yay!!) and was affordable. I would recommend this to anyone who loves painting their nails. What girl doesn&#x27;t like nail polish? ;)</li>
            <li> Perfectly shine at night! The gold is so glamorous! Now I have six shatters and cant wait to put them all on my nails~!</li>
            <li> Love the gold especially for the holidays and I find that it shatters well, I am very pleased with my purchase.  The item also came very fast and in great condition.  Would definitely buy in every color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I used this product correctly, but the crackle didn&#x27;t look right. It barely cracked and just looked like I lazily put on some nail polish. I acknowledge there may be some trick to using it that I missed, but I have to rate it down for not being terribly user friendly.</li>
            <li> The produce is okay,and this gold is amazing!! But if u wanna make ur nails be crack..make sure u take something elso like unknow brand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like other OPI products that have nearly no fumes smell. I can&#x27;t stand its.... Just don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I own almost all the shatter colors and gold, silver and white all make horrible shatters. They only look decent with certain colors, which is not many colors. Stick to black or blue or purple</li>
            <li> This polish is very thin and translucent, unlike most of OPI&#x27;s other shatters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lovely color, very bright and metallic with hints of glitter and shine. But regardless of how pretty it is, it doesn&#x27;t do what it is supposed to do. It just doesn&#x27;t look good as a shatter. For one thing, since it is more translucent than most OPI polishes it goes on thin. Shatter polishes are to be applied in one quick coat to get the desired effect. So I&#x27;m sure you can see the problem here! If you apply more than one coat to reach a good level of coverage, it won&#x27;t crack well and it will look chunky and messy. But if you only apply one coat you can hardly see more than the suggestion of a gold shimmer. The crackle gets totally lost. Also, even when applied lightly it has a really undesirable chunkiness when it begins to crack, probably due to the metal flakes in it pulling up a bit and not laying flat as they should. It also shatters in very wide, thick pieces, most of the other OPI Shatters give more delicate looking results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping this would work out nicely... But it doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve tried this over many colors and find it looks nice with black, red and blue but I haven&#x27;t actually worn it out anywhere. It just doesn&#x27;t look nearly as nice as the other shatters. For an OPI polish, I feel this is very low quality.</li>
            <li> Stays on without chipping for a long time.  Great color rich looking most of my friends asked me about this polish,&lt;br /&gt;Great product hope to see colors same brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend along with another crackle polish. Very pretty and shiny. Crackle works great!</li>
            <li> This is a different texture to have on your nails.It gives it the shattered look.An idea nail polish that gives your nails that extra glow</li>
            <li> I love this polish because it has the perfect sort of subtle gold colour. It has the flat brush that allows you to cover your entire nail with one stroke which is perfect for crackle or shatter polish.</li>
            <li> Glistens gold with a shatter or crackle finish!  Got it to wear with my black and gold!  Go go PENS!</li>
            <li> I have been using this. I am very happy with the looks and beauty of it!! I will definately be buying this again</li>
            <li> This polish is just what I was looking for...for the holiday season.  Like Opi products. Yes, I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Great color and great look under any strong color like black , red , blue , this is a real Opi product&lt;br /&gt;the quality is like always , Very happy costumer</li>
            <li> The polish goes on so thinly that whether it crackles or not is irrelevant. If you&#x27;re looking for a crackle that people will notice, don&#x27;t buy this. If you&#x27;re looking for a metallic or overlay, then there are plenty of non-crackle ones you can buy. This is the most disappointed I&#x27;ve ever been in an OPI nail polish.</li>
            <li> Great value and service! This polish is amazing, as most OPI Polish is, and is especially effective when applied over black...at least in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Very bright gold and clumpy.  Unlike most other OPI shatters, this one was harder to apply.  As it is so bright, it made it more difficult to find choices with which to combine it and still be work appropriate.</li>
            <li> Also used over solid color.</li>
            <li> I teach middle school, and my female students encouraged me to try \\&quot;crackle\\&quot; polish. It&#x27;s great, and I plan to purchase other colors.</li>
            <li> This shatter product is so fun.</li>
            <li> We use it quite but it tends to dry up while its still in the bottle</li>
            <li> This color worked for me I added a glitter coating on top of it as I was looking more for the color then the cracking ... It does not really crack so it worked for what I was trying to do with it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it would have been better in another color, but it just looked like was chipping on my.  My husband used the term &amp;#34;tawdry&amp;#34; to describe the look!:)</li>
            <li> Just love Shatter and the more sparkles the better this Gold color is so pretty and sparkles like it should just love it.</li>
            <li> OPI is a very reliable and quality polish. arrived far sooner than expected and looks great. i&#x27;m disappointed i can&#x27;t show a picture of what it looks like on my nails, but i&#x27;m sure you can imagine how fabulous it looks. the shatter worked out really well and putting a clear top coat over it when it&#x27;s completely dry made the gold glitter shine even more, which isn&#x27;t something i even thought about at all. pleasantly surprised at how good this polish is. would recommend!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this product. I thought I was ordering regular nail polish and discovered that it was something different. When I used the polish as directed it still didn&#x27;t give me that crackle look. I would not order this product again.</li>
            <li> This  nail enamel is the best I have bough and my grandaughter loves the the color. It last a long time so less touch ups.</li>
            <li> This product is a good idea and a little bit of fun but I did not get the desired effect after using it and the crackle was not as evident as the manufacturer said it would be.</li>
            <li> At first I loved using this crackle polish. It looks great over red polish. However, I only had it for a couple of months and then the polish completely dried out leaving only the gold flakes. Very disappointing since I had only used it a handful of times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried crackle nail polish once before, and I didn&#x27;t like it. I decided to give this a try, because I&#x27;ve never had a problem with O.P.I. nail polish before. It was super easy to apply, and looks super cute!</li>
            <li> This nail polish clumps; it doesn&#x27;t shatter.  The overall effect is that your nails look messy.  I&#x27;m going to stick with the Sally Hansen Shatter collection.  Those shatter nicely and you only have to use one coat.</li>
            <li> havent used it yet however the color is great, now its time to use it effectively on the nail not sure if i will have the salon do it or attempt it myself</li>
            <li> Loved it!! Works just as it says painted it over black and looks really amazing</li>
            <li> Wonderful nail polish. Nice color.</li>
            <li> This is mostly my fault for not putting two and two together that this would be a &amp;#34;shatter&amp;#34; polish.&lt;br /&gt;I hate shatter polishes. But the over all color I think was kind of ugly and misleading from this picture. Again, my fault for latenight, thoughtless shopping.</li>
            <li> This was a very good deal on this polish. It runs for about 7 to 8 dollars and I got it at about4 to5 dollars. I have never used a crackle polish but I&#x27;m excited to try it</li>
            <li> I bought it when it had promotions. I love O.P.I nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;For this, I choose to use one color as basis. And use it to cover. The result turns to a splitting effect. I like it.</li>
            <li> Just not my style. I like a smooth look.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter who is ten, and I love to have manicures together. This has become a tradition when I visit with her. This time we both chose the Opi gold shatter. We like to be wild and crazy at times with our nail polish. We like to choose out of the ordinary colors, when we are together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first the good shatter looked lovely, a slight gold sheen. However, we could not see any shatters, so we asked the manicurist to apply another coat. Nothing! One more coat and still nothing, but a translucent gold shimmer. It looks OK, but not anything like we were after. We wanted something spectacular, and we did not get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we did get was a good manicure and a good time together. We did not get the shatter gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Recommended For Us. prisrob 12-30-13</li>
            <li> U Paint It On..and In Seconds Starts To Shatter And Dry... I Love it. Im Going To Buy The Black Shatter Next. Great Color too</li>
            <li> you love the color last along time really pretty buy it it cheap  and true to color. i will buy more for price</li>
            <li> I have 8 other shatter polishes from OPI and they are all great. This was one color I didn&#x27;t have so I was happy to find it on here and it was a great price too</li>
            <li> I was sooo excited to try this.  I always wanted an Opi nail polish. In stores they cost too much money for me on my tight budget. When I saw it on amazon, for a good price, I was thrilled! I bought it right away without reading the reviews. I got it in the mail a little while ago. The shipping wasn&#x27;t that bad, it was average. I painted my nails with it right away. First of all, I noticed it wasn&#x27;t shattering at all. So I just painted two coats like a regular nail polish. The color was really pretty. I let it dry, and about an hour later I noticed it was falling right off my nails. I took a shower shortly after. It basically disintegrated all off in little pieces. It got all over my shower. I am not happy with this product at all. I would suggest not wasting your money on this.</li>
            <li> It works wonderful. I have had allot of compliments on my nails. It stays on for a long time too!</li>
            <li> This shatter nail polish is by far the prettiest i&#x27;ve had and i have a lot of crackled nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;You don&amp;#34;t have to use a lot of the product to get the desired effect.</li>
            <li> love this color over pink, and the gold crackle is classic, I prefer to paint my nails other than going to the nail salon and it takes a while getting used to using this stuff but after a few tries I had it down</li>
            <li> I am obesessed with nail polish and this one was a great addition to my collection.  Looks great over any other nail polish.</li>
            <li> Lately I have been a bit of a magpie!  Love the effects of this polish.  So if you love salon looks for less money but great value,&lt;br /&gt;get any of the Opi polishes!</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved it!!  It is a great color.  I love OPI.  I am really glad I got this color.  I highly recommend OPI.</li>
            <li> It delivered so fast，and the polish is good，easy to put on，and the color last for about a week more. And it&#x27;s easy to remove.</li>
            <li> it can&#x27;t be applied evenly and the color is less strong as it shows on the picture. maybe other color will be nicer</li>
            <li> La duracion en pesima. Se seco muy rapido , no me dura nada. Prense que por la marca era bueno</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use this. Just as soon as I figure out what base to use to get the shatter look.</li>
            <li> The color of this polish just wasn&#x27;t for me. I didn&#x27;t return it but I will probably just let it sit with all the other rejected polish I have. It goes on kinda clear and then when I do a double or triple coat it almost looks yellow on my nails. Sorry OPI but i just don&#x27;t like this color.</li>
            <li> For someone else, I do not use the product myself,so....It shall be good anyway. Hopefully get some other color later</li>
            <li> I paid $3 for a bottle that would&#x27;ve cost me 10 in the store &amp; it does wat its supposed 2..so yea success!</li>
            <li> I give this product 4 stars because as some said it doesn&#x27;t shatter but for me it actually worked. The only thing is that I left this out in the sun and now after a year it doesn&#x27;t crackle from the sun damage. I can still use the gold color &#x3D;) Other than that the nail polish works great!</li>
            <li> I put this over dark green for my school colors. It works well if you wait to apply it for a full day.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It&#x27;s worth the price!! It&#x27;s easy to apply and also shines beautifully!! I love it</li>
            <li> I own the Silver Shatter by OPI, and had high hopes for this one. It&#x27;s not what I was hoping it would be, which makes me appreciate the amount I paid for it. The shatter effective isn&#x27;t as obvious with the Gold Shatter as it was with the Silver, and it ends up looking more like a gold sparkle over top the original color, with an occasional small shatter. I&#x27;m hoping to do a few more tests with it, and perhaps find a color that it works well with, but thus far, I prefer the Silver over the Gold.</li>
