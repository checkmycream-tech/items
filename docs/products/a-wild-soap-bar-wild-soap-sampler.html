            <li>Was expecting more</li>

            <li>and I disagree with many of them.</li>
            <li>Love them all.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a while, but I&#x27;ll never forget how lovely it smelled.....</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using this soap in case</li>
            <li>You and your guests will love the variety and quality of this sampler.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Gives you a chance to try out different soaps so that you can find what you like best.</li>
            <li>The soap is great, and the sample pack provides a nice variety, but be advised that the bars in the sampler are tiny.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s fun and interesting to try each kind.  </li>
            <li>The smell is strong and pleasant, which I really like.  </li>
            <li>I love the rustic look &amp; smooth feel of the bars</li>
            <li>Smells so good and looks very naural.</li>
            <li>A sampler for sure ...that will make you want to buy the full size over and over again.</li>
            <li>Once you got through a good 1/4 to 1/2 of a particular bar (when all of the stuff \\&quot;contaminated\\&quot; by its neighbors got used up, I presume) you could start to smell its unique fragrance, but by that time you&#x27;re so used to having it on you that it&#x27;s about time to switch it up</li>
            <li>Each one is unique and different, they are quite beautiful to look at, smell fabulous and are nice and sudsy and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>Great for regular handwashing and shower both.</li>
            <li>They came nicely boxed and ready for use or gifting.</li>
            <li>well, they were smooth unless they contained clays.</li>
            <li>So I find these very useful.  </li>
            <li>Also great as &#x27;guest soaps&#x27; when a full bar of soap simply won&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li>love those pretty soap bars.</li>
            <li>swiftly &amp; safely scent;)</li>
            <li>far so good, right?</li>
            <li>Hard to decide which I like best.</li>
            <li>Fresh clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more, love the packaging too.</li>
            <li>The top is all open and exposes the top of the soaps.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just fit me very much.</li>
            <li>You never know when you&#x27;ll need a plumber or other repairman in the house, and most of them would rather not use rose scented soaps.  </li>
            <li>They certainly are perfect for visiting guests who need a small bar of soap for the week or weekend.</li>
            <li>Why put toxic substances on it that get absorbed into your system?  </li>
            <li>Considering they are home made, I guess I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Can you tell I love handcrafted, natural soaps?</li>
            <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t disappear too fast compared to the average soap bar.</li>
            <li>That said, these are interesting, pleasant soaps, definitely not run of the mill, and if you bought each one full size you&#x27;d have to spend a small fortune.</li>
            <li>Each little soap has its own plant-based scent which is noticeable but not overpowering, and the plants chosen are unique</li>
            <li>I suppose that the word &amp;#34;sampler&amp;#34; should have been my first clue.</li>
            <li>where they broached the topic of current day chemicals in soap/shampoo amongst many others but basically introduced the idea of organic cleansers.</li>
            <li>They do a good job of cleaning your skin without leaving a heavy scent or residue.</li>
            <li>Whoever makes these soaps has a signature style that is very unique to the soaper; the blends of herbs &amp; essential oils are not the common find which I found interesting and appealing.</li>
            <li>Thus far, this has been my favorite assortment as far as scents go.</li>
            <li>The bars are a really good size for people with small hands (the bars I received were 2&amp;#34</li>
            <li>After testing them out I really enjoyed the squeaky clean feel I got and their scents left me feeling like I smelled properly like a guy.</li>
            <li>Quite a variety from mild to wild.</li>
            <li>If you have light color wash cloths the soaps will stain them and the stains don&#x27;t wash out, even with bleach on white wash</li>
            <li>Unusual shape lends a very rustic feel to an otherwise routine item.</li>
            <li>this review is helpful to someone who loves natural soap and might be interested in buying this.</li>
            <li>A Wild Soapbar has a number of floral scents as expected, but the real draw were the more masculine wood scents: pine tar neem, sassafras, cedarwood and yucca root.</li>
            <li>Because of the size, they were kind of hard to use.</li>
            <li>For those who might wonder they were nice hard bars that lasted about a month between my husband and I &amp; They also make your bathroom smell</li>
            <li>Other than that minor inconvenience,  I have really enjoyed this assortment!</li>
            <li>I love buying &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;guest-sized&amp;#34; handmade soaps because I become bored easily.</li>
            <li>Fabulous soap .. small bars, just right for a guest soap or in a frequently used guest bathroom.</li>
            <li>The smell is from the natural oils of whatever soap you choose.</li>
            <li>The soaps don&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This soap is so wild.</li>
            <li>I like natural soaps and this product does not disappoint.</li>
            <li>If you find a scent you particularly like you can buy larger bars.  </li>
            <li>Based on the pictures of the product, and lack of adequate explanations, I expected a larger item.</li>
            <li>So far, I have been using the same bar for about three weeks twice a day</li>
            <li>You cant get the full effect of the soap because they are too small.</li>
            <li>What I received was a very small box with the soap bar sizes similar to the facial soap bar found in most hotels.</li>
            <li>The whole box is smaller than a single bar of soap.</li>
            <li>The soap was very high quality, and my wife specifically commented that it didn&#x27;t leave her skin feeling oily like a lot of other boutique soaps do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got dry skin and am tired of all the &amp;#34;Axe&amp;#34; style scented soaps/washes out there, so I turned toward simpler more natural soaps hoping for a change.</li>
            <li>; long, 1.5&amp;#34; wide, and .5&amp;#34; high).</li>

            <li> Fabulous soap .. small bars, just right for a guest soap or in a frequently used guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> The smell is from the natural oils of whatever soap you choose.</li>
            <li> The soaps don&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This soap is so wild.</li>
            <li> I like natural soaps and this product does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> If you find a scent you particularly like you can buy larger bars.  </li>
            <li> Based on the pictures of the product, and lack of adequate explanations, I expected a larger item.</li>
            <li> So far, I have been using the same bar for about three weeks twice a day</li>
            <li> You cant get the full effect of the soap because they are too small.</li>
            <li> What I received was a very small box with the soap bar sizes similar to the facial soap bar found in most hotels.</li>
            <li> The whole box is smaller than a single bar of soap.</li>
            <li> The soap was very high quality, and my wife specifically commented that it didn&#x27;t leave her skin feeling oily like a lot of other boutique soaps do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got dry skin and am tired of all the &amp;#34;Axe&amp;#34; style scented soaps/washes out there, so I turned toward simpler more natural soaps hoping for a change.</li>
            <li> ; long, 1.5&amp;#34; wide, and .5&amp;#34; high).</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry skin especially in the winter but these soaps moisturize and don&#x27;t bother my skin and not dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> soap is packaged with the bricks all directly against each other, and by the time the soap got to us, you couldn&#x27;t tell one scent from another.</li>
            <li> One bar last a long time !</li>
            <li> This makes the true scent of each bar individually hard to smell until it&#x27;s been used a few times.</li>
            <li> In fact I haven&#x27;t seen them in a long time</li>
            <li> This was a HUGE disappointment.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t bother my skin at all, which I have to be careful of.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I look forward to testing the other seven bars in turn.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the bars are packed together unwrapped.</li>
            <li> Might even go down the drain if you has no stopper.</li>
            <li> The scents included are: bluebonnet, desert sage, prickly pear, horse mint, black Willow, sassafras, cedar wood, and wildflower.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not sweet or fruity smelling</li>
            <li> These are NOT full size bars of soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend these little soaps to anyone.  </li>
            <li> One of life&#x27;s little &amp;#34;happies.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> I said to myself, &amp;#34;You are trying to waste money.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I was worried that they were so unusably small based on previous reviews-</li>
            <li> The soaps are small, measuring 1.5&amp;#34; X 2&amp;#34; X .25&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> The are small hotel sample sized bars.  </li>
            <li> I like keeping neutral scented small soap bars on hand in the guest bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Its too small for the price.</li>
            <li> though I like the soaps, I will not  buy them again because of the negative points I outlined.</li>
            <li> Very small sample for the price -</li>
            <li> Obviously I don&#x27;t know what an ounce of soap looks like because I was shocked, shocked over how small the box was.  </li>
            <li> The soaps are expensive, 8 bars in the pack at a cost of $1.67 a bar.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed in the small size.</li>
            <li> Totally unable to domesticate it.</li>
            <li> I would rate these a very poor value based on weight and price.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fresh clean scents.&lt;br /&gt;I Love the packaging and the soaps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got dry skin and am tired of all the &amp;#34;Axe&amp;#34; style scented soaps/washes out there, so I turned toward simpler more natural soaps hoping for a change. A Wild Soapbar has a number of floral scents as expected, but the real draw were the more masculine wood scents: pine tar neem, sassafras, cedarwood and yucca root. After testing them out I really enjoyed the squeaky clean feel I got and their scents left me feeling like I smelled properly like a guy. I recommend the sampler so you can find one you like too.</li>
            <li> great selection of soap I love the variety</li>
            <li> Very small sample for the price - but the soap is lovely - smells great, great lather.  Just wish the &amp;#34;sampler&amp;#34; was larger.</li>
            <li> This product is good for my skin and face, so I ues it  every day and it&#x27;s just fit me very much.</li>
            <li> The soap is great, and the sample pack provides a nice variety, but be advised that the bars in the sampler are tiny. This might be cute for a guest bath.</li>
            <li> I suppose that the word &amp;#34;sampler&amp;#34; should have been my first clue. Based on the pictures of the product, and lack of adequate explanations, I expected a larger item. What I received was a very small box with the soap bar sizes similar to the facial soap bar found in most hotels.</li>
            <li> love these soaps. they are good size. I was worried that they were so unusably small based on previous reviews- but they are a great size. Makes skin smooth and great scent.</li>
            <li> Love the travel size bars! Great for trips and gift giving!  I&#x27;ll be back for more, love the packaging too. Great for stuffing  stockings or  housewarming gift.  They smell really nice too .</li>
            <li> These are good soaps but they melt very quickly.  And the scents of each bar are very similar.  They certainly are perfect for visiting guests who need a small bar of soap for the week or weekend.</li>
            <li> You will achieve a nice lather with this soap.  The smell is from the natural oils of whatever soap you choose. Great for your skin. Yes, it is not an inexpensive item but consider this. Your skin is the largest organ in your body. Why put toxic substances on it that get absorbed into your system?  The sampler box is a great way to become familiar with this company.</li>
            <li> Our family love these soaps!!! Just wish they were a lot bigger. You cant get the full effect of the soap because they are too small.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;. The soaps are from organic sources.&lt;br /&gt;. The soaps have very nice fragrance&#x27;s and are aromatic leaving the bathroom smelling nice also.&lt;br /&gt;. I tend to have dry skin especially in the winter but these soaps moisturize and don&#x27;t bother my skin and not dry out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;. The soaps are expensive, 8 bars in the pack at a cost of $1.67 a bar.&lt;br /&gt;. The soaps are small, measuring 1.5&amp;#34; X 2&amp;#34; X .25&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;. The soaps don&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;. If you have light color wash cloths the soaps will stain them and the stains don&#x27;t wash out, even with bleach on white wash cloths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;Even though I like the soaps, I will not  buy them again because of the negative points I outlined.</li>
            <li> Obviously I don&#x27;t know what an ounce of soap looks like because I was shocked, shocked over how small the box was.  I said to myself, &amp;#34;You are trying to waste money.&amp;#34;  But I know what an ounce of cheese looks like, so I should have known.  That said, these are interesting, pleasant soaps, definitely not run of the mill, and if you bought each one full size you&#x27;d have to spend a small fortune. (Sorry! Had too!)</li>
            <li> The bars are a really good size for people with small hands (the bars I received were 2&amp;#34; long, 1.5&amp;#34; wide, and .5&amp;#34; high). Unlike some reviewers, I use them to wash my hands and face and not in the shower, so there is no problem of them getting away from me. They feel good, not at all drying. So far, I have been using the same bar for about three weeks twice a day and it has many soapings. The fragrance of the one I am using is very strong, but pleasant. I look forward to testing the other seven bars in turn.</li>
            <li> Loved trying all the scents and textures. Quite a variety from mild to wild. Love these soaps. One bar last a long time !</li>
            <li> smells great, makes me feel special.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend these little soaps to anyone.  They&#x27;re not sweet or fruity smelling so they&#x27;re good for guys and girls alike.  Each little soap has its own plant-based scent which is noticeable but not overpowering, and the plants chosen are unique so it&#x27;s fun and interesting to try each kind.  One of life&#x27;s little &amp;#34;happies.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The recipient was very pleased with the fragrances of the soap.  The recipient would like to have more of this product.</li>
            <li> Love this gift set.  The packaging is perfect and shows off the soaps just great.  Haven&#x27;t yet tried the soaps but we are looking forward to trying them.</li>
            <li> A delicious assortment of scents! I love buying &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;guest-sized&amp;#34; handmade soaps because I become bored easily. Thus far, this has been my favorite assortment as far as scents go. My only complaint is the bars are packed together unwrapped. This makes the true scent of each bar individually hard to smell until it&#x27;s been used a few times. Other than that minor inconvenience,  I have really enjoyed this assortment! Great for regular handwashing and shower both. A great product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I would rate these a very poor value based on weight and price.</li>
            <li> Go this for my Dad for his birthday.  Great soap and what a deal!  These should last him quite awhile!</li>
            <li> They are the perfect sized soaps for a quest bathroom! Each one is unique and different, they are quite beautiful to look at, smell fabulous and are nice and sudsy and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> Fabulous soap .. small bars, just right for a guest soap or in a frequently used guest bathroom. Wonderful, fresh, fruity smell..can&#x27;t get enough of the scent ..it enlightens me, makes me feel good and energetic .. love those pretty soap bars.</li>
            <li> I think these are great soaps.  The are small hotel sample sized bars.  The scents included are: bluebonnet, desert sage, prickly pear, horse mint, black Willow, sassafras, cedar wood, and wildflower.  I like keeping neutral scented small soap bars on hand in the guest bathroom.  You never know when you&#x27;ll need a plumber or other repairman in the house, and most of them would rather not use rose scented soaps.  So I find these very useful.  If you find a scent you particularly like you can buy larger bars.  These soaps, used as hand soaps, last for several months.  They do a good job of cleaning your skin without leaving a heavy scent or residue.</li>
            <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t disappear too fast compared to the average soap bar. Just taking off a star because the amount you get for the price isn&#x27;t that impressive.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling soap but I thought they would be larger bars.  Because of the size, they were kind of hard to use.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money! The whole box is smaller than a single bar of soap. This was a HUGE disappointment.</li>
            <li> smaller than a hotel bar of soap. Might even go down the drain if you has no stopper. Was expecting more</li>
            <li> These are so good. And they give you a sense of each kind of scent. I like them. Just keep in mind that they are tiny bars of soap, so they&#x27;re overpriced. They make for a nice gift, though.</li>
            <li> Love the variety. Great buy.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and I disagree with many of them. I can tell the difference between each scent. They came nicely boxed and ready for use or gifting. Bentonite clay is used by my family to treat MRSA so this is a great way to use it before my kids get it. It should prevent outbreaks of it. And they all smell amazing.</li>
            <li> swiftly &amp; safely scent;)</li>
            <li> Love them all.  Hard to decide which I like best.</li>
            <li> The soap smells wonderful but I was disappointed in the small size. They are each about hotel soap size. Otherwise, it&#x27;s okay. Considering they are home made, I guess I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Was bought as a gift and the person who received it loved it. Said it smells great and works really well!</li>
            <li> This soap is so wild. Totally unable to domesticate it.</li>
            <li> This os a pack of sample sized soap.  I didnt realize this when I purchased it.  Over-priced for what you get.</li>
            <li> The soap was very high quality, and my wife specifically commented that it didn&#x27;t leave her skin feeling oily like a lot of other boutique soaps do. The lather is nice, and it rinses clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t bother my skin at all, which I have to be careful of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good, right? So why only 3/5 stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is packaged with the bricks all directly against each other, and by the time the soap got to us, you couldn&#x27;t tell one scent from another. Once you got through a good 1/4 to 1/2 of a particular bar (when all of the stuff \\&quot;contaminated\\&quot; by its neighbors got used up, I presume) you could start to smell its unique fragrance, but by that time you&#x27;re so used to having it on you that it&#x27;s about time to switch it up anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it would help if they&#x27;d throw a piece of wax paper or something between each bar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought these on amazon. In fact I haven&#x27;t seen them in a long time but I used to buy this soap from a store on ebay. It would have seemed I had spoken (exchanged email) with the owner herself? Very Nice lady.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this soap is Sooo Good!! It&#x27;s been a while, but I&#x27;ll never forget how lovely it smelled.....oh! was it ever scrumptious!! I&#x27;ve tried all but two in this set and a bunch of others and I just loved them all. Whoever makes these soaps has a signature style that is very unique to the soaper; the blends of herbs &amp; essential oils are not the common find which I found interesting and appealing. I love the rustic look &amp; smooth feel of the bars well, they were smooth unless they contained clays. Can you tell I love handcrafted, natural soaps? For those who might wonder they were nice hard bars that lasted about a month between my husband and I &amp; They also make your bathroom smell Wonderful!!. I really enjoyed using this soap in case you didn&#x27;t notice.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review is helpful to someone who loves natural soap and might be interested in buying this. It really is good stuff!! Buy it, you&#x27;ll like it!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know I had an issue with soaps and shampoos till I heard an interview on Dave Holmes podcast, \\&quot;You made it weird\\&quot; with Anziz Ansari (sp?) where they broached the topic of current day chemicals in soap/shampoo amongst many others but basically introduced the idea of organic cleansers. So I tried this and it&#x27;s pretty good!</li>
            <li> This sampler is a great way to try a variety of soaps you may not have used before. Also great as &#x27;guest soaps&#x27; when a full bar of soap simply won&#x27;t do. Unusual shape lends a very rustic feel to an otherwise routine item. Be mindful of the picture. These are NOT full size bars of soap. You and your guests will love the variety and quality of this sampler. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> A sampler for sure ...that will make you want to buy the full size over and over again. Made in Texas! Yeah!</li>
            <li> Smells so good and looks very naural. The packaging needs improvement. The top is all open and exposes the top of the soaps. Almost seems used.</li>
            <li> I like natural soaps and this product does not disappoint. Gives you a chance to try out different soaps so that you can find what you like best. Great for gift or for a treat for yourself.</li>
            <li> It is very nice soap.  The smell is strong and pleasant, which I really like.  The measurements are as follows: 2 x 1.5 x .25 inches.  Perfect for the dishcloths I knitted for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Its too small for the price.</li>
