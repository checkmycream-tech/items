            <li>So far so good!!</li>
            <li>Best out of all the natural sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>By far one of the best mineral sunscreens that doesn&#x27;t contain cancer causing ingredients.</li>
            <li>PROS:  - Natural protection (listed as one of best sunscreens by EWG)</li>
            <li>so far the best i tried..</li>
            <li>by far THE BEST safer sunscreen that we have tried.</li>
            <li>Most important it&#x27;s effective and non-toxic!</li>

            <li>Safe, easy to apply and it smells good.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love!  </li>
            <li>After spending way too many hours on the internets searching for an effective and safe sunscreen  </li>
            <li>We have tried dozens of the top ewg rated sunscreens and this is by far the best for any sport or water activities.</li>
            <li>Our favorite natural sunscreen, works perfectly!</li>
            <li>I love this product and am thrilled I finally found the perfect sunscreen.</li>
            <li>They also seem to like as I haven&#x27;t gotten any complaints about eyes burning--which is great ;-)</li>
            <li>It is very light, however, so</li>
            <li>I have even used it on my 13-month old with very fair skin.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
            <li>buy Livestrong :-)</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-greasy and provides wonderful coverage without that white sunscreen look (I&#x27;m medium-light skin tone).</li>
            <li>it helps support cancer research :)</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic.</li>
            <li>(much more noticeable once you jump in the water</li>
            <li>I try to avoid chemical sunscreens, so we have tried lots of zinc sunscreens - most of them with a toothpaste-like consistency.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and my kids never get burned.</li>
            <li>We have been searching for a more healthy sunscreen for our family.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found this stuff.</li>
            <li>Makes me wonder if having a zinc deficiency makes one more prone to sunburn.</li>
            <li>Most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products have proven to be overpriced and ineffective.  </li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li>We love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>so i know its safe for my kids.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s water resistant,</li>
            <li>Need I say more.</li>
            <li>it has a nice light scent that is not overwpowering.  </li>
            <li>Kids love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also incredibly effective, perhaps because it&#x27;s easier to apply the appropriate amount, and with re-application keeps my ghost-pale skin burn free.</li>
            <li>Though in fairness, we did spend most of our time in shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Out of three sunscreens I tried on vacation to mexico, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>one was my favorite choice:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the smell and</li>
            <li>Probably my favorite of the safer sunblocks, and yes, we did check the toxicity levels on the ewg website.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is why I love this brand.  </li>
            <li>you aren&#x27;t sold yet, here are more reasons to love this product:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I get more sunscreen and then get my neck and ears.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll appreciate it in your 60s.  :)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love the scent-</li>
            <li>kids are allergic to many sunscreen ingredients and this one did not cause them any irritation.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by cheap brands, this stuff is it!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>But overall, this sunscreen is excellent, and I don&#x27;t have any complaints about it!</li>
            <li>Tried this because of EWG&#x27;s recommendation for a safe sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and has a nice, not overpowering, scent.</li>
            <li>Nice light scent.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Pretty much the best option there is for kids in terms of safety &amp; protection.</li>
            <li>Has a great sort of grapefruity smell that my 4 yr old really likes, good, effective coverage.</li>
            <li>I feel they got the perfect balance so that it applies easy enough and isn&#x27;t too oily.  </li>
            <li>Since I use it on my face sometimes, for high-level protection on hot, bright summer days, I add just a pinch of moisturizing lotion into the sunscreen before I apply it.</li>
            <li>This makes my beautiful brown-skinned six year old daughter appear as though she had a flour soak-bath.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and how easily it blends in.</li>
            <li>Great product so far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other sunscreen products, and this is great --and inexpensive in comparison!</li>
            <li>Then apply Thinksport afterward, it will go on creamy, smooth, and absorb better.</li>
            <li>It is rated as safe by the EWG yearly report on sunscreens, and is mineral based, which is important to me.</li>
            <li>and you have to really rub it in good</li>
            <li>Easy to spread and get on...works perfect - had minimal sunburns this summer.  </li>
            <li>think I need to find a different ss that provides as good protection, but not so greasy and clingy!  </li>
            <li>and I am grateful this didn&#x27;t happen to my sweet baby!</li>
            <li>I tan really easily</li>
            <li>It blends in easily and doesn&#x27;t make us look like ghosts</li>
            <li>to apply as it doesn&#x27;t easily apply evenly on skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>ThinkSport blends in easily and doesn&#x27;t make my kids look like ghosts.  </li>
            <li>My daughters and I burn easily, and this prevented it after hours on the beach.</li>
            <li>b/c rubbing this chalky zinc stuff in is work, although I have to say this is more easily absorbed into the skin than most ewg.org recommended sunscreens.</li>
            <li>You just have to clean your items more after use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy of use.</li>
            <li>) Goes on easy and smooth&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>This one works well and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Spreads easily.</li>
            <li>- Fairly easy to rub in.</li>
            <li>Easy to rub in, no ghost like appearances.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and apply.</li>
            <li>Safe, works wonderfully, and safe to use on my sweet little girl.</li>
            <li>You should definitely buy it with all the great ingredients, and is a good price for so much.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best sunscreen out there.  </li>
            <li>He plays soccer and this works fine for him.</li>
            <li>Thicker than store brands but goes on smoothly and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li>The packaging was fine and delivered on time considering that it was coming from the US to Europe.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>Applies smoothly and easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, I agree with all the positive reviews as to nice light smell, easy to put on, etc.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing, well-rated by the EWG, goes on easily, and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>so the rest of my skin is light.</li>
            <li>Not only does this sunscreen work well, it smells great.</li>
            <li>Decided to try some chemical free sunscreen this summer.</li>
            <li>Updates: Confirmed with Thinksport</li>
            <li>This works fabulously.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s important to me, otherwise my boys would never let me put it on them.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s smooth to put on</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>Worth the time for a safe product</li>
            <li>I use it regularly and remain happy with it.</li>
            <li>A light citrus scent and non greasy, non sticky</li>
            <li>For me, I like the light citurs scent.  </li>
            <li>I would not say that the liquid is as smooth as something like Coppertone Ultra Sport Sunscreen, which will soak in somewhat if you forget to rub it in and flows faster.</li>
            <li>I can see how, if you have light skin, it would be almost unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Kept us sunburn free for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I applied this before leaving and the first thing I noticed was it does not spread nicely but instead soaks in rather quickly, so seems to take a lot of product to get your skin covered.</li>
            <li>It has a mild smell, doesn&#x27;t feel or look greasy, doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and is easy to wash off in the shower but stood up to sweat and swimming.</li>
            <li>I was using MD Moms which I love, but this stuff is half the price, works great and also skips the harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>I bought this after doing research to find a less-toxic sunscreen that was also user friendly.</li>
            <li>Most worked pretty well, but they all had their pros and cons.  </li>
            <li>I start from my forehead, nose and the top of my cheeks (the parts that burn first) then spread to the rest of the face.  </li>
            <li>It gets absorbed very quickly leaving my skin feeling moisturized and supple</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve already ordered more for the Spring season and made sure to get one for myself in the adult version.</li>
            <li>This is an OK sunscreen, nothing more special than other big-brand ones, probably not as effective as others.</li>
            <li>As applying sunscreen to children is as enjoyable and easy as bathing a cat i highly recommend getting your kid a one-peice with elbow and knee</li>
            <li>The baby sunscreen is awesome, too, in pretty much all the same ways!</li>
            <li>totally burn free, rubs in great (much better than many of the other chemical free products out there i.e. California Baby), and is well priced.  </li>
            <li>and it smells sweet.</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen but you really have to apply every hour while in the water .  </li>
            <li>Ordering more and really like it.</li>
            <li>It is so nice that my 3 year old dug it out of my bag...</li>
            <li>Consumers should be able to buy safe sunscreens at a reasonable size and at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>I bought it thanks to momma sohn&#x27;s recommendation on youtube :)</li>
            <li>By mid morning, your face feels good not greasy.</li>
            <li>It is good product for kids who like outdoor sport such as a swimming, soccer, baseball or bike.</li>
            <li>As, I say, however, I am coming to the conclusion that this is a problem for all sunscreens using physical blockers, so it would not be fair to penalize this product for that shortcoming (from my point of view).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best smelling, least greasy and easiest to spread of the SPFs we have tried that are rated highest by EWG.</li>
            <li>It has a mild scent (wish it was unscented)</li>
            <li>Most important thing is for me that there is no harsh chemicals because I am a &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; user of sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I use it for my two super fair-skinned kids, as well as myself.</li>
            <li>It does take a bit of work to get it to the point where I am not completely white, however it is worth it to me as I know I am putting good stuff on myself and on my daughter.</li>
            <li>I had been using the Think Baby sunscreen which I just love and decided to try this now that my twins are a bit older.  </li>
            <li>It has a mild fruity smell and does not smell like sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It has high SPF, and it&#x27;s safe to use.</li>
            <li>Overall very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY baby sunscreen that is not only safe with great reviews on safety but doesn&#x27;t burn our baby.</li>
            <li>Also very affordable compared to my second favorite CA Baby and Honest sunscreen.</li>
            <li>yes its a great product, i wish it would cost a bit less money.</li>
            <li>so everything had a halo-like affect (kind of cool in the photo actually, but not what i was looking for!).  </li>
            <li>spreads easily and protects very well</li>
            <li>My son has very sensitive skin and is allergic to most things</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and great for the little kids!!</li>
            <li>Love everything about it so far!</li>
            <li>This will be our go-to sunscreen for next summer for sure!</li>
            <li>if you do not mind the white opaque cast and are more focused on protection,  get this sunblock!</li>
            <li>Very light citrus scent but all natural.</li>
            <li>I especially like this particular version because it&#x27;s great when it&#x27;s really hot</li>
            <li>Great product - easy application, scent isn&#x27;t noticeable by my 4 year old unlike other safer sunscreens on the market.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this sunscreen for our family based on the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>great smell, rubs in well, stays on  for a few hours when Im at the ocean.</li>
            <li>Everything else I&#x27;ve tried just doesn&#x27;t come close, so in my book it&#x27;s totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>It arrived completely separated into water and watery paste and no amount of shaking or stirring was able to reconstitute it.</li>
            <li>My son has sensitive skin and has been using this for more than 2 years now since I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it doesn&#x27;t seem worth it.</li>
            <li>found this brand to be far better than their infant version.</li>
            <li>Finally (and most important of all)</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the switch so far.</li>
            <li>I have bought Badger, Loving Naturals, all the big name naturals.</li>
            <li>It rubs in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of white residue</li>
            <li>I also love the complete lack of fragrance.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I thought to use this on myself before ever trusting it on my 3 month old baby.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>it smells fresh with a hint of citrus.  </li>
            <li>Has a fresh scent -- not perfumy.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I have a friend that uses it and says she likes it better than most due to scent and ability to rub into the skin easier.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old son has platinum hair, very fair skin, and grey eyes (very Swedish)</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t put it on if you plan to take pictures right after...</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply especially to wiggly kids.</li>
            <li>Other sunscreens may be easier to apply and more able to &#x27;disappear,&#x27; but this just seems safer for delicate skin and more effective.  </li>
            <li>Works great, isnt super thick or runny.</li>
            <li>BTW, our 2nd favorite sunscreen is Babo Botanicals (smells amazing and isn&#x27;t as white, but runs off with any moisture)</li>
            <li>It is smooth and not thick.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are clean and mild for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Safe product as tested by ewg.org&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: We have flown through the small tubes, but a safe product is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Although it has good coverage almost like a BB cream, it tends to interfere a little with my powder foundation.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, but must be applied quickly or leaves the white residue.  </li>
            <li>My title says it all - this stuff seems to work great, but I find it hard to spread on my kids.</li>
            <li>Have used so many different products over the years and this one tops them all.</li>
            <li>first sweat brought this lotion out of my skin</li>
            <li>But it rubs in pretty well and prevents sunburn Sooo...</li>
            <li>I tried 4 of the top rated sunscreens when looking for a physical (non-chemical) sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s came out on top and is my only choice now.</li>
            <li>After trying many different sun blockers, this is the one I&#x27;m staying with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend using a different product for the face area (i.e. with more moisture), but the rest of my body appreciates the ThinkSport protection.    </li>
            <li>I also found it to indeed be water resistant as kids went swimming the first time it was used.  </li>
            <li>This might be a newer formulation so double check on the ewg to make sure it still has a 1 rating.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s exactly how it&#x27;s supposed to be.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does exactly what it claims it will do, including the fact that it is waterproof.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, thick sunscreen that is easy to put on and stays in place.</li>
            <li>It is nice and thick, but smooths on easily without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>i mean it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>+ (Three out of the four tubes I received were full of liquid) because I really need a sunscreen to use on vacation and this brand was ranked highly on EWG for its safety.</li>
            <li>My infant has used this on many very sunny days and never once been burned or even red.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this sunscreen based on the positive ratings from the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s (EWG) sunscreen guide.</li>
            <li>Loved this sunscreen over this past summer.  </li>
            <li>Product did have a very nice, subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li>so hes very particular about the sunscreens weve used.  </li>
            <li>The only stuff that is easy to put on body parts with hair are the sprays and there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m ever putting that on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only stuff that is easy to put on body parts with hair are the sprays and there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m ever putting that on me.  </li>
            <li>I like everything about this sunscreen, except that it&#x27;s a little tacky, and doesn&#x27;t smooth on easily (on the face or on the body).</li>
            <li>We applied it as recommended and reapplied after swimming, but it certainly didn&#x27;t act like a 50 spf sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Pretty much the same, fantastic product as the Think Baby</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t shy away just because you have fair skin or burn easily.</li>
            <li>The most important thing to me is that it seems to last a long time through all the sweat and beach water- even on the face!</li>
            <li>I use it on my children, both of whom dislike sunscreen, but are more willing to use it versus other cream sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Worked fine as daily sunscreen, but was not as waterproof as promised.</li>
            <li>It takes a while to spread the ss all over my arms and for it to not be a huge patch of white.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not just this, I noticed that the ss would get over my clothes as well, and also my hair making it really sticky because of the residue on my hands.  </li>
            <li>Stays put all day, very water resistant.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I use it on my whole family, toddler and adults.</li>
            <li>Sunscreen had somehow separated into solids and liquids and no matter how much I shook it, it just would not mix.</li>
            <li>This sunblock goes on smooth and evenly especially for a zinc-based sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Although you have to rub it in really well, it stays on really well.</li>
            <li>This is so much easier than rubbing until it</li>
            <li>This is so much easier than rubbing until it disappears.  </li>
            <li>After much research (including EWG&#x27;s Sunscreen Guide), I chose to buy this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The amount of rub-in determines how much whiteness still appears.    </li>
            <li>I started it using it for the whole family.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of this product and it works really well.</li>
            <li>First full sun weekend with toddlers outside.  </li>
            <li>Trying to find a sunscreen that&#x27;s safe and won&#x27;t irritate my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin (face only).</li>
            <li>like I said only her face is sensitive to most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Rubs in so much better than other zinc versions and the smell is yummy.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty sure all the formulas are about the same (baby, sport, regular)</li>
            <li>This item looks good and serious.</li>
            <li>Smells subtle but really good.</li>
            <li>Also, I appreciate that as I sweat the sunscreen doesn&#x27;t start dripping in streaks down my leg, unlike other more readily-available brands. :-)  </li>
            <li>Mine are very new.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s true that other manufacturers put too much oil, then you get an easy to apply product, but your skin is left very oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On her first day of daycare (today) a friend wanted to keep me busy</li>
            <li>Most sunscreens expire in less than a year.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>My natural skin color is fairly light (not white, caramel-ish)</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s also a tad greasy for facial use, but it absorbs fairly quickly).</li>
            <li>I prefer Blue Lizzard Baby, it has more for the same price.</li>
            <li>Smells decent.</li>
            <li>It has great ingredients and ranks well on the ewg website... but having said that it also doesn&#x27;t rub in very well and is expensive.</li>
            <li>Assuming I have a short sleeve shirt, I now apply it on my arms, getting more sunscreen if necessary.  </li>
            <li>Assuming I have a short sleeve shirt, I now apply it on my arms, getting more sunscreen if necessary.  </li>
            <li>I would particularly recommend it for kids or anyone out in the sun all day.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m willing to see a little white on skin if it protects their skin (and my own).  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>high zinc %</li>
            <li>and if you have a little more color to your skin).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few sunscreens looking for one with safer ingredients than most have.</li>
            <li>While a dermatologist suggested the zinc oxide amount was higher than necessary, it still seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>This aspect should be expected since apparently avoiding this issue may introduce more risk on the nanoparticle level.</li>
            <li>Small size makes it easy to tote!</li>
            <li>very consistent&lt;br /&gt;5) Priced lower than many other physical sunscreens&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this because it rubs in pretty nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a thick white paste all of your skin.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;ve found my new go-to sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent like some other natural sunscreens.</li>
            <li>The fact that it makes me smell slightly fruity but not overly sweet is a bonus!</li>
            <li>It has a really nice, subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li>I like the Thinksport Sunscreens for my kids because they are one of the few lines out there that have more natural ingredients in them.</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewers that the white color is very light.  </li>
            <li>Works well on very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very sensitive skin and has no problems at all with ThinkSport.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to everyone no matter how light or dark they are.</li>
            <li>I was really interested in this product, because of the article on livestrong, but obviously they are gaining from it, so of course their article is biased.</li>
            <li>Here is a tip to help make this sunscreen rub in easier and not leave a white residue: apply coconut oil to your skin first and let it soak in for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Not sure what the difference is, but I like the child version more.</li>
            <li>Finally a natural sunscreen that works and doesn&#x27;t make you look like a ghost!</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s still visible in some spots, I just spread it out a bit more, again, not trying to make it disappear, and then do the same for the other places I applied.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s still visible in some spots, I just spread it out a bit more, again, not trying to make it disappear, and then do the same for the other places I applied.  </li>
            <li>- Better bang for the buck as compared to other \\&quot;safe\\&quot; sunscreens, since the tube is double or triple their size.  </li>
            <li>We ended up purchasing about one tube per month, but since we only need this about three months out of the year the extra expense seemed totally worth it to know I wasn&#x27;t covering my family in chemicals!</li>
            <li>I used MY normal SPF 15 lotion from another company on my face and the only thing that got slightly burnt was my nose (because I sweat there the most) and</li>
            <li>This is very thick sunscreen that provides great coverage but has a strange smell - almost like citrus.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that the film is not very heavy and fades after some time, important given we are African American.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and does not leave the greasy heavy feeling</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very active person in the summer, as I enjoy whacking tennis balls across blazing-hot courts.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s more of a slight purple tint that results after that time instead of white.</li>
            <li>This is a great product rated tops with the ewg.org, but it&#x27;s very small and will not last very long having 2 kids and living in CA where we wear sunscreen every day.</li>
            <li>This time I actually opened the seal to check how much liquid was in there.</li>
            <li>Much thicker than Blue Lizard Sunscreen which I also tested this summer.</li>
            <li>I am very diligent about sunscreen and I am floored over how it is as if she wasn&#x27;t wearing any at in during the 7 hour we were outside.</li>
            <li>Because this sunscreen uses natural barrier ingredients like zinc and titanium dioxide, it will leave a whitish cast on your skin</li>
            <li>BTW, I don&#x27;t see much difference between the different varieties of ThinkSport/Thinkbaby, etc.</li>
            <li>I only gave it a 4 because it doesn&#x27;t really spread well</li>
            <li>Its not heavy</li>
            <li>My son gets skin eruptions when he goes in any level of direct sunlight.</li>
            <li>This helps him completely.</li>
            <li>With a two-year old, this is a must.</li>
            <li>Sensitive skin in my family &amp; no rashes is the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t leave much sticky residue, and there are not clumpy white bits.  </li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Natural and non</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after seeing a posting from EWG about the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>because I completely forgot to put ANYTHING on them).</li>
            <li>(my 17 month old son can get thru application without running off, squirming or screaming...</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time, and even in the water (I&#x27;m an avid surfer)  </li>
            <li>Started using this on my 1 year old and 3 year old...and then myself.  </li>
            <li>But got this adult version and over 1/2 the container was just liquid.</li>
            <li>As some of you may know, getting a 3 year old to stand still</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought 3 tubes so far and for each one the expiry was around 2 years from when I got it.  </li>
            <li>It is all natural and doesn&#x27;t pollute the ocean.</li>
            <li>Used it on our 3, 5, 9 year old boys and ourselves for 2 weeks in FL in July.  </li>
            <li>This seems to work as well as any chemical-laden name brand on my 6 year old</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s the trade-off for a natural product.</li>
            <li>Again, I don&#x27;t worry too much about the white yet, just get it evenly and make sure there isn&#x27;t a thick amount anywhere.  </li>
            <li>Again, I don&#x27;t worry too much about the white yet, just get it evenly and make sure there isn&#x27;t a thick amount anywhere.  </li>
            <li>It was good to know that I wasn&#x27;t putting questionable or understudied chemicals on their skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think protection from the sun should mean that you should accumulate more harmful chemicals in your body instead.    </li>
            <li>I love this and have been using it for the past two summers!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold up very long when you are consistently swimming .</li>
            <li>Unless you put too much, the white will have disappeared or at least faded significantly!  </li>
            <li>Unless you put too much, the white will have disappeared or at least faded significantly!  </li>
            <li>I use a small amount, and it does fine.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this one is my favorite, and I&#x27;ve tried a few!</li>
            <li>I could wear it while hiking or surfing or for daily use when I want more protection than my usual 30+ spf.</li>
            <li>We have used the tube I just purchased on multiple occasions, in water, out of water, on myself, husband, and children, and we&#x27;ve all gotten mild burns with even minimal sun exposure.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the white color gets on things like the stroller however I am assuming this happens with all high quality and safe sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I first thought it was temporary, but my face looked white all day long.</li>
            <li>It is thick but can be rubbed in easily.</li>
            <li>My sun burn usually skips the getting red phase and moves directly onto the swollen itchy rash filled phase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not extremely greasy and will disappear if you blend well.</li>
            <li>can be a MAJOR challenge.  </li>
            <li>Good product, a little hard to rub in but definitely does the job.</li>
            <li>well although in general I stay out of the sun and have not gotten burnt.  </li>
            <li>As with all zinc oxide sunscreens it will protect only those areas it is directly applied to.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried quite  a few brands that are free from the questionable ingredients in most mainstream sunscreens.</li>
            <li>My family of four with very different skin tones, ALL BURNED after applying it frequently.</li>
            <li>My son has eczema and this is the only one (so far) that doesn&#x27;t make him flare up.</li>
            <li>This is the only lotion that doesn&#x27;t seem to break my 3 year old daughter out when we apply it to her.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old finally stopped screaming during sunscreen application!</li>
            <li>It goes on well, a little white but rubs in quickly</li>
            <li>Oh, another thing to note is that though it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, it could leave prints on shiny dark surfaces such as the laptop I&#x27;m using right now.</li>
            <li>We skipped the beach altogether last year because he was only months old but also because I was weary about putting sunscreen on him at such a young age.</li>
            <li>Seriously, if the sun threw itself at her, I could bet my anual paycheck that the sun would bounce off of the very visible shield on her skin and land right back into orbit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read other reviews saying as much but gave the product the benefit of the doubt.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that it&#x27;s not oil free.</li>
            <li>While the rub-in action doesn&#x27;t take incredibly long, I have missed spots when rushed.</li>
            <li>and after a few hours in the sun, I didn&#x27;t burn nor did I feel my skin getting hot.</li>
            <li>well, unless you&#x27;re into the pale skin look ;)</li>
            <li>It might seem a little greasy at first, but after I put on my makeup, I blot it with toilet paper which removes a lot of the greasiness.  </li>
            <li>However my primary complaint is that this thing is super greasy, kind of difficult to spread, and difficult to blend.  </li>

            <li> So far so good!!</li>

            <li> Love Love Love!  </li>
            <li> After spending way too many hours on the internets searching for an effective and safe sunscreen  </li>
            <li> We have tried dozens of the top ewg rated sunscreens and this is by far the best for any sport or water activities.</li>
            <li> Our favorite natural sunscreen, works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I love this product and am thrilled I finally found the perfect sunscreen.</li>
            <li> They also seem to like as I haven&#x27;t gotten any complaints about eyes burning--which is great ;-)</li>
            <li> It is very light, however, so</li>
            <li> I have even used it on my 13-month old with very fair skin.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
            <li> buy Livestrong :-)</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-greasy and provides wonderful coverage without that white sunscreen look (I&#x27;m medium-light skin tone).</li>
            <li> it helps support cancer research :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic.</li>
            <li> (much more noticeable once you jump in the water</li>
            <li> I try to avoid chemical sunscreens, so we have tried lots of zinc sunscreens - most of them with a toothpaste-like consistency.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and my kids never get burned.</li>
            <li> We have been searching for a more healthy sunscreen for our family.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have found this stuff.</li>
            <li> Makes me wonder if having a zinc deficiency makes one more prone to sunburn.</li>
            <li> Most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products have proven to be overpriced and ineffective.  </li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> We love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> so i know its safe for my kids.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s water resistant,</li>
            <li> Need I say more.</li>
            <li> it has a nice light scent that is not overwpowering.  </li>
            <li> Kids love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also incredibly effective, perhaps because it&#x27;s easier to apply the appropriate amount, and with re-application keeps my ghost-pale skin burn free.</li>
            <li> Though in fairness, we did spend most of our time in shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Out of three sunscreens I tried on vacation to mexico, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> one was my favorite choice:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the smell and</li>
            <li> Probably my favorite of the safer sunblocks, and yes, we did check the toxicity levels on the ewg website.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is why I love this brand.  </li>
            <li> you aren&#x27;t sold yet, here are more reasons to love this product:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I get more sunscreen and then get my neck and ears.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll appreciate it in your 60s.  :)</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love the scent-</li>
            <li> kids are allergic to many sunscreen ingredients and this one did not cause them any irritation.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by cheap brands, this stuff is it!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> But overall, this sunscreen is excellent, and I don&#x27;t have any complaints about it!</li>
            <li> Tried this because of EWG&#x27;s recommendation for a safe sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and has a nice, not overpowering, scent.</li>
            <li> Nice light scent.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Pretty much the best option there is for kids in terms of safety &amp; protection.</li>
            <li> Has a great sort of grapefruity smell that my 4 yr old really likes, good, effective coverage.</li>
            <li> I feel they got the perfect balance so that it applies easy enough and isn&#x27;t too oily.  </li>
            <li> Since I use it on my face sometimes, for high-level protection on hot, bright summer days, I add just a pinch of moisturizing lotion into the sunscreen before I apply it.</li>
            <li> This makes my beautiful brown-skinned six year old daughter appear as though she had a flour soak-bath.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how easily it blends in.</li>
            <li> Great product so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other sunscreen products, and this is great --and inexpensive in comparison!</li>
            <li> Then apply Thinksport afterward, it will go on creamy, smooth, and absorb better.</li>
            <li> It is rated as safe by the EWG yearly report on sunscreens, and is mineral based, which is important to me.</li>
            <li> and you have to really rub it in good</li>
            <li> Easy to spread and get on...works perfect - had minimal sunburns this summer.  </li>
            <li> think I need to find a different ss that provides as good protection, but not so greasy and clingy!  </li>
            <li> and I am grateful this didn&#x27;t happen to my sweet baby!</li>
            <li> I tan really easily</li>
            <li> It blends in easily and doesn&#x27;t make us look like ghosts</li>
            <li> to apply as it doesn&#x27;t easily apply evenly on skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply</li>
            <li> ThinkSport blends in easily and doesn&#x27;t make my kids look like ghosts.  </li>
            <li> My daughters and I burn easily, and this prevented it after hours on the beach.</li>
            <li> b/c rubbing this chalky zinc stuff in is work, although I have to say this is more easily absorbed into the skin than most ewg.org recommended sunscreens.</li>
            <li> You just have to clean your items more after use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy of use.</li>
            <li> ) Goes on easy and smooth&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>

            <li> - Fairly easy to rub in.</li>
            <li> Easy to rub in, no ghost like appearances.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and apply.</li>
            <li> Safe, works wonderfully, and safe to use on my sweet little girl.</li>
            <li> You should definitely buy it with all the great ingredients, and is a good price for so much.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best sunscreen out there.  </li>
            <li> He plays soccer and this works fine for him.</li>
            <li> Thicker than store brands but goes on smoothly and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li> The packaging was fine and delivered on time considering that it was coming from the US to Europe.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li> Applies smoothly and easily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, I agree with all the positive reviews as to nice light smell, easy to put on, etc.  </li>
            <li> Smells amazing, well-rated by the EWG, goes on easily, and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> so the rest of my skin is light.</li>
            <li> Not only does this sunscreen work well, it smells great.</li>
            <li> Decided to try some chemical free sunscreen this summer.</li>
            <li> Updates: Confirmed with Thinksport</li>
            <li> This works fabulously.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s important to me, otherwise my boys would never let me put it on them.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s smooth to put on</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> applies smoothly.</li>
            <li> Worth the time for a safe product</li>
            <li> I use it regularly and remain happy with it.</li>
            <li> A light citrus scent and non greasy, non sticky</li>
            <li> For me, I like the light citurs scent.  </li>
            <li> I would not say that the liquid is as smooth as something like Coppertone Ultra Sport Sunscreen, which will soak in somewhat if you forget to rub it in and flows faster.</li>
            <li> I can see how, if you have light skin, it would be almost unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Kept us sunburn free for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I applied this before leaving and the first thing I noticed was it does not spread nicely but instead soaks in rather quickly, so seems to take a lot of product to get your skin covered.</li>
            <li> It has a mild smell, doesn&#x27;t feel or look greasy, doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and is easy to wash off in the shower but stood up to sweat and swimming.</li>
            <li> I was using MD Moms which I love, but this stuff is half the price, works great and also skips the harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I bought this after doing research to find a less-toxic sunscreen that was also user friendly.</li>
            <li> Most worked pretty well, but they all had their pros and cons.  </li>
            <li> I start from my forehead, nose and the top of my cheeks (the parts that burn first) then spread to the rest of the face.  </li>
            <li> It gets absorbed very quickly leaving my skin feeling moisturized and supple</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve already ordered more for the Spring season and made sure to get one for myself in the adult version.</li>
            <li> This is an OK sunscreen, nothing more special than other big-brand ones, probably not as effective as others.</li>
            <li> As applying sunscreen to children is as enjoyable and easy as bathing a cat i highly recommend getting your kid a one-peice with elbow and knee</li>
            <li> The baby sunscreen is awesome, too, in pretty much all the same ways!</li>
            <li> totally burn free, rubs in great (much better than many of the other chemical free products out there i.e. California Baby), and is well priced.  </li>
            <li> and it smells sweet.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen but you really have to apply every hour while in the water .  </li>
            <li> Ordering more and really like it.</li>
            <li> It is so nice that my 3 year old dug it out of my bag...</li>
            <li> Consumers should be able to buy safe sunscreens at a reasonable size and at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> I bought it thanks to momma sohn&#x27;s recommendation on youtube :)</li>
            <li> By mid morning, your face feels good not greasy.</li>
            <li> It is good product for kids who like outdoor sport such as a swimming, soccer, baseball or bike.</li>
            <li> As, I say, however, I am coming to the conclusion that this is a problem for all sunscreens using physical blockers, so it would not be fair to penalize this product for that shortcoming (from my point of view).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The best smelling, least greasy and easiest to spread of the SPFs we have tried that are rated highest by EWG.</li>
            <li> It has a mild scent (wish it was unscented)</li>
            <li> Most important thing is for me that there is no harsh chemicals because I am a &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; user of sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I use it for my two super fair-skinned kids, as well as myself.</li>
            <li> It does take a bit of work to get it to the point where I am not completely white, however it is worth it to me as I know I am putting good stuff on myself and on my daughter.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Think Baby sunscreen which I just love and decided to try this now that my twins are a bit older.  </li>
            <li> It has a mild fruity smell and does not smell like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It has high SPF, and it&#x27;s safe to use.</li>
            <li> Overall very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY baby sunscreen that is not only safe with great reviews on safety but doesn&#x27;t burn our baby.</li>
            <li> Also very affordable compared to my second favorite CA Baby and Honest sunscreen.</li>
            <li> yes its a great product, i wish it would cost a bit less money.</li>
            <li> so everything had a halo-like affect (kind of cool in the photo actually, but not what i was looking for!).  </li>
            <li> spreads easily and protects very well</li>
            <li> My son has very sensitive skin and is allergic to most things</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and great for the little kids!!</li>
            <li> Love everything about it so far!</li>
            <li> This will be our go-to sunscreen for next summer for sure!</li>
            <li> if you do not mind the white opaque cast and are more focused on protection,  get this sunblock!</li>
            <li> Very light citrus scent but all natural.</li>
            <li> I especially like this particular version because it&#x27;s great when it&#x27;s really hot</li>
            <li> Great product - easy application, scent isn&#x27;t noticeable by my 4 year old unlike other safer sunscreens on the market.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this sunscreen for our family based on the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> great smell, rubs in well, stays on  for a few hours when Im at the ocean.</li>
            <li> Everything else I&#x27;ve tried just doesn&#x27;t come close, so in my book it&#x27;s totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> It arrived completely separated into water and watery paste and no amount of shaking or stirring was able to reconstitute it.</li>
            <li> My son has sensitive skin and has been using this for more than 2 years now since I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it doesn&#x27;t seem worth it.</li>
            <li> found this brand to be far better than their infant version.</li>
            <li> Finally (and most important of all)</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with the switch so far.</li>
            <li> I have bought Badger, Loving Naturals, all the big name naturals.</li>
            <li> It rubs in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of white residue</li>
            <li> I also love the complete lack of fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I thought to use this on myself before ever trusting it on my 3 month old baby.</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> it smells fresh with a hint of citrus.  </li>
            <li> Has a fresh scent -- not perfumy.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have a friend that uses it and says she likes it better than most due to scent and ability to rub into the skin easier.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old son has platinum hair, very fair skin, and grey eyes (very Swedish)</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t put it on if you plan to take pictures right after...</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply especially to wiggly kids.</li>
            <li> Other sunscreens may be easier to apply and more able to &#x27;disappear,&#x27; but this just seems safer for delicate skin and more effective.  </li>
            <li> Works great, isnt super thick or runny.</li>
            <li> BTW, our 2nd favorite sunscreen is Babo Botanicals (smells amazing and isn&#x27;t as white, but runs off with any moisture)</li>
            <li> It is smooth and not thick.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are clean and mild for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Safe product as tested by ewg.org&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: We have flown through the small tubes, but a safe product is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Although it has good coverage almost like a BB cream, it tends to interfere a little with my powder foundation.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, but must be applied quickly or leaves the white residue.  </li>
            <li> My title says it all - this stuff seems to work great, but I find it hard to spread on my kids.</li>
            <li> Have used so many different products over the years and this one tops them all.</li>
            <li> first sweat brought this lotion out of my skin</li>
            <li> But it rubs in pretty well and prevents sunburn Sooo...</li>
            <li> I tried 4 of the top rated sunscreens when looking for a physical (non-chemical) sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s came out on top and is my only choice now.</li>
            <li> After trying many different sun blockers, this is the one I&#x27;m staying with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend using a different product for the face area (i.e. with more moisture), but the rest of my body appreciates the ThinkSport protection.    </li>
            <li> I also found it to indeed be water resistant as kids went swimming the first time it was used.  </li>
            <li> This might be a newer formulation so double check on the ewg to make sure it still has a 1 rating.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s exactly how it&#x27;s supposed to be.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does exactly what it claims it will do, including the fact that it is waterproof.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, thick sunscreen that is easy to put on and stays in place.</li>
            <li> It is nice and thick, but smooths on easily without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> i mean it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> + (Three out of the four tubes I received were full of liquid) because I really need a sunscreen to use on vacation and this brand was ranked highly on EWG for its safety.</li>
            <li> My infant has used this on many very sunny days and never once been burned or even red.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this sunscreen based on the positive ratings from the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s (EWG) sunscreen guide.</li>
            <li> Loved this sunscreen over this past summer.  </li>
            <li> Product did have a very nice, subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li> so hes very particular about the sunscreens weve used.  </li>
            <li> The only stuff that is easy to put on body parts with hair are the sprays and there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m ever putting that on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only stuff that is easy to put on body parts with hair are the sprays and there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m ever putting that on me.  </li>
            <li> I like everything about this sunscreen, except that it&#x27;s a little tacky, and doesn&#x27;t smooth on easily (on the face or on the body).</li>
            <li> We applied it as recommended and reapplied after swimming, but it certainly didn&#x27;t act like a 50 spf sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Pretty much the same, fantastic product as the Think Baby</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t shy away just because you have fair skin or burn easily.</li>
            <li> The most important thing to me is that it seems to last a long time through all the sweat and beach water- even on the face!</li>
            <li> I use it on my children, both of whom dislike sunscreen, but are more willing to use it versus other cream sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Worked fine as daily sunscreen, but was not as waterproof as promised.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to spread the ss all over my arms and for it to not be a huge patch of white.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not just this, I noticed that the ss would get over my clothes as well, and also my hair making it really sticky because of the residue on my hands.  </li>
            <li> Stays put all day, very water resistant.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I use it on my whole family, toddler and adults.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen had somehow separated into solids and liquids and no matter how much I shook it, it just would not mix.</li>
            <li> This sunblock goes on smooth and evenly especially for a zinc-based sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Although you have to rub it in really well, it stays on really well.</li>
            <li> This is so much easier than rubbing until it</li>
            <li> This is so much easier than rubbing until it disappears.  </li>
            <li> After much research (including EWG&#x27;s Sunscreen Guide), I chose to buy this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The amount of rub-in determines how much whiteness still appears.    </li>
            <li> I started it using it for the whole family.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this product and it works really well.</li>
            <li> First full sun weekend with toddlers outside.  </li>
            <li> Trying to find a sunscreen that&#x27;s safe and won&#x27;t irritate my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin (face only).</li>
            <li> like I said only her face is sensitive to most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Rubs in so much better than other zinc versions and the smell is yummy.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty sure all the formulas are about the same (baby, sport, regular)</li>
            <li> This item looks good and serious.</li>
            <li> Smells subtle but really good.</li>
            <li> Also, I appreciate that as I sweat the sunscreen doesn&#x27;t start dripping in streaks down my leg, unlike other more readily-available brands. :-)  </li>
            <li> Mine are very new.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s true that other manufacturers put too much oil, then you get an easy to apply product, but your skin is left very oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On her first day of daycare (today) a friend wanted to keep me busy</li>
            <li> Most sunscreens expire in less than a year.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> My natural skin color is fairly light (not white, caramel-ish)</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s also a tad greasy for facial use, but it absorbs fairly quickly).</li>
            <li> I prefer Blue Lizzard Baby, it has more for the same price.</li>
            <li> Smells decent.</li>
            <li> It has great ingredients and ranks well on the ewg website... but having said that it also doesn&#x27;t rub in very well and is expensive.</li>
            <li> Assuming I have a short sleeve shirt, I now apply it on my arms, getting more sunscreen if necessary.  </li>
            <li> Assuming I have a short sleeve shirt, I now apply it on my arms, getting more sunscreen if necessary.  </li>
            <li> I would particularly recommend it for kids or anyone out in the sun all day.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m willing to see a little white on skin if it protects their skin (and my own).  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> high zinc %</li>
            <li> and if you have a little more color to your skin).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few sunscreens looking for one with safer ingredients than most have.</li>
            <li> While a dermatologist suggested the zinc oxide amount was higher than necessary, it still seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> This aspect should be expected since apparently avoiding this issue may introduce more risk on the nanoparticle level.</li>
            <li> Small size makes it easy to tote!</li>
            <li> very consistent&lt;br /&gt;5) Priced lower than many other physical sunscreens&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this because it rubs in pretty nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a thick white paste all of your skin.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I&#x27;ve found my new go-to sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent like some other natural sunscreens.</li>
            <li> The fact that it makes me smell slightly fruity but not overly sweet is a bonus!</li>
            <li> It has a really nice, subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li> I like the Thinksport Sunscreens for my kids because they are one of the few lines out there that have more natural ingredients in them.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers that the white color is very light.  </li>
            <li> Works well on very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin and has no problems at all with ThinkSport.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone no matter how light or dark they are.</li>
            <li> I was really interested in this product, because of the article on livestrong, but obviously they are gaining from it, so of course their article is biased.</li>
            <li> Here is a tip to help make this sunscreen rub in easier and not leave a white residue: apply coconut oil to your skin first and let it soak in for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the difference is, but I like the child version more.</li>
            <li> Finally a natural sunscreen that works and doesn&#x27;t make you look like a ghost!</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s still visible in some spots, I just spread it out a bit more, again, not trying to make it disappear, and then do the same for the other places I applied.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s still visible in some spots, I just spread it out a bit more, again, not trying to make it disappear, and then do the same for the other places I applied.  </li>
            <li> - Better bang for the buck as compared to other \\&quot;safe\\&quot; sunscreens, since the tube is double or triple their size.  </li>
            <li> We ended up purchasing about one tube per month, but since we only need this about three months out of the year the extra expense seemed totally worth it to know I wasn&#x27;t covering my family in chemicals!</li>
            <li> I used MY normal SPF 15 lotion from another company on my face and the only thing that got slightly burnt was my nose (because I sweat there the most) and</li>
            <li> This is very thick sunscreen that provides great coverage but has a strange smell - almost like citrus.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that the film is not very heavy and fades after some time, important given we are African American.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply and does not leave the greasy heavy feeling</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very active person in the summer, as I enjoy whacking tennis balls across blazing-hot courts.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s more of a slight purple tint that results after that time instead of white.</li>
            <li> This is a great product rated tops with the ewg.org, but it&#x27;s very small and will not last very long having 2 kids and living in CA where we wear sunscreen every day.</li>
            <li> This time I actually opened the seal to check how much liquid was in there.</li>
            <li> Much thicker than Blue Lizard Sunscreen which I also tested this summer.</li>
            <li> I am very diligent about sunscreen and I am floored over how it is as if she wasn&#x27;t wearing any at in during the 7 hour we were outside.</li>
            <li> Because this sunscreen uses natural barrier ingredients like zinc and titanium dioxide, it will leave a whitish cast on your skin</li>
            <li> BTW, I don&#x27;t see much difference between the different varieties of ThinkSport/Thinkbaby, etc.</li>
            <li> I only gave it a 4 because it doesn&#x27;t really spread well</li>
            <li> Its not heavy</li>
            <li> My son gets skin eruptions when he goes in any level of direct sunlight.</li>
            <li> This helps him completely.</li>
            <li> With a two-year old, this is a must.</li>
            <li> Sensitive skin in my family &amp; no rashes is the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t leave much sticky residue, and there are not clumpy white bits.  </li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Natural and non</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after seeing a posting from EWG about the natural ingredients.</li>

            <li> (my 17 month old son can get thru application without running off, squirming or screaming...</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, and even in the water (I&#x27;m an avid surfer)  </li>
            <li> Started using this on my 1 year old and 3 year old...and then myself.  </li>
            <li> But got this adult version and over 1/2 the container was just liquid.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 tubes so far and for each one the expiry was around 2 years from when I got it.  </li>
            <li> It is all natural and doesn&#x27;t pollute the ocean.</li>
            <li> Used it on our 3, 5, 9 year old boys and ourselves for 2 weeks in FL in July.  </li>
            <li> This seems to work as well as any chemical-laden name brand on my 6 year old</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s the trade-off for a natural product.</li>
            <li> Again, I don&#x27;t worry too much about the white yet, just get it evenly and make sure there isn&#x27;t a thick amount anywhere.  </li>
            <li> Again, I don&#x27;t worry too much about the white yet, just get it evenly and make sure there isn&#x27;t a thick amount anywhere.  </li>
            <li> It was good to know that I wasn&#x27;t putting questionable or understudied chemicals on their skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think protection from the sun should mean that you should accumulate more harmful chemicals in your body instead.    </li>
            <li> I love this and have been using it for the past two summers!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold up very long when you are consistently swimming .</li>
            <li> Unless you put too much, the white will have disappeared or at least faded significantly!  </li>
            <li> Unless you put too much, the white will have disappeared or at least faded significantly!  </li>
            <li> I use a small amount, and it does fine.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this one is my favorite, and I&#x27;ve tried a few!</li>
            <li> I could wear it while hiking or surfing or for daily use when I want more protection than my usual 30+ spf.</li>
            <li> We have used the tube I just purchased on multiple occasions, in water, out of water, on myself, husband, and children, and we&#x27;ve all gotten mild burns with even minimal sun exposure.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the white color gets on things like the stroller however I am assuming this happens with all high quality and safe sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I first thought it was temporary, but my face looked white all day long.</li>
            <li> It is thick but can be rubbed in easily.</li>
            <li> My sun burn usually skips the getting red phase and moves directly onto the swollen itchy rash filled phase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not extremely greasy and will disappear if you blend well.</li>
            <li> can be a MAJOR challenge.  </li>
            <li> Good product, a little hard to rub in but definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> well although in general I stay out of the sun and have not gotten burnt.  </li>
            <li> As with all zinc oxide sunscreens it will protect only those areas it is directly applied to.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried quite  a few brands that are free from the questionable ingredients in most mainstream sunscreens.</li>
            <li> My family of four with very different skin tones, ALL BURNED after applying it frequently.</li>
            <li> My son has eczema and this is the only one (so far) that doesn&#x27;t make him flare up.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that doesn&#x27;t seem to break my 3 year old daughter out when we apply it to her.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old finally stopped screaming during sunscreen application!</li>
            <li> It goes on well, a little white but rubs in quickly</li>
            <li> Oh, another thing to note is that though it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, it could leave prints on shiny dark surfaces such as the laptop I&#x27;m using right now.</li>
            <li> We skipped the beach altogether last year because he was only months old but also because I was weary about putting sunscreen on him at such a young age.</li>
            <li> Seriously, if the sun threw itself at her, I could bet my anual paycheck that the sun would bounce off of the very visible shield on her skin and land right back into orbit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read other reviews saying as much but gave the product the benefit of the doubt.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it&#x27;s not oil free.</li>
            <li> While the rub-in action doesn&#x27;t take incredibly long, I have missed spots when rushed.</li>
            <li> and after a few hours in the sun, I didn&#x27;t burn nor did I feel my skin getting hot.</li>
            <li> well, unless you&#x27;re into the pale skin look ;)</li>
            <li> It might seem a little greasy at first, but after I put on my makeup, I blot it with toilet paper which removes a lot of the greasiness.  </li>
            <li> However my primary complaint is that this thing is super greasy, kind of difficult to spread, and difficult to blend.  </li>
            <li> It is thick, so it takes a bit of rubbing to go on, but I figure that&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> Works very well, spreads easily, not greasy (maybe just a bit) nor gritty.</li>
            <li> Not as oily and chalky as other natural sunscreens.</li>
            <li> have the adult version and prefer this one to the other.</li>
            <li> This product is very difficult to rub in, especially with any kind of hair (eyebrows, facial hair, etc).</li>
            <li> the price is quite reasonable - sunscreens are generally pretty expensive</li>
            <li> I use it on my body, as it is a little thick for daily wear on my face, but it does the job, and I appreciate that it is free of octibenzones.  </li>
            <li> the past we&#x27;ve used the Seventh Generation Wee-Generation sunscreen and really, really like it.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s long lasting I guess?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick though.</li>
            <li> well, they fight me less than with the other ones that I really have to rub, rub, rub to blend into their skin.  </li>
            <li> However, the big big plus is it can be used at Cancun parks such as Xplor and Xcaret, etc., where almost all other US brands are not permitted.</li>
            <li> now have to apply this on arms and back of hands, then carefully wash just the palm side of my hands to get rid of the ss on my palm but still leave it on the back of my hands for protection.  </li>
            <li> It spreads well enough but it doesn&#x27;t rub in leaving a white sheen to my skin, making me look purple since I have a pink undertone.</li>
            <li> and you are left completely unprotected because you left your big jug of sunscreen at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have a hard time applying this sunblocker or others, here&#x27;s how I apply it:&lt;br /&gt;Put</li>
            <li> The fact that it does not contain dangerous chemicals makes it all that much better.</li>
            <li> long sleeves with Spf 50</li>
            <li> Non greesey and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> ive tested this on long days at the beach</li>
            <li> I used this product all summer long</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time before you need to reapply.  </li>
            <li> It is super thick going on, so remember a little can go a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have found that the product is only slightly greasy upon initial application.</li>
            <li> My  husband seemed to have trouble getting it completely rubbed in around his facial hair, but other than looking a bit &amp;#34;pale&amp;#34; this didn&#x27;t seem to affect the performance of the product.</li>
            <li> Worked all summers for kids and adults with lots of outdoor pool, beach and other outside time.</li>
            <li> I would use other physical sunscreens before buying this one (sush as BurnOut kids).</li>
            <li> and you definitely need to take a shower and/or bathe your kids immediately after using this product due to its thickness and metallic smell.</li>
            <li> Effective but a little difficult to spread !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obviously pricier than your average sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I tried a few different safe sunscreens and was really unhappy with how clumpy they were.  </li>
            <li> Yes,  it&#x27;s thick and white and even if you rub it in well,  there is occasionally some residue left.  </li>
            <li> and my kids have never burned &amp; barely tan with just a few reapplications.  </li>
            <li> It is essential to rub in the product to cut down on some of the whiteness (or in my case, sometimes purple sheen).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a sunscreen with a dry feel to it, get this one!</li>
            <li> I have tried several other non-chemical sunscreens and prefer this one due to</li>
            <li> It is a little thick but as expected with any non poisonous sunscreen ;)</li>
            <li> ( I have very dry skin - people with oily skin may find it greasy).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other natural sun blockers in the past and still burnt.  </li>
            <li> No matter what others may claim as &#x27;unscented&#x27;, they always have a certain odor to them which I am tired of.  </li>
            <li> only need a little bit and spread it.</li>
            <li> With tanned skin, a little hard to completely rub in and get the white out.  </li>
            <li> When these manufacturers start making natural sunscreens at $8 for at least 8 oz., then perhaps I&#x27;ll increase my rating.</li>
            <li> My kids get really pink on the cheeks, nose, and ears.</li>
            <li> Endures even when wet longer than I thought.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a bit greasy (the reason for 4 stars instead of 5), so for everyday wear</li>
            <li> We spent 2 hours at the beach</li>
            <li> Never a burn, not even pink.</li>
            <li> We did four days of theme parks...getting wet, drying off, getting wet again and so on.</li>
            <li> and we did not have one day of pink skin.  </li>
            <li> We spent hours a day on the beach with no burns.  </li>
            <li> We spent an entire week at the beach and slathered him up in this everyday.</li>
            <li> I have a pale white skin and it makes my skin even toned and protects well.</li>
            <li> It is white and you have to rub in but it takes less rubbing than all the other brands I&#x27;ve tried!  </li>
            <li> I ususally stock up in the spring so that my little ones can frolic outdoors all summer long without worry.  </li>
            <li> The other sunscreens I have tried (The ones marked 2 or below on EWG - like badger) are very difficult to rub on and leave that whitish cast that is very visible on my brown skin.</li>
            <li> My bottle has black letters not light blue letters.</li>
            <li> I checked other 3 unopened tubes.</li>
            <li> I used it too and it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes when I sweat like other sunscreens do.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is easier to apply than any other barrier sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it&#x27;s a small bottle and pricy.  </li>
            <li> First of all the product is expensive for the size.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well and truly is waterproof (within reason, of course).  </li>
            <li> also think the coverage is weaker than the chemical-based sunscreens, so be warned and don&#x27;t use it in extreme conditions like I did: hiking a canyon in Australia in 45 Celcius heat.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re active and sweating (i.e. at baseball or tennis).</li>
            <li> Other reviewers said this is one of the less &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; zinc oxide sunscreens, and I have to agree.</li>
            <li> Its kind of expensive and has a little bit of a weird odor.</li>
            <li> It got so bad when i was leaving huge greasiness on my phone and then got the grease over my phone&#x27;s camera lense</li>
            <li> and I can get really dark.</li>
            <li> I have dark skin and this lotion leaves me looking like a ghost.</li>
            <li> Unlike the chemical sunscreens which will always be easier to apply, last longer, this one does need to be reapplied every few hours as all zinc oxide based sunscreens do, but I found that this one stayed on longer without being excessively sticky.  </li>
            <li> I hate most sunscreens leave then looking like ghost .</li>
            <li> The yummy orangesicle smell kept my son standing still while I slathered him down.  </li>
            <li> It has slight citrus scent</li>
            <li> Looking for an alternative from the typical sunscreen that is loaded with chemicals.  </li>
            <li> They were very active in the water and sweating throughout the day, but this seemed to hold up well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not full of toxins.</li>
            <li> I did get a little tan but no redness or sunburn over the course of 3 days at the lake.</li>
            <li> It does seem a little greasy.</li>
            <li> My son is a little redhead</li>
            <li> This tube will likely be gone after two months of judicious use (late June to late August 2012).  </li>
            <li> However to my disappointment I cannot find a reasonable price quality product in the quantity I need for my kids everyday use.  </li>
            <li> just buy a few at a time-</li>
            <li> I followed the EWG&#x27;s rating and tried a few brands.</li>
            <li> Rubs in smoothly  - no greasy feel.</li>
            <li> have used this as well, under my makeup for an everyday sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It spreads almost as well as a chemical sunscreen - you need to rub it in a few seconds longer, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Wasted product.</li>
            <li> Not a huge bottle.</li>
            <li> I am quite pale as are my children</li>
            <li> Although a little expensive, I&#x27;ll pay the extra knowing</li>
            <li> Some were a little sticky or thick, some were not as water resistant as others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We had printed out photos that they take at Hearst Castle that they put fake backgrounds in and i was holding them...only to realize that i was leaving a very obvious thumb print on the side.  </li>
            <li> is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable).</li>
            <li> I like that it comes in small tubes.  </li>
            <li> only part that I find difficult which will be a problem for any sunscreen that is a cream/lotion is applying it to my arms and legs because I have body hair.  </li>
            <li> The only part that I find difficult which will be a problem for any sunscreen that is a cream/lotion is applying it to my arms and legs because I have body hair.  </li>
            <li> Faces only though because it is expensive and</li>
            <li> and I am FRIED- very unevenly fried, too.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t rub in very well which was annoying but not a huge problem.</li>
            <li> Very thick, but spreads well with a little work.</li>
            <li> This can be rubbed in so you can&#x27;t hardly tell it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard for me to detect \\&quot;protection level\\&quot; since it&#x27;s so subjective and hard to notice?  </li>
            <li> lot of people who complain about how hard it is to put on a sun blocker or how oily it is don&#x27;t seem to understand the nature of the product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a sunblock that isn&#x27;t greasy or thick.  </li>
            <li> That was a bit disappointing, because it isn&#x27;t that big a bottle...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick</li>
            <li> its not so thick that it takes forever to rub in (like lots of sunscreens).  </li>
            <li> Not too thick like others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Not too thick</li>
            <li> Not too thick.</li>
            <li> After buying two of these and spending over 50 dollars on a very small bottle i ended up going to the pharmacy and buying another type.</li>
            <li> Am I getting 4 bad products at the same time?</li>
            <li> This is no good</li>
            <li> I just buy the least expensive one (:</li>
            <li> This is a zinc oxide sunscreen - it&#x27;s difficult to rub it in, difficult to get rid of the pale &#x27;ghost&#x27; look on your skin -</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell unpleasant, and despite being thick isn&#x27;t difficult to spread.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed and will be sending it back.</li>
            <li> However, prices wary a LOT.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However....it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so disturbing to be leaving grease EVERYWHERE.  </li>
            <li> However, after 90 minutes on the beach our entire family came home with terrible sunburns.</li>
            <li> The texture is quite tacky and is somewhat difficult to scrub off your skin in the shower; sand will stick to you like a sugar cookie.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  use personal care products without the safety seal in tact, especially expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> (I was a sad mommy)</li>
            <li> However, it is a bit difficult to rub into my skin.</li>
            <li> I tried to shake the tube to mix the liquid and the rest of the content, thinking maybe it was the cold weather that separated the content, but nope, it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> So, I was afraid to put it to the test, considering that I bought it intending to wear it on our vacation to a South Pacific island and my complexion is as pasty while and prone to burns as it gets.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> the product smells horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an OK sunscreen, nothing more special than other big-brand ones, probably not as effective as others. However, the big big plus is it can be used at Cancun parks such as Xplor and Xcaret, etc., where almost all other US brands are not permitted.</li>
            <li> I was using MD Moms which I love, but this stuff is half the price, works great and also skips the harmful chemicals. It has a mild scent (wish it was unscented) but it isn&#x27;t very strong so I&#x27;m ok with it. Very good stuff. Worked all summers for kids and adults with lots of outdoor pool, beach and other outside time.</li>
            <li> Works very well, spreads easily, not greasy (maybe just a bit) nor gritty. My kids get really pink on the cheeks, nose, and ears. This can be rubbed in so you can&#x27;t hardly tell it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li> My natural skin color is fairly light (not white, caramel-ish) but since I&#x27;m mixed with native american I tan really easily and I can get really dark. I tried using this on my hands to test it and after a few hours in the sun, I didn&#x27;t burn nor did I feel my skin getting hot. My hands lightened after prolonged protection and now I&#x27;m using it on the rest of my exposed skin. It&#x27;s not sticky at all and it smells sweet. My aim is to not only protect myself from burning in the sun(yes, it hurts us brown people too!) but to also have my arms and face the same color as the rest of my body. I always wear tees, pants, and shoes(no sandals) so the rest of my skin is light. I would recommend this to everyone no matter how light or dark they are. You need to be protected from the sun. Oh, another thing to note is that though it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, it could leave prints on shiny dark surfaces such as the laptop I&#x27;m using right now. I&#x27;ll wipe it off later.</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s: Worked perfectly. Safe product as tested by ewg.org&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: We have flown through the small tubes, but a safe product is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone!.</li>
            <li> Thinksport, Livestrong, Thinkbaby, etc. are all the SAME, check ingredients.  However, prices wary a LOT.&lt;br /&gt;So buy Livestrong :-) at 10.00 dollars a tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other sunscreen products, and this is great --and inexpensive in comparison! There is a coconut scent to it, however it actually doesn&#x27;t bother me (and I despise coconut). Works great on my kids, too. Just buy it.</li>
            <li> My title says it all - this stuff seems to work great, but I find it hard to spread on my kids. It&#x27;s really thick and you have to really rub it in good and it leaves a white/pearly tint to their skin.&lt;br /&gt;In the past we&#x27;ve used the Seventh Generation Wee-Generation sunscreen and really, really like it. It&#x27;s easy to spread in and does a good job protecting my kids skin. The only downside with that is that it is not waterproof (hence the reason that we bought the ThinkSport).</li>
            <li> I bought this product after two problematic orders in a row of Thinkbaby SPF 50+ (Three out of the four tubes I received were full of liquid) because I really need a sunscreen to use on vacation and this brand was ranked highly on EWG for its safety. It almost amazed me that I ended up receiving yet another tube of liquid. This time I actually opened the seal to check how much liquid was in there. A lot! I tried to shake the tube to mix the liquid and the rest of the content, thinking maybe it was the cold weather that separated the content, but nope, it didn&#x27;t work. After two minutes&#x27; of vigorous shaking, I could still pour liquid out of the tube. I guess I will have to give up on this brand and its manufacturer after all. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this sunscreen based on the positive ratings from the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s (EWG) sunscreen guide. My kids and I are fair-skinned redheads so we need high-SPF sunscreens but I want to avoid hazardous/carcinogenic ingredients as much as possible. Not only does this sunscreen work well, it smells great. This is a nice, thick sunscreen that is easy to put on and stays in place. The fact that it makes me smell slightly fruity but not overly sweet is a bonus! Everything else I&#x27;ve tried just doesn&#x27;t come close, so in my book it&#x27;s totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> Delicious, light orange-creamsicle scent. Not as oily and chalky as other natural sunscreens. Works EXCELLENT...and, best of all, it doesn&#x27; give you cancer. However....it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing this sunscreen works well although in general I stay out of the sun and have not gotten burnt.  It&#x27;s really hard for me to detect \\&quot;protection level\\&quot; since it&#x27;s so subjective and hard to notice?  However my primary complaint is that this thing is super greasy, kind of difficult to spread, and difficult to blend.  It takes a while to spread the ss all over my arms and for it to not be a huge patch of white.  Additionally as I want to protect my hands as well I would apply it on my hands...and then I noticed that I&#x27;m leaving greasy prints EVERYWHERE.  It got so bad when i was leaving huge greasiness on my phone and then got the grease over my phone&#x27;s camera lense so everything had a halo-like affect (kind of cool in the photo actually, but not what i was looking for!).  We had printed out photos that they take at Hearst Castle that they put fake backgrounds in and i was holding them...only to realize that i was leaving a very obvious thumb print on the side.  This was about 2+ hours AFTER I applied it initially on my arm and hands...i mean it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s long lasting I guess?  but it&#x27;s so disturbing to be leaving grease EVERYWHERE.  Even my friends were like \\&quot;omfg why are you still leaving ss on everything???\\&quot; at me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;x___x&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have to apply this on arms and back of hands, then carefully wash just the palm side of my hands to get rid of the ss on my palm but still leave it on the back of my hands for protection.  D:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not just this, I noticed that the ss would get over my clothes as well, and also my hair making it really sticky because of the residue on my hands.  arg!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I need to find a different ss that provides as good protection, but not so greasy and clingy!  D:</li>
            <li> Very pleased! Other reviewers said this is one of the less &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; zinc oxide sunscreens, and I have to agree. No sunburns yet! As with any sunscreen, keep reapplying. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent like some other natural sunscreens. Overall, I think this one is my favorite, and I&#x27;ve tried a few! My kiddo doesn&#x27;t mind having it applied which is a plus!</li>
            <li> Seems to have worked reat for us! I like that it is a safer product and still does the trick.</li>
            <li> Love. Great product for outdoorsy kids. Stays put all day, very water resistant. Does leave a ghostly white film on the skin initially but it does eventually sink in. Excellent safey rating from EWG. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen! I use it for my  kids, as well as myself.  It blends in easily and doesn&#x27;t make us look like ghosts and  it works, no sunburns, no tanning.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful smelling!</li>
            <li> Turns your skin quite white and takes a while to go in and on but overall, I like it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this sunscreen for our family based on the positive reviews. It didn&#x27;t rub in very well which was annoying but not a huge problem. However, after 90 minutes on the beach our entire family came home with terrible sunburns. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> Did not wear it into the sun, so can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness. It arrived completely separated into water and watery paste and no amount of shaking or stirring was able to reconstitute it. So, I was afraid to put it to the test, considering that I bought it intending to wear it on our vacation to a South Pacific island and my complexion is as pasty while and prone to burns as it gets. Product did have a very nice, subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li> My son has sensitive skin and has been using this for more than 2 years now since I found it on Amazon.  It is not too oily and has a pleasant smell.  He plays soccer and this works fine for him. love it.</li>
            <li> I orded 4 tube of this sunscreen for its review. I opened one today 4/19/2015 and found that its all waterlike liquid inside. I check the expiration date on the tube, it is 05/2016. I checked other 3 unopened tubes. They all feels like liquid inside. Am I getting 4 bad products at the same time?</li>
            <li> Excellent, sage sunscreen! Been using this for years on my kids! Love it!</li>
            <li> Its working as it supposed to. Most important thing is for me that there is no harsh chemicals because I am a &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; user of sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Good product, easy to use.</li>
            <li> not greasy.  good EWG rating</li>
            <li> For the price, it doesn&#x27;t seem worth it. It spreads well enough but it doesn&#x27;t rub in leaving a white sheen to my skin, making me look purple since I have a pink undertone. After working in the yard, I noticed a white build up in the crease at my elbows.</li>
            <li> Works well on very sensitive skin. Endures even when wet longer than I thought. All family members are using now.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get burned from the sun but it doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin. I have dark skin and this lotion leaves me looking like a ghost.</li>
            <li> I was really interested in this product, because of the article on livestrong, but obviously they are gaining from it, so of course their article is biased. the product smells horrible! it smells like cilantro. My son hates it. After buying two of these and spending over 50 dollars on a very small bottle i ended up going to the pharmacy and buying another type. dont recommend at all.</li>
            <li> Decided to try some chemical free sunscreen this summer. It&#x27;s obviously pricier than your average sunscreen. Not a huge bottle. But it works great. It&#x27;s pretty thick though. Much thicker than Blue Lizard Sunscreen which I also tested this summer.</li>
            <li> I am a parnoid parent and have looked to avoid chemical based sunscreens for my infants and younger children.  The contents is solid, and after days in the pool and on the beach it worked like a charm with no burns.  As with all zinc oxide sunscreens it will protect only those areas it is directly applied to.  Unlike the chemical sunscreens which will always be easier to apply, last longer, this one does need to be reapplied every few hours as all zinc oxide based sunscreens do, but I found that this one stayed on longer without being excessively sticky.  As applying sunscreen to children is as enjoyable and easy as bathing a cat i highly recommend getting your kid a one-peice with elbow and knee long sleeves with Spf 50 protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this brand to be far better than their infant version.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen! After spending way too many hours on the internets searching for an effective and safe sunscreen  (a lot of cross referencing with EWG, non-toxic beauty bloggers) ThinkSport fulfilled all of my requirements. It&#x27;s non-greasy and provides wonderful coverage without that white sunscreen look (I&#x27;m medium-light skin tone). It smells insanely good and feels good going on. I could wear it while hiking or surfing or for daily use when I want more protection than my usual 30+ spf. Most important it&#x27;s effective and non-toxic!</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen.  Stays on well and is not greasy.  Also has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Great sunblock for kids with a light scent, its easy apply - not greasie or sticky - ans it helps support cancer research :)</li>
            <li> This is our fist day of vacation and my daughter is burned after using this and applying it as often as it suggested. And I used plenty. Very disappointed and will be sending it back. I read other reviews saying as much but gave the product the benefit of the doubt. I am very diligent about sunscreen and I am floored over how it is as if she wasn&#x27;t wearing any at in during the 7 hour we were outside. Part of the time she was even in the shade.</li>
            <li> A great mineral sunscreen. I use it on my body, as it is a little thick for daily wear on my face, but it does the job, and I appreciate that it is free of octibenzones.  It is odorless and rubs in colorless.</li>
            <li> Pricey.&lt;br /&gt;Greasy once applied to skin.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to apply as it doesn&#x27;t easily apply evenly on skin.</li>
            <li> This is excellent for sun protection. I have olive skin and it does leave a bit of a white residue, but on my paler boyfriend you can&#x27;t see any residue at all.</li>
            <li> When my daughter brought this sunscreen to a school outing at the beach, all the kids thought this was the best sunscreen. She also came home without a sunburn! This stuff is magic.</li>
            <li> Love everything about it so far! Easy to apply and everyone loves the smell. Giving 4 stars because haven&#x27;t put it to the beach test yet, but expecting great results!</li>
            <li> great sunscreen, smells good, spreads well, came quickly</li>
            <li> Love it! Have used so many different products over the years and this one tops them all. Easy to apply and great for the little kids!! It&#x27;s the only sunscreen we use!!! It works the way it should!</li>
            <li> Good product! With tanned skin, a little hard to completely rub in and get the white out.  Good coverage.</li>
            <li> Has a great sort of grapefruity smell that my 4 yr old really likes, good, effective coverage. I used it too and it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes when I sweat like other sunscreens do. Definitely requires re-application if you are sweating a lot.</li>
            <li> Thicker than store brands but goes on smoothly and rubs in easily. No stickiness or slimy feeling that alot of brands have. Nice, pleasant scent. Reapplied every couple hours but would sometimes go longer. I did get a little tan but no redness or sunburn over the course of 3 days at the lake. It was also great for the kids who didn&#x27;t get burnt. They were very active in the water and sweating throughout the day, but this seemed to hold up well. No running into the eyes and causing them to burn. Overall very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> very good sunscreen. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and works great</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen but you really have to apply every hour while in the water .  It doesn&#x27;t hold up very long when you are consistently swimming .</li>
            <li> Smell like orange creamsicles</li>
            <li> This product is great for those of us who are allergic to the chemical sunscreens! Because this sunscreen uses natural barrier ingredients like zinc and titanium dioxide, it will leave a whitish cast on your skin (much more noticeable once you jump in the water and if you have a little more color to your skin).  I&#x27;ll take the whitish cast over chemical rash or sunburn any day.  The texture is quite tacky and is somewhat difficult to scrub off your skin in the shower; sand will stick to you like a sugar cookie.  Otherwise, I&#x27;ve found my new go-to sunscreen.  The fragrance is delish, smells like Trix cereal.</li>
            <li> Just starting using it this month and performs as advertised.  No problems.  Great product so far!</li>
            <li> Smells terrible. Leaves a white residue. I bathed the kids after swimming and I washed them twice with soap and when they got dressed I could STILL smell the sunscreen. It took another bath until it finally washed out. No returns so that&#x27;s a bummer.</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to blend and works great</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen! I use it for my two super fair-skinned kids, as well as myself. My daughter has very sensitive skin and has no problems at all with ThinkSport. It has a really nice, subtle fragrance. I try to avoid chemical sunscreens, so we have tried lots of zinc sunscreens - most of them with a toothpaste-like consistency. ThinkSport blends in easily and doesn&#x27;t make my kids look like ghosts.  Finally (and most important of all) - it works! No sunburns, no tanning. I give it an A+. BTW, I don&#x27;t see much difference between the different varieties of ThinkSport/Thinkbaby, etc. I just buy the least expensive one (:</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the same formula as the baby one. It has the same ingredients. I only gave it a 4 because it doesn&#x27;t really spread well</li>
            <li> Ordering more and really like it. Its not heavy and you never know you have it on. It has slight citrus scent and you don&#x27;t even notice after a couple mins.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen, doesn&#x27;t smell like much which was good. Just wish they sold it in a bigger size. Probably will but the goddess garden one because of this.</li>
            <li> spreads easily and protects very well</li>
            <li> Gotta rub it in a lot otherwise you&#x27;ll look like a clown. only need a little bit and spread it.</li>
            <li> I opened the cap and the foil seal was off and some was spilling out. I don&#x27;t  use personal care products without the safety seal in tact, especially expensive ones. I couldn&#x27;t return it because the only option is finding a local UPS to bring it to and there are none local to me or be home when UPS comes to pick it up. (I can&#x27;t take a day off of work for that! ) I contacted Amazon about this issue and they promptly refunded me so I&#x27;m content. I can&#x27;t comment on the quality of the product. I have a friend that uses it and says she likes it better than most due to scent and ability to rub into the skin easier. Maybe I&#x27;ll try some of hers.</li>
            <li> Pretty much the best option there is for kids in terms of safety &amp; protection.</li>
            <li> Updates: Confirmed with Thinksport, there are different designs for the packages, so be relaxed if you received a difference version. Mine are very new. So far so good!!</li>
            <li> My son gets skin eruptions when he goes in any level of direct sunlight. This helps him completely. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is great!!!!! Love the smell and my kids never get burned. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> We have been searching for a more healthy sunscreen for our family. We found it in this product. Thank you- Kay from South Florida.</li>
            <li> great smell, rubs in well, stays on  for a few hours when Im at the ocean. I like this and Im picky.</li>
            <li> This item looks good and serious. I didn&#x27;t try it on me yet but it is as described on the site. The packaging was fine and delivered on time considering that it was coming from the US to Europe. It&#x27;s one of the cheapest option on the net for this type of product and the cheapest for this brand. It is also one of the harmlessness sunscreen on the market considering the chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  First full sun weekend with toddlers outside.  No sunburns yet.  Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> We switched to this from BurnOut sunscreen after they changed their formula and I am pleased with the switch so far.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have found this stuff. I was using chemical sunscreens before and have officially changed to physical block zinc oxide. This sunscreen works well for me and my children (two of whom are extremely fair) and I like having both the zinc and water resistant protection. Makes me wonder if having a zinc deficiency makes one more prone to sunburn. Here is a tip to help make this sunscreen rub in easier and not leave a white residue: apply coconut oil to your skin first and let it soak in for about 20 minutes. Then apply Thinksport afterward, it will go on creamy, smooth, and absorb better. Your skin will look moisturized while having great protection too.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen smells nice, rubs in easily and is totally safe for my kids!  It&#x27;s a rating 1 on EWG website.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is great. It has high SPF, and it&#x27;s safe to use. It won&#x27;t make you look like a ghost. I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this brand of sunblock before and have been very happy with it, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again. We have used the tube I just purchased on multiple occasions, in water, out of water, on myself, husband, and children, and we&#x27;ve all gotten mild burns with even minimal sun exposure. It just doesn&#x27;t seem to be working in any circumstance.</li>
            <li> great sunblock, works well</li>
            <li> Best out of all the natural sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve tried a lot. Non greesey and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This works fabulously.  My daughters and I burn easily, and this prevented it after hours on the beach. Perfect! I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
            <li> This  is now my go - to sunscreen.  We&#x27;ve tried quite  a few brands that are free from the questionable ingredients in most mainstream sunscreens. Most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products have proven to be overpriced and ineffective.  Not this one! It kept my kids from burning at the pool this summer.  Yes,  it&#x27;s thick and white and even if you rub it in well,  there is occasionally some residue left.  My kids don&#x27;t mind and I&#x27;m willing to see a little white on skin if it protects their skin (and my own).  Love this sunscreen and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Great products for my baby^_^</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen! Only complaint is that it&#x27;s not oil free.</li>
            <li> We love this stuff. Works great, isnt super thick or runny.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. It has a ewg.org rating of 1 so i know its safe for my kids. my husband is a skin cancer survivior so hes very particular about the sunscreens weve used.  ive tested this on long days at the beach and my kids have never burned &amp; barely tan with just a few reapplications.  its not so thick that it takes forever to rub in (like lots of sunscreens).  i always keep 2 or 3 of these on hand so i dont run out. There is no need to pay $20+ for a bottle of healthy sunscreen when this is so great and affordable. highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have bought Badger, Loving Naturals, all the big name naturals. I wish these ingredients were organic, but I will use this. Compared to the others, this smooths on without a greasy feeling. With a two-year old, this is a must. All the others had me dreading putting sunscreen on. Also, my daughter is bi-racial, and this doesn&#x27;t leave her looking like I dumped her in flour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the adult version and prefer this one to the other. Not sure what the difference is, but I like the child version more.</li>
            <li> This is a great product rated tops with the ewg.org, but it&#x27;s very small and will not last very long having 2 kids and living in CA where we wear sunscreen every day. The vendor is great- great communication and service, and I will probably order this again just b/c of all the non-toxic sunscreens out there, this is one of the lowest in price. I love that it&#x27;s water resistant, b/c rubbing this chalky zinc stuff in is work, although I have to say this is more easily absorbed into the skin than most ewg.org recommended sunscreens.</li>
            <li> In spite of having brown skin, I get sun burnt very easily. My sun burn usually skips the getting red phase and moves directly onto the swollen itchy rash filled phase. The other sunscreens I have tried (The ones marked 2 or below on EWG - like badger) are very difficult to rub on and leave that whitish cast that is very visible on my brown skin. I tried one formulated especially for the face from MDSolarSciences, that was easier to spread on, but left the same whitish cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the ThinkSport Kids on my face and body. It has a very pleasant smell. It is very easy to spread on. It does not leave a whitish cast on my brown skin. It gets absorbed very quickly leaving my skin feeling moisturized and supple ( I have very dry skin - people with oily skin may find it greasy). It is definitely water resistant. It kept me from getting burnt on my recent week-long beach vacation in Mexico. Need I say more.</li>
            <li> This is the best safe sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever found.  Rubs in so much better than other zinc versions and the smell is yummy.  Sensitive skin in my family &amp; no rashes is the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> Good product, a little hard to rub in but definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product! I am using it for baking</li>
            <li> It has a goopy consistency and it doesn&#x27;t blend in well.  I would use other physical sunscreens before buying this one (sush as BurnOut kids).</li>
            <li> I tried a few different safe sunscreens and was really unhappy with how clumpy they were.  This stuff is perfect.  It is thick, so it takes a bit of rubbing to go on, but I figure that&#x27;s worth.  It doesn&#x27;t smell unpleasant, and despite being thick isn&#x27;t difficult to spread.  It also doesn&#x27;t leave much sticky residue, and there are not clumpy white bits.  My girls and I put the ThinkBaby on our faces and necks every morning; this stuff goes on arms when we&#x27;re going to be out and won&#x27;t have time to reapply the AllTerrain kids spray.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is wonderful!  It is nice and thick, but smooths on easily without being greasy.  That&#x27;s important to me, otherwise my boys would never let me put it on them. The most important thing to me is that it seems to last a long time through all the sweat and beach water- even on the face! It doesn&#x27;t seep into their eyes and bother them.  My boys smell like a dream wearing it under the sun- it has a nice light scent that is not overwpowering.  It is so nice that my 3 year old dug it out of my bag... I caught him putting it on like lotion after his bath.  That was a bit disappointing, because it isn&#x27;t that big a bottle... you know... it&#x27;s not a jergen sized bottle where you could put droves and droves of it on at one time.  It is the perfect size to carry around with you.  It would be neat if it came in a bit bigger sized bottle, but hey- just buy a few at a time- it&#x27;s that wonderful.  The baby sunscreen is awesome, too, in pretty much all the same ways!</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I use for my son now. It&#x27;s not extremely greasy and will disappear if you blend well. I followed the EWG&#x27;s rating and tried a few brands. I stick to this one for 2 years now</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and does not leave the greasy heavy feeling</li>
            <li> Works great. I spend a lot of time in the sun playing golf and I have sensitive skin. This has a light scent that is pleasant, too.</li>
            <li> Perfect blend of ingredients so it&#x27;s smooth to put on</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I trust the ingredients and the smell is not overwhelming. It does take a bit of work to get it to the point where I am not completely white, however it is worth it to me as I know I am putting good stuff on myself and on my daughter.</li>
            <li> The Pros: Smells good  - Like an orange push pop. Rubs in smoothly  - no greasy feel. Natural and non toxic.&lt;br /&gt;The Cons: We all got sun burned. We applied it as recommended and reapplied after swimming, but it certainly didn&#x27;t act like a 50 spf sunscreen. Will not be using it again.</li>
            <li> It smells great.  It rubs in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of white residue</li>
            <li> Our sunscreen search is over! We have tried dozens of the top ewg rated sunscreens and this is by far the best for any sport or water activities. Goes on smooth. Only slightly white cast on skin. Smells good. Kids love it (and my kids are picky!). And best of all - no burns!&lt;br /&gt;We don&#x27;t use it on the face, because we love love Trukid face stick (tinted!). BTW, our 2nd favorite sunscreen is Babo Botanicals (smells amazing and isn&#x27;t as white, but runs off with any moisture)</li>
            <li> Great rating on EWG and doesn&#x27;t leave you looking ghostly!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is easier to apply than any other barrier sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s also incredibly effective, perhaps because it&#x27;s easier to apply the appropriate amount, and with re-application keeps my ghost-pale skin burn free. I also love the complete lack of fragrance.</li>
            <li> Has a pleasant smell upon application, turns metallic after on your skin for a while. This product is very difficult to rub in, especially with any kind of hair (eyebrows, facial hair, etc). I applied 20+ minutes before going out in the sun and first sweat brought this lotion out of my skin and I had to wipe away the white residue. I like that it is supposedly safer but it is a lot of work to put on and you definitely need to take a shower and/or bathe your kids immediately after using this product due to its thickness and metallic smell.</li>
            <li> Effective sunscreen. I have even used it on my 13-month old with very fair skin. We spent an entire week at the beach and slathered him up in this everyday. He did not burn at all. Though in fairness, we did spend most of our time in shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this as well, under my makeup for an everyday sunscreen. It is rated as safe by the EWG yearly report on sunscreens, and is mineral based, which is important to me. Overall, it is a bit greasy (the reason for 4 stars instead of 5), so for everyday wear I use a small amount, and it does fine. (Plus, I have oily, acne-prone skin.) So the fact that I can use it as a daily sunscreen says a lot!</li>
            <li> only sunscreen I use.  Very safe ratings on consumers working group.  Very thick, but spreads well with a little work.</li>
            <li> I like everything about this sunscreen, except that it&#x27;s a little tacky, and doesn&#x27;t smooth on easily (on the face or on the body). Since I use it on my face sometimes, for high-level protection on hot, bright summer days, I add just a pinch of moisturizing lotion into the sunscreen before I apply it. That seems to do the trick. (It&#x27;s also a tad greasy for facial use, but it absorbs fairly quickly). As an all-over sunscreen, it is very effective.</li>
            <li> Got this for my kids for swim camp.  It has a good safety rating from EWG.  The only thing is that it&#x27;s a small bottle and pricy.  I prefer Blue Lizzard Baby, it has more for the same price.</li>
            <li> The packaging keeps changing, so I do not know which product I have (I read that the formulation had changed, perhaps related to packaging?).  What I have is labeled &amp;#34;for kids&amp;#34; and comes in a black/yellow/white tube.  It is easy to apply, but must be applied quickly or leaves the white residue.  Works well for sun protection. I use it on my children, both of whom dislike sunscreen, but are more willing to use it versus other cream sunscreens.</li>
            <li> We have been using this sunscreen for over a year now. Love the smell and how easily it blends in. Plus it is mineral based so very safe.</li>
            <li> high zinc % but doesn&#x27;t feel like chalk. applies smoothly. provides excellent protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few sunscreens looking for one with safer ingredients than most have. this is the best I&#x27;ve tried  and I&#x27;m very happy with it! Smells great, and easy to rub in. I use it on my whole family, toddler and adults. I will be buying a lot of this stuff!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Out of three sunscreens I tried on vacation to mexico, this is my favorite. Expensive but didn&#x27;t clog up my pores. It does seem a little greasy. Its kind of expensive and has a little bit of a weird odor. But it rubs in pretty well and prevents sunburn Sooo...</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after seeing a posting from EWG about the natural ingredients. First of all the product is expensive for the size. My family of four with very different skin tones, ALL BURNED after applying it frequently.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I thought to use this on myself before ever trusting it on my 3 month old baby. On her first day of daycare (today) a friend wanted to keep me busy (I was a sad mommy) so off to the beach we went (since I started her a week before I have to go to work)! I applied this before leaving and the first thing I noticed was it does not spread nicely but instead soaks in rather quickly, so seems to take a lot of product to get your skin covered. We spent 2 hours at the beach and I am FRIED- very unevenly fried, too. Blotchy. I used MY normal SPF 15 lotion from another company on my face and the only thing that got slightly burnt was my nose (because I sweat there the most) and my ears (because I completely forgot to put ANYTHING on them). This is no good and I am grateful this didn&#x27;t happen to my sweet baby! I think child services would be called on me! Sheesh!</li>
            <li> Great product for my toddler!</li>
            <li> Finally a natural sunscreen that works and doesn&#x27;t make you look like a ghost!</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.  Not too thick like others I&#x27;ve tried.  Smells decent.</li>
            <li> It has great ingredients and ranks well on the ewg website... but having said that it also doesn&#x27;t rub in very well and is expensive. Going back to alba botanica.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen!! My son has eczema and this is the only one (so far) that doesn&#x27;t make him flare up.</li>
            <li> Goes on really smooth and nice scent! Lost one star just because it does make your face noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li> I have tried many sunblocks, this one Rocks!! Wished it was organic.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> One of the best rated sunscreens for babies by the EWG. Safe, very effective. My infant has used this on many very sunny days and never once been burned or even red. My only complaint is the white color gets on things like the stroller however I am assuming this happens with all high quality and safe sunscreens. You just have to clean your items more after use. Worth the time for a safe product</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen. I bought this after doing research to find a less-toxic sunscreen that was also user friendly. This one is perfect. It spreads almost as well as a chemical sunscreen - you need to rub it in a few seconds longer, but that&#x27;s it. Once rubbed in, it isn&#x27;t visible. It has a mild smell, doesn&#x27;t feel or look greasy, doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and is easy to wash off in the shower but stood up to sweat and swimming. I use it regularly and remain happy with it. I have tried several other non-chemical sunscreens and prefer this one due to it&#x27;s easy of use.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Think Baby sunscreen which I just love and decided to try this now that my twins are a bit older.  Pretty much the same, fantastic product as the Think Baby and I didn&#x27;t notice the difference between the two.  My 4 year old son has platinum hair, very fair skin, and grey eyes (very Swedish) and this keeps his beautiful baby skin totally burn free, rubs in great (much better than many of the other chemical free products out there i.e. California Baby), and is well priced.  I ususally stock up in the spring so that my little ones can frolic outdoors all summer long without worry.  I love this product and am thrilled I finally found the perfect sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Best natural sunscreen and the best price for a natural sunscreen!</li>
            <li> My son is very fair with gorgeous auburn hair. We skipped the beach altogether last year because he was only months old but also because I was weary about putting sunscreen on him at such a young age. This summer I reviewed this brand and bought sport and regular. I will only use this brand from now until forever. It goes on well, a little white but rubs in quickly (my 17 month old son can get thru application without running off, squirming or screaming... Unbelievable). He got total protection for hours in the pool and at the beach. Never a burn, not even pink. I reapplied as directed. Every 80 minutes is awesome compared to every 20 minutes for reapplication. And had a short absorption time. Apply at home and by the time you get to Sun and water you&#x27;re good to go. The ingredients are clean and mild for sensitive skin. Excellent product. Completely satisfied!</li>
            <li> I tried 4 of the top rated sunscreens when looking for a physical (non-chemical) sunscreen.  Most worked pretty well, but they all had their pros and cons.  Some were a little sticky or thick, some were not as water resistant as others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one was my favorite choice:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Seemed to have the best water resistance.  The sunscreen did not run off ... seems to do well in working itself onto the skin.&lt;br /&gt;2) Texture and smell was great.  A light citrus scent and non greasy, non sticky feel.&lt;br /&gt;3) Goes on easy and smooth&lt;br /&gt;4) Good sun protection ... very consistent&lt;br /&gt;5) Priced lower than many other physical sunscreens&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s came out on top and is my only choice now.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best sunscreen out there.  Safe, works wonderfully, and safe to use on my sweet little girl.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff.  It lasts a long time, and even in the water (I&#x27;m an avid surfer)  I&#x27;ll go in for 90m and come out with no burns.  Very effective!</li>
            <li> Our favorite natural sunscreen, works perfectly! Not too thick</li>
            <li> This works! Great consistency, not greasy feeling. Goes on easily and smoothly. Absorbs in well, no white all over afterwards. Very light citrus scent but all natural. My son has very sensitive skin and is allergic to most things but he loves this sunscreen! It&#x27;s also great with sports sweating and water/pool activity, lasts longer than others.</li>
            <li> Started using this on my 1 year old and 3 year old...and then myself.  It&#x27;s hard to find a sunblock that isn&#x27;t greasy or thick.  This one works well and is easy to apply.  For me, I like the light citurs scent.  No matter what others may claim as &#x27;unscented&#x27;, they always have a certain odor to them which I am tired of.  This was a nice change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already ordered more for the Spring season and made sure to get one for myself in the adult version.</li>
            <li> This product is rated as one of the safer sunscreens to use, so I buy it for the entire family.  It works extremely well and truly is waterproof (within reason, of course).  This was our sunscreen of choice for Hawaii, and no one suffered any burns.</li>
            <li> Loved the baby formulation. But got this adult version and over 1/2 the container was just liquid. Sunscreen had somehow separated into solids and liquids and no matter how much I shook it, it just would not mix. Wasted product. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this product, not to mention it works great. Really happy with this! It goes on well &amp; stays on the surface of the skin.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this sunscreen!  Smells subtle but really good. It is white and you have to rub in but it takes less rubbing than all the other brands I&#x27;ve tried!  Also very affordable compared to my second favorite CA Baby and Honest sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This sunblock goes on smooth and evenly especially for a zinc-based sunscreen.  I love the smell and my toddler boys tolerate having this one applied...well, they fight me less than with the other ones that I really have to rub, rub, rub to blend into their skin.  Probably my favorite of the safer sunblocks, and yes, we did check the toxicity levels on the ewg website.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use on vacation. (Had to buy it at our local nature foods store because the buyer i went thru dropped the ball and did not deliver it on time) We did four days of theme parks...getting wet, drying off, getting wet again and so on. We never reapplied. No one got sunburned at all. Although you have to rub it in really well, it stays on really well. I had no problems and thats after 12 hrs of theme parks a day. I have recommended this product to all my friends. The fact that it does not contain dangerous chemicals makes it all that much better.</li>
            <li> Worked fine as daily sunscreen, but was not as waterproof as promised. Just after a short ocean swim , it would wash off and we had to re-apply constantly.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love!  My son is a little redhead so I am fanatical about using sunscreen on his very fair skin.  I used this product all summer long and we did not have one day of pink skin.  As some of you may know, getting a 3 year old to stand still so you can put sunscreen on them can be a MAJOR challenge.  The yummy orangesicle smell kept my son standing still while I slathered him down.  This was an awesome purchase!</li>
            <li> After trying many different sun blockers, this is the one I&#x27;m staying with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people who complain about how hard it is to put on a sun blocker or how oily it is don&#x27;t seem to understand the nature of the product.  Zinc oxide is a white powder.  So if the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t put enough oil (or similar products), it&#x27;s like trying to apply toothpaste on your skin and hiding it.  But it&#x27;s true that other manufacturers put too much oil, then you get an easy to apply product, but your skin is left very oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is why I love this brand.  I feel they got the perfect balance so that it applies easy enough and isn&#x27;t too oily.  As an added bonus, it actually works.  I&#x27;ve tried other natural sun blockers in the past and still burnt.  When I apply this one and re-apply every 90 minutes or so (depending on what I&#x27;m doing) I show no signs of burning on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you aren&#x27;t sold yet, here are more reasons to love this product:&lt;br /&gt;- the price is quite reasonable - sunscreens are generally pretty expensive&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve bought 3 tubes so far and for each one the expiry was around 2 years from when I got it.  This means I can keep it for 2 summers.  Most sunscreens expire in less than a year.&lt;br /&gt;- it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;- I like that it comes in small tubes.  That way I can leave one at my backpack, at home, at work, or wherever.  You never know when your friends might ask you to go do something outside and you are left completely unprotected because you left your big jug of sunscreen at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have a hard time applying this sunblocker or others, here&#x27;s how I apply it:&lt;br /&gt;Put a dab on your fingers, about the size of a big blueberry (I just had breakfast), then spread it on the finger tips for both hands.  Apply all over your face.  I start from my forehead, nose and the top of my cheeks (the parts that burn first) then spread to the rest of the face.  Don&#x27;t rub until it disappears, just spread it evenly and ignore the fact that it appears a bit white.  I get more sunscreen and then get my neck and ears.  Assuming I have a short sleeve shirt, I now apply it on my arms, getting more sunscreen if necessary.  Again, I don&#x27;t worry too much about the white yet, just get it evenly and make sure there isn&#x27;t a thick amount anywhere.  Now once you are done your arms, look back at your face.  Unless you put too much, the white will have disappeared or at least faded significantly!  If it&#x27;s still visible in some spots, I just spread it out a bit more, again, not trying to make it disappear, and then do the same for the other places I applied.  Then repeat until it&#x27;s all gone.  This is so much easier than rubbing until it disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only part that I find difficult which will be a problem for any sunscreen that is a cream/lotion is applying it to my arms and legs because I have body hair.  But if I do what I wrote above, by the time I&#x27;ve done a second pass or so, it starts to disappear.  The only stuff that is easy to put on body parts with hair are the sprays and there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m ever putting that on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be safe, wear sunscreen, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with being pasty white.  You&#x27;ll appreciate it in your 60s.  :)then get my neck and ears.  Assuming I have a short sleeve shirt, I now apply it on my arms, getting more sunscreen if necessary.

            <li> Good sunscreen, rubs in well, nice light citrus scent. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen. Spreads easily. By far one of the best mineral sunscreens that doesn&#x27;t contain cancer causing ingredients.</li>
            <li> UPDATE (10/2014):  I&#x27;m still using this sunscreen after 2+ years. I&#x27;m a very active person in the summer, as I enjoy whacking tennis balls across blazing-hot courts. While a dermatologist suggested the zinc oxide amount was higher than necessary, it still seems to work very well. I recommend using a different product for the face area (i.e. with more moisture), but the rest of my body appreciates the ThinkSport protection.    I have found that the product is only slightly greasy upon initial application. Also, rubbing well and patience are helpful in avoiding the ashy effect on brown skin. The sunscreen absorbs after 5 to 10 minutes. There&#x27;s more of a slight purple tint that results after that time instead of white. It&#x27;s not a big deal. Also, I appreciate that as I sweat the sunscreen doesn&#x27;t start dripping in streaks down my leg, unlike other more readily-available brands. :-)  ______________________________________________________________  After much research (including EWG&#x27;s Sunscreen Guide), I chose to buy this sunscreen. I don&#x27;t think protection from the sun should mean that you should accumulate more harmful chemicals in your body instead.    PROS:  - Natural protection (listed as one of best sunscreens by EWG), so I have peace of mind.  - Better bang for the buck as compared to other \\&quot;safe\\&quot; sunscreens, since the tube is double or triple their size.  - Does not cause breakouts.  - Fairly easy to rub in. The amount of rub-in determines how much whiteness still appears.    CONS (i.e. why 3 stars instead of 5?):  - The cost: While there is comparable value, $20 a tube is unreasonable for the amount of product (3 wt oz.). When these manufacturers start making natural sunscreens at $8 for at least 8 oz., then perhaps I&#x27;ll increase my rating. Until then, there&#x27;s going to be an automatic deduction(s). Consumers should be able to buy safe sunscreens at a reasonable size and at a reasonable cost. This tube will likely be gone after two months of judicious use (late June to late August 2012).  - I have brown skin and the ashy look is in effect. It is essential to rub in the product to cut down on some of the whiteness (or in my case, sometimes purple sheen). While the rub-in action doesn&#x27;t take incredibly long, I have missed spots when rushed. I would not say that the liquid is as smooth as something like Coppertone Ultra Sport Sunscreen, which will soak in somewhat if you forget to rub it in and flows faster. This aspect should be expected since apparently avoiding this issue may introduce more risk on the nanoparticle level. As such, my vanity will take a backseat for now. It&#x27;s still a con, that Livestrong should try to work to fix.</li>
            <li> It made me look like i am wearing a white mask. I first thought it was temporary, but my face looked white all day long.</li>
            <li> BEST sunscreen out there for children.  Easy to spread and get on...works perfect - had minimal sunburns this summer.  I love this and have been using it for the past two summers!</li>
            <li> We used this all summer and it worked great on my three kids (one infant) and both my husband and myself.  No burns at all.  It is super thick going on, so remember a little can go a long way.  My  husband seemed to have trouble getting it completely rubbed in around his facial hair, but other than looking a bit &amp;#34;pale&amp;#34; this didn&#x27;t seem to affect the performance of the product. I love the scent- it smells fresh with a hint of citrus.  We ended up purchasing about one tube per month, but since we only need this about three months out of the year the extra expense seemed totally worth it to know I wasn&#x27;t covering my family in chemicals! I am pretty sure all the formulas are about the same (baby, sport, regular) so we just bought whichever one was the cheapest each time we ordered. They all worked perfectly. I would definitely recommend this.  Also-- I am quite pale as are my children so don&#x27;t shy away just because you have fair skin or burn easily. This product can do it!</li>
            <li> Effective but a little difficult to spread !</li>
            <li> I feel so happy to have found this sunscreen.  Safe, easy to apply and it smells good. Makes momma happy!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY baby sunscreen that is not only safe with great reviews on safety but doesn&#x27;t burn our baby. We used the California Sun 30+ and our baby still got burnt. We took two bottle of this ThinkSport to the Bahamas and our baby didn&#x27;t even get burnt! I started it using it for the whole family. LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> Applies smoothly and easily.  Has a fresh scent -- not perfumy.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that doesn&#x27;t seem to break my 3 year old daughter out when we apply it to her.  She can play for a couple hours outside with no issues.  We do reapply after about 2 hours. Although a little expensive, I&#x27;ll pay the extra knowing it&#x27;s not full of toxins.</li>
            <li> yes its a great product, i wish it would cost a bit less money. so far the best i tried..</li>
            <li> Excellent sun screen. Non greasy. Not too thick. Smells great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sunscreen after finding it&#x27;s review on EWG.  I appreciate that the film is not very heavy and fades after some time, important given we are African American.  I also found it to indeed be water resistant as kids went swimming the first time it was used.  I hate most sunscreens leave then looking like ghost . However to my disappointment I cannot find a reasonable price quality product in the quantity I need for my kids everyday use.  I used it up in no time, but I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Love that it has an EWG rating of 1 -- smells great and is easy to rub in.  Lasts a long time before you need to reapply.  LOVE this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Not greasy! If you&#x27;re looking for a sunscreen with a dry feel to it, get this one! I bought it thanks to momma sohn&#x27;s recommendation on youtube :)</li>
            <li> Used this at the beach on my toddler and infant and I am very pleased with the product. It goes on smoothly without being greasy and it smells pleasant, like fruit. I reapplied throughout the day and both children stayed protected, even after being in the water. It was good to know that I wasn&#x27;t putting questionable or understudied chemicals on their skin.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, goes on nice without greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Smells great, goes on easily...by far THE BEST safer sunscreen that we have tried. My 3 year old finally stopped screaming during sunscreen application! He even lets me put it on his face.</li>
            <li> Goes on well and stays on.</li>
            <li> It is not as effective as the SPF 50+ Coppertone I regularly use.</li>
            <li> I put this on my face every morning under my makeup.  Make sure you rub it in good.  It might seem a little greasy at first, but after I put on my makeup, I blot it with toilet paper which removes a lot of the greasiness.  By mid morning, your face feels good not greasy.</li>
            <li> One of the best sunscreens ever. We tested it surfing in the tropics under blazing sun for over 8 hours a day (yes we re-applied!).&lt;br /&gt;My kids are allergic to many sunscreen ingredients and this one did not cause them any irritation. YAY!&lt;br /&gt;We also used the baby version Thinkbaby. It was shipped immediately, expiration dates are years from now. We will be re-ordering!</li>
            <li> It is smooth and not thick. It is good product for kids who like outdoor sport such as a swimming, soccer, baseball or bike.</li>
            <li> Looking for an alternative from the typical sunscreen that is loaded with chemicals.  I found it.  Great rating on the Environmental Working Group website.</li>
            <li> We are in the islands and this stuff does the job, We were swimming 12to 4pm today sunscreen applied once before going to beach. No sunburn, without it and sunburn all over.It is all natural and doesn&#x27;t pollute the ocean.Don&#x27;t be fooled by cheap brands, this stuff is it!</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, is fairly water resistant and doesn&#x27;t leave my children all ghosty. I would definitely recommend reapplying every hour if your children are swimming.</li>
            <li> This is probably obvious to others, but it didn&#x27;t occur to me, so I&#x27;ll go ahead and comment.  If you&#x27;re using sunscreen with physical blockers, by definition, it needs to be opaque to some degree to block out the sun.  I agree with the other reviewers that the white color is very light.  I have olive skin, however, so this sunscreen still shows up like I&#x27;m wearing white face.  It is very light, however, so I can see how, if you have light skin, it would be almost unnoticeable.  As, I say, however, I am coming to the conclusion that this is a problem for all sunscreens using physical blockers, so it would not be fair to penalize this product for that shortcoming (from my point of view).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I agree with all the positive reviews as to nice light smell, easy to put on, etc.  Just a warning that if you&#x27;re darker skin in complexions, this will still make you look like you&#x27;re wearing white.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was great for protection! We spent hours a day on the beach with no burns.  I reapplied on kids about every 2ish hours. It is a little thick but as expected with any non poisonous sunscreen ;)</li>
            <li> I like the Thinksport Sunscreens for my kids because they are one of the few lines out there that have more natural ingredients in them. I especially like this particular version because it&#x27;s great when it&#x27;s really hot and they&#x27;re active and sweating (i.e. at baseball or tennis). They also seem to like as I haven&#x27;t gotten any complaints about eyes burning--which is great ;-)</li>
            <li> By far my favorite sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. Smells amazing, well-rated by the EWG, goes on easily, and reasonably priced. Love it.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this product and it works really well. However, it is a bit difficult to rub into my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product - easy application, scent isn&#x27;t noticeable by my 4 year old unlike other safer sunscreens on the market. Highly recommend ThinkBaby and Badger brands as the best for safe non toxic type sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply especially to wiggly kids. My kids do get tanned with this (hence only 4 stars) but they don&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> Loved this sunscreen over this past summer.  Easy to rub in, no ghost like appearances.  Used it on our 3, 5, 9 year old boys and ourselves for 2 weeks in FL in July.  No one burned &#x3D; everyone happy!  This will be our go-to sunscreen for next summer for sure!</li>
            <li> Works great! It comes on a bit white but i have no signs of burnt skin while wearing it.</li>
            <li> This is very thick sunscreen that provides great coverage but has a strange smell - almost like citrus. I&#x27;ve adapted to it though and no longer worry about slathering chemicals all over my face every morning.</li>
            <li> This is the best organic sunscreen I have ever used! It smells like fruits or citrus, and the bottle contains a  lot of product. Although it has good coverage almost like a BB cream, it tends to interfere a little with my powder foundation. But overall, this sunscreen is excellent, and I don&#x27;t have any complaints about it! Even though it&#x27;s for kids, I use it! It can be used on everyone and is the best for children. You should definitely buy it with all the great ingredients, and is a good price for so much.</li>
            <li> Trying to find a sunscreen that&#x27;s safe and won&#x27;t irritate my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin (face only). We have a winner! It has a mild fruity smell and does not smell like sunscreen. It is thick but can be rubbed in easily. Now we all use this on our faces when we head to the pool. Faces only though because it is expensive and like I said only her face is sensitive to most sunscreens. We use another brand for our bodies. If this one were cheaper we would only use it.</li>
            <li> Tried this because of EWG&#x27;s recommendation for a safe sunscreen. Easy to use and apply. Small size makes it easy to tote!</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen! We&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 yrs now. It&#x27;s the only sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t give my kids a rash. Rated 1 on the EWG site gives me peace of mind knowing I&#x27;m not putting harmful chemicals on my kids. However, the bottle I have looks different than this one. My bottle has black letters not light blue letters. This might be a newer formulation so double check on the ewg to make sure it still has a 1 rating. Sometimes they change the formulation and add harmful chemicals. I&#x27;m hoping that it&#x27;s not the case with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is a zinc oxide sunscreen - it&#x27;s difficult to rub it in, difficult to get rid of the pale &#x27;ghost&#x27; look on your skin - but that&#x27;s exactly how it&#x27;s supposed to be.  Other sunscreens may be easier to apply and more able to &#x27;disappear,&#x27; but this just seems safer for delicate skin and more effective.  I would particularly recommend it for kids or anyone out in the sun all day.</li>
            <li> This seems to work as well as any chemical-laden name brand on my 6 year old so we&#x27;re happy with it!</li>
            <li> I like this because it rubs in pretty nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a thick white paste all of your skin.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen. Goes on smooth and has a nice, not overpowering, scent.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and it works great!</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly.  Nice light scent.  Rubs in completely - no white residue</li>
            <li> The best smelling, least greasy and easiest to spread of the SPFs we have tried that are rated highest by EWG. We also tried Cal Baby and Badger. This is now our toddler sunscreen, as well as mine</li>
            <li> This makes my beautiful brown-skinned six year old daughter appear as though she had a flour soak-bath. Seriously, if the sun threw itself at her, I could bet my anual paycheck that the sun would bounce off of the very visible shield on her skin and land right back into orbit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you do not mind the white opaque cast and are more focused on protection,  get this sunblock! You will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does exactly what it claims it will do, including the fact that it is waterproof.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work! My daughters and I used this per the instructions and still got sunburns! Went back to regular sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Great coverage and protection.  Not as white as Think Baby, but still protects from the sun.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin whiter for some time after you rub this cream on, since it doesn&#x27;t absorb well / at all... but that&#x27;s the trade-off for a natural product. Just don&#x27;t put it on if you plan to take pictures right after...your skin will look whitish /pale...not a good look... well, unless you&#x27;re into the pale skin look ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think the coverage is weaker than the chemical-based sunscreens, so be warned and don&#x27;t use it in extreme conditions like I did: hiking a canyon in Australia in 45 Celcius heat. I got a sunburn despite putting on layers of this.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny. I love it. I have a pale white skin and it makes my skin even toned and protects well. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> Kept us sunburn free for 3 weeks.</li>
