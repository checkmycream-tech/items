    <ol>
            <li>This sampler set was a perfect way to save on money while finding the shades I wanted.</li>

            <li>Great assortment!</li>
            <li>you will have a flawless look.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great!  </li>
            <li>The foundation and setting veil make my skin look awesome without looking cakey.</li>
            <li>This mineral makeup is the best makeup I&#x27;ve used for the price.</li>
            <li>, a great buy for the price!!!</li>
            <li>There are 11 sample bottles and the brush set is perfect for travelling.  </li>
            <li>Love it!!!</li>
            <li>It was a very pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>My skin was evened out perfectly, with redness  and capillaries covered beautifully.</li>
            <li>a very good deal for this product.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>The FAIR 2 foundation is the best match for me.</li>
            <li>Not the best mineral foundation I&#x27;ve ever used, but it is still really good.</li>
            <li>Great coverage</li>
            <li>This makeup is great.</li>
            <li>Just saying lol but give it a go</li>
            <li>This set is great for those wanting to try out mineral make-up.</li>
            <li>The eye brushes are great for applying the mineral eye color.</li>
            <li>and they are a great match</li>
            <li>I am kind of pinkish, but these are perfect for the porcelain skin type gals.</li>
            <li>AS DESCRIBED THE POWDER BLENDS EVENLY AND SMOOTHS OUT THE SKIN, I WILL BE RE ORDERING FOR SURE!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Bisque concealer - very warm toned concealer</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I have redness at times from acne and this multi-tasking powder is amazing!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not losing bristles and they seem fairly soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The finishing veil is good.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and oil in my t-zone and it did a good job of keeping me matte all day.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d probably never use the Fair #2 unless it was combined with the Fair #1 maybe.</li>
            <li>But Fair #1 I must admit I like that one.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;fair&#x27; selection includes plenty of samples from which to select.  </li>
            <li>But If u do not have the money for BareMinerals, then this is a fair tread.</li>
            <li>I loved the eye shadow and blush but the foundation and multipurpose powder didnt impress me.</li>
            <li>The foundation brush fell apart and didn&#x27;t do a good job of applying foundation.</li>
            <li>Good product and good value.  </li>
            <li>One is fair and another is fair2 which is a bit darker then just fair</li>
            <li>I ordered the fair which came with fair and fair #2.  </li>
            <li>ok, not the best, BareMinerals (BM) is better.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup its great.</li>
            <li>I love the brushes they are great</li>
            <li>I am enjoying it!  </li>
            <li>Makeup covers well, love that is organic and company does not test on animals!</li>
            <li>it is easy to use and makes my face look great.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows and blush are AMAZING</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on and on about how great it is, but I don&#x27;t want to sound like a spokesperson.</li>
            <li>Also because I liked the eye shadow colors in the trial kit.</li>
            <li>I kind of wish this kit had come with sample jars of the colored concealers as I would have liked to have tried those combined with their bisque.</li>
            <li>Their Fair #1 is actually a near perfect match for me</li>
            <li>Brushes are compact and nice to use.</li>
            <li>however, you may want to find your own buki type brush.</li>
            <li>Nice purse size products.</li>
            <li>I love that once it&#x27;s on my skin feels amazing, and even through sweat and tears it stays put.</li>
            <li>This kit has a nice variety to get you acquainted with their product.</li>
            <li>Loved the mineral eye colors - fully saturated color goes on smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I ordered more product directly from the site with the enclosed coupon and I am impressed with the quality and quantity of all of the products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very light complected so the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34</li>
            <li>The eye shadows are rich colors, they have good staying power and were really complimentary to my fair complexion.</li>
            <li>Colors are just beautiful, especially for my fair skin tone.</li>
            <li>This gives very good coverage and has a nice group of brushes with the various face powder jars.</li>
            <li>let alone better.</li>
            <li>the most part I like this makeup.</li>
            <li>The bisque is okay</li>
            <li>I think it might have worked better with that combo.</li>
            <li>but it did work okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to spending a lot more on the BE product.</li>
            <li>The vials are packed to the top with powder, always something I like to see.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I do love the silky feel of everything</li>
            <li>I am 68 and find this light, nice coverage without being cakey or clown looking.</li>
            <li>the sample pack is generous for $12.99 and you could pay more than that for a drugstore or department store powder or mascara alone,  Give it  go</li>
            <li>Most of the colors are neutral and you have everything you need to decide which colors are you.  </li>
            <li>U get a lot more from IQ and there for have more of a choice to what eye color (shade)</li>
            <li>and I love how its does not have that oil feeling to it.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is that the brushes are not the best quality.</li>
            <li>I was overall very happy with this product...</li>
            <li>reminded me more of an highlighting eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product though....and will buy more products from IQ</li>
            <li>I love it -</li>
            <li>i like this sample kit for trying the different colors and the brushes were wonderful.</li>
            <li>i love this product.....</li>
            <li>i just love it, i will buy again.</li>
            <li>I love this make-up.</li>
            <li>from light to dark:&lt;br /&gt;*Apricot - warm shimmery peach (orangish)&lt;br /&gt;*Tan</li>
            <li>It will work for me in the winter for sure.</li>
            <li>I do love the brushes, the eyeshadows, and the blush.</li>
            <li>brushes are all great except the main one, which does shed a tad now and then.</li>
            <li>I have SUPER sensitive skin, but this stuff is great!</li>
            <li>I loved this kit at first.</li>
            <li>Looks great when you first put it on but quickly wears off.</li>
            <li>IQ Natural is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are working great for me so far.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with how light this makeup is.</li>
            <li>The price is perfect and I can afford to buy a whole new set every time</li>
            <li>it goes on easily and is great on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The rest of the makeup applies easily.</li>
            <li>Love my make-up completely happy with it and was delivered earlier then said</li>
            <li>My skin has had no negative reaction to this at all - which is good for the acne prone people (like myself).</li>
            <li>The quality is high in my opinion, it is very fine particles of powder and it is very easy to blend.</li>
            <li>and it works fine.</li>
            <li>Each container is filled to the brim - which I did not expect.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to get a nice even coverage</li>
            <li>I always buy the palest concealer and powder I can get, but this kit is a tad light even for me.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>and it is light feeling, and not oily at all.</li>
            <li>, powder looks and feels like chalk on a face, brushes are cheap and rough!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Warmth face color - a light cocoa colored bronzer</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Cafe - Light brown matte</li>
            <li>it contains some chemicals which doesn&#x27;t sound like it&#x27;s &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The eye shadow that looks like it would be a warm brown is so light that it barely adds any color to my skin, and I have very light skin.</li>
            <li>This is a HUGE sampler set, it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>brushes are OK and very soft, but I have brushes I have used for ever and love so prefer them.  </li>
            <li>It is still worth it just for the make-up!</li>
            <li>and I love that it is reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>but it was worth a try!</li>
            <li>The brushes, eyeshadows are very nice too, wish the packaging was a little more friendly to use-prefer the powders</li>
            <li>it washes clean with cleanser</li>
            <li>- my skin looks bright and fresh and clean, and my acne has cleared up considerably.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not too yellow, but Fair #1 works</li>
            <li>I did not expect this product to be as good as it is actually.</li>
            <li>-Most of the products in this set (blush and eye shadow) are VERY sparkly, which I did not expect and which I was specifically trying to avoid.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying just the FAIR 2 and setting veil again.</li>
            <li>Be warned: Most of these are very shimmery.  </li>
            <li>and i haven&#x27;t used that stuff since i was 15 years old, so at age 44 i needed something and this stuff is spectacular</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t cake in the lines and creases, but provides adequate coverage.</li>
            <li>I do love it though, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows are very pretty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-The foundation kind of comes on cakey even after using a very tiny bit, though I am hoping with practice I can apply it more effectively, since I am not very familiar with mineral</li>
            <li>Great kit for little money.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely would suggest getting this, at least to try out the samples and get some awesome eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>Its well worth the price</li>
            <li>was so  worth the money.</li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a couple bucks to give it a try.</li>
            <li>It has some good colors and the multiple choices for foundation help to really match it to your skin tone.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about it.</li>
            <li>think it worth to try it .</li>
            <li>alone neither was quite right</li>
            <li>and I will definitely be buying more in the full size when these samples run out.</li>
            <li>Its better to go with Bare Minerals or Pur Minerals.</li>
            <li>Got these for preteens to practice with natural soft looks and they love them!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m also going to email them and ask if they might send a slightly darker blush and just the Fair #1 x2</li>
            <li>fair foundations - one slightly darker</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re useful for that, but not for much else.</li>
            <li>I did have to use more of it to cover things the same way.</li>
            <li>I would definitely want a darker more mauve or cinnamon toned blush rather than this one.</li>
            <li>I think I actually like it better than BE</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and my skin actually seems in better condition since I started using</li>
            <li>In the hot sun sweating, just dab and no one will notice runs in ur make up.</li>
            <li>But like i said overall it was okay.</li>
            <li>5g pots are more than enough for the eyeshadows, but not enough for foundation; but good enough as sampler size.  </li>
            <li>And I will return to buy the full sized items, I literally have tossed my old (store brand, overly processed) cosmetics thanks to IQ Naturals!</li>
            <li>The brushes are pretty decent quality for the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands but till now I just didn&#x27;t find anything I liked as much,</li>
            <li>and I can see myself becoming a regular with this one.</li>
            <li>FAST DELIVERY, PRODUCT CAME EXACTLY</li>
            <li>It also covers nicely if you have some dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li>I bought this to try out a new mineral makeup...and i will admit that the first few times i wore it i loved it.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are beautiful little things, although I will admit to using a brush made especially for applying mineral powder foundation.</li>
            <li>have gotten samples from the bare minerals counter, and those were smaller, and honestly, they were really</li>
            <li>I guess if you are looking for that, fine, but don&#x27;t expect it to look much different than a nude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting older and my skin is a bit more sensitive these days apparently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been reading about the negatives of parabens too, and I decided I wanted to get away from that as much as I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too much for me as a bronzer.</li>
            <li>I just did not care much for.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t hurt to ask, and if they do then their &amp;#34;Fair&amp;#34; kit will work very well for me</li>
            <li>so I probably won&#x27;t be a BE customer much now that I&#x27;ve discovered this.</li>
            <li>I really like the eye shadow and the finishing veil.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see that the spray mist finiishing stuff does much</li>
            <li>This stuff is gentle and doesn&#x27;t break out your skin.  </li>
            <li>It does not take much and it feels,light,and</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The powder is light and doesn&#x27;t cake on, however is does come off when sweating, especially during the warmer months.</li>
            <li>; shade works really well for me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care for the IQ&#x27;s blush, it was really &#x27;shiny&#x27; on my face, pearly....</li>
            <li>fast shipment</li>
            <li>Mainly because of the fact that this makeup doesn&#x27;t have any of that and reviews here already are mostly positive.</li>
            <li>stingy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty fair skinned, but I do get a little bit of color in the summer, so the foundation is a little light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read other reviews complaining that the brushes shed pretty easily on use.</li>
            <li>Fair #2 is just a tad too dark and just a bit yellow for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a side note, the dark eyeshadow makes a fantastic eyeliner that won&#x27;t smudge or give you raccoon eyes!</li>
            <li>I like the BM brushes way better hands down.</li>
            <li>foundation colors are decent.</li>
            <li>but it is more than enough for multiple applications.</li>
            <li>They look like they would be very natural, neutral tones, but when you open the jars you can see they are full of glittery product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this starter kit if you want to give mineral makeup a try and don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money to do so.</li>
            <li>I had a high quality brush that I used instead and the foundation performed well.</li>
            <li>I have not used the entire brush set yet (haven&#x27;t needed to) but found them to be decent quality - not high quality, but nice and soft bristles.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t worn any makeup for many years and decided to &#x27;class up&#x27; a little</li>
            <li>However, IQ&#x27;s overal face color was better for me, it&#x27;s a little lighter in shade than the BE&#x27;s version</li>
            <li>The pink blush they give you is just way too light and frosted for me.</li>
            <li>Went on great, wonderful coverage, but after a few hours it started to look terrible.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard for me to find a foundation that&#x27;s fair enough</li>
            <li>But u get a very natural look with the makeup</li>
            <li>It made my face feel very clean and clear, but then after a few times it would not stay on even with the foundation and setting spray.  </li>
            <li>and it looks so natural!</li>
            <li>Great&lt;br /&gt;For sensitive skin too!</li>
            <li>You can always apply more if you feel your initial application is too sheer for your liking, but I find that just a tiny amount in the lid does the trick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why I never tried mineral makeup before, but I&#x27;m really glad that I ordered this kit.</li>
            <li>flat round).&lt;br /&gt;They feel super soft, and the minerals go on really smooth (I also like to mix a little water into the eye shadow</li>
            <li>The foundations (two colors that both work very well with my super pale skin tone) have amazing coverage with only a little product used.</li>
            <li>but i mixed them together and got a less yellowy and better look for me.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the eyeshadows as I&#x27;m pretty partial to my Hard Candy eyeshadow sets, but they also go on really easily and look very natural if you use the neutral tones.</li>
            <li>*mature</li>
            <li>But I cleaned out an old mineral make up container and just pour what I need in there</li>
            <li>I have allergies and so far NO itching and no redness.  </li>
            <li>and I would recommend some one with sensitive skin to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>It just looks like it smoothed out my natural skin tone.</li>
            <li>I have both, but once my BM is gone, I will reorder from IQ, can not beat the price for natural makeup.</li>
            <li>all natural &amp;#34; so I wonder if this sample is natural also .&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the brushes aren&#x27;t super soft, and after a few uses become very scratchy on your skin.</li>
            <li>Four different girls thoroughly enjoying the experimentation without going overboard on price or without lacking quality..</li>
            <li>Soul - Very dark cool charcoal&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pink on it&#x27;s own is pretty useless.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Bare Escentuals &amp;#34;Bare Minerals&amp;#34; mineral makeup since about 2002.</li>
            <li>I knew I could never afford Bare Minerals or BareEscentuals, so when I saw this I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;d have to say this kit was a positive experience except for a couple of colors being slightly off for me.</li>
            <li>She says it is OK but that it is rather hard to apply due to the amount of fall outs.</li>
            <li>also the sheer quality of the the petal blush its barely there</li>
            <li>Very messy loose powders and don&#x27;t go on smoothly</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this product especially if you can&#x27;t afford bare minerals</li>
            <li>; mixed with the pink blush is my new blush.</li>
            <li>I was also suprised by how much product was in these little tiny pods.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-The containers do not come with a plastic guard that a lot of powders come with to keep them from coming out too fast, so it is hard to tap out the right amount of powder into the very TINY cap without making a mess and wasting makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This mineral makeup is the best makeup I&#x27;ve used for the price.</li>
            <li> , a great buy for the price!!!</li>
            <li> There are 11 sample bottles and the brush set is perfect for travelling.  </li>
            <li> Love it!!!</li>
            <li> It was a very pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> My skin was evened out perfectly, with redness  and capillaries covered beautifully.</li>
            <li> a very good deal for this product.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> The FAIR 2 foundation is the best match for me.</li>
            <li> Not the best mineral foundation I&#x27;ve ever used, but it is still really good.</li>
            <li> Great coverage</li>
            <li> This makeup is great.</li>
            <li> Just saying lol but give it a go</li>
            <li> This set is great for those wanting to try out mineral make-up.</li>
            <li> The eye brushes are great for applying the mineral eye color.</li>
            <li> and they are a great match</li>
            <li> I am kind of pinkish, but these are perfect for the porcelain skin type gals.</li>
            <li> AS DESCRIBED THE POWDER BLENDS EVENLY AND SMOOTHS OUT THE SKIN, I WILL BE RE ORDERING FOR SURE!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Bisque concealer - very warm toned concealer</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have redness at times from acne and this multi-tasking powder is amazing!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not losing bristles and they seem fairly soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The finishing veil is good.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and oil in my t-zone and it did a good job of keeping me matte all day.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d probably never use the Fair #2 unless it was combined with the Fair #1 maybe.</li>
            <li> But Fair #1 I must admit I like that one.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;fair&#x27; selection includes plenty of samples from which to select.  </li>
            <li> But If u do not have the money for BareMinerals, then this is a fair tread.</li>
            <li> I loved the eye shadow and blush but the foundation and multipurpose powder didnt impress me.</li>
            <li> The foundation brush fell apart and didn&#x27;t do a good job of applying foundation.</li>
            <li> Good product and good value.  </li>
            <li> One is fair and another is fair2 which is a bit darker then just fair</li>
            <li> I ordered the fair which came with fair and fair #2.  </li>
            <li> ok, not the best, BareMinerals (BM) is better.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup its great.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes they are great</li>
            <li> I am enjoying it!  </li>
            <li> Makeup covers well, love that is organic and company does not test on animals!</li>
            <li> it is easy to use and makes my face look great.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows and blush are AMAZING</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on and on about how great it is, but I don&#x27;t want to sound like a spokesperson.</li>
            <li> Also because I liked the eye shadow colors in the trial kit.</li>
            <li> I kind of wish this kit had come with sample jars of the colored concealers as I would have liked to have tried those combined with their bisque.</li>
            <li> Their Fair #1 is actually a near perfect match for me</li>
            <li> Brushes are compact and nice to use.</li>
            <li> however, you may want to find your own buki type brush.</li>
            <li> Nice purse size products.</li>
            <li> I love that once it&#x27;s on my skin feels amazing, and even through sweat and tears it stays put.</li>
            <li> This kit has a nice variety to get you acquainted with their product.</li>
            <li> Loved the mineral eye colors - fully saturated color goes on smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I ordered more product directly from the site with the enclosed coupon and I am impressed with the quality and quantity of all of the products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very light complected so the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The eye shadows are rich colors, they have good staying power and were really complimentary to my fair complexion.</li>
            <li> Colors are just beautiful, especially for my fair skin tone.</li>
            <li> This gives very good coverage and has a nice group of brushes with the various face powder jars.</li>
            <li> let alone better.</li>
            <li> the most part I like this makeup.</li>
            <li> The bisque is okay</li>
            <li> I think it might have worked better with that combo.</li>
            <li> but it did work okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to spending a lot more on the BE product.</li>
            <li> The vials are packed to the top with powder, always something I like to see.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I do love the silky feel of everything</li>
            <li> I am 68 and find this light, nice coverage without being cakey or clown looking.</li>
            <li> the sample pack is generous for $12.99 and you could pay more than that for a drugstore or department store powder or mascara alone,  Give it  go</li>
            <li> Most of the colors are neutral and you have everything you need to decide which colors are you.  </li>
            <li> U get a lot more from IQ and there for have more of a choice to what eye color (shade)</li>
            <li> and I love how its does not have that oil feeling to it.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is that the brushes are not the best quality.</li>
            <li> I was overall very happy with this product...</li>
            <li> reminded me more of an highlighting eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product though....and will buy more products from IQ</li>
            <li> I love it -</li>
            <li> i like this sample kit for trying the different colors and the brushes were wonderful.</li>
            <li> i love this product.....</li>
            <li> i just love it, i will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this make-up.</li>
            <li> from light to dark:&lt;br /&gt;*Apricot - warm shimmery peach (orangish)&lt;br /&gt;*Tan</li>
            <li> It will work for me in the winter for sure.</li>
            <li> I do love the brushes, the eyeshadows, and the blush.</li>
            <li> brushes are all great except the main one, which does shed a tad now and then.</li>
            <li> I have SUPER sensitive skin, but this stuff is great!</li>
            <li> I loved this kit at first.</li>
            <li> Looks great when you first put it on but quickly wears off.</li>
            <li> IQ Natural is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are working great for me so far.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with how light this makeup is.</li>
            <li> The price is perfect and I can afford to buy a whole new set every time</li>
            <li> it goes on easily and is great on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The rest of the makeup applies easily.</li>
            <li> Love my make-up completely happy with it and was delivered earlier then said</li>
            <li> My skin has had no negative reaction to this at all - which is good for the acne prone people (like myself).</li>
            <li> The quality is high in my opinion, it is very fine particles of powder and it is very easy to blend.</li>
            <li> and it works fine.</li>
            <li> Each container is filled to the brim - which I did not expect.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to get a nice even coverage</li>
            <li> I always buy the palest concealer and powder I can get, but this kit is a tad light even for me.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> and it is light feeling, and not oily at all.</li>
            <li> , powder looks and feels like chalk on a face, brushes are cheap and rough!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Warmth face color - a light cocoa colored bronzer</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Cafe - Light brown matte</li>
            <li> it contains some chemicals which doesn&#x27;t sound like it&#x27;s &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The eye shadow that looks like it would be a warm brown is so light that it barely adds any color to my skin, and I have very light skin.</li>
            <li> This is a HUGE sampler set, it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> brushes are OK and very soft, but I have brushes I have used for ever and love so prefer them.  </li>
            <li> It is still worth it just for the make-up!</li>
            <li> and I love that it is reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> but it was worth a try!</li>
            <li> The brushes, eyeshadows are very nice too, wish the packaging was a little more friendly to use-prefer the powders</li>
            <li> it washes clean with cleanser</li>
            <li> - my skin looks bright and fresh and clean, and my acne has cleared up considerably.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not too yellow, but Fair #1 works</li>
            <li> I did not expect this product to be as good as it is actually.</li>
            <li> -Most of the products in this set (blush and eye shadow) are VERY sparkly, which I did not expect and which I was specifically trying to avoid.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying just the FAIR 2 and setting veil again.</li>
            <li> Be warned: Most of these are very shimmery.  </li>
            <li> and i haven&#x27;t used that stuff since i was 15 years old, so at age 44 i needed something and this stuff is spectacular</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t cake in the lines and creases, but provides adequate coverage.</li>
            <li> I do love it though, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are very pretty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The foundation kind of comes on cakey even after using a very tiny bit, though I am hoping with practice I can apply it more effectively, since I am not very familiar with mineral</li>
            <li> Great kit for little money.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely would suggest getting this, at least to try out the samples and get some awesome eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> Its well worth the price</li>
            <li> was so  worth the money.</li>
            <li> I figured it was worth a couple bucks to give it a try.</li>
            <li> It has some good colors and the multiple choices for foundation help to really match it to your skin tone.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about it.</li>
            <li> think it worth to try it .</li>
            <li> alone neither was quite right</li>
            <li> and I will definitely be buying more in the full size when these samples run out.</li>
            <li> Its better to go with Bare Minerals or Pur Minerals.</li>
            <li> Got these for preteens to practice with natural soft looks and they love them!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m also going to email them and ask if they might send a slightly darker blush and just the Fair #1 x2</li>
            <li> fair foundations - one slightly darker</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re useful for that, but not for much else.</li>
            <li> I did have to use more of it to cover things the same way.</li>
            <li> I would definitely want a darker more mauve or cinnamon toned blush rather than this one.</li>
            <li> I think I actually like it better than BE</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> and my skin actually seems in better condition since I started using</li>
            <li> In the hot sun sweating, just dab and no one will notice runs in ur make up.</li>
            <li> But like i said overall it was okay.</li>
            <li> 5g pots are more than enough for the eyeshadows, but not enough for foundation; but good enough as sampler size.  </li>
            <li> And I will return to buy the full sized items, I literally have tossed my old (store brand, overly processed) cosmetics thanks to IQ Naturals!</li>
            <li> The brushes are pretty decent quality for the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands but till now I just didn&#x27;t find anything I liked as much,</li>
            <li> and I can see myself becoming a regular with this one.</li>
            <li> FAST DELIVERY, PRODUCT CAME EXACTLY</li>
            <li> It also covers nicely if you have some dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try out a new mineral makeup...and i will admit that the first few times i wore it i loved it.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are beautiful little things, although I will admit to using a brush made especially for applying mineral powder foundation.</li>
            <li> have gotten samples from the bare minerals counter, and those were smaller, and honestly, they were really</li>
            <li> I guess if you are looking for that, fine, but don&#x27;t expect it to look much different than a nude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting older and my skin is a bit more sensitive these days apparently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading about the negatives of parabens too, and I decided I wanted to get away from that as much as I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too much for me as a bronzer.</li>
            <li> I just did not care much for.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t hurt to ask, and if they do then their &amp;#34;Fair&amp;#34; kit will work very well for me</li>
            <li> so I probably won&#x27;t be a BE customer much now that I&#x27;ve discovered this.</li>
            <li> I really like the eye shadow and the finishing veil.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see that the spray mist finiishing stuff does much</li>
            <li> This stuff is gentle and doesn&#x27;t break out your skin.  </li>
            <li> It does not take much and it feels,light,and</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The powder is light and doesn&#x27;t cake on, however is does come off when sweating, especially during the warmer months.</li>
            <li> ; shade works really well for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the IQ&#x27;s blush, it was really &#x27;shiny&#x27; on my face, pearly....</li>
            <li> fast shipment</li>
            <li> Mainly because of the fact that this makeup doesn&#x27;t have any of that and reviews here already are mostly positive.</li>
            <li> stingy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty fair skinned, but I do get a little bit of color in the summer, so the foundation is a little light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews complaining that the brushes shed pretty easily on use.</li>
            <li> Fair #2 is just a tad too dark and just a bit yellow for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a side note, the dark eyeshadow makes a fantastic eyeliner that won&#x27;t smudge or give you raccoon eyes!</li>
            <li> I like the BM brushes way better hands down.</li>
            <li> foundation colors are decent.</li>
            <li> but it is more than enough for multiple applications.</li>
            <li> They look like they would be very natural, neutral tones, but when you open the jars you can see they are full of glittery product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this starter kit if you want to give mineral makeup a try and don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money to do so.</li>
            <li> I had a high quality brush that I used instead and the foundation performed well.</li>
            <li> I have not used the entire brush set yet (haven&#x27;t needed to) but found them to be decent quality - not high quality, but nice and soft bristles.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t worn any makeup for many years and decided to &#x27;class up&#x27; a little</li>
            <li> However, IQ&#x27;s overal face color was better for me, it&#x27;s a little lighter in shade than the BE&#x27;s version</li>
            <li> The pink blush they give you is just way too light and frosted for me.</li>
            <li> Went on great, wonderful coverage, but after a few hours it started to look terrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to find a foundation that&#x27;s fair enough</li>
            <li> But u get a very natural look with the makeup</li>
            <li> It made my face feel very clean and clear, but then after a few times it would not stay on even with the foundation and setting spray.  </li>
            <li> and it looks so natural!</li>
            <li> Great&lt;br /&gt;For sensitive skin too!</li>
            <li> You can always apply more if you feel your initial application is too sheer for your liking, but I find that just a tiny amount in the lid does the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I never tried mineral makeup before, but I&#x27;m really glad that I ordered this kit.</li>
            <li> flat round).&lt;br /&gt;They feel super soft, and the minerals go on really smooth (I also like to mix a little water into the eye shadow</li>
            <li> The foundations (two colors that both work very well with my super pale skin tone) have amazing coverage with only a little product used.</li>
            <li> but i mixed them together and got a less yellowy and better look for me.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the eyeshadows as I&#x27;m pretty partial to my Hard Candy eyeshadow sets, but they also go on really easily and look very natural if you use the neutral tones.</li>
            <li> *mature</li>
            <li> But I cleaned out an old mineral make up container and just pour what I need in there</li>
            <li> I have allergies and so far NO itching and no redness.  </li>
            <li> and I would recommend some one with sensitive skin to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> It just looks like it smoothed out my natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> I have both, but once my BM is gone, I will reorder from IQ, can not beat the price for natural makeup.</li>
            <li> all natural &amp;#34; so I wonder if this sample is natural also .&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the brushes aren&#x27;t super soft, and after a few uses become very scratchy on your skin.</li>
            <li> Four different girls thoroughly enjoying the experimentation without going overboard on price or without lacking quality..</li>
            <li> Soul - Very dark cool charcoal&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pink on it&#x27;s own is pretty useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bare Escentuals &amp;#34;Bare Minerals&amp;#34; mineral makeup since about 2002.</li>
            <li> I knew I could never afford Bare Minerals or BareEscentuals, so when I saw this I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d have to say this kit was a positive experience except for a couple of colors being slightly off for me.</li>
            <li> She says it is OK but that it is rather hard to apply due to the amount of fall outs.</li>
            <li> also the sheer quality of the the petal blush its barely there</li>
            <li> Very messy loose powders and don&#x27;t go on smoothly</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this product especially if you can&#x27;t afford bare minerals</li>
            <li> ; mixed with the pink blush is my new blush.</li>
            <li> I was also suprised by how much product was in these little tiny pods.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The containers do not come with a plastic guard that a lot of powders come with to keep them from coming out too fast, so it is hard to tap out the right amount of powder into the very TINY cap without making a mess and wasting makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The eyeshadows would last long time .</li>
            <li> My skin is average, not oily, but after about 3 hours with this makeup my entire face was oily, splotchy, and just gross.</li>
            <li> The tiny containers can be messy if you&#x27;re not careful, but you&#x27;ll get the hang of not dusting it everywhere.</li>
            <li> I would never go back to any other</li>
            <li> I prefer the Bare Escentuals mineral veil, it has a little &#x27;glow&#x27; to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting dark under eye areas and have some red I need to cover now and again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they are not loaded down with fragrance a big plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a little too much orange, a little too dark</li>
            <li> It smells about the same seems maybe a bit less noticeable,</li>
            <li> as it get older now…it becomes harder to deal with very small containers.</li>
            <li> The jars are about the size of a BE eyeshadow, a little smaller maybe.</li>
            <li> The size of each container is a little bit bigger than a quarter</li>
            <li> as blusher over the pink they send you.</li>
            <li> Blush - subdued pink shimmery blush</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s expected .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As others have said, a little goes a long way, so do follow the directions to use just a pinch and then swirl and tap your brush before applying.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> They will probably last a while even though they are so small.</li>
            <li> so even the small samples will last awhile.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I would recommend to someone wanting to \\&quot;test drive\\&quot; this product.</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people who are dead set on the name brand gave this stuff bad reviews, but I suggest you ignore them like you do people who insist StarBucks is better than every other coffee.</li>
            <li> the foundation was a little powdery/chalky but not a huge issue, the mineral veil was a bit flat..</li>
            <li> but it does use bismuth, at least they did as of the last time</li>
            <li> My skin is never that dark, not even in Summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used minerals before and had the technique down in a day.</li>
            <li> BM has less of a mess,I do not know why, for they both r powders, it might have to do with the brushes that u apply the powder with.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s less then what you would pay at walmart for there cheep stuff..</li>
            <li> I find IQ a bit mess, so u will be wiping up powder once u have finished applying ur make up.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the containers are too small.</li>
            <li> and you can tuck the little container in a corner of your bag for a touch up.  </li>
            <li> It blends as well, but doesn&#x27;t feel quite as heavy.</li>
            <li> When I put the blush on my face, it has exactly this effect - a very fake, overdone shiny look, even with just the smallest bit of the blush.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t broken out since I stopped using regular makeup.</li>
            <li> I did like a few of the items, but the rest are just too shiny for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it comes with 5 brushes (foundation, angled, medium round, liner,</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s small and because of that it could be messy</li>
            <li> little samples are about 1 inch in diameter, but they are PACKED!</li>
            <li> The portions are small but then again this is just supposed to be a sample of what they carry.</li>
            <li> I have very pale ivory skin</li>
            <li> The powder is also quite messy, it&#x27;s very hard to prevent powder from going everywhere</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re hard to get a brush into.</li>
            <li> Lately though the BE makeup just hasn&#x27;t been agreeing with my skin.</li>
            <li> the sample pack containers are way small and very hard for me to use as I have arthritis in my fingers.</li>
            <li> This is much less expensive and in some ways</li>
            <li> Also the jar&#x27;s were so small it was almost impossible not to make a mess.  </li>
            <li> Bliss - shimmery dusty rose&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes weren&#x27;t bad but they are small.</li>
            <li> You may want to purchase a base concealer for those who have dark spots or acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too expensive and you might like it .</li>
            <li> Selected the wrong shade, contacted seller immediately, got no response.</li>
            <li> all of us ladies know that if you get dry skin from time to time that it makes it look like you have make up on and looks nasty but this make up does not do that at all...</li>
            <li> i hate</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, very disappointed, although I will keep practicing on off-days to see if the foundation, bisque, and mineral veil are still usable.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bare Escentuals &amp;#34;Bare Minerals&amp;#34; mineral makeup since about 2002. I&#x27;ve tried other brands but till now I just didn&#x27;t find anything I liked as much, let alone better. Lately though the BE makeup just hasn&#x27;t been agreeing with my skin. I&#x27;m getting older and my skin is a bit more sensitive these days apparently. The one thing I never cared for with the BE makeup was their use of bismuth. Anything with bismuth it just makes my skin itch. I&#x27;ve been reading about the negatives of parabens too, and I decided I wanted to get away from that as much as I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE doesn&#x27;t have that but it does use bismuth, at least they did as of the last time I ordered a big kit. After perusing Amazon and reading ingredient lists I chose to try this kit. Mainly because of the fact that this makeup doesn&#x27;t have any of that and reviews here already are mostly positive. Also because I liked the eye shadow colors in the trial kit. These are colors I&#x27;d use a lot so I didn&#x27;t feel like I was wasting money on colors I&#x27;d never use just to get trials on everything else. The jars are about the size of a BE eyeshadow, a little smaller maybe. The brushes weren&#x27;t bad but they are small. I put them in my purse kit. They&#x27;re useful for that, but not for much else. But they&#x27;re sturdy. They&#x27;re not losing bristles and they seem fairly soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part I like this makeup. It&#x27;s about the same grind as the BE mineral makeup, feels a bit silkier to me actually. It smells about the same seems maybe a bit less noticeable, the smell. It blends as well, but doesn&#x27;t feel quite as heavy. The finishing veil is good. I have combination skin and oil in my t-zone and it did a good job of keeping me matte all day. The foundation covers well and doesn&#x27;t make my face itch at all. The bisque is okay but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s got quite the coverage of the BE bisque. I did have to use more of it to cover things the same way. I kind of wish this kit had come with sample jars of the colored concealers as I would have liked to have tried those combined with their bisque. I think it might have worked better with that combo. I&#x27;m admittedly at a point where a simple bisque concealer is probably not enough for me. I&#x27;m getting dark under eye areas and have some red I need to cover now and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; mixed with the pink blush is my new blush. It&#x27;s too much for me as a bronzer. I have very pale ivory skin and it just does not work for me all over. Just a little too much orange, a little too dark but it did work okay as blusher over the pink they send you. Combining both that gave me a blusher that worked well for me. The pink blush they give you is just way too light and frosted for me. It just doesn&#x27;t show up at all. It was the one product in the kit I just did not care much for. I would definitely want a darker more mauve or cinnamon toned blush rather than this one. The pink on it&#x27;s own is pretty useless. I had to combine the two or forget it. It didn&#x27;t even look like I had any color on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foundation colors are decent. Their Fair #1 is actually a near perfect match for me but I&#x27;d probably never use the Fair #2 unless it was combined with the Fair #1 maybe. My skin is never that dark, not even in Summer. But Fair #1 I must admit I like that one. It&#x27;s hard for me to find a foundation that&#x27;s fair enough that&#x27;s not too yellow, but Fair #1 works well. Fair #2 is just a tad too dark and just a bit yellow for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d have to say this kit was a positive experience except for a couple of colors being slightly off for me. I do plan on ordering a big kit but I&#x27;m also going to email them and ask if they might send a slightly darker blush and just the Fair #1 x2 instead since they&#x27;re supposedly picking the cosmetics as they pack for you. Can&#x27;t hurt to ask, and if they do then their &amp;#34;Fair&amp;#34; kit will work very well for me and I can see myself becoming a regular with this one. I did not expect this product to be as good as it is actually. It was a very pleasant surprise. I&#x27;m used to spending a lot more on the BE product. This is much less expensive and in some ways I think I actually like it better than BE so I probably won&#x27;t be a BE customer much now that I&#x27;ve discovered this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Great coverage and it looks so natural! Great&lt;br /&gt;For sensitive skin too! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I had not tried mineral makeup in sometime and didn&#x27;t yet want to invest big bucks into it. This sampler set was a perfect way to save on money while finding the shades I wanted. This is a HUGE sampler set, it is worth every penny! Each container is filled to the brim - which I did not expect. The quality is high in my opinion, it is very fine particles of powder and it is very easy to blend. They include two foundation shades, a veil and a concealer (or the Biisque multi-tasking powder). I have redness at times from acne and this multi-tasking powder is amazing! It does not cake, it covers well and stays on for my day. My skin has had no negative reaction to this at all - which is good for the acne prone people (like myself). It also covers nicely if you have some dark under eye circles. The eye shadows are rich colors, they have good staying power and were really complimentary to my fair complexion. I have a feeling the sampler set will last me months. And I will return to buy the full sized items, I literally have tossed my old (store brand, overly processed) cosmetics thanks to IQ Naturals! In the photos I tried to show the size and amount (and shades) of what you receive. I have not used the entire brush set yet (haven&#x27;t needed to) but found them to be decent quality - not high quality, but nice and soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Great product!  5g pots are more than enough for the eyeshadows, but not enough for foundation; but good enough as sampler size.  I will definitely buy more of this stuff.  Brushes are compact and nice to use.</li>
            <li> Great assortment! This gives very good coverage and has a nice group of brushes with the various face powder jars. My skin was evened out perfectly, with redness  and capillaries covered beautifully.</li>
            <li> The vials are packed to the top with powder, always something I like to see. Colors are just beautiful, especially for my fair skin tone. As others have said, a little goes a long way, so do follow the directions to use just a pinch and then swirl and tap your brush before applying. You can always apply more if you feel your initial application is too sheer for your liking, but I find that just a tiny amount in the lid does the trick. The brushes are beautiful little things, although I will admit to using a brush made especially for applying mineral powder foundation. The bigger brush included here will work okay though, especially if you are looking for a sheerer application. If you, like me, have...umm...*mature* skin, just take a second or two to moisturize and/or prime your skin...you will have a flawless look.</li>
            <li> This makeup is great. The foundations (two colors that both work very well with my super pale skin tone) have amazing coverage with only a little product used. The eyeshadows and blush are AMAZING and I will definitely be buying more in the full size when these samples run out. I was also suprised by how much product was in these little tiny pods. They will probably last a while even though they are so small. My only complaint is that the containers are too small. They&#x27;re hard to get a brush into. But I cleaned out an old mineral make up container and just pour what I need in there and it works fine. I absolutely would suggest getting this, at least to try out the samples and get some awesome eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> Great kit for little money.  I hadn&#x27;t worn any makeup for many years and decided to &#x27;class up&#x27; a little so I purchased this sample kit.  I am enjoying it!  The &#x27;fair&#x27; selection includes plenty of samples from which to select.  Takes almost no makeup to do the job.</li>
            <li> I have been using a couple weeks now. the sample pack containers are way small and very hard for me to use as I have arthritis in my fingers. I had to buy a container a bit larger and transfer the foundation to that.  If they were flatter and wider it would help but that might not be possible.&lt;br /&gt;the brushes are OK and very soft, but I have brushes I have used for ever and love so prefer them.  No reflectionn on the implement I just have my favorites.  I do love the silky feel of everything and they are not loaded down with fragrance a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;  I have allergies and so far NO itching and no redness.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to get a nice even coverage so even the small samples will last awhile.  I ordered the fair which came with fair and fair #2.  alone neither was quite right but i mixed them together and got a less yellowy and better look for me.  I really like the eye shadow and the finishing veil. also the sheer quality of the the petal blush its barely there but just a hint which I like.  I don&#x27;t see that the spray mist finiishing stuff does much but it doesn&#x27;t itch so I have it if the mood hits.  I am 68 and find this light, nice coverage without being cakey or clown looking. Silky feel and you can tuck the little container in a corner of your bag for a touch up.  I would buy again and I would recommend some one with sensitive skin to give it a try.  the sample pack is generous for $12.99 and you could pay more than that for a drugstore or department store powder or mascara alone,  Give it  go Girls</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  Most of the colors are neutral and you have everything you need to decide which colors are you.  This stuff is gentle and doesn&#x27;t break out your skin.  Its well worth the price and I will probably be purchasing full-sized foundation, a veil, and some of the shadows later.  The brushes are pretty decent quality for the price!</li>
            <li> I knew I could never afford Bare Minerals or BareEscentuals, so when I saw this I had to give it a try. I know a lot of people who are dead set on the name brand gave this stuff bad reviews, but I suggest you ignore them like you do people who insist StarBucks is better than every other coffee. IQ Natural is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being a sample size, I&#x27;ve had this kit for 5 months, using it 2-4 days a week, and there&#x27;s still a ton left. I doubt I&#x27;ll ever use up all the eyeshadow and blush.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are all great except the main one, which does shed a tad now and then. It&#x27;s not a big deal and I do have another brush I can use.&lt;br /&gt;The colors of the kit run a bit lighter than you might expect, so I&#x27;d suggest going a shade darker. I always buy the palest concealer and powder I can get, but this kit is a tad light even for me.&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, the dark eyeshadow makes a fantastic eyeliner that won&#x27;t smudge or give you raccoon eyes! I apply it with the angle brush and I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the makeup applies easily. I&#x27;d never used minerals before and had the technique down in a day. The tiny containers can be messy if you&#x27;re not careful, but you&#x27;ll get the hang of not dusting it everywhere. I love that once it&#x27;s on my skin feels amazing, and even through sweat and tears it stays put. a 95 degree GA day didn&#x27;t muss this makeup! it washes clean with cleanser and my skin actually seems in better condition since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on and on about how great it is, but I don&#x27;t want to sound like a spokesperson. I do love it though, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> -Most of the products in this set (blush and eye shadow) are VERY sparkly, which I did not expect and which I was specifically trying to avoid. They look like they would be very natural, neutral tones, but when you open the jars you can see they are full of glittery product. I wanted something I could use for a bridal look, and it is not recommended that you use something with glitter, as this can make your face look shiny and sweaty. When I put the blush on my face, it has exactly this effect - a very fake, overdone shiny look, even with just the smallest bit of the blush. So the blush is a total waste, and the eye shadows aren&#x27;t much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The foundation kind of comes on cakey even after using a very tiny bit, though I am hoping with practice I can apply it more effectively, since I am not very familiar with mineral foundations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The makeup did not last on my face all day, even though I used the mineral veil finishing powder and the spray that is supposed to help it stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-There is not a ton of pigment to these colors. The eye shadow that looks like it would be a warm brown is so light that it barely adds any color to my skin, and I have very light skin. It just looks like it smoothed out my natural skin tone. I guess if you are looking for that, fine, but don&#x27;t expect it to look much different than a nude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The containers do not come with a plastic guard that a lot of powders come with to keep them from coming out too fast, so it is hard to tap out the right amount of powder into the very TINY cap without making a mess and wasting makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very disappointed, although I will keep practicing on off-days to see if the foundation, bisque, and mineral veil are still usable.</li>
            <li> ok, not the best, BareMinerals (BM) is better. But If u do not have the money for BareMinerals, then this is a fair tread. I have both, but once my BM is gone, I will reorder from IQ, can not beat the price for natural makeup. I like the BM brushes way better hands down. U get a lot more from IQ and there for have more of a choice to what eye color (shade) u will apply. I find IQ a bit mess, so u will be wiping up powder once u have finished applying ur make up. BM has less of a mess,I do not know why, for they both r powders, it might have to do with the brushes that u apply the powder with. But u get a very natural look with the makeup and it is light feeling, and not oily at all. In the hot sun sweating, just dab and no one will notice runs in ur make up.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup its great.I got it back in February and wanted to try a test kit .It was so  worth the money.It is now August and I still have a lot left.It does not take much and it feels,light,and all of us ladies know that if you get dry skin from time to time that it makes it look like you have make up on and looks nasty but this make up does not do that at all...I love the brushes they are great and I love how its does not have that oil feeling to it.All ladies out there get this make up you wont go back and it&#x27;s less then what you would pay at walmart for there cheep stuff..Just saying lol but give it a go and I don&#x27;t write reviews vary often.Thanks</li>
            <li> I like this kit alot. The foundation and setting veil make my skin look awesome without looking cakey. The FAIR 2 foundation is the best match for me.Warmth and the blush have shimmer in it which I didn&#x27;t like because I have oily skin and I wanted an all over matte finish.The eyeshadows are very pretty. I will definitely be buying just the FAIR 2 and setting veil again.</li>
            <li> Got these for preteens to practice with natural soft looks and they love them! Four different girls thoroughly enjoying the experimentation without going overboard on price or without lacking quality..</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. These are working great for me so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try out a new mineral makeup...and i will admit that the first few times i wore it i loved it.  It made my face feel very clean and clear, but then after a few times it would not stay on even with the foundation and setting spray.  Also the jar&#x27;s were so small it was almost impossible not to make a mess.  If I do buy it again it will be the bigger containers for ease of use.  But like i said overall it was okay.</li>
            <li> This kit has a nice variety to get you acquainted with their product. The portions are small but then again this is just supposed to be a sample of what they carry. The cover-up works well, but isn&#x27;t a 100% concealer. You may want to purchase a base concealer for those who have dark spots or acne. The powder is light and doesn&#x27;t cake on, however is does come off when sweating, especially during the warmer months. The powder is also quite messy, it&#x27;s very hard to prevent powder from going everywhere so beware of that. The only downside is that the brushes aren&#x27;t super soft, and after a few uses become very scratchy on your skin. I would advise using different brushes. Other than that I would recommend to someone wanting to \\&quot;test drive\\&quot; this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I never tried mineral makeup before, but I&#x27;m really glad that I ordered this kit. I figured it was worth a couple bucks to give it a try. I went from using liquid makeup and a liquid concealer to this and I&#x27;m pleased with how light this makeup is. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing any makeup at all. I&#x27;m very light complected so the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; shade works really well for me. The size of each container is a little bit bigger than a quarter but it is more than enough for multiple applications. I&#x27;ve read other reviews complaining that the brushes shed pretty easily on use. I haven&#x27;t had this problem but even if I did, I have another brush kit I can use so that really isn&#x27;t a big deal. I don&#x27;t really use the eyeshadows as I&#x27;m pretty partial to my Hard Candy eyeshadow sets, but they also go on really easily and look very natural if you use the neutral tones. I&#x27;d highly recommend this starter kit if you want to give mineral makeup a try and don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money to do so.</li>
            <li> This mineral makeup is the best makeup I&#x27;ve used for the price. It lasted me over 5 months and I haven&#x27;t broken out since I stopped using regular makeup. Definitely recommend this product especially if you can&#x27;t afford bare minerals</li>
            <li> I like the coverage I get with this makeup</li>
            <li> This set is great for those wanting to try out mineral make-up. It has some good colors and the multiple choices for foundation help to really match it to your skin tone. The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is that the brushes are not the best quality. It is still worth it just for the make-up!</li>
            <li> Makeup covers well, love that is organic and company does not test on animals!</li>
            <li> I loved the eye shadow and blush but the foundation and multipurpose powder didnt impress me. Looks great when you first put it on but quickly wears off.</li>
            <li> I have SUPER sensitive skin, but this stuff is great! The only thing I reacted to was the blush. Made my face itchy. But everything else works like a dream...doesn&#x27;t cake in the lines and creases, but provides adequate coverage. Will definitely be buying from them again...however, you may want to find your own buki type brush. The one that came in this package leaves hairs all over my face and broke within 2 weeks of getting.</li>
            <li> FAST DELIVERY, PRODUCT CAME EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED THE POWDER BLENDS EVENLY AND SMOOTHS OUT THE SKIN, I WILL BE RE ORDERING FOR SURE!!</li>
            <li> Not crazy about it. Don&#x27;t like how it feels on my face.</li>
            <li> Do not like it at all!  Very messy loose powders and don&#x27;t go on smoothly, powder looks and feels like chalk on a face, brushes are cheap and rough!&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to waist your money on it. Its better to go with Bare Minerals or Pur Minerals.</li>
            <li> Be warned: Most of these are very shimmery.  I did like a few of the items, but the rest are just too shiny for me.  Even the blush is shimmery.  I felt like a fairy.  If you&#x27;re not into shimmer, you should probably try something else.</li>
            <li> Love my make-up completely happy with it and was delivered earlier then said</li>
            <li> Not the best mineral foundation I&#x27;ve ever used, but it is still really good. Loved the mineral eye colors - fully saturated color goes on smooth and silky. The foundation brush fell apart and didn&#x27;t do a good job of applying foundation. I had a high quality brush that I used instead and the foundation performed well. The eye brushes are great for applying the mineral eye color.</li>
            <li> I was overall very happy with this product...the foundation was a little powdery/chalky but not a huge issue, the mineral veil was a bit flat..I prefer the Bare Escentuals mineral veil, it has a little &#x27;glow&#x27; to it.  However, IQ&#x27;s overal face color was better for me, it&#x27;s a little lighter in shade than the BE&#x27;s version (&#x27;warmth&#x27;). I didn&#x27;t care for the IQ&#x27;s blush, it was really &#x27;shiny&#x27; on my face, pearly....reminded me more of an highlighting eyeshadow.  The brushes, eyeshadows are very nice too, wish the packaging was a little more friendly to use-prefer the powders all had that cover over it with the holes to reduce dumping out and overloading your brushes.  I would recommend this product though....and will buy more products from IQ</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this make up. I love it - it goes on easily and is great on my sensitive skin.  The price is perfect and I can afford to buy a whole new set every time so I get different shadows etc instead of just replacing one color or powder at a time. I have recommended it to friends and would recommend it to anyone. I started using this around the same time I started Origins moisturizer and they are a great match - my skin looks bright and fresh and clean, and my acne has cleared up considerably.</li>
            <li> i like this sample kit for trying the different colors and the brushes were wonderful. a very good deal for this product.&lt;br /&gt;But as it get older now…it becomes harder to deal with very small containers.</li>
            <li> i love this product.....it is easy to use and makes my face look great. i hate foundation and powders always felt like i was wearing something and i haven&#x27;t used that stuff since i was 15 years old, so at age 44 i needed something and this stuff is spectacular i just love it, i will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this make-up. I would never go back to any other make up that I have ever used! I always get compliments on how it looks and I love that it is reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> I got the &amp;#34;Fair&amp;#34; set, and this is what I got:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR FACE:&lt;br /&gt;*2 fair foundations - one slightly darker&lt;br /&gt;*Bisque concealer - very warm toned concealer&lt;br /&gt;*Warmth face color - a light cocoa colored bronzer&lt;br /&gt;*Setting Veil - translucent setting powder&lt;br /&gt;*Petal Blush - subdued pink shimmery blush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EYESHADOWS from light to dark:&lt;br /&gt;*Apricot - warm shimmery peach (orangish)&lt;br /&gt;*Tan Bliss - shimmery dusty rose&lt;br /&gt;*Cafe - Light brown matte&lt;br /&gt;*Khaki - Shimmery subdued neutral green&lt;br /&gt;*Dark Soul - Very dark cool charcoal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these little samples are about 1 inch in diameter, but they are PACKED! The makeup goes all the way to the brim.&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten samples from the bare minerals counter, and those were smaller, and honestly, they were really stingy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty fair skinned, but I do get a little bit of color in the summer, so the foundation is a little light. I am kind of pinkish, but these are perfect for the porcelain skin type gals. It will work for me in the winter for sure. They told me later that they have a color chart on their website, so I would check that out if I were you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it comes with 5 brushes (foundation, angled, medium round, liner, flat round).&lt;br /&gt;They feel super soft, and the minerals go on really smooth (I also like to mix a little water into the eye shadow - I mix it in the cap of the container - it makes it brighter and lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, a great buy for the price!!!</li>
            <li> Good product and good value.  There are 11 sample bottles and the brush set is perfect for travelling.  I ordered more product directly from the site with the enclosed coupon and I am impressed with the quality and quantity of all of the products</li>
            <li> got this for a gift for my in laws for christmas and have heard no complaints to this point.  fast shipment</li>
            <li> I bought it to try out . It is a trial size so it&#x27;s small and because of that it could be messy but it&#x27;s expected .&lt;br /&gt;I like the foundation ( it has 2 tones . One is fair and another is fair2 which is a bit darker then just fair so you can match it to your skin tone ) . But then I saw foundation for sale separately it contains some chemicals which doesn&#x27;t sound like it&#x27;s &amp;#34; all natural &amp;#34; so I wonder if this sample is natural also .&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadows would last long time . Especially some colors :-)&lt;br /&gt;So overall I like the foundation but wonder about it&#x27;s content . The rest of the set ( eyeshadows , blush and bronzer ) would last longer then foundation .&lt;br /&gt;I think it worth to try it . It&#x27;s not too expensive and you might like it .</li>
            <li> I loved this kit at first. Went on great, wonderful coverage, but after a few hours it started to look terrible. My skin is average, not oily, but after about 3 hours with this makeup my entire face was oily, splotchy, and just gross. I do love the brushes, the eyeshadows, and the blush. The foundation just leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> Selected the wrong shade, contacted seller immediately, got no response. So, I ended up giving it to a friend. She says it is OK but that it is rather hard to apply due to the amount of fall outs. She loves the brushes though! I do not think she or I will be buying this product again but it was worth a try!</li>
            <li> Nice purse size products. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
