            <li>happy I finally found the perfect top coat.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best one I&#x27;ve used!  </li>
            <li>This top coat is amazing..</li>
            <li>I have a $2 Shiny Top Coat that works just as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite but</li>
            <li>I used to love &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34; top coat</li>
            <li>This is the next best thing!</li>
            <li>I love the gloss and sheen.  </li>
            <li>I was using another top selling brand before trying Probelle</li>
            <li>This top coat is the answer to my prayers.</li>
            <li>LOVE..</li>
            <li>I decided to use the Probelle Top Coat</li>
            <li>If you are looking for the perfect top coat, look no further.</li>
            <li>Pair any OPI color with this top coat</li>
            <li>My nails feel strong and healthy,  they stay shiny and unchipped for days.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>I only use OPI nail polishes on my nails because I love that they apply smoothly and the colors are great.</li>
            <li>I have always loved how the colors look when people use gel, but I don’t like doing gel on myself as I like leaving my nails natural’s.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>Very glossy top coat.</li>
            <li>and when I use most top coats, the red color bleeds onto the brush.  </li>
            <li>I have not had this top coat for long, but so far it and Nubar are my favorite top coats.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It really is nothing special.  </li>
            <li>The finish that it gives my nails are even better than the gel, my nails last longer and it dries very fast.</li>
            <li>As I mention, this top coat really does seem to shine longer and make the nail polish underneath last longer.  </li>
            <li>Top coat doesn&#x27;t hold up very long</li>
            <li>I had previously been using OPI top coat, but found that while it looked great, it didn&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Much better quality than expected!</li>
            <li>Was hoping this would be a super shiny thick glossy top coat.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok to have but not really worth 8 dollars.</li>
            <li>After finding this I won&#x27;t go back to using any other top coat!</li>
            <li>The top coat performs as expected and I think it makes my home manicure last much longer.  </li>
            <li>Two coats of this, on subsequent days, kept my polish fresh for over 12 days.</li>
            <li>but truthfully, it is worth the extra money for the professional finish!</li>
            <li>Primarily use on toes and due to always having flip flops on, my nail polish take a beating.</li>
            <li>I work as a nurse and wash my hands constantly, nail polish stays on and remains very glossy.</li>
            <li>Gives high gloss and dries almost instantly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll dry fast and keep the polish on for a while</li>
            <li>Just when I was about to give up on trying to find a top coat that could at least last a week without chipping or peeling,  I decided to try this.  </li>
            <li>Dries Fast and gived wet look finish.</li>
            <li>I thought at first that this top coat did not pick up the red color, but it does pick it up from at least some brands,  However, it picks up far less than other brands I have tried</li>

            <li> Was hoping this would be a super shiny thick glossy top coat.  It really is nothing special.  I have a $2 Shiny Top Coat that works just as well. It&#x27;s not my favorite but in comparison to this it&#x27;s just as good. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very glossy top coat. I used to love &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34; top coat but I can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere. This is the next best thing!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat. I work as a nurse and wash my hands constantly, nail polish stays on and remains very glossy. Best product!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good top coat that won&#x27;t chip for awhile so I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them.  This is by far the best one I&#x27;ve used!  My nails feel strong and healthy,  they stay shiny and unchipped for days.  After finding this I won&#x27;t go back to using any other top coat!</li>
            <li> Dries Fast and gived wet look finish. Manicure lasted 9 days. Recommended</li>
            <li> The top coat performs as expected and I think it makes my home manicure last much longer.  I love the gloss and sheen.  It looks great over any type of polish.  I was using another top selling brand before trying Probelle and I think both perform equally.  As I mention, this top coat really does seem to shine longer and make the nail polish underneath last longer.  If you are on the fence about Probelle, there is no need to be.  Take a chance, as I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love the shine! I was skeptical and even not happy about paying $8+ for some darn nail polish for my acrylic nails but truthfully, it is worth the extra money for the professional finish!</li>
            <li> This top coat is the answer to my prayers. I work in the medical field, and wash my hands A LOT. Two coats of this, on subsequent days, kept my polish fresh for over 12 days. It is easy to apply, and dries very quickly. Even my manicurist was impressed and asked me what it was.</li>
            <li> Great top coat. Primarily use on toes and due to always having flip flops on, my nail polish take a beating. This stuff has extended my pedi nicely.</li>
            <li> Just when I was about to give up on trying to find a top coat that could at least last a week without chipping or peeling,  I decided to try this.  LOVE.. LOVE.. LOVE!!  I painted my nails a week ago, and my nails look just as good now as the day I polished them.  No chipping or peeling, and the shine is amazing!! I have tried just about every topcoat you can imagine and finally found something that actually does what it claims to do!!!</li>
            <li> I have always loved how the colors look when people use gel, but I don’t like doing gel on myself as I like leaving my nails natural’s. I decided to use the Probelle Top Coat and I LOVE IT! The finish that it gives my nails are even better than the gel, my nails last longer and it dries very fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll dry fast and keep the polish on for a while but it starts to peel after a few hours. It&#x27;s ok to have but not really worth 8 dollars.</li>
            <li> Top coat doesn&#x27;t hold up very long</li>
            <li> Gives high gloss and dries almost instantly</li>
            <li> Just a great top coat--never peals.</li>
            <li> Much better quality than expected! Stays glossy, much more so than other expensive nail brands.</li>
            <li> This top coat is amazing.. it is definitely long lasting... manicure lasts about 17-12 days with this compare to usually just a few days for me... it has a thick finish and looks like gel manicure... no need to go to salon anymore!!</li>
            <li> Waste of money. The shine is bland, and it looks dull after one day. I will not purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I have not had this top coat for long, but so far it and Nubar are my favorite top coats.  I wear mostly red and coral nail polish and when I use most top coats, the red color bleeds onto the brush.  I thought at first that this top coat did not pick up the red color, but it does pick it up from at least some brands,  However, it picks up far less than other brands I have tried so I still favor it.</li>
            <li> So dissanpointed... Its really bad. I did not last even three days and longer pieces is on.</li>
            <li> It leaves a beautiful shine to my nails! I&#x27;ll be using this from now!</li>
            <li> Worth the price! Dries in less than a minure and shines like a gel. Makes my manicure last over a week!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the perfect top coat, look no further. This stuff is the real deal. I had previously been using OPI top coat, but found that while it looked great, it didn&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped. I wanted to find something that would make my manicure last and not chip. Based on reviews, I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9 days after I did my nails, they are still perfect and do not have any chips. I only use OPI nail polishes on my nails because I love that they apply smoothly and the colors are great. Pair any OPI color with this top coat and I guarantee you will have great results. Every day I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on my nails and everyone thinks they are gel! They can&#x27;t believe that I did them myself and that it is regular nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy I finally found the perfect top coat. It is well worth the price. Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
