            <li>I wear this to sleep and have nice dreams.</li>
            <li>To be honest I don&#x27;t wear it.</li>
            <li>The lotion smells great, but doesn&#x27;t really work good as a lotion.</li>
            <li>:) Thank you! :)</li>
            <li>My Granddaughter claims this as her favorite lotion, and I was so happy I could surprise her with it during her adjustment time when away from home for the first time.  </li>
            <li>This got strong perfume kind fragrance sometime it brings headache.</li>
            <li>I loved how it was more Gothic looking, and the smell was sweet but sexy.</li>
            <li>:&gt;)</li>
            <li>Kiss is wonderful, enticing, mysterious.</li>
            <li>Lasts through the day without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I rather just let it sit and put on something more fresher.</li>
            <li>and I think I was going to love this lotion</li>
            <li>great fragrance Shipped fast</li>
            <li>Excellent product with a very different and pleasing fragrance</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Was glad to find this on Amazon...one of my favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li>I cant tell you how many times Ive gotten laid from using this.</li>
            <li>I wear it all the time, but I feel like it smells better in the fall.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I am in love with this scent.</li>
            <li>; A wonderful body lotion for general use and I certainly recommend it; (This review was from my wife who had me order this product and was very glad she did!)&lt;br /&gt;Mike</li>
            <li>When I first got it i loved it.</li>
            <li>Very good, but it takes long time to reach.</li>
            <li>The dark Kiss lotion is an excellent choice for me</li>
            <li>This is a really good new scent from B&amp;B.</li>
            <li>, the quite one just think I&#x27;m gay  .</li>
            <li>The scent is light &amp; seems to be a crowd pleaser.</li>
            <li>A lady is a woman who is most diligently kept, reserved, funny, excitingly witty and extraordinarily accustomed to the ways of properness.</li>
            <li>This one I think would be labeled as my ultimate favorite! :)</li>
            <li>It is either sweet to the death or woody to the death or clean and fresh...to the death.</li>
            <li>It has a sweet fruity smell.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite scent by BBW.</li>
            <li>It is however not too sweet smelling and is not over powering.</li>
            <li>I know I sound like a paid advertisement right now,</li>
            <li>I do like this fragrance, it&#x27;s fun and unique.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a dude, I don&#x27;t know how best to explain the subtle glory of this.  </li>
            <li>I love it because it doesn&#x27;t stay sickly sweet, it changes into a more romantic, calm tenderness after about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you do not like sweet fragrances like Vanilla (before Dark Kiss, Warm Vanilla Sugar was my favorite BBW</li>
            <li>It does come off very strongly as a sweet scent at first.</li>
            <li>It just doesnt smell fresh to me.</li>
            <li>(smile)</li>
            <li>As soon as I smelled this, I knew it was the right one.</li>
            <li>It is definitely the kind of scent you want to wear at night, but during the day it takes on a more candy like characteristic.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li>Well, it smells mellow and sexy at the same time.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Where her husband does not mind her being &amp;#34;showy&amp;#34;, if she is indeed married.</li>
            <li>purchased this for her as she loves it, sadly no pants access has been granted.  </li>
            <li>she was and still a loyal customer but was surprised about it .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sooooo good and last long</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t give you much room for imagination and exploration.</li>
            <li>Very seductive.</li>
            <li>As we know, some BBS items are only available once or perhaps twice annually.  </li>
            <li>this is a real loss.</li>
            <li>Normally Bath and Body Works product are too fruity or flowery for my taste, but I really like this one!</li>
            <li>It is not a simple sweet or woody smell.</li>
            <li>Usually I have a strong sense of smell and always chooses the right one.</li>
            <li>In fact, I got the whole set - lotion, spray, body wash- for 25 bucks when it first came out during Christmas last year.</li>
            <li>In fact, I got the whole set - lotion, spray, body wash- for 25 bucks when it first came out during Christmas last year.</li>
            <li>I will continue using this fragrance, and it will be the only consistent BBW product I use.</li>
            <li>I will continue using this fragrance, and it will be the only consistent BBW product I use.</li>
            <li>I think itd probably smell better during the fall or the winter though because its very heavy and seductive smelling.</li>
            <li>The lotion really stings when you apply it to dry skin, and doesn&#x27;t really moisturize.</li>
            <li>If you are lucky to find it and get it, do so because it was in stores for a limited  time only</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I would classify the smell though, to be about betrayal, more like seduction, but subtly so.</li>
            <li>Not Dark Kiss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, it is great that Amazon usually has a lot of these hard to find fragrances all year long.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, this is my absolute favorite out of anything that has come out of BBW for the past few years!</li>
            <li>A woman, not necessarily a promiscuis one, just a woman who is not afraid to let her hair down once in a while.</li>
            <li>In short, I feel like most of their fragrances are not sophisticated enough for someone who has experimented with a wide range of products.</li>

            <li> My new roommate always asked me what perfume i use, and we figured out that was not a perfume, but BBW dark kiss.</li>
            <li> If you smell it and pause a moment to reflect, it smells exactly like a dark kiss, if a dark kiss had a smell.</li>
            <li> It has that smell like it has been sitting for a long time.</li>
            <li> Was not complete waste when it came down to it , but at the same time its a B&amp;BW product so I was surprised when she broke out</li>
            <li> I have tried a large amount of BBW products over the past 5 years, during which I was obsessed with finding the right scent for me.</li>
            <li> Received this lotion as a gift &amp; every single time I wore it I got complimented.  </li>
            <li> Not much in between.</li>
            <li> But i got tired of it fast</li>
            <li> The thing about BBW is that they are very black and white with their fragrances.</li>
            <li> It never annoys me like their other scents eventually do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading!this a try.</li>
            <li> It never annoys me like their other scents eventually do.         </li>
            <li> Definitely not fitting for a lady, like Christian Dior Dolce La Vita.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight berry scent, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> , you probably would not enjoy Dark Kiss.</li>
            <li> And not refreshing and sadly got a body mist from this collection which is also very candy.</li>
            <li> Dark kiss!</li>
            <li> works few years ago</li>
            <li> It is hard to explain.</li>
            <li> and then you will know what I mean.</li>
            <li> A kiss in the dark can be sensual or scary.</li>
            <li> It navigates between sickly sweetness, tenderness, heavy woods and a slight hint of fruit.</li>
            <li> So unfortunately i can&#x27;t wear this anymore.</li>
            <li> I am indeed being silly.</li>
            <li> unfortunately I believe it&#x27;s been discontinue at Bath &amp; Body</li>
            <li> and I was getting sick of that), Apple Pie, and the likes</li>
            <li> it started giving me terrible headaches (migraines).</li>

            <li> Was given to me as a gift somewhat since my friend who loved the scent did not like it and it make her skin break out. scent had faded over time . Was not complete waste when it came down to it , but at the same time its a B&amp;BW product so I was surprised when she broke out she was and still a loyal customer but was surprised about it .</li>
            <li> This is a really good new scent from B&amp;B. It has a sweet fruity smell. One day, When I wore it, a clerk said it smelled like cotton candy. :&gt;) I kind of agree but still like it.</li>
            <li> I have tried a large amount of BBW products over the past 5 years, during which I was obsessed with finding the right scent for me.

In short, I feel like most of their fragrances are not sophisticated enough for someone who has experimented with a wide range of products. Not Dark Kiss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark Kiss is wonderful, enticing, mysterious. If you smell it and pause a moment to reflect, it smells exactly like a dark kiss, if a dark kiss had a smell. If that statement perplexes you, you should try it for yourself and then you will know what I mean. I know I sound like a paid advertisement right now, but I&#x27;m just telling the truth. I would not give a scent 5 stars if it did not deserve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark Kiss requires your interpretation. It is not a simple sweet or woody smell. It navigates between sickly sweetness, tenderness, heavy woods and a slight hint of fruit. Very seductive. It is hard to explain. I wear this to sleep and have nice dreams. It is definitely the kind of scent you want to wear at night, but during the day it takes on a more candy like characteristic. It makes me feel optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you do not like sweet fragrances like Vanilla (before Dark Kiss, Warm Vanilla Sugar was my favorite BBW and I was getting sick of that), Apple Pie, and the likes, you probably would not enjoy Dark Kiss.

It never annoys me like their other scents eventually do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading!this a try. In fact, I got the whole set - lotion, spray, body wash- for 25 bucks when it first came out during Christmas last year. It was a great buy. I will continue using this fragrance, and it will be the only consistent BBW product I use. It never annoys me like their other scents eventually do.         Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite scent by BBW. A lot of people have complimented me on it and tell me I smell like cotton candy. It is however not too sweet smelling and is not over powering. Lasts through the day without being overwhelming. I actaully cannot wear perfume because of the headache factor from the stron smell. I can wear this lotion with a light spritz of the Darlk Kiss body spray and it is perfect.</li>
            <li> When I first got it i loved it. I loved how it was more Gothic looking, and the smell was sweet but sexy. But i got tired of it fast it started giving me terrible headaches (migraines). So unfortunately i can&#x27;t wear this anymore. So for people that get Migraines i would not recommend this product to.</li>
            <li> every morning i put a big john holmes wad in my hair and all over my face.  chicks say,&amp;#34;damn you smell good&amp;#34;. Ive had a lot of those over the years, the quite one just think I&#x27;m gay  . this stops my scalp from crawling all day, probably good for my skin as well.  switch up with midnight pomegranate</li>
            <li> It has that smell like it has been sitting for a long time. It just doesnt smell fresh to me. IT still does the job but its just not the same. To be honest I don&#x27;t wear it. I use to wear it all the time when I would buy it from B&amp;BW but I bought 3 and wont wear it. I rather just let it sit and put on something more fresher.</li>
            <li> I love this body cream and get many compliments as to how great it smells!</li>
            <li> I see the comments and I think I was going to love this lotion but it was not the case, nota a good fragance for me, I dont like</li>
            <li> This got strong perfume kind fragrance sometime it brings headache. And not refreshing and sadly got a body mist from this collection which is also very candy. All together I didn&#x27;t like this one. Usually I have a strong sense of smell and always chooses the right one. But this I bought it through reading recommendations which I regret now.</li>
            <li> great fragrance Shipped fast</li>
            <li> Dark kiss! Who comes up with these names for fragrances? A bit prejudice, don&#x27;t you think?! (smile) Well, it smells mellow and sexy at the same time. A kiss in the dark can be sensual or scary. Judas betrayed the Son of Man with a kiss. I don&#x27;t know if I would classify the smell though, to be about betrayal, more like seduction, but subtly so. Definitely not fitting for a lady, like Christian Dior Dolce La Vita. Nah, this is definitely woman quality stuff. ;) A woman, not necessarily a promiscuis one, just a woman who is not afraid to let her hair down once in a while. Where her husband does not mind her being &amp;#34;showy&amp;#34;, if she is indeed married. A lady is a woman who is most diligently kept, reserved, funny, excitingly witty and extraordinarily accustomed to the ways of properness. Women can pull of being a lady just as well, it is our nature, but not with this fragrance. LOL. I am indeed being silly. I do like this fragrance, it&#x27;s fun and unique.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the one I bought from bath &amp; body works few years ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude, I don&#x27;t know how best to explain the subtle glory of this.  All i know is my co-worker puts it on, and I want in her pants.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this for her as she loves it, sadly no pants access has been granted.  Still working on that.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells great, but doesn&#x27;t really work good as a lotion. The lotion really stings when you apply it to dry skin, and doesn&#x27;t really moisturize.</li>
            <li> As we know, some BBS items are only available once or perhaps twice annually.  So, it is great that Amazon usually has a lot of these hard to find fragrances all year long.  My Granddaughter claims this as her favorite lotion, and I was so happy I could surprise her with it during her adjustment time when away from home for the first time.  It spelled &amp;#34;love&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Excellent product with a very different and pleasing fragrance; A wonderful body lotion for general use and I certainly recommend it; (This review was from my wife who had me order this product and was very glad she did!)&lt;br /&gt;Mike in Alamo.</li>
            <li> I used this scent since 2013! My new roommate always asked me what perfume i use, and we figured out that was not a perfume, but BBW dark kiss. It&#x27;s sooooo good and last long</li>
            <li> I love bath &amp; body works lotion and spray! This one I think would be labeled as my ultimate favorite! :)</li>
            <li> Great fragrance. The fragrance lasts forever. I wish they hadn&#x27;t discontinued it in the store. Now we can only get in online.</li>
            <li> This lotion is Awesome the scent is so Wonderful and Sexy unfortunately I believe it&#x27;s been discontinue at Bath &amp; Body this is a real loss.</li>
            <li> magical, whimsical, enchanting, alluring... intoxicating...perfect name for this lotion</li>
            <li> LOVE this body lotionnn! Great job on the delivery of the product! :) Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> Great scent. Love it.</li>
            <li> Very good, but it takes long time to reach.</li>
            <li> i got it for my girlfriend for valentines day and she had thought you couldn&#x27;t find it anymore so she loved it its perfect</li>
            <li> The dark Kiss lotion is an excellent choice for me I used it before and I love it I would recommend this lotion to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent! Normally Bath and Body Works product are too fruity or flowery for my taste, but I really like this one! It does have a slight berry scent, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering. The Vanilla, Amber and Incense tones shine through the berry for a truly delightful scent!!!</li>
            <li> Was glad to find this on Amazon...one of my favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li> Received this lotion as a gift &amp; every single time I wore it I got complimented.  So of course I had to order 4 bottles myself.  The scent is light &amp; seems to be a crowd pleaser.</li>
            <li> This product purchase was for my wife, quen uses this line of beauty products for several years. She is fascinated</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome! I cant tell you how many times Ive gotten laid from using this. Guys say I smell amazing, almost \\&quot;too good\\&quot;. I put it on after I bathe and I come home from 12 hours of work and I still smell like it. I think itd probably smell better during the fall or the winter though because its very heavy and seductive smelling. I wear it all the time, but I feel like it smells better in the fall.</li>
            <li> This was the very best , why did they have to discontinue the scent!!!</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter - she loves it.</li>
            <li> Smells so good i love it</li>
            <li> think it get lost, The product never come, iwas a gif and i have to ask this week to my cousin but she told me that she never got it</li>
            <li> I am in love with this scent. If you are lucky to find it and get it, do so because it was in stores for a limited  time only and they dont have it anymore. Totally recommend it!!!</li>
