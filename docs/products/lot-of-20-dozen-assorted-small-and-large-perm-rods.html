            <li> This package has primarily an assortment of small and medium sized perm rods that vary between long and short.</li>
            <li> These are not long enough for people with long hair.</li>
            <li> The description says small and large.</li>
            <li> Its like receiving small medium and large length.</li>
            <li> Use them for my crochet braids and even on my natural hair for a rod set and had enough that I gave my sister half of the lot.</li>
            <li> Returning they are all small, very deceptive.</li>
            <li> I received the following:    5 dozen yellow perm rods (2 long and 3 short): 3/16\\&quot;  4 dozen blue perm rods (2 long and 2 short): 1/4\\&quot;  5 dozen pink perm rods (2 long and 3 short)</li>
            <li> : 5/16\\&quot;  4 dozen gray perm rods (2 long and 2 short): 3/8\\</li>
            <li> &quot;  2 dozen white perm rods (2 long):</li>
            <li> this 20 dozen will last me for a very long time i rather buy them by the dozen on amazon than pay 9.99 in the hair stores for 7 in a pack</li>
            <li> As other reviews have said these are very tiny diameters, with makes for extremely tight curls.</li>
            <li> There were no large rods included.</li>
            <li> There are no large perm rods in this pack.</li>
            <li> I say again, there are NO LARGE PERM RODS.</li>
            <li> Only small to medium</li>
            <li> All various small sized ones.</li>
            <li> I have thick, MBL, tightly coiled natural hair and wanted these perm rods to give myself effortless curls.</li>
            <li> Just know that these perm rods are for TIGHT and SPRINGY curls.  </li>
            <li> The texture of the rods, the bumpy things on them are little bothersome it snags and tangles my hair</li>
            <li> I both these perm rods to use on the ends of my natural when twisted.</li>
            <li> I too was attracted to the \\&quot;small and large\\&quot; title when I purchased these rods</li>
            <li> and they help curls to stay in my hair for at least a week!</li>
            <li> Yes I was annoyed.</li>
            <li> Otherwise,  it&#x27;s truly false advertisement</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the assortment of sizes so that you can do different curl patterns. I don&#x27;t regret my purchase at all. Love my perm rods.</li>
            <li> on time, product as described.</li>
            <li> Use them for my crochet braids and even on my natural hair for a rod set and had enough that I gave my sister half of the lot. The price is great and the products better!</li>
            <li> Thank you that was a great deal.</li>
            <li> Great value very pleased with purchase</li>
            <li> There were no large rods included. Only small to medium</li>
            <li> I both these perm rods to use on the ends of my natural when twisted. Perm rods can make you curls look really nice.</li>
            <li> Its great love how they work :)</li>
            <li> The description says small and large. There are no large perm rods in this pack. I say again, there are NO LARGE PERM RODS. Yes I was annoyed. Can I still use them? Yeah. Did I want large ones too? Hell yeah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: A nice variety&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: No actual big perm rods. All various small sized ones.</li>
            <li> So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I like that all the sizes come individually packaged.&lt;br /&gt;This 20 dozen is almost too much..&lt;br /&gt;Live it alot.</li>
            <li> A great buy if you use rods for your hair and they work fine.  A large assortment of rod for a good price.</li>
            <li> I have thick, MBL, tightly coiled natural hair and wanted these perm rods to give myself effortless curls. I too was attracted to the \\&quot;small and large\\&quot; title when I purchased these rods and I too was deceived.    This package has primarily an assortment of small and medium sized perm rods that vary between long and short. I received the following:    5 dozen yellow perm rods (2 long and 3 short): 3/16\\&quot;  4 dozen blue perm rods (2 long and 2 short): 1/4\\&quot;  5 dozen pink perm rods (2 long and 3 short): 5/16\\&quot;  4 dozen gray perm rods (2 long and 2 short): 3/8\\&quot;  2 dozen white perm rods (2 long): 7/16\\&quot;    That&#x27;s it. Nearly half of the assortment consists of the smallest size perm rods while none of the bigger perm rods are really included! Actually, only the white rods are classified as big but there are only two packs! Furthermore, the brands you see in the picture are not the brands you&#x27;ll receive. This is important because some perm rods need rolling papers because of how they cling to your hair (speaking about coily natural hair).    Now I have to purchase papers and larger perm rods elsewhere. Like another reviewer, I can use these but they weren&#x27;t what I was expecting from the description.</li>
            <li> Got more than enough! Love it!!</li>
            <li> this 20 dozen will last me for a very long time i rather buy them by the dozen on amazon than pay 9.99 in the hair stores for 7 in a pack</li>
            <li> I love this set because they help hold curls really well and they help curls to stay in my hair for at least a week! They work for me!</li>
            <li> Good but I did not get big ones I was expecting</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a set that will give you perm rods from its smallest to its largest,  this is NOT the set to buy.  I was literally given five dozen of the following sizes: 3/16, 1/4, 5/16, 6/16, and 7/16. That&#x27;s it. If you know about perm rods,  you know that 7/16 doesn&#x27;t begin to classify as &amp;#34;large enough for the bigger sections of your hair&amp;#34;. If you are working with really short hair ( Jada Pinkett in Low Down Dirty Shame ), then this set is perfect.  Otherwise,  it&#x27;s truly false advertisement</li>
            <li> Alot of perm rods!! More than enough for anyone&#x27;s head. The texture of the rods, the bumpy things on them are little bothersome it snags and tangles my hair not sure it is a good fit for type 4 hair but I will still use them. Cheers.</li>
            <li> It should be title Long and short perm rods, not small and large. As other reviews have said these are very tiny diameters, with makes for extremely tight curls. Even by using the biggest ones, it was still entirely too tiny for my length of hair. That being said, it did come with a variety of rods for a good price</li>
            <li> Good buy, every size shape and color. you wont be buying any more of these for a while because they are a lot!</li>
            <li> wonderful will purchase again</li>
            <li> Deserve more than 5 stars.High quality product and above all cheap. I bought them for my wife and she really love them.</li>
            <li> Great buy for someone with shorter natural hair. These are not long enough for people with long hair.</li>
            <li> Liked the lot I received. Need extra rod to put with the others I had for beauty school. Work like they are suppose to.</li>
            <li> Just as the product stated. Great bundle. Its like receiving small medium and large length. I usually used the long length to curl my dreadlocks and it was perfect. You cant go.wrong with having a mixture of rods.</li>
            <li> I recieved the item not long after I place my order and honestly was surprised by the quality. I&#x27;m very thankful that it is a high quality item, that they provided extra rubber bands to repair rod if one should break. The price its self is a steal, regularly in beauty supply stores one pack is 6-8 bucks when I purchased an entire lot!!!</li>
            <li> Perm rods are perm rods i was just hoping for larger rods. If you want small ones then this is perfect for you. Other then that everything was fine</li>
            <li> Perfect for my needs was as described thank you....</li>
            <li> Loved it especially for the price, I will be using this seller again!!</li>
            <li> I got exactly what is described.  Just know that these perm rods are for TIGHT and SPRINGY curls.  Kind of jerry curl like. I use these for achieving a curly afro</li>
            <li> Problem with delivery but I got it after doing so many run around but I love it Thx u</li>
            <li> Alot for your money...Worth every penny, will have these for years to come..</li>
            <li> More than enough perm rods for any type of styling!! I love the White and Grey sizes. Perfect for my natural hair/ marley hair stylings. Must buy</li>
            <li> Returning they are all small, very deceptive.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I expected, they are excellently  made. Not cheap, delivery  was fast and punctual.  Def. Will buy &amp; support this seller again.</li>
