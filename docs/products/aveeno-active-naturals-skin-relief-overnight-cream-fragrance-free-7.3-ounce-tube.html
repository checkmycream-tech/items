            <li>Best product I have found.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>Incredible!</li>
            <li>Awesome product to keep the skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>Love this cream!!!</li>
            <li>This lotion is great for stopping the itching and helping my skin heal.</li>
            <li>Works great and can&#x27;t get it cheaper anywhere else.</li>
            <li>I recommend all aveeno products for they are great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good lotion, I use it on my feet before bed</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it does do a good job.</li>
            <li>A perennial favorite!</li>
            <li>is the most successful acquisition.</li>
            <li>I have not found anything else as effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is also wonderful for sensitive skin because of the lack of fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love Aveeno!</li>
            <li>The texture of the cream is not sticky, not dense - nice and easy to apply ..&lt;</li>
            <li>Love this pintment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may not have a ton of bells and whistles but it&#x27;s the most reliable body product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>so I make sure that I apply this before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>Parfum/smell free!</li>
            <li>Each morning I love the way my hands and elbows feel.</li>
            <li>The squeeze tube also makes it easy to control the amount</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d strongly recommend it for that purpose.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m pretty sure that the dimethecone has been reduced from 2% to 1.3% in addition to most of the inactive ingredients being changed.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy when I found a product I could actually use lightly on my face during the Colorado winters.</li>
            <li>Five stars for the original \\&quot;Intensive</li>
            <li>My wife and I always get chapped skin and have been using Aveeno for several years with great success.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tempted to believe they made a good product for initial \\&quot;all</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate, and it works great!</li>
            <li>When the urticaria flares up (itchy skin), this Aveeno soothe snd works quickly.</li>
            <li>It also manages to moisturize while sinking into skin quickly, so you don&#x27;t wait forever for it to settle in (and ruin your clothes with grease rubbing up against them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing is as good as this product for extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>I use the current one and it is still fairly decent, but not as good as the original</li>
            <li>While oat extract, flour and oil were the main ingredients of the first, now water, glycerin and distearldimonium chloride are the top three.</li>
            <li>and it really keeps skin smooth and silky and hydrated &#x3D;&#x3D;</li>
            <li>my hands seem to be in better condition in general.</li>
            <li>glad short shelf life - so do not crammed preservatives!</li>
            <li>Most lotions cause me to break out, to the point where I only trust a couple brands.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive and super dry and the more \\&quot;chemically enhanced\\</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves hands soft but not greasy</li>
            <li>Terrific product and who better to advertise this product than a natural beauty like Jennifer Aniston!</li>
            <li>The ingredients that are better for you have since been moved to minimal quantities.</li>
            <li>Not so much anymore.</li>
            <li>I use it anytime - not just at night or for \\&quot;intense</li>
            <li>Great product - really helps my skin, especially since I need to go fragrance-free for the next several weeks.</li>
            <li>After trying several alternatives, no other lotions seemed to help with the flaky skin, so I knew I needed something more heavy-duty.</li>
            <li>I hope Aveeno goes back to the original formula.  </li>
            <li>It does not have a greasy feel to it like so many other lotions.</li>
            <li>Love Aveeno Active Naturals.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly,it moisturizes so well without weighing skin down in grease.  </li>
            <li>so important in the dry winter months.</li>
            <li>Now the main ingredients are water and glycerin.  </li>
            <li>and I wake up with very soft skin!</li>
            <li>Not a common thing for me and the desert I live in!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I rub in a huge glob to my hands and especially to my dry cuticles as I go to sleep.  </li>
            <li>I wear it to bed everynight on my super dry hands</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin but never have a reaction to this.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or make me break out.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have tried many different types of body skin creams for relief to my dry, sensitive skin and this is the only one that I can use that does not make me break out.  </li>
            <li>The tube is very large for a very long time to Use.</li>
            <li>I wake up with soft hands and cuticles.  </li>
            <li>I use this cream nearly every morning on dry/itchy parts, and it works like a charm.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon seller and that you have such a product.</li>
            <li>Not a heavy smell, not oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly thick but not greasy and seems to soak in (better than the all-purpose Aveeno lotion).  </li>
            <li>The tube came with the cap cracked and a big piece was missing from the damage but the lotion is just fine and meets expectations.</li>
            <li>I thought I was ordering something else in this lotion, but have found it to be very soothing and dry flaky hands.  </li>
            <li>skin tends to be dry and hard to find a suitable cream.</li>
            <li>I was so bummed to find that my \\&quot;intense relief overnight cream\\&quot; was changed to \\&quot;SKIN\\&quot; relief overnight cream and while the active ingredient stayed the same, the inactive ingredients were completely swapped and/or reduced.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and had no reaction, and now after several days of use of this product (combined with my usual gentle exfoliation), my skin is very noticeably smoother and the dry spots have all but disappeared.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this lotion, Amazon shipped the new (far less desirable) version.  </li>
            <li>I am the type who seeks novelty and always tries new things.</li>
            <li>Tried lots of different products for dry skin, and wind chapped skin, and this is the one that helps keep skin soft the longest period of time.  </li>

            <li> However,though I occasionally wander off to try other options, I keep returning to this time and time again.</li>
            <li> No sensitive skin problems with this!</li>
            <li> with other lotions, I would wake up in the middle of the night and my hands would feel dry again, but not with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and eczema/psoriasis on my hands and legs.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not as helpful as some AHA&#x27;s for really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use it whenever my hands are dry and the rest of my body after taking a shower.  </li>
            <li> Feels like any basic, slightly greasy lotion, and I will no longer be buying it.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened the package from Amazon I thought it might just be the packaging that had changed, but sadly the ingredients are different also</li>
            <li> it makes my skin feel a little rubbery after it sinks in, but it&#x27;s only used before bed</li>
            <li> It really helped relieve some dry, itchy patches on my arms (in a matter of days) that other oily or fragranced lotions were just irritating.  </li>
            <li> Only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> When my hands get especially dry, I wear this at night with cotton gloves - it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Relief\\&quot; lotion, 2 1/2 stars for the entirely average (and therefore quite overpriced) \\&quot;skin relief\\&quot; lotion.</li>
            <li> No more worries about dry skin, cracking, and peeling.</li>
            <li> But I find it too greasy and heavy to use during the day</li>
            <li> No need to limit to overnight use, in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li> Use it at night for relief from the harsh dryness of the day.</li>
            <li> I use this cream as lotion everyday.  </li>
            <li> This lotion works really well either to pinpoint particularly bad areas or all over.</li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;ll scratch my legs</li>
            <li> But then what is the skin of my child makes me sad - his skin on the cheeks always red, as retain moisture, and no cream is not suitable to him.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin that is prone to drying out badly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a cure for eczema, but whenever I&#x27;m having a bad breakout, this is the only lotion that doesn&#x27;t sting and it helps the sore spots feel somewhat protected.  </li>
            <li> &quot; a product is, the worse it reacts with my skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not happy about the Bait n Switch.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have dry and sensitive skin, and in the winter my face gets quite flaky, to the point that my makeup goes on unevenly and actually highlights dry spots. After trying several alternatives, no other lotions seemed to help with the flaky skin, so I knew I needed something more heavy-duty. I use this lotion on my face and I literally noticed a difference the next morning after using it. I have sensitive skin and had no reaction, and now after several days of use of this product (combined with my usual gentle exfoliation), my skin is very noticeably smoother and the dry spots have all but disappeared. And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Tried lots of different products for dry skin, and wind chapped skin, and this is the one that helps keep skin soft the longest period of time.  Not greasy, absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and eczema/psoriasis on my hands and legs. This lotion is great for stopping the itching and helping my skin heal.</li>
            <li> I was so bummed to find that my \\&quot;intense relief overnight cream\\&quot; was changed to \\&quot;SKIN\\&quot; relief overnight cream and while the active ingredient stayed the same, the inactive ingredients were completely swapped and/or reduced. While oat extract, flour and oil were the main ingredients of the first, now water, glycerin and distearldimonium chloride are the top three. The ingredients that are better for you have since been moved to minimal quantities. I&#x27;m tempted to believe they made a good product for initial \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; ratings and user ratings and then made it cheaper for profit. My skin is super sensitive and super dry and the more \\&quot;chemically enhanced\\&quot; a product is, the worse it reacts with my skin. I was so happy when I found a product I could actually use lightly on my face during the Colorado winters. Not so much anymore.</li>
            <li> Love this pintment. When the urticaria flares up (itchy skin), this Aveeno soothe snd works quickly.</li>
            <li> I rub in a huge glob to my hands and especially to my dry cuticles as I go to sleep.  I wake up with soft hands and cuticles.  But I find it too greasy and heavy to use during the day</li>
            <li> Works great and can&#x27;t get it cheaper anywhere else. Nothing else compares with it on my hands. I actually prefer this to the eczema version.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream out there at any price point.</li>
            <li> My wife and I always get chapped skin and have been using Aveeno for several years with great success. I&#x27;d strongly recommend it for that purpose.</li>

            <li> This is the body cream I keep buying again and again! I am the type who seeks novelty and always tries new things. However,though I occasionally wander off to try other options, I keep returning to this time and time again. I have not found anything else as effective. It has a nice texture that&#x27;s just right,neither too thin nor too heavy and greasy. Most importantly,it moisturizes so well without weighing skin down in grease.  My skin is silky after using it. It also manages to moisturize while sinking into skin quickly, so you don&#x27;t wait forever for it to settle in (and ruin your clothes with grease rubbing up against them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also wonderful for sensitive skin because of the lack of fragrance. I have very sensitive skin but never have a reaction to this. The squeeze tube also makes it easy to control the amount you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not have a ton of bells and whistles but it&#x27;s the most reliable body product I&#x27;ve ever used. A perennial favorite!</li>
            <li> No sensitive skin problems with this! and it really keeps skin smooth and silky and hydrated &#x3D;&#x3D; so important in the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> since I started using this, my cuticles have stopped peeling. it&#x27;s not a cure for eczema, but whenever I&#x27;m having a bad breakout, this is the only lotion that doesn&#x27;t sting and it helps the sore spots feel somewhat protected.  it makes my skin feel a little rubbery after it sinks in, but it&#x27;s only used before bed so I don&#x27;t care. with other lotions, I would wake up in the middle of the night and my hands would feel dry again, but not with this stuff. my hands seem to be in better condition in general.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love Aveeno!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY lotion that actually keeps me from scratching myself in my sleep at night. Usually I&#x27;ll scratch my legs so I make sure that I apply this before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> This Aveeno lotion has been my go-to lotion ever since I discovered it about 3 years ago.  I use it anytime - not just at night or for \\&quot;intense relief.\\&quot;  There is no fragrance at all.  It really helped relieve some dry, itchy patches on my arms (in a matter of days) that other oily or fragranced lotions were just irritating.  It&#x27;s fairly thick but not greasy and seems to soak in (better than the all-purpose Aveeno lotion).  I now use it all over, even as a facial moisturizer (doesn&#x27;t cause oiliness).  I have no qualms about putting it on my kids if they&#x27;re scratching - it seems to help them, and I&#x27;ve never noticed any irritation.  When my hands get especially dry, I wear this at night with cotton gloves - it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5/2012:  Aveeno has changed this product.  They are now calling it \\&quot;SKIN RELIEF Overnight Cream\\&quot; and the label and cap are blue.  When I ordered this lotion, Amazon shipped the new (far less desirable) version.  Now the main ingredients are water and glycerin.  Feels like any basic, slightly greasy lotion, and I will no longer be buying it.  Five stars for the original \\&quot;Intensive Relief\\&quot; lotion, 2 1/2 stars for the entirely average (and therefore quite overpriced) \\&quot;skin relief\\&quot; lotion.</li>
            <li> I bought this a week ago at Walmart. It&#x27;s a good lotion, I use it on my feet before bed otherwise I wake up with itchy feet in the middle of the night. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it does do a good job.</li>
            <li> Love Aveeno Active Naturals.  I have very sensitive skin and have tried many different types of body skin creams for relief to my dry, sensitive skin and this is the only one that I can use that does not make me break out.  No perfumes or ingredients that would make me break out.  I recommend all aveeno products for they are great.</li>
            <li> Great product - really helps my skin, especially since I need to go fragrance-free for the next several weeks.</li>
            <li> Best product I have found.  Only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> Nothing is as good as this product for extremely dry skin. It lasts all day. No more worries about dry skin, cracking, and peeling.</li>
            <li> Works so well, like nothing else.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering something else in this lotion, but have found it to be very soothing and dry flaky hands.  Use it at night for relief from the harsh dryness of the day.</li>
            <li> I like that it has no perfume and is soothing.  However, it&#x27;s not as helpful as some AHA&#x27;s for really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t just use this moisturizer at night -- I use it before I put on my make-up in the morning as well. I have very sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or make me break out. My skin feels wonderful. I live in a very dry climate, and it works great!</li>
            <li> Incredible! And even that word does not describe my excitement. The tube is very large for a very long time to Use. The texture of the cream is not sticky, not dense - nice and easy to apply ..&lt;br /&gt;My skin tends to be dry and hard to find a suitable cream. But then what is the skin of my child makes me sad - his skin on the cheeks always red, as retain moisture, and no cream is not suitable to him.&lt;br /&gt;But using currently, there is no fragrance and makeup glad short shelf life - so do not crammed preservatives! After I painted the baby&#x27;s cheeks at night - and in the morning the skin calmed down and become soft and tender. I call this cream is the most successful acquisition. Thanks Amazon seller and that you have such a product.</li>
            <li> Yes, the reviewer J. Fowler is correct.  When I first opened the package from Amazon I thought it might just be the packaging that had changed, but sadly the ingredients are different also (I&#x27;m pretty sure that the dimethecone has been reduced from 2% to 1.3% in addition to most of the inactive ingredients being changed.  I hope Aveeno goes back to the original formula.  I use the current one and it is still fairly decent, but not as good as the original and I&#x27;m not happy about the Bait n Switch.</li>
            <li> I use this cream as lotion everyday.  I use it whenever my hands are dry and the rest of my body after taking a shower.  It&#x27;s the only lotion that works well for me.  It lasts a long time, and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> Awesome product to keep the skin moisturized. Parfum/smell free!</li>
            <li> Aveeno overnight skin relief was what I wanted.  The tube came with the cap cracked and a big piece was missing from the damage but the lotion is just fine and meets expectations.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin that is prone to drying out badly. Most lotions cause me to break out, to the point where I only trust a couple brands. Aveeno is one of those, I have never had a reaction. This lotion works really well either to pinpoint particularly bad areas or all over. It does not have a greasy feel to it like so many other lotions. You can still feel the lotion several hours after applying. I do not notice any fragrance to it. I would highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! As describe Thank you!</li>
            <li> Terrific product and who better to advertise this product than a natural beauty like Jennifer Aniston!</li>
            <li> Love this cream!!! I wear it to bed everynight on my super dry hands and I wake up with very soft skin! Not a common thing for me and the desert I live in! Until now!!</li>
            <li> I use this every night, and sometimes during the day when I&#x27;ve had to wash my hands a lot.  Each morning I love the way my hands and elbows feel.</li>
            <li> Ordere based on picture of item, and item sent was not what was advertised. Sent newer version, not item picture.</li>
            <li> Not a heavy smell, not oily. I have this on subscribe and save.  Highly recommended.  I use overnight and during the day.</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist and have to wash my hands often.  I use this lotion throughout the winter to keep my skin from cracking.  It is not just an overnight cream.  It absorbs quickly and leaves hands soft but not greasy</li>
