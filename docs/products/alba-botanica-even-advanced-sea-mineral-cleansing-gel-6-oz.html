            <li>I liked the product and it works well as a toner, but the fragrance is a little much.</li>
            <li>I did find it to be alright to use if I was very oily (like in the summer).</li>
            <li>It foams a lot, so you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li>However, I do like it so much that I ordered the toner, moisturizer, and the face scrub.</li>
            <li>I am using all Abla face and skin care products and ditching the high prices products.</li>

            <li>I suffer from adult acne at times and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I wanted something all natural that might help with my mild (hormonal) acne, but this just dried my skin without really clearing anything up.</li>
            <li>I wanted a sensitive face wash.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts as well as dryness.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also lasted a really long time and you don&#x27;t need to use  much.</li>
            <li>This should have been package more securely because some of the product leaked out and the pump could have been easily broken due to rough handling.</li>
            <li>I had no idea you could get all natural products like this at such a low cost.</li>
            <li>I am a mid aged male that wants to keep his skin looking well and this product fits the bill.</li>

            <li> This gel is not too harsh.</li>
            <li> So, I just use it on my body as a body wash now until this bottle is gone, then I probably won&#x27;t buy it again because it&#x27;s way too fragrant and because I wasn&#x27;t looking for an expensive body wash</li>

            <li> This cleanser is very gentle but leaves your skin feeling clean. It foams a lot, so you don&#x27;t need to use much. I use it twice daily and I still haven&#x27;t gone through a full bottle (bought it in mid-August and it&#x27;s now end of November). Very good for sensitive or dry skin.</li>

            <li> Only rated it that I don&#x27;t like it because I purchased it for my face, but I can&#x27;t use it on my face anymore, so I use it as a body wash now... it&#x27;s doing ok as a body wash. Everytime I used it on my face, no matter how carefully I washed my face in the shower, this stuff would run into my mouth and eyes and it would burn my eyes and I could taste it for quite some time - it is so strong and scented that I couldn&#x27;t take it any longer.

            <li> This is a great product that leaves my face feeling clean.  I followup with the night cream as well.  I am a mid aged male that wants to keep his skin looking well and this product fits the bill.</li>
            <li> Loves the way it makes my skin feels</li>
            <li> Very light cleansing smell.</li>
            <li> This cleansing gel is my all time favorite.  A little goes a long way!  It&#x27;s very gentle, yet effective.  It foams nicely and is easy to rinse off.  It also is free of all the junk found in most cleansers.  Love it!</li>
            <li> BOUGHT BECAUSE NO BAD CHEMICALS BUT KIND OF BURNS FACE&lt;br /&gt;OK FOR BODY WASH- HAS KIND OF MENTHOL FEEL</li>
            <li> Smells good and appears to be cleansing my face well</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I won&#x27;t use products that are tested on animals, so I have tried MANY products in the search for one that is effective for my sensitive skin that also is cruelty free.  My search is finally over.  Alba products are truly amazing and great for my skin.</li>
            <li> I liked the product and it works well as a toner, but the fragrance is a little much. I would like better if this was fragrance free</li>
            <li> This should have been package more securely because some of the product leaked out and the pump could have been easily broken due to rough handling. But besides that, this face wash is good. I remember using it 2 or 3yrs ago and it cleared up my skin nicely so now I have returned to see if it will do the same as last time.</li>
            <li> I have issues with skin allergies and have gotten hives or contact dermatitis from some soaps. This one is perfect for my face. I can wash my face twice a day and it doesn&#x27;t get dry or irritated.</li>
            <li> I came across this cleanser by accident and thought I would give it a try. It is now my favorite. It leave any skin feeling clean with no dryness or oilyness left behind. I suffer from adult acne at times and have very sensitive skin. This is very gentle. I love it and won&#x27;t use anything else now.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts as well as dryness.  By using this cleanser twice a day followed by my favorite moisturizer, the flakiness and pimples have almost completely disappeared.  This gel is not too harsh.</li>
            <li> love this stuff! doesn&#x27;t hurt your eyes when washing eyemakeup off. does the trick with the rest of my face. good smell!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only facial cleanser that doesn&#x27;t break out my skin. I love the ingredients in this more than in any other product!</li>
