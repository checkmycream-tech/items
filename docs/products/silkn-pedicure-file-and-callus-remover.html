    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>best things about this are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect device to use as we get head into sandal weather!</li>
            <li>But this one is great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m VERY satisfied!!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the best solution.  </li>
            <li>She says this is the best of all the methods she&#x27;s used.  </li>
            <li>I have had others of these electronic callus remover devices before, and I have to say, the Silk&#x27;n is the best one I’ve used.  </li>
            <li>It is the fastest and gave me the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, I found a perfect use for it for me.  </li>
            <li>These are 2 very good reasons I wanted (and needed) this.</li>
            <li>so I have to give it a very good cleaning before I use</li>
            <li>This along with a foot rasp are all you&#x27;ll need this summer to keep your pedicures beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I greatly prefer the Amope on/off switch, but besides that one feature, I greatly prefer the the Silk&#x27;n callus remover.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you what great results I get from the Silk&#x27;n Electronic File.</li>
            <li>I am happy that I read them before trying this product.</li>
            <li>Nice gift too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to get very good results with one try with this device.  </li>
            <li>This tool works like a charm and allows me to take care of my foot issue without rumors circulating around our fair town.  </li>
            <li>This tool works like a charm and allows me to take care of my foot issue without rumors circulating around our fair town.  </li>
            <li>soak method works really good</li>
            <li>It felt really good on my feet.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this electronic pedicure beauty accessory and recommend it to anyone looking for smoother skin and softer feet.</li>
            <li>I love this machine!  </li>
            <li>but I feel I did get amazing results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s just great, my feet look and feel fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is great to use on callouses and hopefully overtime they will smooth out.  </li>
            <li>when I saw this product I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I used to use pumice stones and a popular scrapper that had me saving my feet like I shaved my legs.</li>
            <li>there is no speed or pressure control; it would have been nice if you could use this on a gentler speed; I know that it probably needs to move at a minimum speed in order to work, but it does hurt a wee bit when using it&lt;br</li>
            <li>Batteries are included which is a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>A nice product at this time, hopefully it holds up well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other notables - includes the disposable batteries, easy operation (just turn it on and it starts spinning then turn it off), good build quality - appears durable.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It’s the best of both worlds – an easy-to-use tool offering a finished professional look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is by far THE BEST product I&#x27;ve ever come across!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to be able to get them in between soaks.</li>
            <li>Silk&#x27;n pedicure device is great to use right out of the package.  </li>
            <li>The handle fits my hand nicely and makes it easy to maneuver around my feet.</li>
            <li>I assure you I was tempted on more than one occasion to ask if I could borrow it despite the dangerousness of that</li>
            <li>My favorite device of this type.</li>
            <li>Works so well, be sure to use it over a towel or paper or else you&#x27;ll have foot callus dust all over.</li>
            <li>but surely she&#x27;s convinced me that I need to take better care of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing irritates me more that someone (something) who over promises and under delivers.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that you get two types of buffers/rollers.</li>
            <li>sure to put a lotion on your feet afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Love the Silk&#x27;n Electronic Pedicure File and Callus system.</li>
            <li>but I am in love.</li>
            <li>(besides my daughter using it) would be to have a bit more gender neutral color scheme (or</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many callouses on mine, but the two prominent ones I&#x27;ve had since I was a kid.</li>
            <li>The directions say to not apply pressure for more than 2-3 seconds at a time, but they&#x27;re being cautious...</li>
            <li>if you have thicker callouses, you can sand away with a bit more gusto.</li>
            <li>I thought I would have to spend more time on them, but that isn&#x27;t necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are looking for a way to pamper your feet, you will enjoy this product!</li>
            <li>My wife says this device is effective, easy to use, and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>and you are going to be so surprised and what this removes and polishes your skin to a beautiful healthy look.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product!  </li>
            <li>Well, I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>Shapes the edges of calluses more easily than a pumice stone does.</li>
            <li>I like that you can treat this issue easily and safely at home yourself.  </li>
            <li>This handy and lightweight battery operated file is easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>Warnings are to use light pressure and do not treat one spot more than 2-3 seconds.</li>
            <li>depending upon the intensity of use, but generally after one year.&amp;#34;  That would be great, as you wouldn&#x27;t need to buy many refills.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The batteries were included and they were easy to add.</li>
            <li>The compartment opened easily.  </li>
            <li>The unit is easy to handle, heads are easy to interchange</li>
            <li>This cleaned up really easily with a damp paper towel, though.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>and the Amope beat manual filing easily.</li>
            <li>Works fine but cheaper at Kohls.</li>
            <li>I am really impressed with this little gadget.</li>
            <li>One to really work of the rough stuff and one to polish and give an excellent finishing polish for very smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Two heads, a turquoise one with coarser grain and the purple one with finer grain..not a huge difference, but some, and both finer than the volcanic pumice stone I use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see that you can buy the rollers yet, so hopefully they will come available soon.on</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see that you can buy the rollers yet, so hopefully they will come available soon.</li>
            <li>I plan to use it regularly to keep my feet looking great throughout sandal season.</li>
            <li>I am on my feet all day at work and living in Florida, spend a lot of my free time barefoot.</li>
            <li>Then change the head to the smoother and you soon have silky smooth feet.  </li>
            <li>I also use the smoother roller on the edges of my fingers/cuticles to smooth them out after using cuticle nippers.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I am quite happy with my Silk&#x27;n pedicure tool, even though I don&#x27;t feel it works well enough for the intended purposes.</li>
            <li>Within 10 minutes both my feet were girly smooth.  </li>
            <li>My feet are smooth and happy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>Just place a towel or newspaper on the floor or sit with your feet over the bathtub and run the roller over the areas you want to smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is far superior to pumice stones and ped eggs.</li>
            <li>While the roller on this one seems much smaller than the one on the Amope, it is more effective.  </li>
            <li>It also comes with a brush to clean the device (the Amope didn&#x27;t have a brush).  </li>
            <li>Normally I have to soak my feet pretty good for a while</li>
            <li>I had previously purchased a different product, the Perfect Pedi, which costs $10 more; I like this better.  </li>
            <li>me because of the thickness of my callouses, each foot took 10 full minutes</li>
            <li>All you have to do is take off the plastic cover and gently roll the top of the revolving cylinder on the affected area.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s battery operated, sleek, pretty and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The device is easy to hold and pretty lightweight.  </li>
            <li>Turning it on was fairly easy, but turning it off was a challenge at first.  </li>
            <li>It has two grits, coarse and fine, which come in the form of cartridge heads (kind of like changing out the blade on your Gillette-type razor).  </li>
            <li>:  Make sure your feet are totally dry before using it, and apply it very lightly; that&#x27;s all the pressure needed to do the job.</li>
            <li>It is fast and easy.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m super happy with this little appliance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different method for keeping my feet smooth</li>
            <li>And one last really nice feature is it&#x27;s size and shape.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say that this is, by far, my favorite.</li>
            <li>think for what it does, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>A sterilized old toothbrush works much better.</li>
            <li>I love treating myself to professional pedicures, but since they are rather pricey, I try to do it myself</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t use this to remove calluses all at once, it&#x27;s a gradual process, yet you feel the effects right away.</li>
            <li>For people with normal feet that would just like to maintain their pedicure at home, the fine file may be all they need.</li>
            <li>The instructions are very clear and easy to understand.</li>
            <li>Now I use mostly the fine one about every other day for a quick touch up before my bath.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(My sister will tell you the belt sander is really fast) and that I know I will have to buy new rollers way sooner than most people would.  </li>
            <li>and my feet were super soft and smooth after.</li>
            <li>This is a great little gadget to get your feet ready for summer weather.</li>
            <li>it would be nice if the rollers were easier to clean; the package comes with a little brush, but it doesn&#x27;t remove all the debris off the rollers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perhaps I will change batteries and try again later and see if I can get more off than I did on the first go</li>
            <li>I can actually wait and enjoy a warm foot bath after all the work is done – and with the Silk&#x27;n Pedi is actually no work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I saw and felt a noticeable difference after my first use of this device.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this!  </li>
            <li>I also have the Amope (a similar device), and I truly didn&#x27;t think I could like something better than the Amope, but I do prefer this callus remover with one exception.  </li>
            <li>Overall, she&#x27;s pleased with the appliance which means I now have to plan for replacement rollers.  </li>
            <li>When my wife first saw THE HOBBIT she turned to me and asked if I was a foot model for the film.  </li>
            <li>If your rough heels have been catching on your sheets at night, try this.</li>
            <li>I am an avid exerciser, so my feet have lots of calluses.</li>
            <li>The key take away from the instructions was to not spend more than 2-3 seconds on a callus.</li>
            <li>Since I have sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve only used the purple one -- but it works great to smooth out rough areas!  </li>
            <li>The item comes nicely packaged with two different finishing head attachments fine and rough, for tougher areas.</li>
            <li>This is largely because I&#x27;m a barefoot person.</li>
            <li>Certainly though I could have kept going because I was not feeling any sensations of discomfort.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with two rollers, a coarse and a fine.  </li>
            <li>I used the fine one again the next night.  </li>
            <li>used the course roller because my feet were so gross, but I imagine if I keep up with this, the fine one will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve stuck with the fine grit which has been all I need thus far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like gentle pumice</li>
            <li>I cannot yet speak to how fast the rollers wear out, but I have used mine 2-3 times a week for a month and they are noticeably worn yet.</li>
            <li>I also tried the polish roller, but I really didn&#x27;t think it did anything</li>
            <li>not worry that this is something that will cause irritaion or any real discomfort with use.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to use.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to roll.</li>
            <li>maybe even some flames airbrushed on the handle if that&#x27;s not too much to ask).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it on a callus that I always have and it helped so much.</li>
            <li>It comes ready to operate out of the box</li>
            <li>and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>So this is basically a gentle power-sander for your feet.</li>
            <li>It comes ready to use.</li>
            <li>Most new technology or \\&quot;improved\\&quot; tools fall far short of their promises.  </li>
            <li>the rollers are really easy to change out -- you simply depress a button and they pop off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an amazing little gadget!</li>
            <li>but it rubs on comfortably and really takes dry skin off, without hurting.</li>
            <li>It works really well to smooth out rough areas and calluses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this Silk&#x27;n Electronic File for less than one month and my feet look and feel better already.  </li>
            <li>I have similar products advertised and in stores and was very interested in checking it out, so when I was offered an opportunity to review one for amazon vine at no cost, I jumped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I am ready for summer sandles and flip flops without worrying about my feet looking old and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not hurt at all, but don’t use it more than a few seconds in any spot as it will take off skin</li>
            <li>They warn you in the directions not to use either one for more than a few seconds.  </li>
            <li>but I could see how, if you don&#x27;t clean the heads well enough, the build-up of residue will make the sander less effective and make the job take twice as long.</li>
            <li>your arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the Silk&#x27;n file over the Amope due to the choice of a corse and a fine file roller.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t slide down to turn off as easily as it slides up to turn on.  </li>
            <li>Instead, the entire head removes (as you would do to switch between the coarse and the fine)</li>
            <li>Two different rollers of different textures: one for fine grain and one for rougher grain.</li>
            <li>I never get pedicures -- I just use a pumice stone at home -- and my feet have been getting a bit rough, so I was excited to try this out.  </li>
            <li>This device is lighter in weight, slimmer in the handle, more ergonomic, and easier to hold in general, especially for smaller hands or hands with arthritis.  </li>
            <li>My feet used to be rough, now they are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It removed the dry skin on my heel quickly and painlessly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for women who can&#x27;t afford or are too busy to get routine pedicures.</li>
            <li>I use to pull out my foot bath first to soften the coarse skin before using the pumice and scrapper.</li>
            <li>Not only does it not come with any replacement rollers, but you actually need to replace the entire top part – the rollers themselves are not removable.  </li>
            <li>I used the blue first all over my heels and on the pads of my feet.</li>
            <li>I now use the grater callus remover and then use the Silk&#x27;n pedicure tool to smooth down the skin.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how soft my feet felt afterwards (even before I put on lotion).  </li>
            <li>only sadness is that this does not work as fast as I would like</li>
            <li>I have trouble buying shoes that fit</li>
            <li>There is a brush Included for cleaning, but you can pop the whole roller cartridge off and rinse it  under water for extra cleanliness.</li>
            <li>Kudos to whomever developed it.  </li>
            <li>Kudos to whomever developed it.  </li>
            <li>I want to say I was simply amazed at how FAST it worked.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t say enough how fast this works.</li>
            <li>I do wish it came with a storage case, but I am using an old makeup case I have.</li>
            <li>I was finished, my feet were truly soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use between pedicures or instead of a professional pedicure.  </li>
            <li>Second, I would suggest using a foot cream- one specifically for feet, not a regular hand or body lotion- and use it right after.</li>
            <li>Granted, my feet at this point (early May) aren’t as bad as they will be during the summer, but still, to be able to get them smooth with initial use is really</li>
            <li>I read the whole manual first and learned the purple is the heavy duty roller and the turquoise is the polishing roller.  </li>
            <li>I used this last night for the first time after coming back from a rodeo.</li>
            <li>The only drawback to the Silk&#x27;n is that where as the pedi egg catches all of the shavings, the Silk&#x27;n has no compartment so there is a huge mess.  </li>
            <li>It says you probably won&#x27;t have to buy replacement heads for a year with normal use, which makes this a definite value...</li>
            <li>Maybe they were only in nail salons, but I have been missing out on something extraordinary!  </li>
            <li>My big toes each had such large calluses it looked like my toes were deformed.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the rough one lightly and for just a few seconds all over my feet then switched to the finer textured one and did the same.</li>
            <li>I honestly think the only way to really remove calluses or rough spots and cracks is to soak your feet in coconut oil every night and throw socks on while you sleep - at least, that&#x27;s about the only thing that&#x27;s worked for me for any period of time.  </li>
            <li>It quickly removed the callused skin on my heels in a manner of a few seconds.  </li>
            <li>The set comes with two rollers (one rough and the other fine), batteries and a brush (to remove the excess skin).  </li>
            <li>There are two rollers, one with a coarse texture to really get at those tough calluses and another roller with a finer texture to smooth the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within minutes the calluses on my feet were completely gone and the process was totally painless.</li>
            <li>It barely felt like I was doing anything</li>
            <li>No rough skin</li>
            <li>My only gripe so far</li>
            <li>This did a nice job of smoothing them out, and wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable at all.</li>
            <li>I tried not to get my hopes up too much because my callouses are extreme.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had issues with a couple odd ball areas of my feet developing calluses over the last few years as I find myself going without shoes more often.</li>
            <li>only gripe is that cleaning the heads is kind of a pain with the useless brush they provide.</li>
            <li>Not knowing how long a set of rollers will last coupled with the high cost of replacement rollers (on Amazon only from marketplace vendors they are currently about the price of the device) is why I gave this device 4 stars.</li>
            <li>The current price of $29 appears reasonable relative to the other competitive offerings I perused on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it to take off calluses very well, and the roller was a mess.  </li>
            <li>First, I would place down a towel or cloth to &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; all the dry skin that will flake off.</li>
            <li>little device worked really well.</li>

            <li> best things about this are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect device to use as we get head into sandal weather!</li>
            <li> But this one is great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m VERY satisfied!!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the best solution.  </li>
            <li> She says this is the best of all the methods she&#x27;s used.  </li>
            <li> I have had others of these electronic callus remover devices before, and I have to say, the Silk&#x27;n is the best one I’ve used.  </li>
            <li> It is the fastest and gave me the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, I found a perfect use for it for me.  </li>
            <li> These are 2 very good reasons I wanted (and needed) this.</li>
            <li> so I have to give it a very good cleaning before I use</li>
            <li> This along with a foot rasp are all you&#x27;ll need this summer to keep your pedicures beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I greatly prefer the Amope on/off switch, but besides that one feature, I greatly prefer the the Silk&#x27;n callus remover.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you what great results I get from the Silk&#x27;n Electronic File.</li>
            <li> I am happy that I read them before trying this product.</li>
            <li> Nice gift too!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was able to get very good results with one try with this device.  </li>
            <li> This tool works like a charm and allows me to take care of my foot issue without rumors circulating around our fair town.  </li>
            <li> This tool works like a charm and allows me to take care of my foot issue without rumors circulating around our fair town.  </li>
            <li> soak method works really good</li>
            <li> It felt really good on my feet.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this electronic pedicure beauty accessory and recommend it to anyone looking for smoother skin and softer feet.</li>
            <li> I love this machine!  </li>
            <li> but I feel I did get amazing results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly amazing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just great, my feet look and feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is great to use on callouses and hopefully overtime they will smooth out.  </li>
            <li> when I saw this product I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li> I used to use pumice stones and a popular scrapper that had me saving my feet like I shaved my legs.</li>
            <li> there is no speed or pressure control; it would have been nice if you could use this on a gentler speed; I know that it probably needs to move at a minimum speed in order to work, but it does hurt a wee bit when using it&lt;br</li>
            <li> Batteries are included which is a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> A nice product at this time, hopefully it holds up well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other notables - includes the disposable batteries, easy operation (just turn it on and it starts spinning then turn it off), good build quality - appears durable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It’s the best of both worlds – an easy-to-use tool offering a finished professional look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is by far THE BEST product I&#x27;ve ever come across!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to be able to get them in between soaks.</li>
            <li> Silk&#x27;n pedicure device is great to use right out of the package.  </li>
            <li> The handle fits my hand nicely and makes it easy to maneuver around my feet.</li>
            <li> I assure you I was tempted on more than one occasion to ask if I could borrow it despite the dangerousness of that</li>
            <li> My favorite device of this type.</li>
            <li> Works so well, be sure to use it over a towel or paper or else you&#x27;ll have foot callus dust all over.</li>
            <li> but surely she&#x27;s convinced me that I need to take better care of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing irritates me more that someone (something) who over promises and under delivers.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that you get two types of buffers/rollers.</li>
            <li> sure to put a lotion on your feet afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Love the Silk&#x27;n Electronic Pedicure File and Callus system.</li>
            <li> but I am in love.</li>
            <li> (besides my daughter using it) would be to have a bit more gender neutral color scheme (or</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many callouses on mine, but the two prominent ones I&#x27;ve had since I was a kid.</li>
            <li> The directions say to not apply pressure for more than 2-3 seconds at a time, but they&#x27;re being cautious...</li>
            <li> if you have thicker callouses, you can sand away with a bit more gusto.</li>
            <li> I thought I would have to spend more time on them, but that isn&#x27;t necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are looking for a way to pamper your feet, you will enjoy this product!</li>
            <li> My wife says this device is effective, easy to use, and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> and you are going to be so surprised and what this removes and polishes your skin to a beautiful healthy look.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product!  </li>
            <li> Well, I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> Shapes the edges of calluses more easily than a pumice stone does.</li>
            <li> I like that you can treat this issue easily and safely at home yourself.  </li>
            <li> This handy and lightweight battery operated file is easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> Warnings are to use light pressure and do not treat one spot more than 2-3 seconds.</li>
            <li> depending upon the intensity of use, but generally after one year.&amp;#34;  That would be great, as you wouldn&#x27;t need to buy many refills.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The batteries were included and they were easy to add.</li>
            <li> The compartment opened easily.  </li>
            <li> The unit is easy to handle, heads are easy to interchange</li>
            <li> This cleaned up really easily with a damp paper towel, though.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> and the Amope beat manual filing easily.</li>
            <li> Works fine but cheaper at Kohls.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with this little gadget.</li>
            <li> One to really work of the rough stuff and one to polish and give an excellent finishing polish for very smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Two heads, a turquoise one with coarser grain and the purple one with finer grain..not a huge difference, but some, and both finer than the volcanic pumice stone I use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see that you can buy the rollers yet, so hopefully they will come available soon.on</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see that you can buy the rollers yet, so hopefully they will come available soon.</li>
            <li> I plan to use it regularly to keep my feet looking great throughout sandal season.</li>
            <li> I am on my feet all day at work and living in Florida, spend a lot of my free time barefoot.</li>
            <li> Then change the head to the smoother and you soon have silky smooth feet.  </li>
            <li> I also use the smoother roller on the edges of my fingers/cuticles to smooth them out after using cuticle nippers.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I am quite happy with my Silk&#x27;n pedicure tool, even though I don&#x27;t feel it works well enough for the intended purposes.</li>
            <li> Within 10 minutes both my feet were girly smooth.  </li>
            <li> My feet are smooth and happy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> Just place a towel or newspaper on the floor or sit with your feet over the bathtub and run the roller over the areas you want to smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is far superior to pumice stones and ped eggs.</li>
            <li> While the roller on this one seems much smaller than the one on the Amope, it is more effective.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with a brush to clean the device (the Amope didn&#x27;t have a brush).  </li>
            <li> Normally I have to soak my feet pretty good for a while</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased a different product, the Perfect Pedi, which costs $10 more; I like this better.  </li>
            <li> me because of the thickness of my callouses, each foot took 10 full minutes</li>
            <li> All you have to do is take off the plastic cover and gently roll the top of the revolving cylinder on the affected area.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s battery operated, sleek, pretty and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The device is easy to hold and pretty lightweight.  </li>
            <li> Turning it on was fairly easy, but turning it off was a challenge at first.  </li>
            <li> It has two grits, coarse and fine, which come in the form of cartridge heads (kind of like changing out the blade on your Gillette-type razor).  </li>
            <li> :  Make sure your feet are totally dry before using it, and apply it very lightly; that&#x27;s all the pressure needed to do the job.</li>
            <li> It is fast and easy.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m super happy with this little appliance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different method for keeping my feet smooth</li>
            <li> And one last really nice feature is it&#x27;s size and shape.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say that this is, by far, my favorite.</li>
            <li> think for what it does, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> A sterilized old toothbrush works much better.</li>
            <li> I love treating myself to professional pedicures, but since they are rather pricey, I try to do it myself</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t use this to remove calluses all at once, it&#x27;s a gradual process, yet you feel the effects right away.</li>
            <li> For people with normal feet that would just like to maintain their pedicure at home, the fine file may be all they need.</li>
            <li> The instructions are very clear and easy to understand.</li>
            <li> Now I use mostly the fine one about every other day for a quick touch up before my bath.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (My sister will tell you the belt sander is really fast) and that I know I will have to buy new rollers way sooner than most people would.  </li>
            <li> and my feet were super soft and smooth after.</li>
            <li> This is a great little gadget to get your feet ready for summer weather.</li>
            <li> it would be nice if the rollers were easier to clean; the package comes with a little brush, but it doesn&#x27;t remove all the debris off the rollers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps I will change batteries and try again later and see if I can get more off than I did on the first go</li>
            <li> I can actually wait and enjoy a warm foot bath after all the work is done – and with the Silk&#x27;n Pedi is actually no work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I saw and felt a noticeable difference after my first use of this device.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like this!  </li>
            <li> I also have the Amope (a similar device), and I truly didn&#x27;t think I could like something better than the Amope, but I do prefer this callus remover with one exception.  </li>
            <li> Overall, she&#x27;s pleased with the appliance which means I now have to plan for replacement rollers.  </li>
            <li> When my wife first saw THE HOBBIT she turned to me and asked if I was a foot model for the film.  </li>
            <li> If your rough heels have been catching on your sheets at night, try this.</li>
            <li> I am an avid exerciser, so my feet have lots of calluses.</li>
            <li> The key take away from the instructions was to not spend more than 2-3 seconds on a callus.</li>
            <li> Since I have sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve only used the purple one -- but it works great to smooth out rough areas!  </li>
            <li> The item comes nicely packaged with two different finishing head attachments fine and rough, for tougher areas.</li>
            <li> This is largely because I&#x27;m a barefoot person.</li>
            <li> Certainly though I could have kept going because I was not feeling any sensations of discomfort.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with two rollers, a coarse and a fine.  </li>
            <li> I used the fine one again the next night.  </li>
            <li> used the course roller because my feet were so gross, but I imagine if I keep up with this, the fine one will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve stuck with the fine grit which has been all I need thus far.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like gentle pumice</li>
            <li> I cannot yet speak to how fast the rollers wear out, but I have used mine 2-3 times a week for a month and they are noticeably worn yet.</li>
            <li> I also tried the polish roller, but I really didn&#x27;t think it did anything</li>
            <li> not worry that this is something that will cause irritaion or any real discomfort with use.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to use.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to roll.</li>
            <li> maybe even some flames airbrushed on the handle if that&#x27;s not too much to ask).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it on a callus that I always have and it helped so much.</li>
            <li> It comes ready to operate out of the box</li>
            <li> and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> So this is basically a gentle power-sander for your feet.</li>
            <li> It comes ready to use.</li>
            <li> Most new technology or \\&quot;improved\\&quot; tools fall far short of their promises.  </li>
            <li> the rollers are really easy to change out -- you simply depress a button and they pop off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an amazing little gadget!</li>
            <li> but it rubs on comfortably and really takes dry skin off, without hurting.</li>
            <li> It works really well to smooth out rough areas and calluses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this Silk&#x27;n Electronic File for less than one month and my feet look and feel better already.  </li>
            <li> I have similar products advertised and in stores and was very interested in checking it out, so when I was offered an opportunity to review one for amazon vine at no cost, I jumped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I am ready for summer sandles and flip flops without worrying about my feet looking old and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not hurt at all, but don’t use it more than a few seconds in any spot as it will take off skin</li>
            <li> They warn you in the directions not to use either one for more than a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> but I could see how, if you don&#x27;t clean the heads well enough, the build-up of residue will make the sander less effective and make the job take twice as long.</li>
            <li> your arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the Silk&#x27;n file over the Amope due to the choice of a corse and a fine file roller.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t slide down to turn off as easily as it slides up to turn on.  </li>
            <li> Instead, the entire head removes (as you would do to switch between the coarse and the fine)</li>
            <li> Two different rollers of different textures: one for fine grain and one for rougher grain.</li>
            <li> I never get pedicures -- I just use a pumice stone at home -- and my feet have been getting a bit rough, so I was excited to try this out.  </li>
            <li> This device is lighter in weight, slimmer in the handle, more ergonomic, and easier to hold in general, especially for smaller hands or hands with arthritis.  </li>
            <li> My feet used to be rough, now they are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It removed the dry skin on my heel quickly and painlessly.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for women who can&#x27;t afford or are too busy to get routine pedicures.</li>
            <li> I use to pull out my foot bath first to soften the coarse skin before using the pumice and scrapper.</li>
            <li> Not only does it not come with any replacement rollers, but you actually need to replace the entire top part – the rollers themselves are not removable.  </li>
            <li> I used the blue first all over my heels and on the pads of my feet.</li>
            <li> I now use the grater callus remover and then use the Silk&#x27;n pedicure tool to smooth down the skin.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised how soft my feet felt afterwards (even before I put on lotion).  </li>
            <li> only sadness is that this does not work as fast as I would like</li>
            <li> I have trouble buying shoes that fit</li>
            <li> There is a brush Included for cleaning, but you can pop the whole roller cartridge off and rinse it  under water for extra cleanliness.</li>
            <li> Kudos to whomever developed it.  </li>
            <li> Kudos to whomever developed it.  </li>
            <li> I want to say I was simply amazed at how FAST it worked.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t say enough how fast this works.</li>
            <li> I do wish it came with a storage case, but I am using an old makeup case I have.</li>
            <li> I was finished, my feet were truly soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use between pedicures or instead of a professional pedicure.  </li>
            <li> Second, I would suggest using a foot cream- one specifically for feet, not a regular hand or body lotion- and use it right after.</li>
            <li> Granted, my feet at this point (early May) aren’t as bad as they will be during the summer, but still, to be able to get them smooth with initial use is really</li>
            <li> I read the whole manual first and learned the purple is the heavy duty roller and the turquoise is the polishing roller.  </li>
            <li> I used this last night for the first time after coming back from a rodeo.</li>
            <li> The only drawback to the Silk&#x27;n is that where as the pedi egg catches all of the shavings, the Silk&#x27;n has no compartment so there is a huge mess.  </li>
            <li> It says you probably won&#x27;t have to buy replacement heads for a year with normal use, which makes this a definite value...</li>
            <li> Maybe they were only in nail salons, but I have been missing out on something extraordinary!  </li>
            <li> My big toes each had such large calluses it looked like my toes were deformed.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the rough one lightly and for just a few seconds all over my feet then switched to the finer textured one and did the same.</li>
            <li> I honestly think the only way to really remove calluses or rough spots and cracks is to soak your feet in coconut oil every night and throw socks on while you sleep - at least, that&#x27;s about the only thing that&#x27;s worked for me for any period of time.  </li>
            <li> It quickly removed the callused skin on my heels in a manner of a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> The set comes with two rollers (one rough and the other fine), batteries and a brush (to remove the excess skin).  </li>
            <li> There are two rollers, one with a coarse texture to really get at those tough calluses and another roller with a finer texture to smooth the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within minutes the calluses on my feet were completely gone and the process was totally painless.</li>
            <li> It barely felt like I was doing anything</li>
            <li> No rough skin</li>
            <li> My only gripe so far</li>
            <li> This did a nice job of smoothing them out, and wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable at all.</li>
            <li> I tried not to get my hopes up too much because my callouses are extreme.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with a couple odd ball areas of my feet developing calluses over the last few years as I find myself going without shoes more often.</li>
            <li> only gripe is that cleaning the heads is kind of a pain with the useless brush they provide.</li>
            <li> Not knowing how long a set of rollers will last coupled with the high cost of replacement rollers (on Amazon only from marketplace vendors they are currently about the price of the device) is why I gave this device 4 stars.</li>
            <li> The current price of $29 appears reasonable relative to the other competitive offerings I perused on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it to take off calluses very well, and the roller was a mess.  </li>
            <li> First, I would place down a towel or cloth to &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; all the dry skin that will flake off.</li>
            <li> little device worked really well.</li>
            <li> I liked the two heads, the blue being the sander and the purple being the polisher (just a little finer grain); it says to use the latter after the other, but you can also use that one for other parts of your feet that might just be a little rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After about a month of use on the Amope, I did change the roller due to decreased performance, but I&#x27;m pleased to note in the Silk&#x27;n roller instruction guide it actually states &amp;#34;replace</li>
            <li> Used on dry skin, not wet.</li>
            <li> walk several miles a day, and my feet show it, especially the dreadfully dry and cracked skin on my heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When this callus remover arrived, I put the batteries and coarse grinder in immediately and headed to my (dry) tub.</li>
            <li> You can see the gross dry skin flaking off as you roll over your feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought it was smoking and realized that it was simply removing unwanted dry and cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> One for really rough, coarse skin (blue) and another for softening and polishing (purple).</li>
            <li> In the past she&#x27;s used files, stones, and other callus removers but was willing to try one of the electronic pedicure appliances.  </li>
            <li> I have tried various lotions and other types of products similar to this</li>
            <li> My other devices came with extra replacement rollers, and they did not last a year.  </li>
            <li> No more old lady feet!!</li>
            <li> It definitely smooths out any rough patches or cracks...</li>
            <li> my 9-year old daughter also took a liking to this thing so now when I go to use it I can see her dead skin gunked up on the sander head</li>
            <li> I learned I should never get it wet, and I should only work with dry feet.  </li>
            <li> (You need to use this guy with dry feet- water</li>
            <li> I think the Amope roller (it only has the one roller) is a cross between the two because while it also removes the dried skin, it does it slower.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed that my feet seem even drier than they were before unless I use it every single day.  </li>
            <li> The pluses to the Silk&#x27;n product include two different rollers - the turquoise one is tough for use on calluses and rough areas and the purple one one is a gentle finishing one that polishes and smooths.</li>
            <li> I have only had this little guy for a couple of days</li>
            <li> comes with the two rollers, so you can be as gentle or as tough as you&#x27;d like on your feet</li>
            <li> There is a rough textured roller and a finer textured one.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a few seconds to snap together</li>
            <li> Turn this belt-sander thing on and run it over any rough areas of your feet...</li>
            <li> The Silk&#x27;n Electronic Pedicure File and Callus Remover is a must purchase for those who have rough callus patches on their feet.  </li>
            <li> It has a roller bar that exfoliates the rough area of your feet.  </li>
            <li> After only a few uses, my feet are smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always have rough skin on my heels and if I don&#x27;t use a pumice bar everyday it looks gross.  </li>
            <li> As I got older, the hands got tired and I gave up.  </li>
            <li> It leaves rough edges, and I never really filed my feet down after using it before.  </li>
            <li> No professional pedicures for me, I’m just not comfortable sharing a foot bath or foot tools with hundreds of others.  </li>
            <li> After using this twice this past week, my feet are softer than they&#x27;ve been since maybe I was ten.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I never realized there was a device like this until the last year.  </li>
            <li> I usually just use the coarse.  </li>
            <li> The Silk&#x27;n Electronic Pedicure File and Callus remover didn&#x27;t work quite as well at removing calluses as I thought it would, based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Works well on rough calluses, and to help grind down callus edges.</li>
            <li> That would leave rough edges eventually once it dried up.  </li>
            <li> This one has a combination type off/on switch, where you have to press down a safety button and then slide it up.  </li>
            <li> she said it&#x27;s no more messy than any other method as long as you plan for it.  </li>
            <li> *too* bad to clean and is &amp;#34;quiet enough&amp;#34; for her purposes.  </li>
            <li> When I asked about mess</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent the past 33 years in Florida, going barefoot almost all the time both indoors and outdoors.  </li>
            <li> if you get pedicures regularly, this would still  be a handy product to have at home to prevent the build up of hard, uncomfortable, ugly calluses on your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about this device as I couldn&#x27;t imagine an electronic gadget for my feet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit messy.</li>
            <li> I have passed these type of callous removers by in the past thinking no way but the porous stone on the front does burr away your dead skin with little pressure.  </li>
            <li> My sister like me also has thick callouses and she has confided that she has used her husbands belt sander on her heels from time to time, and while this may seem comically extreme to you...</li>

            <li> I have a small shower stool, and sit there to do my feet since it gives off a lot of dead skin flakes.  </li>
            <li> It’s impossible for me to say at this point how long the rollers on the Silk&#x27;n device will last.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product!  I have (and always have had since childhood) thick callouses on my feet- especially my heels.  This is largely because I&#x27;m a barefoot person. I can walk on gravel without shoes, that&#x27;s the level of callous we are talking about.  My sister like me also has thick callouses and she has confided that she has used her husbands belt sander on her heels from time to time, and while this may seem comically extreme to you... I assure you I was tempted on more than one occasion to ask if I could borrow it despite the dangerousness of that venture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I saw this product I was thrilled.  I tried not to get my hopes up too much because my callouses are extreme.  I read the whole manual first and learned the purple is the heavy duty roller and the turquoise is the polishing roller.  I learned I should never get it wet, and I should only work with dry feet.  I also learned that a roller could last up to a year.  I thought in my case that seems unlikely.  And I think I am probably going to be changing rollers every three months if my test was any indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me because of the thickness of my callouses, each foot took 10 full minutes and I didn&#x27;t get all the callouses off either foot but I feel I did get amazing results.  For the amount of thick cracked callouses I had I was surprised how soft my feet felt afterwards (even before I put on lotion).  I was too tired after 20 mintues to keep going and the batteries (included) felt like they were lagging for me after that time.  Certainly though I could have kept going because I was not feeling any sensations of discomfort.  Perhaps I will change batteries and try again later and see if I can get more off than I did on the first go around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only sadness is that this does not work as fast as I would like (My sister will tell you the belt sander is really fast) and that I know I will have to buy new rollers way sooner than most people would.  Looking on Amazon I don&#x27;t see that you can buy the rollers yet, so hopefully they will come available soon.on I don&#x27;t see that you can buy the rollers yet, so hopefully they will come available soon.</li>
            <li> I used to use pumice stones and a popular scrapper that had me saving my feet like I shaved my legs. As I got older, the hands got tired and I gave up.  No professional pedicures for me, I’m just not comfortable sharing a foot bath or foot tools with hundreds of others.  I saw the Silk&#x27;n Pedi offered with on Vine for review and thought; this may be just what I need. It’s the best of both worlds – an easy-to-use tool offering a finished professional look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The handle fits my hand nicely and makes it easy to maneuver around my feet. There is a blue and purple roller. Blue is coarse; purple is to polish. There is a cover and brush as well, and the Company includes 2AA batteries. I use to pull out my foot bath first to soften the coarse skin before using the pumice and scrapper. I can actually wait and enjoy a warm foot bath after all the work is done – and with the Silk&#x27;n Pedi is actually no work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend reading the booklet thoroughly before you start so you don’t have to interrupt your treatment. Warnings are to use light pressure and do not treat one spot more than 2-3 seconds. Makes sense.</li>
            <li> I purchased my device from Kohl&#x27;s because I did not want to wait for a delivery AND I had a 15% off coupon. This device is AWESOMESAUCE and a must have. It&#x27;s battery operated, sleek, pretty and easy to use. The only draw-back...the replacement rollers are NOT sold in stores and can only be purchased online. I saw and felt a noticeable difference after my first use of this device. My feet used to be rough, now they are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I never get pedicures -- I just use a pumice stone at home -- and my feet have been getting a bit rough, so I was excited to try this out.  It works really well to smooth out rough areas and calluses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with two rollers:  a blue, coarser one for tougher calluses and a purple, finer-grained one for calluses that aren&#x27;t as bad.  Since I have sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve only used the purple one -- but it works great to smooth out rough areas!  After using this twice this past week, my feet are softer than they&#x27;ve been since maybe I was ten.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend using this over your bathtub or in your shower.  I have a small shower stool, and sit there to do my feet since it gives off a lot of dead skin flakes.  (Using a towel under your feet would work too, of course, but you definitely want something to make clean-up easy.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best things about this are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  comes with the two rollers, so you can be as gentle or as tough as you&#x27;d like on your feet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  the rollers are really easy to change out -- you simply depress a button and they pop off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave this four stars instead of five are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  there is no speed or pressure control; it would have been nice if you could use this on a gentler speed; I know that it probably needs to move at a minimum speed in order to work, but it does hurt a wee bit when using it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  it would be nice if the rollers were easier to clean; the package comes with a little brush, but it doesn&#x27;t remove all the debris off the rollers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this!  It&#x27;s the perfect device to use as we get head into sandal weather!</li>
            <li> I have trouble buying shoes that fit so I end up with calluses. I was a little nervous about this device as I couldn&#x27;t imagine an electronic gadget for my feet. But this one is great! It&#x27;s like gentle pumice but it rubs on comfortably and really takes dry skin off, without hurting. Easier to use than pumice stones, too. Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries were included and they were easy to add. The compartment opened easily.  However, the batteries were wrapped really tightly in plastic! That was the hardest part of using the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different method for keeping my feet smooth and I&#x27;ve been disappointed in all of them until now! This is by far THE BEST product I&#x27;ve ever come across! It is fast and easy. Works like a charm. I&#x27;m VERY satisfied!!</li>
            <li> My favorite device of this type. ( I also have an emjoi). The device is easy to hold and pretty lightweight.  I like that it comes with rollers of 2 different degrees of coarseness. I cannot yet speak to how fast the rollers wear out, but I have used mine 2-3 times a week for a month and they are noticeably worn yet. There is a brush Included for cleaning, but you can pop the whole roller cartridge off and rinse it  under water for extra cleanliness. Batteries are included which is a nice surprise. Works so well, be sure to use it over a towel or paper or else you&#x27;ll have foot callus dust all over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I never realized there was a device like this until the last year.  Maybe they were only in nail salons, but I have been missing out on something extraordinary!  I also have the Amope (a similar device), and I truly didn&#x27;t think I could like something better than the Amope, but I do prefer this callus remover with one exception.  This one has a combination type off/on switch, where you have to press down a safety button and then slide it up.  Turning it on was fairly easy, but turning it off was a challenge at first.  It doesn&#x27;t slide down to turn off as easily as it slides up to turn on.  The Amope has a rotational off/on switch where you just twist on the handle and turn it on, and twist again to turn it off.  I greatly prefer the Amope on/off switch, but besides that one feature, I greatly prefer the the Silk&#x27;n callus remover. While the roller on this one seems much smaller than the one on the Amope, it is more effective.  It removed the dry skin on my heel quickly and painlessly.  This remover comes with two rollers, a coarse roller and a polish roller.  I think the Amope roller (it only has the one roller) is a cross between the two because while it also removes the dried skin, it does it slower.  The coarse roller on this remover is a beast!  It quickly removed the callused skin on my heels in a manner of a few seconds.  It&#x27;s truly amazing.  It also comes with a brush to clean the device (the Amope didn&#x27;t have a brush).  I also tried the polish roller, but I really didn&#x27;t think it did anything and doubt I would use it again.  After about a month of use on the Amope, I did change the roller due to decreased performance, but I&#x27;m pleased to note in the Silk&#x27;n roller instruction guide it actually states &amp;#34;replace the roller.....depending upon the intensity of use, but generally after one year.&amp;#34;  That would be great, as you wouldn&#x27;t need to buy many refills.  Also, I noticed that this device is quieter when I used the coarse grinder comparedto the Amope.  And one last really nice feature is it&#x27;s size and shape.  This device is lighter in weight, slimmer in the handle, more ergonomic, and easier to hold in general, especially for smaller hands or hands with arthritis.  I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> It works.... but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the best solution.  It definitely smooths out any rough patches or cracks... but I&#x27;ve noticed that my feet seem even drier than they were before unless I use it every single day.  I honestly think the only way to really remove calluses or rough spots and cracks is to soak your feet in coconut oil every night and throw socks on while you sleep - at least, that&#x27;s about the only thing that&#x27;s worked for me for any period of time.  But - the product does work..... you just need to use it every day to maintain the results.</li>
            <li> My wife says this device is effective, easy to use, and easy to hold.  When I asked about mess she said it&#x27;s no more messy than any other method as long as you plan for it.  In the past she&#x27;s used files, stones, and other callus removers but was willing to try one of the electronic pedicure appliances.  She says this is the best of all the methods she&#x27;s used.  She also indicated it&#x27;s not *too* bad to clean and is &amp;#34;quiet enough&amp;#34; for her purposes.  Overall, she&#x27;s pleased with the appliance which means I now have to plan for replacement rollers.  Not knowing how long a set of rollers will last coupled with the high cost of replacement rollers (on Amazon only from marketplace vendors they are currently about the price of the device) is why I gave this device 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent the past 33 years in Florida, going barefoot almost all the time both indoors and outdoors.  Needless to say I&#x27;ve built up a lot of tough and cracked skin on both feet.  Not just on both feet, but on all ten toes.  When my wife first saw THE HOBBIT she turned to me and asked if I was a foot model for the film.  Slowly but surely she&#x27;s convinced me that I need to take better care of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manly man that I am, I decided to order this Silk&#x27;n Electronic Pedicure File and Callus Remover.  I thought about going to a beauty salon and getting a pedicure, but I was afraid that after they got over the shock of seeing my feet, that I would have to visit several salons to get bids to be worked on--kind of like getting a bid to build a house.  Besides that, women talk to their stylists like men chat with their barbers.  In no time Hobbit sightings were bound to be reported around our small town.  Next thing you know someone would put a reward out for its (my) capture.  Being retired, I don&#x27;t have time for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions on assembly (put in two batteries which are included) were simple as were the operating instructions. All you have to do is take off the plastic cover and gently roll the top of the revolving cylinder on the affected area.  The instructions also say \\&quot;prepare for a mess\\&quot;.  No problem for me since I used to start off with a belt sander and then graduate to an orbital sander.  My wife always made me put up plastic sheeting since my efforts always resulted in clouds of white dust trying to work their way throughout our home.  Believe it or not, this Silk&#x27;n Electronic Pedicure File and Callus Remover also puts out quite a cloud of dust. If something starts to smell like it&#x27;s burning, it&#x27;s probably time to stop your treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been hard to please.  Most new technology or \\&quot;improved\\&quot; tools fall far short of their promises.  Nothing irritates me more that someone (something) who over promises and under delivers.  This tool works like a charm and allows me to take care of my foot issue without rumors circulating around our fair town.  Kudos to whomever developed it.  Maybe they could invent something to permanently remove back hair next!  They could call it the \\&quot;Manly Man&#x27;s Back Hair Mower\\&quot;, or maybe the \\&quot;Back Hair Whacker\\&quot;.elivers.

            <li> I have very dry, rough and calloused feet which truly drives me crazy. I have tried various lotions and other types of products similar to this and I have to say that this is, by far, my favorite. I love the fact that you get two types of buffers/rollers. ..One to really work of the rough stuff and one to polish and give an excellent finishing polish for very smooth skin. I am very pleased with this electronic pedicure beauty accessory and recommend it to anyone looking for smoother skin and softer feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with a couple odd ball areas of my feet developing calluses over the last few years as I find myself going without shoes more often. Normally I have to soak my feet pretty good for a while and then just use a knife to scrape them down/off but this thing allows me to take care of them within a couple minutes that I start to notice they are bugging me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soak method works really good but it&#x27;s nice to be able to get them in between soaks. A nice product at this time, hopefully it holds up well.</li>
            <li> I have had others of these electronic callus remover devices before, and I have to say, the Silk&#x27;n is the best one I’ve used.  It is the fastest and gave me the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I walk several miles a day, and my feet show it, especially the dreadfully dry and cracked skin on my heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to get very good results with one try with this device.  Granted, my feet at this point (early May) aren’t as bad as they will be during the summer, but still, to be able to get them smooth with initial use is really amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to put a lotion on your feet afterwards.  I use either Badger foot balm or Vaseline Intensive Repair lotion.  I use the device once a week and put the balm or lotion on my heels every night before I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device comes with two batteries, but I would recommend getting some rechargeable batteries when they wear out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two rollers, a coarse and a fine.  I usually just use the coarse.  It does not hurt at all, but don’t use it more than a few seconds in any spot as it will take off skin and you don’t want to go deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the manual, the rollers should last about a year.  That is my only concern.  My other devices came with extra replacement rollers, and they did not last a year.  It’s impossible for me to say at this point how long the rollers on the Silk&#x27;n device will last.  Not only does it not come with any replacement rollers, but you actually need to replace the entire top part – the rollers themselves are not removable.  Instead, the entire head removes (as you would do to switch between the coarse and the fine) and so the entire head must be replaced, not just the rollers.  I could not find any replacement heads for sale, so I assume that essentially, this is a toss-after-a-year product.</li>
            <li> Love the Silk&#x27;n Electronic Pedicure File and Callus system. The item comes nicely packaged with two different finishing head attachments fine and rough, for tougher areas. The unit is easy to handle, heads are easy to interchange and it&#x27;s battery operated (included).  For those summer feet this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I have only had this little guy for a couple of days but I am in love. My feet were covered in very thick calluses from years of running with bad shoes and generally not taking care of my feet. My big toes each had such large calluses it looked like my toes were deformed. When this callus remover arrived, I put the batteries and coarse grinder in immediately and headed to my (dry) tub. (You need to use this guy with dry feet- water is a bad bad idea here). Within minutes the calluses on my feet were completely gone and the process was totally painless. My tub however, was covered in gross skin flakes! This cleaned up really easily with a damp paper towel, though.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m super happy with this little appliance. I plan to use it regularly to keep my feet looking great throughout sandal season.</li>
            <li> What does this have that Amope doesn&#x27;t? Two different rollers of different textures: one for fine grain and one for rougher grain. You don&#x27;t use this to remove calluses all at once, it&#x27;s a gradual process, yet you feel the effects right away. If your rough heels have been catching on your sheets at night, try this. Give it a week. You&#x27;ll be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing little gadget! I have similar products advertised and in stores and was very interested in checking it out, so when I was offered an opportunity to review one for amazon vine at no cost, I jumped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am on my feet all day at work and living in Florida, spend a lot of my free time barefoot. These are 2 very good reasons I wanted (and needed) this. Well, I was not disappointed! I want to say I was simply amazed at how FAST it worked. I saw instant results. Now,my fet were not really all that bad, but I did have some rough patches and very dry, cracked heels. Guess what? I DO  NOT ANYMORE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with 2 heads. One for really rough, coarse skin (blue) and another for softening and polishing (purple). I used the blue first all over my heels and on the pads of my feet. Wow. I just can&#x27;t say enough how fast this works. I do recommend 2 things. First, I would place down a towel or cloth to &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; all the dry skin that will flake off. It&#x27;s a bit messy. Second, I would suggest using a foot cream- one specifically for feet, not a regular hand or body lotion- and use it right after. It will help with the softening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not worry that this is something that will cause irritaion or any real discomfort with use. I know some of the advertised foot products look like they might be painful or make your feet sore after. Not The Silk&#x27;n.  It barely felt like I was doing anything and my feet were super soft and smooth after. Now I am ready for summer sandles and flip flops without worrying about my feet looking old and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with the 2 heads, it also comes with the 2 AA batteries needed and a cleaning brush. I do wish it came with a storage case, but I am using an old makeup case I have.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you what great results I get from the Silk&#x27;n Electronic File. I get some serious callouses and it takes forever to file them off. I have tried various different manual files, the Ped Egg, a metal file and the Amope electronic foot file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Silk&#x27;n and the Amope beat manual filing easily. You can buff off callouses in a fraction of the time without tiring out your arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the Silk&#x27;n file over the Amope due to the choice of a corse and a fine file roller. The Amope only has a corse file. For people with normal feet that would just like to maintain their pedicure at home, the fine file may be all they need. The 2 units seem to provide similar results using the corse file.</li>
            <li> Works well on rough calluses, and to help grind down callus edges. Two heads, a turquoise one with coarser grain and the purple one with finer grain..not a huge difference, but some, and both finer than the volcanic pumice stone I use. Used on dry skin, not wet. Shapes the edges of calluses more easily than a pumice stone does. Safer than those blades they use at some pedicure places.</li>
            <li> I love this machine!  I always have rough skin on my heels and if I don&#x27;t use a pumice bar everyday it looks gross.  I have tried all kinds of files, creams, vinegar, antifungal cream to no avail.  Enter this electronic item and I have had a breakthrough.  No rough skin and I have not needed the pumice at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how I used it. There is a rough textured roller and a finer textured one.  The first time I used the rough one lightly and for just a few seconds all over my feet then switched to the finer textured one and did the same. They warn you in the directions not to use either one for more than a few seconds.  Any way, instant smoothness.  I used the fine one again the next night.  Now I use mostly the fine one about every other day for a quick touch up before my bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just great, my feet look and feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> The Silk&#x27;n Electronic Pedicure File and Callus remover is a great solution to an annoying problem - foot calluses.  I had previously purchased a different product, the Perfect Pedi, which costs $10 more; I like this better.  The pluses to the Silk&#x27;n product include two different rollers - the turquoise one is tough for use on calluses and rough areas and the purple one one is a gentle finishing one that polishes and smooths. I like that you can treat this issue easily and safely at home yourself.  The refills suggested price for one of each is $19.95, but they are $16.95 on the Silk&#x27;n website&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you get pedicures regularly, this would still  be a handy product to have at home to prevent the build up of hard, uncomfortable, ugly calluses on your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:  Make sure your feet are totally dry before using it, and apply it very lightly; that&#x27;s all the pressure needed to do the job.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It only takes a few seconds to snap together and you&#x27;re ready to use.  Just glide it over your feet and the callouses just melt away.  Then change the head to the smoother and you soon have silky smooth feet.  I&#x27;ve used a pedi egg for years and what would take hours of work with that only takes minutes with the Silk&#x27;n.  The only drawback to the Silk&#x27;n is that where as the pedi egg catches all of the shavings, the Silk&#x27;n has no compartment so there is a huge mess.  Be prepared to file your feet over a towel or wastebasket.</li>
            <li> I used this last night for the first time after coming back from a rodeo. My feet were disgusting. In fact, they&#x27;re disgusting a lot of the time because I hate wearing shoes. Pedicures usually do the trick, but I can&#x27;t afford to get a pedicure a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little device worked really well. There&#x27;s not assembly. All you have to do is put in the included batteries and take the protective covering off and you&#x27;re ready to roll. It felt really good on my feet. You can see the gross dry skin flaking off as you roll over your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the course roller because my feet were so gross, but I imagine if I keep up with this, the fine one will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was finished, my feet were truly soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is small so you can pack it to take on vacation, shove it in a drawer, put it in your purse (if you need to, I guess).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think for what it does, it&#x27;s worth the price. I mean, $25 a pop for a pedicure, or $30 for something you can use over and over to make your feet feel nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really have nothing bad to say about this product. I highly recommend it for women who can&#x27;t afford or are too busy to get routine pedicures.</li>
            <li> The Silk&#x27;n Electronic Pedicure File and Callus remover didn&#x27;t work quite as well at removing calluses as I thought it would, based on other reviews.  I think my problem is that I use too much thick lotion  daily (Gold Bond Shea Butter).  I didn&#x27;t find it to take off calluses very well, and the roller was a mess.  This was using the coarse roller.  However, I found a perfect use for it for me.  I sometimes use one of the cheese grater type callus removers.  It leaves rough edges, and I never really filed my feet down after using it before.  That would leave rough edges eventually once it dried up.  I now use the grater callus remover and then use the Silk&#x27;n pedicure tool to smooth down the skin.  I also use the smoother roller on the edges of my fingers/cuticles to smooth them out after using cuticle nippers.  Therefore, I am quite happy with my Silk&#x27;n pedicure tool, even though I don&#x27;t feel it works well enough for the intended purposes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this Silk&#x27;n Electronic File for less than one month and my feet look and feel better already.  I&#x27;m a guy but hey we have feet too and we wear flipflops.  Every couple of years my wife forces me to join her and my daughter for a mani/pedi and I always feel bad for the person that has to work on me (lots of deferred maintenance - hey I&#x27;m a guy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In guy-speak - this thing is a belt sander for your feet.  It has two grits, coarse and fine, which come in the form of cartridge heads (kind of like changing out the blade on your Gillette-type razor).  So far I&#x27;ve stuck with the fine grit which has been all I need thus far.  Turn this belt-sander thing on and run it over any rough areas of your feet...basically it sandpapers off skin and you can actually see the sawdust (skin) floating up in the air.  Within 10 minutes both my feet were girly smooth.  On the cons side my 9-year old daughter also took a liking to this thing so now when I go to use it I can see her dead skin gunked up on the sander head so I have to give it a very good cleaning before I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notables - includes the disposable batteries, easy operation (just turn it on and it starts spinning then turn it off), good build quality - appears durable.  My only gripe so far (besides my daughter using it) would be to have a bit more gender neutral color scheme (or maybe even some flames airbrushed on the handle if that&#x27;s not too much to ask).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I like this thing and will continue to use it (when no one is looking).  The current price of $29 appears reasonable relative to the other competitive offerings I perused on Amazon.  Overall I rate it 5-STARS in consideration of price/value.  If there&#x27;s any future notables with my product experience I&#x27;ll add update comments to my review.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with this little gadget. I used it on a callus that I always have and it helped so much. I was afraid it would hurt but it didn&#x27;t at all. And it just took a couple of minutes to make a big difference on my feet. This is a great little gadget to get your feet ready for summer weather.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t truly say I was a believer.  I&#x27;ve had other devices that have sworn to do a fine job as a pedicure file, and failed miserably.  I was stunned by the effortless manner in which this file works.  It is painless and simple.  I thought it was smoking and realized that it was simply removing unwanted dry and cracked skin.  My feet are smooth and happy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a believer now!</li>
            <li> Ladies with cracked heels and callouses on the sides and tops of your toes, heads-up, this device can take them on!!  NOT A GIMMICK throw away.  It looks like it could never work and delicate looking but it is a dead skin eating monster!  Lay a towel under your foot while you work and you are going to be so surprised and what this removes and polishes your skin to a beautiful healthy look.  I have passed these type of callous removers by in the past thinking no way but the porous stone on the front does burr away your dead skin with little pressure.  I never felt any discomfort using this. This along with a foot rasp are all you&#x27;ll need this summer to keep your pedicures beautiful.  No more old lady feet!!</li>
            <li> The Silk&#x27;n Electronic Pedicure File and Callus Remover is a must purchase for those who have rough callus patches on their feet.  This handy and lightweight battery operated file is easy to use and clean.  The set comes with two rollers (one rough and the other fine), batteries and a brush (to remove the excess skin).  It comes ready to operate out of the box and it works very well.  I used it on both of my feet and now the calluses I had on my heels have been rubbed away.  The file will get dusty from the excess skin and that&#x27;s where the brush comes in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a callus remover and are tired of using a file or a pumice stone then the Silk&#x27;n Electronic Pedicure File and Callus Remover is a must purchase.</li>
            <li> So this is basically a gentle power-sander for your feet. I don&#x27;t have many callouses on mine, but the two prominent ones I&#x27;ve had since I was a kid. This did a nice job of smoothing them out, and wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable at all. The directions say to not apply pressure for more than 2-3 seconds at a time, but they&#x27;re being cautious...if you have thicker callouses, you can sand away with a bit more gusto. I liked the two heads, the blue being the sander and the purple being the polisher (just a little finer grain); it says to use the latter after the other, but you can also use that one for other parts of your feet that might just be a little rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that cleaning the heads is kind of a pain with the useless brush they provide. A sterilized old toothbrush works much better. It says you probably won&#x27;t have to buy replacement heads for a year with normal use, which makes this a definite value...but I could see how, if you don&#x27;t clean the heads well enough, the build-up of residue will make the sander less effective and make the job take twice as long.</li>
            <li> Silk&#x27;n pedicure device is great to use right out of the package.  It has a roller bar that exfoliates the rough area of your feet.  Just place a towel or newspaper on the floor or sit with your feet over the bathtub and run the roller over the areas you want to smooth.  It is great to use on callouses and hopefully overtime they will smooth out.  Use between pedicures or instead of a professional pedicure.  This is far superior to pumice stones and ped eggs. Nice gift too!</li>
            <li> I am an avid exerciser, so my feet have lots of calluses. I love treating myself to professional pedicures, but since they are rather pricey, I try to do it myself sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s very easy to use. The instructions are very clear and easy to understand. I am happy that I read them before trying this product. The key take away from the instructions was to not spend more than 2-3 seconds on a callus. I thought I would have to spend more time on them, but that isn&#x27;t necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It works! After only a few uses, my feet are smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The product design. There are two rollers, one with a coarse texture to really get at those tough calluses and another roller with a finer texture to smooth the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It comes ready to use. Batteries are included with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a way to pamper your feet, you will enjoy this product!</li>
            <li> Works fine but cheaper at Kohls.</li>
