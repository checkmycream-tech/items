            <li>Beautiful hair, clean and conditioned.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s nice and smells nice.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m leaving any kind of powder or substance in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!!!</li>
            <li>This product works into my hair easily and has a pleasant, but not overpowering, scent.</li>
            <li>Great dry shampoo and wonderful price.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t build up in my hair at all the way others do and it has a pleasant light smell.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty good!</li>
            <li>Not as good as a shampoo but fine substitute after exercise.</li>
            <li>This one leaves my day 2 and 3 hair looking better than my day 1 hair, to be honest.</li>
            <li>Really nice and useful good product</li>
            <li>Also has a very light fragrance.</li>
            <li>Honestly the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found is the suave professionals keritan.</li>
            <li>I like the suave one better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased I did.</li>
            <li>I will look for something better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, smells nice, and doesn&#x27;t leave acresidue.  </li>
            <li>I mostly got this for my teens who don&#x27;t have time to wash their hair every day but have issues with greasy, stringy looking hair.</li>
            <li>to make sure, before I wrote this review, I used it 4 times.</li>
            <li>, I love the way I smell afterwards.</li>
            <li>My hair looks greasy on the top after about 6 hours of washing.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>so that made it even better.</li>
            <li>I will purchase this item again :)</li>
            <li>Better to just use it if you&#x27;ve got a date at night after work and want to touch up your hair.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>a gift for myself I love</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this once I go through it.</li>
            <li>Though I like the cost better than my</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this</li>
            <li>This is my favorite</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I did, and I agree that it works better than pricier competitors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product, that&#x27;s all I have to say</li>
            <li>This product made my hair even more oily.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>But it just makes it look more oily and adds to the scalp build up.</li>
            <li>The one thing that does make me nervous is the overwhelming smell and product that you can&#x27;t quite get away from.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many and this is the one I prefer.</li>
            <li>This stuff is ok, but did not perform a miracle on my hair that needed to be washed.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is awesome.</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo and or volumizer I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is the best!</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo out there.</li>
            <li>Smells good but the fragrance does not last, which, to me, is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I love all of the sulfate free products from L&#x27;Oreal but this is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect dry shampoo and thought I&#x27;d found &amp;#34;The One&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo ever!</li>
            <li>It feels refreshing to get that strong, cool blast on the scalp!</li>
            <li>Nice and light clean smell.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and appealing.  </li>
            <li>It refreshes your hair, gives it body, and has a light lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have very fine blonde/dirty blonde hair and found that this works great with my hair.</li>
            <li>Great price and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t seem to make the greasy look go away as easily.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell strong and like perfume.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell, made my head itch and came out strong.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, but not horrible.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic and works better than most dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried (and smells great to boot)</li>
            <li>Not bad, but still on the hunt for something better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine and does what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li>Love this for quick &amp;#34;re-set&amp;#34; between washings.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the strong smell, but otherwise a great dry shampoo that is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>It goes on light and it really does dissolve oils from the hair, it freshens, enhances body and it leaves a clean sensational feeling on the scalp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would also possibly be good for somebody who is bedridden as they can have clean hair without showering or bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t expect this to replace your normal shampooing cycle.</li>
            <li>It gives me great volume and doesn&#x27;t make my roots white.</li>
            <li>It is cheap, sprays well with no visible product, but has a stronger scent that I notice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is quite light, so</li>
            <li>This would probably be great if you wanted a low hold hairspray and wanted to a product to use rat or back-comb your hair ala 60s 70s.</li>
            <li>I have to be very thorough applying this product, which is kind of a pain</li>
            <li>I went a whole second day and my hair still looks great!</li>
            <li>This hair care product really works well !!!</li>
            <li>Smells fabulous and clean.</li>
            <li>She has super fine hair and it can help keep her hair tighter in a pony or with a bow.</li>
            <li>At first i thought it was okay</li>
            <li>I just do it because I HAVE to run because I love ice cream) and that makes my hair need washing more frequently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dry shampoos before that worked great, this one didn&#x27;t do it for me</li>
            <li>For the cost, this dry shampoo touch-up is great.  </li>
            <li>Immediately when you spray your hair and scalp feel clean.</li>
            <li>This a great inexpensive dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Pssssst, Batiste Cherry (ick) and Tropical scents, and Not Your Mothers Clean Freak.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo keeps my hair looking great.</li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t make my hair look clean.</li>
            <li>Great for my in between hair washing, my Locs respond well to the dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>Best value dry shampoo.best bang for buck dry shampoo best bang for buck dry shampoo.great value.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say this L&#x27;oreal dry shampoo delivers!</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair look clean at the top of my head.</li>
            <li>, it made my hair smell good, but you can still see some greasiness if it&#x27;s the 2nd day since you washed your hair...</li>
            <li>Only plus is that it makes your hair smell good.</li>
            <li>It was better than Dove&#x27;s but not by much.  </li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>It does allow you to skip a day (sometimes two) which is more healthy for your hair, but I&#x27;ve found it helped me significantly to use it daily when I wanted to &amp;#34;style&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It leaves no residue, it&#x27;s mess free, it smells great</li>
            <li>Pretty strong.</li>
            <li>Instead it is like a very light hairspray, clear and light and sticky.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was as described, but irritated my scalp.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any white powder on my hair, smells great and really removes oil buildup in my hair if I don&#x27;t get to wash it for days.</li>
            <li>This is quick.</li>
            <li>In the morning my hair is as light as the first day.</li>
            <li>It makes my scalp feel clean, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and had a light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Smells good, it works reall well for dry shampoo..</li>
            <li>This product did not dry out my roots as I would have liked</li>
            <li>Big Sexy Hair dry shampoo has been the best, so far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried like 5 different dry shampoos and this is the best!</li>
            <li>Works the best out of several dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo unlike the fresh brand that leaves white residue.</li>
            <li>Great for dark hair!</li>
            <li>Smells good but leaves a white powder on your hair that is very noticeable.</li>
            <li>but if you have to use an 8th of the bottle to make your hair presentable is it really worth it?</li>
            <li>There are far better products on the market.</li>
            <li>Smells good and adds volume but absolutely leaves white residue.  </li>
            <li>right up there with the Batiste brand of dry-shampoos, which has been my favorite brand so far.</li>
            <li>It is also very refreshing, as odd as that may sound.</li>
            <li>gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed, mainly because I had such low expectations.</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>This is Mrs, by the way: this stuff makes my hair greasier than it was to begin with and doesn&#x27;t seem to clean much at all.</li>
            <li>This is OK but it sometimes leaves a white residue in my light brown hair and it doesn&#x27;t really get rid of the oil.</li>
            <li>It smells good which is rare for the older brands of dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and full of body!</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of dry shampoo</li>
            <li>$17/bottle dry shampoo, it just was not as effective.  </li>
            <li>if you just do a quick spray it doesn&#x27;t always appear to have worked very well.</li>
            <li>I read I could make my own dry shampoo with 1/2 baking soda and 1/2 corn starch???</li>
            <li>Also shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>The smell is ok but it doesn&#x27;t clean your hair as expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, but I&#x27;ll be trying a different product when this one runs out.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>This product leaves a white residue in my hair most of the time.</li>
            <li>so I purchased this item as it was cheaper and had higher customer ratings.</li>
            <li>I feel I need to use a lot more for the same effect.</li>
            <li>and it looks even better the second day.</li>
            <li>Even regular baby powder works better.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really beat the price either!</li>
            <li>Great for long hair and ladies and some men who don&#x27;t want to wash their hair daily.</li>
            <li>This smells funny.</li>
            <li>I will order more of this in the future.</li>
            <li>in a pinch, when you hair is all oily and matty, and you just NEED to het it looking clean, this will do the trick better than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs quick cleaning between hair washing.  </li>
            <li>excellent.product, it smells nice and and don&#x27;t live white residue in your hair.</li>
            <li>I have used Garnier dry shampoo and it smells really nice and works very well.</li>
            <li>Especially for the price, I would recommed this product to anyone who is looking for a great dry shampoo to use any morning</li>
            <li>I have to work the white powder through with my fingers, but overall pretty good.</li>
            <li>so that is one positive attribute.  </li>
            <li>It leaves no white powder residue and It actually has a nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li>There are better dry shampoos out there.</li>
            <li>One of the better dry shampoos out there.</li>
            <li>I love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brands of dry hairspray and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I really really love this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I am now using the dry shampoo by &amp;#34;not your mother&#x27;s&amp;#34; I think it is called something like &amp;#34;clean freek&amp;#34; and it works much better</li>
            <li>Is talc free and doesn&#x27;t poof hair up as much as  other powdery dry shampoos, but is very refreshing and does the job.</li>
            <li>It works the same, the smell is not quite as strong, and it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and when my hair gets oily it is definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li>Total waste of money product isnt that great used it once and never again...</li>
            <li>My hair responded really well to it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really smell and you don&#x27;t have to shake it a ton to spray it.</li>
            <li>This works really well in my hair.</li>
            <li>But, it just doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; very well.  </li>
            <li>Also it didn&#x27;t remove as much of the oily look as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>And it really works to make my hair look not greasy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave as much residue as others</li>
            <li>really like this product ....</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for a modern texturizing product you might want to keep looking.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>This product really does work to revive hair and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and is frangrance-free.</li>
            <li>, that doesn&#x27;t help me much...</li>
            <li>Works okay, but not much in a can.</li>
            <li>It sucks up the oil in your hair quite nicely and leaves it looking fresh.</li>
            <li>Gives limp and lifeless hair more body and keeps your hair fresh looking for up to 3 days.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave you with weird feeling hair like most others.</li>
            <li>I have used baby powder and several dry shampoos (most of which were way more expensive than this one), but then I read a review in InStyle magazine rating this the best dry shampoo, so I had to give this a shot.</li>
            <li>, so my search hasn&#x27;t ended yet, but in the mean time, this is a good one.</li>
            <li>This is a fast fix for those of us who simply need a fast way to clean in between the longer method of washing, drying and styling.</li>
            <li>But as the other reviewers said, it does leave powdery layer on top.</li>
            <li>It works, but there are other products that seem to work much better.</li>
            <li>Like most of the other stuff out there.</li>
            <li>so I would just use this product, a brush, and a little hair spray and honestly my hair looked better than when I used to pull out the ole Chi and curling iron mess.  </li>
            <li>works good without leaving too much white residue on dark hair</li>
            <li>Ive tried a good 10 different dry hairsprays and this one so far takes the cake.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay - not great, not bad!</li>
            <li>Some dry shampoos allow me to got a full 24-36 hours without washing but this one really doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cut the grease&amp;#34; much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible I have unrealistic expectations, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>Perfect for crazy busy mornings when you just didn&#x27;t have time to wash your hair.</li>
            <li>great for after a work out, keep a blowout another day, extra body, or when you are having a late morning and just roll out of bed.</li>
            <li>Also I am super blonde</li>
            <li>You only need a few sprays and to brush it through your hair and you are good to go.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It has a really great scent, and doesn&#x27;t leave any weird texture (stickiness, stiffness, dryness, etc.)</li>
            <li>Took my hair from greasy and gross to soft and full.</li>
            <li>With this dry shampoo I can go at least 3 days without washing my hair and it looks great.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t get oily easily, it&#x27;s more on the dry side, but I was looking for a product that would help give me some shape and body and take away the 2nd day hair &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thank you for making this such an easy buying process, especially during the hectic holiday season.</li>
            <li>This is the only dry shampoo that I use I love it.</li>
            <li>it slicks back right against my scalp).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried three other well known brands and they didn&#x27;t work nearly as well and had a strong fragrance that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>The only really good stuff is made by Toni and Guy, but it&#x27;s super expensive.</li>
            <li>I had used Kerastase dry shampoo in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li>I use several different dry shampoos, and this is my favorite brand.  </li>
            <li>Not exactly what I was hoping for, but one of the better dry shampoos.</li>
            <li>Worked really well- not at all white.</li>
            <li>On them, it helped quite a bit with the greasiness but didn&#x27;t take it completely away -</li>
            <li>On me it did take the greasy feeling completely away.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say how far this product goes.</li>
            <li>I made time to write this review because I wanted to tell others who have had to deal with sensitive scalp issues that this might work for them as well.</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft like you just washed.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last the whole day though.  </li>
            <li>It works really well and does not leave white residue in my hair.</li>
            <li>I shake the can really well and use short bursts.  </li>
            <li>When I first used this product I really liked how my hair felt clean, unlike some other products that can make my hair feel dirty.</li>
            <li>Looks as good if not better than when washing the previous day.</li>
            <li>This was my first dry shampoo experience.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is the first dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>And, the bottle feels half full-</li>
            <li>This arrived to me on time, but it wasn&#x27;t even half full.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have issues with it leaving a super white film/powder in my hair like some dry shampoos...</li>
            <li>I have tried countless other dry shampoos, this one is so far my favorite.</li>
            <li>However, I can usually get it to go away with some fluffing and styling, so all in all not bad for my first dry shampoo experience.</li>
            <li>Other brands of dry shampoo or products that call themselves &amp;#34;texture spray&amp;#34; will either clog up immediately, make your hair feel gummy, need to be used on wet hair only, or are only good for the &amp;#34;beach style&amp;#34; waves/messy look.  </li>
            <li>I also found a hair gel with no silicone and very water soluble (so I don&#x27;t need the detergents in shampoo which needlessly dry out my hair</li>
            <li>I really like this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>Make sure you hold it at least 8 inches away to avoid any white residue.  </li>
            <li>If my hair is wet, or greasy then it turns dark brown, this stuff however seems to really absorb any oils in my hair and makes it look nearly fresh again.</li>
            <li>very dark blonde &amp; my teens have light blonde hair).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, and a few spritzes goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have fine, somewhat dry hair and don&#x27;t want to wash it everyday.</li>
            <li>When I finally decided to give this one a shot however, I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>and I never felt it was brushed out completely.</li>
            <li>Actually, it did one time when I first got it and really over sprayed my hair, but I think that was user error rather than product error, as I have never had that problem again and have been using for a few months (still on the same can).</li>
            <li>Smells nice, isn&#x27;t excessively sticky or tacky and I don&#x27;t get a lot of white dust on my dark hair from the product.</li>
            <li>I have thick, dry hair that my stylist says I shouldn&#x27;t wash more than every 3 days.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair look fresh without making it feel stiff.</li>
            <li>The spray is extremely fine and as long as you shake it well and hold it a few inches from your hairline, there will be no white residue.</li>
            <li>Not a huge fan of this, I&#x27;m a dry shampoo connoisseur because I have fine, blonde, oily</li>
            <li>I am new to dry shampoo, but I find it does the job.  </li>
            <li>I have bought much more expensive brands, but this is the winner so far.</li>
            <li>The product distributes pretty evenly so you don&#x27;t get that gunky white build up when you use it, even on dark hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine color-treated blonde hair that was left flat and lifeless when using other dry shampoos.</li>
            <li>Unlike other products, this one does not leave hair too dry or too oily, but just right.  </li>
            <li>I have thick but fine hair and this left a residue on my hair that a regular shampoo could not remove.</li>
            <li>Only supermarket brand dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry out my straight hair.</li>
            <li>However, be careful not to spray too much as it does still give you that grey</li>
            <li>My scalp&#x27;s oily, so the only time that worked out well is the first few weeks after I color my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair felt a little rough, like I had sprayed it with mild hairspray.</li>
            <li>only thing is that I can&#x27;t wear my hair down with this stuff, it really needs to be up in a pony tail.</li>
            <li>I have tried several dry shampoos and they either have a distinct odd smell or leave white powder in your hair.</li>
            <li>I have thick, dark hair and many brands, even salon brands, just leave my hair white.</li>

            <li> Really nice and useful good product</li>
            <li> Also has a very light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Honestly the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found is the suave professionals keritan.</li>
            <li> I like the suave one better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased I did.</li>
            <li> I will look for something better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, smells nice, and doesn&#x27;t leave acresidue.  </li>
            <li> I mostly got this for my teens who don&#x27;t have time to wash their hair every day but have issues with greasy, stringy looking hair.</li>
            <li> to make sure, before I wrote this review, I used it 4 times.</li>
            <li> , I love the way I smell afterwards.</li>
            <li> My hair looks greasy on the top after about 6 hours of washing.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> so that made it even better.</li>
            <li> I will purchase this item again :)</li>
            <li> Better to just use it if you&#x27;ve got a date at night after work and want to touch up your hair.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>

            <li> I will be buying more of this once I go through it.</li>
            <li> Though I like the cost better than my</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this</li>
            <li> This is my favorite</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I did, and I agree that it works better than pricier competitors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product, that&#x27;s all I have to say</li>
            <li> This product made my hair even more oily.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> But it just makes it look more oily and adds to the scalp build up.</li>
            <li> The one thing that does make me nervous is the overwhelming smell and product that you can&#x27;t quite get away from.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many and this is the one I prefer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok, but did not perform a miracle on my hair that needed to be washed.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is awesome.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo and or volumizer I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is the best!</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo out there.</li>
            <li> Smells good but the fragrance does not last, which, to me, is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> I love all of the sulfate free products from L&#x27;Oreal but this is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect dry shampoo and thought I&#x27;d found &amp;#34;The One&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo ever!</li>
            <li> It feels refreshing to get that strong, cool blast on the scalp!</li>
            <li> Nice and light clean smell.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and appealing.  </li>
            <li> It refreshes your hair, gives it body, and has a light lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have very fine blonde/dirty blonde hair and found that this works great with my hair.</li>
            <li> Great price and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t seem to make the greasy look go away as easily.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell strong and like perfume.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell, made my head itch and came out strong.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, but not horrible.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic and works better than most dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried (and smells great to boot)</li>
            <li> Not bad, but still on the hunt for something better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine and does what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> Love this for quick &amp;#34;re-set&amp;#34; between washings.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the strong smell, but otherwise a great dry shampoo that is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> It goes on light and it really does dissolve oils from the hair, it freshens, enhances body and it leaves a clean sensational feeling on the scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would also possibly be good for somebody who is bedridden as they can have clean hair without showering or bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t expect this to replace your normal shampooing cycle.</li>
            <li> It gives me great volume and doesn&#x27;t make my roots white.</li>
            <li> It is cheap, sprays well with no visible product, but has a stronger scent that I notice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is quite light, so</li>
            <li> This would probably be great if you wanted a low hold hairspray and wanted to a product to use rat or back-comb your hair ala 60s 70s.</li>
            <li> I have to be very thorough applying this product, which is kind of a pain</li>
            <li> I went a whole second day and my hair still looks great!</li>
            <li> This hair care product really works well !!!</li>
            <li> Smells fabulous and clean.</li>
            <li> She has super fine hair and it can help keep her hair tighter in a pony or with a bow.</li>
            <li> At first i thought it was okay</li>
            <li> I just do it because I HAVE to run because I love ice cream) and that makes my hair need washing more frequently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dry shampoos before that worked great, this one didn&#x27;t do it for me</li>
            <li> For the cost, this dry shampoo touch-up is great.  </li>
            <li> Immediately when you spray your hair and scalp feel clean.</li>
            <li> This a great inexpensive dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Pssssst, Batiste Cherry (ick) and Tropical scents, and Not Your Mothers Clean Freak.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo keeps my hair looking great.</li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t make my hair look clean.</li>
            <li> Great for my in between hair washing, my Locs respond well to the dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Best value dry shampoo.best bang for buck dry shampoo best bang for buck dry shampoo.great value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say this L&#x27;oreal dry shampoo delivers!</li>
            <li> It really makes my hair look clean at the top of my head.</li>
            <li> , it made my hair smell good, but you can still see some greasiness if it&#x27;s the 2nd day since you washed your hair...</li>
            <li> Only plus is that it makes your hair smell good.</li>
            <li> It was better than Dove&#x27;s but not by much.  </li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> It does allow you to skip a day (sometimes two) which is more healthy for your hair, but I&#x27;ve found it helped me significantly to use it daily when I wanted to &amp;#34;style&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It leaves no residue, it&#x27;s mess free, it smells great</li>
            <li> Pretty strong.</li>
            <li> Instead it is like a very light hairspray, clear and light and sticky.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was as described, but irritated my scalp.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any white powder on my hair, smells great and really removes oil buildup in my hair if I don&#x27;t get to wash it for days.</li>
            <li> This is quick.</li>
            <li> In the morning my hair is as light as the first day.</li>
            <li> It makes my scalp feel clean, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and had a light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Smells good, it works reall well for dry shampoo..</li>
            <li> This product did not dry out my roots as I would have liked</li>
            <li> Big Sexy Hair dry shampoo has been the best, so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried like 5 different dry shampoos and this is the best!</li>
            <li> Works the best out of several dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo unlike the fresh brand that leaves white residue.</li>
            <li> Great for dark hair!</li>
            <li> Smells good but leaves a white powder on your hair that is very noticeable.</li>
            <li> but if you have to use an 8th of the bottle to make your hair presentable is it really worth it?</li>
            <li> There are far better products on the market.</li>
            <li> Smells good and adds volume but absolutely leaves white residue.  </li>
            <li> right up there with the Batiste brand of dry-shampoos, which has been my favorite brand so far.</li>
            <li> It is also very refreshing, as odd as that may sound.</li>
            <li> gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed, mainly because I had such low expectations.</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> This is Mrs, by the way: this stuff makes my hair greasier than it was to begin with and doesn&#x27;t seem to clean much at all.</li>
            <li> This is OK but it sometimes leaves a white residue in my light brown hair and it doesn&#x27;t really get rid of the oil.</li>
            <li> It smells good which is rare for the older brands of dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and full of body!</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of dry shampoo</li>
            <li> $17/bottle dry shampoo, it just was not as effective.  </li>
            <li> if you just do a quick spray it doesn&#x27;t always appear to have worked very well.</li>
            <li> I read I could make my own dry shampoo with 1/2 baking soda and 1/2 corn starch???</li>
            <li> Also shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> The smell is ok but it doesn&#x27;t clean your hair as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible, but I&#x27;ll be trying a different product when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> This product leaves a white residue in my hair most of the time.</li>
            <li> so I purchased this item as it was cheaper and had higher customer ratings.</li>
            <li> I feel I need to use a lot more for the same effect.</li>
            <li> and it looks even better the second day.</li>
            <li> Even regular baby powder works better.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really beat the price either!</li>
            <li> Great for long hair and ladies and some men who don&#x27;t want to wash their hair daily.</li>
            <li> This smells funny.</li>
            <li> I will order more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> in a pinch, when you hair is all oily and matty, and you just NEED to het it looking clean, this will do the trick better than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs quick cleaning between hair washing.  </li>
            <li> excellent.product, it smells nice and and don&#x27;t live white residue in your hair.</li>
            <li> I have used Garnier dry shampoo and it smells really nice and works very well.</li>
            <li> Especially for the price, I would recommed this product to anyone who is looking for a great dry shampoo to use any morning</li>
            <li> I have to work the white powder through with my fingers, but overall pretty good.</li>
            <li> so that is one positive attribute.  </li>
            <li> It leaves no white powder residue and It actually has a nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li> There are better dry shampoos out there.</li>
            <li> One of the better dry shampoos out there.</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brands of dry hairspray and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I really really love this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I am now using the dry shampoo by &amp;#34;not your mother&#x27;s&amp;#34; I think it is called something like &amp;#34;clean freek&amp;#34; and it works much better</li>
            <li> Is talc free and doesn&#x27;t poof hair up as much as  other powdery dry shampoos, but is very refreshing and does the job.</li>
            <li> It works the same, the smell is not quite as strong, and it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and when my hair gets oily it is definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money product isnt that great used it once and never again...</li>
            <li> My hair responded really well to it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really smell and you don&#x27;t have to shake it a ton to spray it.</li>
            <li> This works really well in my hair.</li>
            <li> But, it just doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; very well.  </li>
            <li> Also it didn&#x27;t remove as much of the oily look as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> And it really works to make my hair look not greasy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave as much residue as others</li>
            <li> really like this product ....</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for a modern texturizing product you might want to keep looking.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li> This product really does work to revive hair and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and is frangrance-free.</li>
            <li> , that doesn&#x27;t help me much...</li>
            <li> Works okay, but not much in a can.</li>
            <li> It sucks up the oil in your hair quite nicely and leaves it looking fresh.</li>
            <li> Gives limp and lifeless hair more body and keeps your hair fresh looking for up to 3 days.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave you with weird feeling hair like most others.</li>
            <li> I have used baby powder and several dry shampoos (most of which were way more expensive than this one), but then I read a review in InStyle magazine rating this the best dry shampoo, so I had to give this a shot.</li>
            <li> , so my search hasn&#x27;t ended yet, but in the mean time, this is a good one.</li>
            <li> This is a fast fix for those of us who simply need a fast way to clean in between the longer method of washing, drying and styling.</li>
            <li> But as the other reviewers said, it does leave powdery layer on top.</li>
            <li> It works, but there are other products that seem to work much better.</li>
            <li> Like most of the other stuff out there.</li>
            <li> so I would just use this product, a brush, and a little hair spray and honestly my hair looked better than when I used to pull out the ole Chi and curling iron mess.  </li>
            <li> works good without leaving too much white residue on dark hair</li>
            <li> Ive tried a good 10 different dry hairsprays and this one so far takes the cake.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay - not great, not bad!</li>
            <li> Some dry shampoos allow me to got a full 24-36 hours without washing but this one really doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cut the grease&amp;#34; much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible I have unrealistic expectations, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for crazy busy mornings when you just didn&#x27;t have time to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> great for after a work out, keep a blowout another day, extra body, or when you are having a late morning and just roll out of bed.</li>
            <li> Also I am super blonde</li>
            <li> You only need a few sprays and to brush it through your hair and you are good to go.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It has a really great scent, and doesn&#x27;t leave any weird texture (stickiness, stiffness, dryness, etc.)</li>
            <li> Took my hair from greasy and gross to soft and full.</li>
            <li> With this dry shampoo I can go at least 3 days without washing my hair and it looks great.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t get oily easily, it&#x27;s more on the dry side, but I was looking for a product that would help give me some shape and body and take away the 2nd day hair &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thank you for making this such an easy buying process, especially during the hectic holiday season.</li>
            <li> This is the only dry shampoo that I use I love it.</li>
            <li> it slicks back right against my scalp).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried three other well known brands and they didn&#x27;t work nearly as well and had a strong fragrance that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> The only really good stuff is made by Toni and Guy, but it&#x27;s super expensive.</li>
            <li> I had used Kerastase dry shampoo in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li> I use several different dry shampoos, and this is my favorite brand.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was hoping for, but one of the better dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> Worked really well- not at all white.</li>
            <li> On them, it helped quite a bit with the greasiness but didn&#x27;t take it completely away -</li>
            <li> On me it did take the greasy feeling completely away.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say how far this product goes.</li>
            <li> I made time to write this review because I wanted to tell others who have had to deal with sensitive scalp issues that this might work for them as well.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft like you just washed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last the whole day though.  </li>
            <li> It works really well and does not leave white residue in my hair.</li>
            <li> I shake the can really well and use short bursts.  </li>
            <li> When I first used this product I really liked how my hair felt clean, unlike some other products that can make my hair feel dirty.</li>
            <li> Looks as good if not better than when washing the previous day.</li>
            <li> This was my first dry shampoo experience.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the first dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> And, the bottle feels half full-</li>
            <li> This arrived to me on time, but it wasn&#x27;t even half full.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have issues with it leaving a super white film/powder in my hair like some dry shampoos...</li>
            <li> I have tried countless other dry shampoos, this one is so far my favorite.</li>
            <li> However, I can usually get it to go away with some fluffing and styling, so all in all not bad for my first dry shampoo experience.</li>
            <li> Other brands of dry shampoo or products that call themselves &amp;#34;texture spray&amp;#34; will either clog up immediately, make your hair feel gummy, need to be used on wet hair only, or are only good for the &amp;#34;beach style&amp;#34; waves/messy look.  </li>
            <li> I also found a hair gel with no silicone and very water soluble (so I don&#x27;t need the detergents in shampoo which needlessly dry out my hair</li>
            <li> I really like this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Make sure you hold it at least 8 inches away to avoid any white residue.  </li>
            <li> If my hair is wet, or greasy then it turns dark brown, this stuff however seems to really absorb any oils in my hair and makes it look nearly fresh again.</li>
            <li> very dark blonde &amp; my teens have light blonde hair).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, and a few spritzes goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have fine, somewhat dry hair and don&#x27;t want to wash it everyday.</li>
            <li> When I finally decided to give this one a shot however, I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> and I never felt it was brushed out completely.</li>
            <li> Actually, it did one time when I first got it and really over sprayed my hair, but I think that was user error rather than product error, as I have never had that problem again and have been using for a few months (still on the same can).</li>
            <li> Smells nice, isn&#x27;t excessively sticky or tacky and I don&#x27;t get a lot of white dust on my dark hair from the product.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dry hair that my stylist says I shouldn&#x27;t wash more than every 3 days.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look fresh without making it feel stiff.</li>
            <li> The spray is extremely fine and as long as you shake it well and hold it a few inches from your hairline, there will be no white residue.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of this, I&#x27;m a dry shampoo connoisseur because I have fine, blonde, oily</li>
            <li> I am new to dry shampoo, but I find it does the job.  </li>
            <li> I have bought much more expensive brands, but this is the winner so far.</li>
            <li> The product distributes pretty evenly so you don&#x27;t get that gunky white build up when you use it, even on dark hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine color-treated blonde hair that was left flat and lifeless when using other dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> Unlike other products, this one does not leave hair too dry or too oily, but just right.  </li>
            <li> I have thick but fine hair and this left a residue on my hair that a regular shampoo could not remove.</li>
            <li> Only supermarket brand dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry out my straight hair.</li>
            <li> However, be careful not to spray too much as it does still give you that grey</li>
            <li> My scalp&#x27;s oily, so the only time that worked out well is the first few weeks after I color my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair felt a little rough, like I had sprayed it with mild hairspray.</li>
            <li> only thing is that I can&#x27;t wear my hair down with this stuff, it really needs to be up in a pony tail.</li>
            <li> I have tried several dry shampoos and they either have a distinct odd smell or leave white powder in your hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dark hair and many brands, even salon brands, just leave my hair white.</li>
            <li> I would not buy again unless I really could not just plain ole wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started experimenting with not washing my hair daily and tried out different dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> After looking at numerous different dry shampoos, I finally decided on this one.</li>
            <li> Second choice would be the Suave&#x27;s Dry Shampoo (currently on the shelves at WalMart).  </li>
            <li> Suave also makes a decent dry shampoo for half the cost.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your hair soft and shiny, without leaving a powdery residue that other dry shampoos leave.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend for those who have lighter coloured hair (to avoid the powder look), and who don&#x27;t go too long without shampooing!</li>
            <li> The only other brand I have found that worked similarly (but actually did not have the chemical smell when sprayed) was the CVS generic dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorites at this price point, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoos (I only wash my hair once a week)</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> The dry shampoo before only lasted a day and could get clumpyish...</li>
            <li> I received a sample of dry shampoo form a recent Pantene purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the second brand of dry shampoo I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I have tried countless dry shampoos over the years and this one is definately one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different dry shampoos on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair but only use the dry shampoo every 2 to three days on my roots and bangs.  </li>
            <li> , I tried using a little, I tried using a lot, I tried holding it close up, I tried spraying from far away, but it never worked.</li>
            <li> It was just ok at cutting grease though.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about it showing up in my hair or smelling weird but neither of these were an issue ( I have light brown hair/</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this often, mostly when school gets crazy.  </li>
            <li> It was strangely energizing, if you can believe that.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t smell it all day long.  </li>
            <li> The can lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have used at least 8-10 different brands of dry shampoos over the last 4 years, so I have gotten to know the good and the bad.  </li>
            <li> but I sprayed it a little too close to my hair and it left a white powdery substance on my hair.</li>
            <li> my hair only every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad, since this one was a more expensive (and presumably higher quality) than others I&#x27;ve tried: Pantene, Herbal Essences, Salon Essentials, etc.</li>
            <li> I have low lights in my usually brown hair and with this dry shampoo it actually looks like I have white hair!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue like other dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> but this is even better because it isn&#x27;t too bad with turning your hair white</li>
            <li> I like to use dry shampoos and this one was around the price I wanted to pay.</li>
            <li> So you know what happened with dry shampoos</li>
            <li> heard about this L&#x27;oreal Paris EverStyle dry shampoo and after reading the ingredients, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works but just use it for touch ups between shampooing.  </li>
            <li> As with all dry shampoos, you might get a day in between shampooing using it.  </li>
            <li> I had sworn off dry shampoo after trying Oscar Blandi Pronto Dry Shampoo.</li>
            <li> It was not at all like the Pantene dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> There are times when you just need DRY shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I like this dry shampoo a lot.</li>
            <li> Oh, and you don&#x27;t need to blow dry it or do anything to it.</li>
            <li> Some of these dry shampoos use a lot of talc (which this one does not) and that looks like dandruff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> heard about this dry shampoo from a coworker.</li>
            <li> I have not found it to leave a residue or dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I use after exercising and then blow dry.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t work like a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make dry shampoo like they used to.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different dry shampoos, and this one definitely has a nicer smell than others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been curious about dry shampoo for a long time.</li>
            <li> Also, no white residue on my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> People who say otherwise probably do not have dark brown hair but be prepared for the white to show up.</li>
            <li> It weighed my hair down and gave it a white appearance.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other dry shampoo&#x27;s and this one is the only one that does not leave a white residue.</li>
            <li> I do NOT recommend this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have wavy, medium thickness hair, not particularly greasy, but I wanted to freshen.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> Does not leave white flacky mess.</li>
            <li> This is a white chalky mess.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I get a little white in my hair from holding it too close, but,</li>
            <li> I seem to need twice as much as other dry shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Left my hair dull, with a white haze.  </li>
            <li> but it claims to not have as many chemicals and bad things for your hair</li>
            <li> Then I&#x27;d have to wash my hair every day for the next few weeks until I colored it</li>
            <li> Alas, this still left a powdery, white residue in my hair, even after brushing it out (ESPECIALLY after trying to brush it out!)</li>
            <li> It does not really have any type of smell to it either</li>
            <li> This one I really do not like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of washing my hair daily.</li>
            <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t look as white or so stiff as the other brands.</li>
            <li> But Dry Shampoos are all a bit odd.</li>
            <li> I had to use water to get it out but other than that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just purchase the other brand.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day</li>
            <li> It didnt work as well as some of the other options out there</li>
            <li> I use this in between washes washing my hair every other day).</li>
            <li> I tend to was my hair every other day and by the send day it gets a bit oily</li>
            <li> but I honeslty don&#x27;t see any difference compared to other products that aren&#x27;t supposed to be healthier for your hair.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t flake all over your clothes like other brands.</li>
            <li> Am slightly disappointed that it feels like the can is only half full -</li>
            <li> Does nothing to oily hair except making them look dull by taking their shine away &amp; building up white dandruff.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever see white residue, and if I do, it disappears as soon as I rub it a bit.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair</li>
            <li> I have really dark hair, and this doesn&#x27;t show on my hair at all.</li>
            <li> The cap doesn&#x27;t like to stay on so your package can arrive with a not full can of this stuff due to the cap falling off and the nozzle getting bumped.</li>
            <li> In fact, it weighs my hair down and makes it greasy.</li>
            <li> The product is great if you have grey hair, unfortunately I have very dark brown and the white residue is the worst I&#x27;ve seen with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure there are any dry shampoos that would work that well tho...</li>
            <li> This is the only dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave an awful residue in my dark hair or gross feeling to my hair, I use every other day on my non-wash hair days and it really does the trick.</li>
            <li> I have black hair and didn&#x27;t notice any residue.</li>
            <li> 34;add-on&amp;#34; item for less than $6</li>
            <li> This lasted me less than two weeks</li>
            <li> but it does help slightly.  </li>
            <li> However, talking with my hair lady, she says washing daily is not a good thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually happy with L&#x27;Oreal products, but this one was a bit disappointing. :(</li>
            <li> I spray a little e trap around my hairline to cover my regrowth.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like breathing that in, and as I have two little boys glued to my hip</li>
            <li> There was a little improvement.  </li>
            <li> I would always become very nervous having them around afraid what chemicals they are breathing in.  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t have any trouble washing it out without a detergent--</li>
            <li> I used to wash my hair everyday and now can skip a day</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It actually made my hair look worse.</li>
            <li> (it made my hair look heavy and stringy), but it did get rid of the majority of the oil in my scalp.</li>
            <li> It seems this was used before it got shipped to me because I used the spray once for my thin short hair, and it was gone.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste time on this one.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday no matter</li>
            <li> I still recommend this brand; however, because I have wasted lots of money on products that clog.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to use a clarifying shampoo and even that took a few washes.</li>
            <li> So they smell pretty bad.</li>
            <li> and I found that they all left my hair feeling dirty and heavy feeling with a rough texture.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get any weird powder, or anything flaky afterwards, and I find it actually even improves my ability to style my hair into pony tails that get a little volume</li>
            <li> it does the job while using very little of the product....</li>
            <li> I also did not think it added any volume like ones I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I like it yet</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Usually my hair is greasy after one day meaning I can&#x27;t make it another day without washing again.</li>
            <li> This product fails at the second test.  </li>
            <li> I usually purchase any of the GOT2B varieties.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how this product made it out of the lab.</li>
            <li> Not okay.</li>
            <li> Very few uses..</li>
            <li> not great for dark hair, but works in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Hard to brush through/out.  </li>
            <li> but too hard to use on roots.  </li>
            <li> I will always have at least 2 on hand, one in my travel bag &amp; one on my vanity.</li>
            <li> This felt thick and made my hair look greasy</li>
            <li> Not amazing, but gets some oil out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no better (or worse) than some of the cheaper brands I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> I usually like L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s products so after being disappointed with Dove&#x27;s dry shampoo, decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t look so bald (my hair is seriously thin, so</li>
            <li> Like a lot worse.</li>
            <li> Useless product</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s insanely expensive.</li>
            <li> Not impressed by the product.</li>
            <li> Not impressed L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> Sadly, for some reason, it doesn&#x27;t absorb oil as well for me around the sides of my head.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about how these smelled</li>
            <li> I thought I had bad dandruff for years, nothing worked.</li>
            <li> She has a bad bath and getting her into the tub can be painful.  </li>
            <li> My hair was still greasy looking after spraying a ton.  :(</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel weird or nasty.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Leaves white residue in hair</li>
            <li> This is OK but it sometimes leaves a white residue in my light brown hair and it doesn&#x27;t really get rid of the oil.</li>
            <li> Smells good but leaves a white powder on your hair that is very noticeable.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money product isnt that great used it once and never again...</li>
            <li> Worked really well- not at all white. It was strangely energizing, if you can believe that. My hair responded really well to it. I have bought much more expensive brands, but this is the winner so far. I plan to continue buying it.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was hoping for, but one of the better dry shampoos. It doesn&#x27;t really smell and you don&#x27;t have to shake it a ton to spray it. I have black hair and didn&#x27;t notice any residue. Not bad, but still on the hunt for something better.</li>
            <li> Does nothing to oily hair except making them look dull by taking their shine away &amp; building up white dandruff. Useless product</li>
            <li> I do NOT recommend this dry shampoo! I have low lights in my usually brown hair and with this dry shampoo it actually looks like I have white hair! I also did not think it added any volume like ones I have used in the past. I will never order this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I like the suave one better</li>
            <li> Not sure if I like it yet</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the strong smell, but otherwise a great dry shampoo that is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Best one I&#x27;ve tried. No white residue and the smell is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo. Does not leave white flacky mess.</li>
            <li> I had used Kerastase dry shampoo in the past and loved it. However, it&#x27;s insanely expensive. I decided to try this product knowing that Kerastase is made my L&#x27;Oreal. I&#x27;m so pleased I did. It works the same, the smell is not quite as strong, and it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper. This works great. I have thick, dry hair that my stylist says I shouldn&#x27;t wash more than every 3 days. However, I like to run on my treadmill (lies, I don&#x27;t LIKE to run. I just do it because I HAVE to run because I love ice cream) and that makes my hair need washing more frequently. I find I can use this after running and not feel completely gross until my 3rd day.</li>
            <li> Works well but leaves white residue. I will look for something better.</li>
            <li> Good but not the best. Still doesn&#x27;t absorb all the oil I wish it did.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have tried a few other dry shampoo&#x27;s and this one is the only one that does not leave a white residue. It is also very refreshing, as odd as that may sound. I would def recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, smells nice, and doesn&#x27;t leave acresidue.  It was just ok at cutting grease though.  There are better dry shampoos out there.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot</li>
            <li> I like to use dry shampoos and this one was around the price I wanted to pay. I like the fragrance of this product but I sprayed it a little too close to my hair and it left a white powdery substance on my hair. I had to use water to get it out but other than that, it&#x27;s nice and smells nice.</li>
            <li> The spray is extremely fine and as long as you shake it well and hold it a few inches from your hairline, there will be no white residue. If you use too much, just brush through a few times and it disapears. It&#x27;s great to refresh your hair and build body in fine hair</li>
            <li> This made my scalp itch, I didn&#x27;t care for it. It arrived quickly and was as described, but irritated my scalp.</li>
            <li> This works really well in my hair.</li>
            <li> This was my first dry shampoo experience. I was worried about it showing up in my hair or smelling weird but neither of these were an issue ( I have light brown hair/very dark blonde &amp; my teens have light blonde hair). I mostly got this for my teens who don&#x27;t have time to wash their hair every day but have issues with greasy, stringy looking hair. On them, it helped quite a bit with the greasiness but didn&#x27;t take it completely away - On me it did take the greasy feeling completely away. It feels refreshing to get that strong, cool blast on the scalp! Am slightly disappointed that it feels like the can is only half full - but I have only used it a handful of times now so I can&#x27;t say how far this product goes. Would recommend regardless!</li>
            <li> One of my favorites at this price point, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoos (I only wash my hair once a week) and this one provides good value for the price. It gives me great volume and doesn&#x27;t make my roots white.</li>
            <li> The smell is ok but it doesn&#x27;t clean your hair as expected.</li>
            <li> a good quality product and I am happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use on my dog.  She has a bad bath and getting her into the tub can be painful.  I use it between baths.  I then rack her coat.  It leaves her smelling good and she shows no allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> My history is that everything upsets my scalp. I thought I had bad dandruff for years, nothing worked. Stopped using hair spray, tada! Even tried using the hypoallergenic hair spray, itchy. Hair gels, mega itchy. Some brands of shampoo and conditioner made me itchy! So you know what happened with dry shampoos, right? Oh man, ITCHY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since learned some things. I don&#x27;t shampoo, I use a conditioner without silicone to shampoo and condition my hair. Ahhhh! I also found a hair gel with no silicone and very water soluble (so I don&#x27;t need the detergents in shampoo which needlessly dry out my hair anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT I prefer to &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; my hair only every other day. My scalp&#x27;s oily, so the only time that worked out well is the first few weeks after I color my hair. Then I&#x27;d have to wash my hair every day for the next few weeks until I colored it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard about this L&#x27;oreal Paris EverStyle dry shampoo and after reading the ingredients, I decided to try it. I truly figured I&#x27;d have to give it away after a use or two, but I am a hopeful person, so...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to make sure, before I wrote this review, I used it 4 times. If it was going to be a problem, it would be one by now. It&#x27;s WONDERFUL! Not only does it work on my oily hair/scalp, but it doesn&#x27;t make me itch! I see no flakes at all! And I don&#x27;t have any trouble washing it out without a detergent-- it seems as water soluble as my hair gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed, mainly because I had such low expectations. I made time to write this review because I wanted to tell others who have had to deal with sensitive scalp issues that this might work for them as well.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this product and I think I&#x27;m done. It takes a lot of spray to effectively degrease my hair (after 2 days of not showering). It smells really nice and doesn&#x27;t leave a ton of residue after brushing but if you have to use an 8th of the bottle to make your hair presentable is it really worth it? No. No, it is not.</li>
            <li> I have very fine blonde/dirty blonde hair and found that this works great with my hair. If my hair is wet, or greasy then it turns dark brown, this stuff however seems to really absorb any oils in my hair and makes it look nearly fresh again. I don&#x27;t get any weird powder, or anything flaky afterwards, and I find it actually even improves my ability to style my hair into pony tails that get a little volume so I don&#x27;t look so bald (my hair is seriously thin, so it slicks back right against my scalp).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that I can&#x27;t wear my hair down with this stuff, it really needs to be up in a pony tail. I&#x27;m not sure there are any dry shampoos that would work that well tho... (if you know, please comment and tell me!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO!!! It smells great, I love the way I smell afterwards. I almost forgot about that!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s o.k.  I don&#x27;t have issues with it leaving a super white film/powder in my hair like some dry shampoos...although, I am blonde.  The fragrance is nice.  But, it just doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; very well.  My hair looks greasy on the top after about 6 hours of washing.  Some dry shampoos allow me to got a full 24-36 hours without washing but this one really doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cut the grease&amp;#34; much.  I&#x27;d probably purchase it again if I got another GREAT deal on Subscribe and Save but otherwise, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.  On to the next...</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried dry shampoo. It&#x27;s possible I have unrealistic expectations, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product. My hair felt a little rough, like I had sprayed it with mild hairspray. Also it didn&#x27;t remove as much of the oily look as I had hoped. It&#x27;s not terrible, but I&#x27;ll be trying a different product when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> Love this for quick &amp;#34;re-set&amp;#34; between washings. Smells nice, isn&#x27;t excessively sticky or tacky and I don&#x27;t get a lot of white dust on my dark hair from the product. Recommend!</li>
            <li> One of the better dry shampoos out there.</li>
            <li> Great item. On time delivery</li>
            <li> Made my hair greasy. But works great in my mothers hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t love it. I&#x27;ve tried dry shampoos before that worked great, this one didn&#x27;t do it for me</li>
            <li> This is Mrs, by the way: this stuff makes my hair greasier than it was to begin with and doesn&#x27;t seem to clean much at all. It DOES smell good, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used so far. I hardly ever see white residue, and if I do, it disappears as soon as I rub it a bit. It has a really great scent, and doesn&#x27;t leave any weird texture (stickiness, stiffness, dryness, etc.) in my hair. I like to apply it before bed, and again in the morning if there&#x27;s any spots that need a touch up.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work well. My hair was still greasy looking after spraying a ton.  :(</li>
            <li> Took my hair from greasy and gross to soft and full. I&#x27;m loving this.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t leave residue. Smells fabulous and clean. Makes hair soft like you just washed.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff...right up there with the Batiste brand of dry-shampoos, which has been my favorite brand so far. I got this as an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; item for less than $6 so that made it even better. It sucks up the oil in your hair quite nicely and leaves it looking fresh. I will purchase this item again :)</li>
            <li> The product is great if you have grey hair, unfortunately I have very dark brown and the white residue is the worst I&#x27;ve seen with this one.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and appealing.  You don&#x27;t smell it all day long.  This dry shampoo works but just use it for touch ups between shampooing.  As with all dry shampoos, you might get a day in between shampooing using it.  Might is the word here.  Better to just use it if you&#x27;ve got a date at night after work and want to touch up your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t leave any white powder on my hair, smells great and really removes oil buildup in my hair if I don&#x27;t get to wash it for days.</li>
            <li> I had sworn off dry shampoo after trying Oscar Blandi Pronto Dry Shampoo. When I finally decided to give this one a shot however, I was very pleasantly surprised. It leaves no residue, it&#x27;s mess free, it smells great and it keeps my hair from getting greasy.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! Perfect for crazy busy mornings when you just didn&#x27;t have time to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> Is talc free and doesn&#x27;t poof hair up as much as  other powdery dry shampoos, but is very refreshing and does the job.</li>
            <li> Best value dry shampoo.best bang for buck dry shampoo best bang for buck dry shampoo.great value. Highly recommended. I would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Smells really nice and works great!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs quick cleaning between hair washing.  It leaves your hair soft and shiny, without leaving a powdery residue that other dry shampoos leave.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. It leaves no white powder residue and It actually has a nice fresh scent. I have tried several dry shampoos and they either have a distinct odd smell or leave white powder in your hair. This is an aerosol spray. All you can to do is spray, brush and go! It also gave my hair some volume and shape when it needed it.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well.  I am new to dry shampoo, but I find it does the job.  Sometimes I get a little white in my hair from holding it too close, but, that&#x27;s user error.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine and does what you&#x27;d expect. It&#x27;s no better (or worse) than some of the cheaper brands I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless other dry shampoos, this one is so far my favorite. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s perfect, so my search hasn&#x27;t ended yet, but in the mean time, this is a good one. The product distributes pretty evenly so you don&#x27;t get that gunky white build up when you use it, even on dark hair. And it really works to make my hair look not greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve tried like 5 different dry shampoos and this is the best! It smells good which is rare for the older brands of dry shampoo. I like Psst before but this is even better because it isn&#x27;t too bad with turning your hair white and it doesn&#x27;t build up in your hair if you have to go an extra day. The dry shampoo before only lasted a day and could get clumpyish... :/ great for after a work out, keep a blowout another day, extra body, or when you are having a late morning and just roll out of bed. 😉</li>
            <li> Works great. Smells great</li>
            <li> This product leaves a white residue in my hair most of the time. However, I can usually get it to go away with some fluffing and styling, so all in all not bad for my first dry shampoo experience.</li>
            <li> works good without leaving too much white residue on dark hair</li>
            <li> a gift for myself I love</li>
            <li> no build up, and smells good</li>
            <li> It weighed my hair down and gave it a white appearance. I recommend Batiste!</li>
            <li> For the cost, this dry shampoo touch-up is great.  It doesn&#x27;t last the whole day though.  Smells good but the fragrance does not last, which, to me, is a good thing.  I just reapply if I plan to go out in the evening.</li>
            <li> This product does not work. I received a sample of dry shampoo form a recent Pantene purchase. I liked the idea of dry shampoo so I purchased this item as it was cheaper and had higher customer ratings. It was not at all like the Pantene dry shampoo. I&#x27;ve used this four times now and each time it did not make a difference in appearance, texture, or grease. I followed the instructions, I tried using a little, I tried using a lot, I tried holding it close up, I tried spraying from far away, but it never worked. I will say the scent is nice so that is one positive attribute.  I would not recommend this product and next time I&#x27;ll just purchase the other brand.</li>
            <li> This hair care product really works well !!!</li>
            <li> Smells good, it works reall well for dry shampoo..I love it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave as much residue as others but it didn&#x27;t seem to make the greasy look go away as easily. I feel I need to use a lot more for the same effect.</li>
            <li> Great dry shampoo and wonderful price.</li>
            <li> This is a white chalky mess. My hair felt so gross after using this product. I couldn&#x27;t brush all the white powder out of my brown hair.  There are far better products on the market.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long.  Very few uses..</li>
            <li> really like this product .... it does the job while using very little of the product.... has a nice smell also....</li>
            <li> It works really well and does not leave white residue in my hair.</li>
            <li> Gives me a extra day between shampoos.  Make sure you hold it at least 8 inches away to avoid any white residue.  Otherwise it gives great volume and takes away the greasy hair feeling.</li>
            <li> This is the first dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve bought. I love it. Nice and light clean smell. Immediately when you spray your hair and scalp feel clean. Also, no white residue on my dark brown hair. I will be buying more of this once I go through it.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found. I have thick, dark hair and many brands, even salon brands, just leave my hair white. This product works into my hair easily and has a pleasant, but not overpowering, scent.</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose and smells nice</li>
            <li> I really like this dry shampoo. I wash my hair every other day and I use this on the off day. I makes my hair smell and look good. The can lasts a long time. It works best when sprayed on the roots at about 8&amp;#34; away from your head.</li>
            <li> not great for dark hair, but works in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Smells really good, works great.</li>
            <li> Gives limp and lifeless hair more body and keeps your hair fresh looking for up to 3 days. I used to wash my hair everyday and now can skip a day and it looks even better the second day.</li>
            <li> There are times when you just need DRY shampoo.  It refreshes your hair, gives it body, and has a light lovely fragrance. I have tried several kinds and this one is the winner. I will always have at least 2 on hand, one in my travel bag &amp; one on my vanity. Great product!</li>
            <li> Eh.  It sprays white on my brown/blonde hair.  Hard to brush through/out.  Smells good- but too hard to use on roots.  And, the bottle feels half full- which I guess is a good thing!  It can not be returned- is flammable.  Keep shopping.</li>
            <li> This a great inexpensive dry shampoo.  I tried a few others and really like this one. I find it does best if I spray it the night before and sleep in it. In the morning my hair is as light as the first day. Also I am super blonde so if I am between touch ups I spray a little e trap around my hairline to cover my regrowth.  I have even sprayed it in my toddlers hair. She has super fine hair and it can help keep her hair tighter in a pony or with a bow.</li>
            <li> I have tried more expensive brands (Oscar Blandi, DryBar) and I prefer this formula from L&#x27;Oreal .  It doesn&#x27;t turn powdery, like others I have tried, leaving a white residue.  I shake the can really well and use short bursts.  I have dark brown hair and I don&#x27;t notice any obvious signs of a powdery finish.  I shake my hair with my finger afterwards to ensure the product is worked through and I haven&#x27;t missed a spot.  Smells great too!</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is awesome. I have fine hair and when my hair gets oily it is definitely noticeable. I am trying to grow out my hair and am trying to not wash it as often. With this dry shampoo I can go at least 3 days without washing my hair and it looks great. It smells nice too which is a bonus! I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Though I like the cost better than my $17/bottle dry shampoo, it just was not as effective.  This product did not dry out my roots as I would have liked</li>
            <li> Not impressed by the product.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo and or volumizer I&#x27;ve found. And it leaves no white powdery spots in your hair like some others do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started experimenting with not washing my hair daily and tried out different dry shampoos. I&#x27;ve tried Pssssst, Batiste Cherry (ick) and Tropical scents, and Not Your Mothers Clean Freak. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about how these smelled and I found that they all left my hair feeling dirty and heavy feeling with a rough texture. And they made my scalp itch! My hair doesn&#x27;t get oily easily, it&#x27;s more on the dry side, but I was looking for a product that would help give me some shape and body and take away the 2nd day hair &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this hoping it work for my needs. I&#x27;m happy to say this L&#x27;oreal dry shampoo delivers! It makes my scalp feel clean, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and had a light, pleasant scent. I love it. My hair looks great on day two AND day three with this stuff. It leaves my hair soft and full of body! I never thought I would go without washing my hair for two days and still show my face in public. This dry shampoo keeps my hair looking great. I&#x27;m so glad I found this, I will continue to buy this product. L&#x27;oreal, please do not stop making this!!!</li>
            <li> Only supermarket brand dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry out my straight hair.</li>
            <li> Really nice and useful good product</li>
            <li> This is the second brand of dry shampoo I have tried.  I purchased this because the local stores were all out of my brand.  I have long hair but only use the dry shampoo every 2 to three days on my roots and bangs.  This lasted me less than two weeks and I never felt it was brushed out completely.</li>
            <li> After looking at numerous different dry shampoos, I finally decided on this one. I love it! I&#x27;m a brunette and it doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue on my hair. It smells great, too. Usually my hair is greasy after one day meaning I can&#x27;t make it another day without washing again. This totally helped me with that issue. I went a whole second day and my hair still looks great!</li>
            <li> I have used at least 8-10 different brands of dry shampoos over the last 4 years, so I have gotten to know the good and the bad.  Ther are two things that I demand from them. 1. The can must spray all of the product out.  Some lose pressure after 4 or 5 uses and you can still feel product in the can.  2.  The product must brush out without leaving a dull/chalky look and feel.  This product fails at the second test.  Left my hair dull, with a white haze.  I usually purchase any of the GOT2B varieties.  They are the best and they don&#x27;t break the wallet!  Second choice would be the Suave&#x27;s Dry Shampoo (currently on the shelves at WalMart).  It is cheap, sprays well with no visible product, but has a stronger scent that I notice.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different dry shampoos, and this one definitely has a nicer smell than others.&lt;br /&gt;It is quite light, so if you just do a quick spray it doesn&#x27;t always appear to have worked very well. However, be careful not to spray too much as it does still give you that grey powdery look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good product and I will continue to use it. Would definitely recommend for those who have lighter coloured hair (to avoid the powder look), and who don&#x27;t go too long without shampooing!</li>
            <li> I like this dry shampoo a lot. It didn&#x27;t build up in my hair at all the way others do and it has a pleasant light smell. This is my favorite and I wish they sold it in stores. I only know to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this! I have used baby powder and several dry shampoos (most of which were way more expensive than this one), but then I read a review in InStyle magazine rating this the best dry shampoo, so I had to give this a shot. I&#x27;m so glad that I did, and I agree that it works better than pricier competitors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a blow out every Thursday morning, and then I use this on Tuesday and Wednesday morning to get me through those last two days before I go back to the salon. It&#x27;s light weight, and a few spritzes goes a long way. I have really dark hair, and this doesn&#x27;t show on my hair at all. Actually, it did one time when I first got it and really over sprayed my hair, but I think that was user error rather than product error, as I have never had that problem again and have been using for a few months (still on the same can). Oh, and you don&#x27;t need to blow dry it or do anything to it. I just spritz, then brush my hair and go.</li>
            <li> This did not work. It was a waste of money. If you have oily hair that needs to be washed every day, do not bother with this. Even regular baby powder works better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brands of dry hairspray and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This did not work well on my hair. I tried it one evening after washing my hair in the morning the day before. I have wavy, medium thickness hair, not particularly greasy, but I wanted to freshen. This felt thick and made my hair look greasy so I wound up washing it anyway.</li>
            <li> This is the only dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave an awful residue in my dark hair or gross feeling to my hair, I use every other day on my non-wash hair days and it really does the trick.</li>
            <li> It seems to make my hair greasier.  I&#x27;m usually happy with L&#x27;Oreal products, but this one was a bit disappointing. :(</li>
            <li> I thought this would be like a root lifting texturing product that would aid ooph to my hair . Instead it is like a very light hairspray, clear and light and sticky. This would probably be great if you wanted a low hold hairspray and wanted to a product to use rat or back-comb your hair ala 60s 70s. But if you&#x27;re looking for a modern texturizing product you might want to keep looking.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very dry. It is ok, definitely not perfect.</li>
            <li> It actually made my hair look worse. Like a lot worse. Not sure how this product made it out of the lab.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. I have fine color-treated blonde hair that was left flat and lifeless when using other dry shampoos. This one leaves my day 2 and 3 hair looking better than my day 1 hair, to be honest. Big fan. Can&#x27;t really beat the price either!</li>
            <li> It works. But Dry Shampoos are all a bit odd. They use gas to bond to and then volatilize oil in your hair. So they smell pretty bad. Some of these dry shampoos use a lot of talc (which this one does not) and that looks like dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in a pinch, when you hair is all oily and matty, and you just NEED to het it looking clean, this will do the trick better than any other I have tried. It&#x27;s not cheap, but in a pinch is is fast and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would also possibly be good for somebody who is bedridden as they can have clean hair without showering or bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t expect this to replace your normal shampooing cycle.</li>
            <li> When I first used this product I really liked how my hair felt clean, unlike some other products that can make my hair feel dirty. However, it didn&#x27;t make my hair look clean. I&#x27;m switching back to a more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> Not as good as a shampoo but fine substitute after exercise.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.  I have to work the white powder through with my fingers, but overall pretty good.</li>
            <li> It didnt work as well as some of the other options out there (it made my hair look heavy and stringy), but it did get rid of the majority of the oil in my scalp.</li>
            <li> I love this product, that&#x27;s all I have to say</li>
            <li> At first i thought it was okay, it made my hair smell good, but you can still see some greasiness if it&#x27;s the 2nd day since you washed your hair...after maybe 2 weeks of using, i noticed that i kept getting ZITS on my head!! what ?!!? Must be an ingredient in there that is doing that..i will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Definitely turns your hair gray until you brush it in.  It takes some time to get all of the gray brushed through.  I love all of the sulfate free products from L&#x27;Oreal but this is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of washing my hair daily. However, talking with my hair lady, she says washing daily is not a good thing. heard about this dry shampoo from a coworker. Thought id try it. Highly impressed. I spray it, then do makeup, come back and comb it out. Looks as good if not better than when washing the previous day. Smells great. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel weird or nasty. Definitely worth a try!!!</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is the best! I have fine, somewhat dry hair and don&#x27;t want to wash it everyday. I can just spray this on in the morning and it not only takes the built up hairspray out, it also gives me some body. I tried three other well known brands and they didn&#x27;t work nearly as well and had a strong fragrance that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of this, I&#x27;m a dry shampoo connoisseur because I have fine, blonde, oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t add volume and my hair looked greasy mid way through the day. Will not use again.</li>
            <li> Works the best out of several dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  Great for dark hair!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a bunch of white stuff in your hair.  I don&#x27;t use this often, mostly when school gets crazy.  My hair doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;just washed&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t look greasy either.  I recommend this for when you are short on time!</li>
            <li> The GREATEST hair care product ever. Style &amp; Refresh. A must for your beauty Kit!</li>
            <li> Great for long hair and ladies and some men who don&#x27;t want to wash their hair daily. Doesn&#x27;t smell strong and like perfume. Cheaper than in local stores.</li>
            <li> I use this in between washes washing my hair every other day). This product made my hair even more oily. Only plus is that it makes your hair smell good.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t turn your hair white.</li>
            <li> Not impressed L&#x27;Oreal. This arrived to me on time, but it wasn&#x27;t even half full. It seems this was used before it got shipped to me because I used the spray once for my thin short hair, and it was gone. Not okay. I will update if needed</li>
            <li> Great for my in between hair washing, my Locs respond well to the dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Pretty strong. But as the other reviewers said, it does leave powdery layer on top. I have used Garnier dry shampoo and it smells really nice and works very well. Probabaly wont buy again.</li>
            <li> Best I have used! I have not found it to leave a residue or dry my hair. I use after exercising and then blow dry. Looks great and healthy. My daughter likes it too! It does not aggravate her asthma as others have done.</li>
            <li> Great transaction!! Really liked this stuff</li>
            <li> I usually like L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s products so after being disappointed with Dove&#x27;s dry shampoo, decided to give this a try.  It didn&#x27;t do much.  It was better than Dove&#x27;s but not by much.  Dove actually seemed to make my hair oilier.  This one didn&#x27;t make it oilier but it wasn&#x27;t cleaner either.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like this brand; does not flake or make my hair feel yucky.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and a wonderful fragrance! Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it perfect for camping!  If you don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair this can hold you over for a day or two until you can wash your hair!  Also great if you straighten /curl your hair and don&#x27;t want to wash out your hairdo.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Not amazing, but gets some oil out.</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo.  I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m leaving any kind of powder or substance in my hair.  It sprays on, gives vibrancy and my hair still feels like my hair.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Great price and super fast shipping. Thank you for making this such an easy buying process, especially during the hectic holiday season.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic and works better than most dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried (and smells great to boot) but I&#x27;d recommend buying it in-store. The cap doesn&#x27;t like to stay on so your package can arrive with a not full can of this stuff due to the cap falling off and the nozzle getting bumped.</li>
            <li> Ive tried a good 10 different dry hairsprays and this one so far takes the cake. Smells wonderful as well.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave you with weird feeling hair like most others.</li>
            <li> Works almost like hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;One is supposed to lift up hair and spray hair and scalp, then brush...which I did. It allowed some styling, but it did not last long, barely one day.&lt;br /&gt;It did not get sticky or powdery.&lt;br /&gt;But I would not buy again unless I really could not just plain ole wash my hair.</li>
            <li> It works, but there are other products that seem to work much better. I have to be very thorough applying this product, which is kind of a pain considering I am using it because I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Worksd great, no residue</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect dry shampoo and thought I&#x27;d found &amp;#34;The One&amp;#34;! Alas, this still left a powdery, white residue in my hair, even after brushing it out (ESPECIALLY after trying to brush it out!) I&#x27;m sad, since this one was a more expensive (and presumably higher quality) than others I&#x27;ve tried: Pantene, Herbal Essences, Salon Essentials, etc. Big Sexy Hair dry shampoo has been the best, so far!</li>
            <li> This product really does work to revive hair and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and is frangrance-free.</li>
            <li> This smells funny. I seem to need twice as much as other dry shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re in the market, I suggest Batiste. Suave also makes a decent dry shampoo for half the cost. Don&#x27;t waste time on this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay - not great, not bad!</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair smell and feel dirtier than it was before. I tend to was my hair every other day and by the send day it gets a bit oily so I thought this product would help with the oiliness of my hair. But it just makes it look more oily and adds to the scalp build up.</li>
            <li> i have no idea what is in here but it doesn&#x27;t work like a dry shampoo. No volume. No getting rid of grease in the hair. In fact, it weighs my hair down and makes it greasy. It also was gone in like 2 weeks of me trying to give it a chance.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue like other dry shampoos. Also has a very light fragrance.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make dry shampoo like they used to. Nothing special, but not horrible. Like most of the other stuff out there. The only really good stuff is made by Toni and Guy, but it&#x27;s super expensive.</li>
            <li> I really really love this dry shampoo.  I have tried countless dry shampoos over the years and this one is definately one of my favorites.  You only need a few sprays and to brush it through your hair and you are good to go.  Unlike other products, this one does not leave hair too dry or too oily, but just right.  It does not really have any type of smell to it either but it claims to not have as many chemicals and bad things for your hair but I honeslty don&#x27;t see any difference compared to other products that aren&#x27;t supposed to be healthier for your hair.  Especially for the price, I would recommed this product to anyone who is looking for a great dry shampoo to use any morning you are in a rush.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, the type of quality I have come to expect from L&#x27;Oreal Paris. It goes on light and it really does dissolve oils from the hair, it freshens, enhances body and it leaves a clean sensational feeling on the scalp. I will definitely purchase this product again. This is a fast fix for those of us who simply need a fast way to clean in between the longer method of washing, drying and styling. This is quick. You spray it in, remember to hold the bottle several inches away and you brush it through, and viola! Beautiful hair, clean and conditioned.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell, made my head itch and came out strong. I am now using the dry shampoo by &amp;#34;not your mother&#x27;s&amp;#34; I think it is called something like &amp;#34;clean freek&amp;#34; and it works much better</li>
            <li> I use several different dry shampoos, and this is my favorite brand.  I use it everyday no matter if I wash my hair not. It does allow you to skip a day (sometimes two) which is more healthy for your hair, but I&#x27;ve found it helped me significantly to use it daily when I wanted to &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; my hair.  I am very low maintanence so I would just use this product, a brush, and a little hair spray and honestly my hair looked better than when I used to pull out the ole Chi and curling iron mess.  Other brands of dry shampoo or products that call themselves &amp;#34;texture spray&amp;#34; will either clog up immediately, make your hair feel gummy, need to be used on wet hair only, or are only good for the &amp;#34;beach style&amp;#34; waves/messy look.  I didn&#x27;t find that the case with L&#x27;Oreal. The one thing that does make me nervous is the overwhelming smell and product that you can&#x27;t quite get away from.  I don&#x27;t like breathing that in, and as I have two little boys glued to my hip I would always become very nervous having them around afraid what chemicals they are breathing in.  I try to use it and walk some, that doesn&#x27;t help me much...but it does help slightly.  The only other brand I have found that worked similarly (but actually did not have the chemical smell when sprayed) was the CVS generic dry shampoo.  I still recommend this brand; however, because I have wasted lots of money on products that clog. I have never had that experience with L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> excellent.product, it smells nice and and don&#x27;t live white residue in your hair.</li>
            <li> Smell good!!!! Great product!!</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different dry shampoos on my hair. This one I really do not like. I have thick but fine hair and this left a residue on my hair that a regular shampoo could not remove. I ended up having to use a clarifying shampoo and even that took a few washes. Honestly the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found is the suave professionals keritan. I regret trying this product.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo unlike the fresh brand that leaves white residue. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t look as white or so stiff as the other brands.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo out there. I&#x27;ve tried many and this is the one I prefer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been curious about dry shampoo for a long time. I used to use basic talc on my roots as an oil absorber. This stuff is pretty good! It really makes my hair look clean at the top of my head. Sadly, for some reason, it doesn&#x27;t absorb oil as well for me around the sides of my head. I can&#x27;t make sense of it. In would still buy it again though!</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo ever! Doesn&#x27;t flake all over your clothes like other brands. Smells good. Works well - refreshes and re-volumizes.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look fresh without making it feel stiff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok, but did not perform a miracle on my hair that needed to be washed. There was a little improvement.  I read I could make my own dry shampoo with 1/2 baking soda and 1/2 corn starch???</li>
            <li> Smells good and adds volume but absolutely leaves white residue.  People who say otherwise probably do not have dark brown hair but be prepared for the white to show up.</li>
            <li> Works okay, but not much in a can.</li>
            <li> This is the only dry shampoo that I use I love it. I will order more of this in the future. Also shipped very fast.</li>
