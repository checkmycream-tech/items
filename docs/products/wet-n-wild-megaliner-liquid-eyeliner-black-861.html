            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Pretty good liquid liner for cheap</li>
            <li>It is nice having an &#x27;all in one&#x27; option (having the brush with the liner) and the price is just right.  </li>
            <li>It does run easily</li>

            <li>&amp; i was being a cheapo &amp; got a cheap liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product and cheap.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner so much .</li>
            <li>Other than that its great.</li>
            <li>The liner isn&#x27;t matte but it isn&#x27;t super shiny.</li>
            <li>The cap is nice a long and easy to hold on to when applying the eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While this is great if you need to wear eyeliner for like 48 hours, for the average person who puts make up on in the morning and takes off at night, I do not recommend.</li>
            <li>I bought this at my local drug store and it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>Using baby-oil takes this product right off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply, lasts all day, and the bottle lasts me a month if I use it daily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and it&#x27;s just as good as the ones sold by the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially good if you want sharp wings that dry fast!</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t get all dull , it leaves a great finish</li>
            <li>I do a medium sized line across my top lashes and this is the one and only product I have used.</li>
            <li>but I love how it applies and it has a long wear.  </li>
            <li>This stuff went on fine, but by the end of the day I had huge, dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li>I currently have the loreal super slim liquid liner and the product runs out quickly.</li>
            <li>I tend to have problems with fumes from certain cosmetic products but have not had a problem at all with this product.</li>
            <li>The megaliner goes on wet and smooth and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>Works great and super dark black color.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Brush allows line to be really smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i really like it &amp; the brush</li>
            <li>Due to this you&#x27;re always rubbing your eyes therefore creating more wrinkles on them.&lt;br /&gt;-Because</li>
            <li>I imagined that the tip was more of a shorter tip and sharp</li>
            <li>Love Wet and Wild....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this particular mascara for years.</li>
            <li>my main reason for buying it.</li>
            <li>I have used so many maybelline&#x27;s &amp; revlon eyeliners &amp; they only last for 4-5 hours.</li>
            <li>I use high end make-up products.  </li>
            <li>Too difficult to remove, I&#x27;d rather just use an eyeliner pen and be able to easily wipe off at the end of the night.</li>
            <li>, the black is very black which is great, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>this is a decent cheap eyeliner if you want something that will last a long time.</li>
            <li>For some reason, Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild MegaLiner Liquid Eyeliner is the only one that does not flake off at the end of the day and yet still washes off easily with water at the end of the night.  </li>
            <li>It comes out a jet black, and unlike other liquid liners, doesn&#x27;t require you to apply 3 layers to make sure there is a nice solid black color without any breakage.</li>
            <li>The product came in a few hours early and was perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>I tried the maybelline masterstudio liquid liner and it dried on me so quickly.</li>
            <li>I only used it once and gave it to my 13 year old as play makeup.</li>
            <li>This is a very matte eyeliner, so expect some flaking at the end of the day if You&#x27;re too rough with it.</li>
            <li>The color is pitch black and it stays on pretty well.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;-LASTS TOO LONG, horrid to get off at the end of the night.</li>
            <li> long.</li>
            <li> I store it upside down and the product will only be enough for one eye.</li>
            <li> I USE WET N WILD EVERYDAY NOW, at school i dont have to check my winged eyeliner in the restroom anymore</li>
            <li> Because I use it every  single day .</li>
            <li> Application is easy for both thin and thick lines.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for a few years now (the h20 proof and regular version).</li>
            <li> If you miss up wet a que tip and put makeup remover on it to correct.</li>
            <li> Came sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years on my upper lid.</li>
            <li> Ive been ising it fpr so long and its never let me down</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s bolder than elf&#x27;s even though it&#x27;s $1.</li>
            <li> As for the brush, sometimes it will fray which makes it a bit difficult to apply the product without smearing somewhere on your eye-lid, but that is the only possible flaw I can think of!</li>
            <li> The tip is flexible and its as if your drawing on your line on your lid, unlike other eyeliners who have a stiff tip to apply the liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> In your local drugstores you can get this product for around 3 dollars which is crazy since it surpasses other liquid liners that are around double the price.</li>
            <li> &amp; i have a little bit of oily eyes.</li>
            <li> It does last a very long time, but rather difficult to get off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry I wasted my $$ on this.</li>
            <li> It makes sense that I have the black as it almost completes my collection!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner has been my go-to product for the past 2 and a half years.</li>
            <li> Other reviews complain that this eyeliner is hard to remove, but I haven&#x27;t encountered that problem.</li>
            <li> Another thing I noticed is that towards the end of the day, it gets a little hard and starts to flake off on you (even with primer on).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so thick and hard to get off, if you mess up, its REALLY difficult to fix.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can be applied either thin or thick, depending on your preference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought expensive liners over the years - never again.  </li>
            <li> Im obsessed with this eyeliner!</li>
            <li> and I was highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> The bad thing about it is removing the eyeliner!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like it, its affordable, it lasts and it goes on smooth and doesnt streak when layering! It does run easily so primer is a must!</li>
            <li> I am a face sweater and have oily lids...this didn&#x27;t last 2 hours on my face. ( Except for UNDER my eyes! For some reason there was plenty under there!) I only used it once and gave it to my 13 year old as play makeup.</li>
            <li> Im obsessed with this eyeliner! Gives you the perfect winged look. My only complain is that it tends to smudge on the corner of my eyes after a couple of hours. Other than that its great.</li>
            <li> I like the precise tip. I apply it to the inner side of my lashed. Stays on for most of the day. I tried more expensive brands and I was highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend was happy. These werent for me or anything. I swear.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Wet n Wild megaliner.  It makes sense that I have the black as it almost completes my collection! The megaliner goes on wet and smooth and dries quickly.  It has the tiniest of brushes at the end of the cap. The cap is nice a long and easy to hold on to when applying the eyeliner.  It can be applied either thin or thick, depending on your preference.  It is nice having an &#x27;all in one&#x27; option (having the brush with the liner) and the price is just right.  I tend to have problems with fumes from certain cosmetic products but have not had a problem at all with this product. I will purchase again when I run out of my current stock!</li>
            <li> Pretty good liquid liner for cheap, the black is very black which is great, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The only eyeliner I&#x27;ve been using for the last 3 years. Have &amp;#34;converted&amp;#34; my coworkers to wet n wild too. We&#x27;re all bartenders so at the end of a 8 hour shift their eyeliners would be worn off and smudgy while mine is intact. I always buy 3 at a time. Because I use it every  single day .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for a few years now (the h20 proof and regular version). It&#x27;s very easy to apply, lasts all day, and the bottle lasts me a month if I use it daily. The bad thing about it is removing the eyeliner! I have to scrub my eyelids harshly just to remove it completely at night. Another thing I noticed is that towards the end of the day, it gets a little hard and starts to flake off on you (even with primer on). I&#x27;d say overall this is a decent cheap eyeliner if you want something that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some reviewers say this eyeliner wears so well it won&#x27;t wash off. I use a layer of almond oil to remove all traces of makeup every night and keep my skin moisturized. LOVE this liner AND the price. It&#x27;s one of my staples.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked all over for eyeliner that won&#x27;t smudge and give me raccoon eyes, and I have to keep looking. This stuff went on fine, but by the end of the day I had huge, dark circles under my eyes (that of course I couldn&#x27;t get off until I got home to the eye makeup remover, because the stuff is waterproof).</li>
            <li> This is a very matte eyeliner, so expect some flaking at the end of the day if You&#x27;re too rough with it. It does last a very long time, but rather difficult to get off. Overall, a good product and cheap.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is perfect for you if you like to manipulate your own cat eye design. The tip is flexible and its as if your drawing on your line on your lid, unlike other eyeliners who have a stiff tip to apply the liquid eyeliner. Ive been wearing it for years and dont plan on switching. Its also cheap and easily accessible :)</li>
            <li> this is the best eyeliner out of tens i&#x27;ve tried... because it stays on my eyelids all day... love it!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner so much . Ive been ising it fpr so long and its never let me down</li>
            <li> I do a medium sized line across my top lashes and this is the one and only product I have used. Best color stats on all day yet easy to get off with makeup remover. Tips: wipe off on sides before use, once you get it because there is a lot of product.  If you miss up wet a que tip and put makeup remover on it to correct.</li>
            <li> Love Wet and Wild....cheap but I love how it applies and it has a long wear.  I&#x27;ve used this particular mascara for years. It&#x27;s my favorite liquid liner.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the local drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap&lt;br /&gt;-Lasts for a while&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t smudge&lt;br /&gt;-Brush allows line to be really smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-LASTS TOO LONG, horrid to get off at the end of the night. Took multiple cottons balls and eye makeup remover applications. Due to this you&#x27;re always rubbing your eyes therefore creating more wrinkles on them.&lt;br /&gt;-Because it&#x27;s so thick and hard to get off, if you mess up, its REALLY difficult to fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is great if you need to wear eyeliner for like 48 hours, for the average person who puts make up on in the morning and takes off at night, I do not recommend. Too difficult to remove, I&#x27;d rather just use an eyeliner pen and be able to easily wipe off at the end of the night.</li>
            <li> I have finally tried this product and OMG I&#x27;m in love! I think this is my HG liquid liner! I have tried so many liners. I used to use the cover girl liquid liner. I tried the maybelline masterstudio liquid liner and it dried on me so quickly. I currently have the loreal super slim liquid liner and the product runs out quickly. I store it upside down and the product will only be enough for one eye. The tip is starting to dry out. I also have the maybelline stiletto liquid liner. I like it but I feel like I can&#x27;t get enough product so I have to keep dipping the brush every time. But this eyeliner is amazing!! My cat eye comes out soooo perfect and it super easy to use. The liner isn&#x27;t matte but it isn&#x27;t super shiny. Plus this liner lasts me all day. I got it at target for $3. I dont think I&#x27;ll buy another liquid liner ever again</li>
            <li> It works wonders, though if anyone is looking to buy this product, you should know tyat it is a brush, not the felt tip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought expensive liners over the years - never again.  I picked this liner up and it is as good as any of the high cost liners both drugstore and department store brand.  Application is easy for both thin and thick lines.  No problems coming off at night either - I happen to take my makeup off with makeup remover wipes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local drug store and it&#x27;s amazing it&#x27;s easy to remove and doesn&#x27;t leave residue. It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
            <li> Best liquid liner , I&#x27;m a make up artist and I love this stuff . it doesn&#x27;t get all dull , it leaves a great finish</li>
            <li> This eyeliner has been my go-to product for the past 2 and a half years. I had one co-worker who would constantly compliment my eyeliner and stated that it was so jet-black as well as well defined. In your local drugstores you can get this product for around 3 dollars which is crazy since it surpasses other liquid liners that are around double the price. It comes out a jet black, and unlike other liquid liners, doesn&#x27;t require you to apply 3 layers to make sure there is a nice solid black color without any breakage. Other reviews complain that this eyeliner is hard to remove, but I haven&#x27;t encountered that problem. Using baby-oil takes this product right off. As for the brush, sometimes it will fray which makes it a bit difficult to apply the product without smearing somewhere on your eye-lid, but that is the only possible flaw I can think of! Definitely check it out!!!</li>
            <li> No different formula or staying power from dollar store brand. NO !!  I would not buy this product again. It did not last, and it smeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry I wasted my $$ on this.</li>
            <li> The moisture on the brush did not allow even application and after approx 7 uses, the brush started to deteriorate.</li>
            <li> Came sooner than expected. Nicely Packaged. I really love this liner. It&#x27;s cheap and it&#x27;s just as good as the ones sold by the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> I use high end make-up products.  For some reason, Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild MegaLiner Liquid Eyeliner is the only one that does not flake off at the end of the day and yet still washes off easily with water at the end of the night.  My favorite look includes cat eye wings so this is also economical.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price that you pay. The color is pitch black and it stays on pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. Plus, Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild does not test on animals--my main reason for buying it.</li>
            <li> The product came in a few hours early and was perfectly fine. No scratches, rips, or usage. I imagined that the tip was more of a shorter tip and sharp but it&#x27;s similar to the elf liquid liner brush: long. Other than that, it&#x27;s bolder than elf&#x27;s even though it&#x27;s $1.</li>
            <li> i went to walgreens &amp; i was being a cheapo &amp; got a cheap liquid eyeliner BUT OMFG THIS EYELINER HAS BEEN THE BEST. I have used so many maybelline&#x27;s &amp; revlon eyeliners &amp; they only last for 4-5 hours. I USE WET N WILD EVERYDAY NOW, at school i dont have to check my winged eyeliner in the restroom anymore bc it doesnt smear at all!! &amp; i have a little bit of oily eyes. i dont know man i really like it &amp; the brush</li>
            <li> Works great and super dark black color. I have used this before and I love it. One of the best drugstore liquid liners there is.</li>
            <li> This is the best liquid liner I have ever bought. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years on my upper lid. It&#x27;s especially good if you want sharp wings that dry fast!</li>
