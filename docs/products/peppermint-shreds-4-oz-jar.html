    <ol>
            <li>and my teeth feel great!  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>It takes a while to get used to the soap taste, but does a wonderful job of cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li>Both she and the dentist asked me what I was using because they couldn&#x27;t believe how great my teeth looked.</li>
            <li>These are great.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect great results if you smoke, drink soda, wine, or tea.</li>
            <li>My daughter got my jar and she&#x27;s still happy with it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>Tooth-soap is excellence, great product if your going organic.</li>
            <li>Feels good but taste aweful.</li>
            <li>However, after a good rinse the soap tastes goes away.</li>
            <li>Good fluoride-free alternative to toothpaste.</li>
            <li>(I did not take a star off for the price because I&#x27;m uncertain whether it is a fair price or not at this point.)</li>
            <li>I love the way this product works!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to use, I&#x27;m converted!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Now I brush my teeth more and longer.</li>
            <li>If you love that &amp;#34;just got a cleaning at the dentist&amp;#34; feeling without the pain that comes with it, you&#x27;ll love this</li>
            <li>It is definitely different, but in a very good way!</li>
            <li>I love this Product....</li>
            <li>I give this product 5 stars simply because it is awesome!!</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Overall great product!!!!</li>
            <li>I love how clean my teeth feel!</li>
            <li>I like my teeth very clean</li>
            <li>Your teeth feel soooo clean!</li>
            <li>As for the effects of using the Tooth Soap Shreds, I&#x27;ve never had a more clean jowl then with Tooth Soap.</li>
            <li>I love how clean they make my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to take when traveling</li>
            <li>I bought this product 8 months ago and its still going strong.</li>
            <li>It does such a great job that, last year when I went to the dentist, the hygienist kept remarking how great my teeth looked.</li>
            <li>My teeth are smooth all day.</li>
            <li>and so I didn&#x27;t feel a need to go for a cleaning, but figured it would probably be a good idea to be looked at by a professional.</li>
            <li>The soap lathers much better than paste, and I really feel like I am getting a better cleaner mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised at how nice my teeth feel and how effective this product really is!  </li>
            <li>(pretty good deal considering this is made of all whole food products).</li>
            <li>and I still have the original jars.  </li>
            <li>This product helps your mouth to feel clean.</li>
            <li>Which is to clean my teeth and tongue without the poisonous intervention of fluoride, cargeenan or any foaming agents which do nothing but leave a film over the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>leaves the teeth feeling squeaky clean like going to the dentist for a cleaning.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a cool &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Good product  overall</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my whole mouth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and i ran to my toothbrush to give it a try.</li>
            <li>It is soapy but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>It definitely is economical, though</li>
            <li>I can have a confident smile for the first time in my adult life.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t taste as good as other Tooth Soaps, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>The dentist has even mentioned the difference during my 6 month checkups and cleanings how much improved the and quick  </li>
            <li>but I can deal with a little soapy taste with a product as good as this.</li>
            <li>so I had to go back to something better for that.  </li>
            <li>It tastes exactly like what it is:  soap with peppermint oil added.  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly what I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Left my teeth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>what is up,  these companies charging so much for a soap.</li>
            <li>Even the next morning they still feel silky smooth, no coating or buildup.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to tooth soap</li>
            <li>teeth feel so much cleaner with this.</li>
            <li>stuff really lathers well.</li>
            <li>I might buy another bottle and really keep track of how much it costs per use and change my mind on the price point.</li>
            <li>May be more towards natural than commercial soaps, but a soap.&lt;br /&gt;One can get some liquid soap and add peppermint drops, rather than pay $22.</li>
            <li>Other than that, my husband and I both love the shreds.  </li>
            <li>In total what she was able to scrape off was less than what you could fit on a head of a pin.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to use a full strand which is about 1&amp;#34; long, I use about 1/3 of that and get plenty of foam</li>
            <li>The dentist actually checked my whole mouth over twice because he had never seen this.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a natural toothpaste, and appreciate that soap is a natural product, but I just couldn&#x27;t get used to the feeling of soap in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that my tooth stain went away</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for close to 6 months now, and I still can&#x27;t decide if I really like it enough to buy it again or not.  </li>
            <li>So far it has worked.</li>
            <li>read in some other reviews that after a while the soap in the jar gets stuck together kind of like shredded cheese that has been melted a little.  </li>
            <li>No more &#x27;morning&#x27; breath, slippery smooth teeth.</li>
            <li>Normally you go in twice a year for cleanings, they recommended I come back in a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>concept, that one little shred of soap about half the size of a toothpick can give you more than enough foam to brush all your teeth, without any harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>Buying conventional toothpaste, I&#x27;d go through a whole container in maybe 2-3 months.</li>
            <li>Then wet your toothbrush with water and brush your teeth like normal.  </li>
            <li>As far as effectiveness goes, I don&#x27;t see that it works any better or worse than your average non-whitening formula toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Although I love this product after the first few uses the shreds turn into a big gummy pile (think cheese all melted together), making it difficult to portion out the \\&quot;shreds\\&quot; anymore.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> So even though this product is a bit more expensive initially its been costing me roughly $2.85/month for this product</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> hands have to be absolutely dry to use this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time and my dentist can tell!!</li>
            <li> My gums are firmer and pinker and for some reason I have less plaque overall.</li>
            <li> Once you try it, it would be hard to go back to regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> , this doesn&#x27;t taste like Crest, or any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> So, based on other reviews, I tried tooth soap.  </li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this product so I&#x27;ll usually guesstimate about 1/8 tsp per brushing.</li>
            <li> For the record, I still brush with the same Sonicare toothbrush I&#x27;ve for past 5 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to sprinkle a few on the cap and take from there, but even then my hands have to be very dry</li>
            <li> While the product lasts awhile, and it&#x27;s not too bad for a natural product, I still feel it&#x27;s a bit on the high side.</li>
            <li> My dentist said it looked as if I had been away for less than 6 months.</li>
            <li> They taste pretty awful at first, but I&#x27;ve become accustomed to them now and that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I can get past the bitter taste, but it caused tooth sensitivity</li>
            <li> Otherwise the shreds start sticking together and it just because a mess.</li>
            <li> Requires a little acclimation to the taste of soap.</li>
            <li> you have to get used to no flavor left behind if you feel you need that you can follow with mouth wash , but My Teeth &amp; Gums never felt cleaner</li>
            <li> So to avoid this I have been pouring a few shreds into the cap and taking the one I want from there instead of sticking my fingers in the jar.  </li>
            <li> This product solved my horrible receding gum line and everything is perfectly pink and healthy.</li>
            <li> Other than the taste being bad, it cleans very well.</li>
            <li> cleanings are because there&#x27;s very little plaque to deal with.  </li>
            <li> The last product I tried used salt, which I found unpleasant because my teeth never felt</li>
            <li> Cut the unhealthy habits and your teeth will become whiter and healthier.</li>
            <li> Normal toothpastes with Glycerin you want to avoid because they leave a nasty residue around the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product, but wanted to move away from using toothpaste with tons of chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Even my breath has improved, it wasn&#x27;t really bad before but still.  </li>
            <li> If you care about your teeth, I promise you, you will not be disappointed with this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product. Now I look forward to brushing my teeth. No more &#x27;morning&#x27; breath, slippery smooth teeth. Love this. Now I brush my teeth more and longer.</li>
            <li> If you love that &amp;#34;just got a cleaning at the dentist&amp;#34; feeling without the pain that comes with it, you&#x27;ll love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for years. It does such a great job that, last year when I went to the dentist, the hygienist kept remarking how great my teeth looked. In total what she was able to scrape off was less than what you could fit on a head of a pin. Both she and the dentist asked me what I was using because they couldn&#x27;t believe how great my teeth looked. The dentist actually checked my whole mouth over twice because he had never seen this. And all this WITHOUT having my teeth cleaned for 3 years! I like my teeth very clean and so I didn&#x27;t feel a need to go for a cleaning, but figured it would probably be a good idea to be looked at by a professional. Normally you go in twice a year for cleanings, they recommended I come back in a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, this doesn&#x27;t taste like Crest, or any other toothpaste. It is soapy but not unpleasant. They add essential oils so you have a variety to choose from like cinnamon, peppermint, etc.  If you care about your teeth, I promise you, you will not be disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I use regular toothpaste in the morning and this tooth soap at night. My gums are firmer and pinker and for some reason I have less plaque overall. I think this stuff prevents plaque bacteria from attaching at your gumline. Kinda takes getting used to the soap taste, but now I like it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time and my dentist can tell!! I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product, but wanted to move away from using toothpaste with tons of chemicals.  So, based on other reviews, I tried tooth soap.  I am pleasantly surprised at how nice my teeth feel and how effective this product really is!  It is definitely different, but in a very good way!</li>
            <li> Left my teeth feeling very clean. It doesn&#x27;t taste like peppermint, just smells like it. Other than the taste being bad, it cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 8 months ago and its still going strong. Buying conventional toothpaste, I&#x27;d go through a whole container in maybe 2-3 months. So even though this product is a bit more expensive initially its been costing me roughly $2.85/month for this product (pretty good deal considering this is made of all whole food products). As for the effects of using the Tooth Soap Shreds, I&#x27;ve never had a more clean jowl then with Tooth Soap. Tooth Soap removes all of the build up around the gums. Normal toothpastes with Glycerin you want to avoid because they leave a nasty residue around the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has room to grow in the \\&quot;ease of use\\&quot; department. Although I love this product after the first few uses the shreds turn into a big gummy pile (think cheese all melted together), making it difficult to portion out the \\&quot;shreds\\&quot; anymore. This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this product so I&#x27;ll usually guesstimate about 1/8 tsp per brushing.</li>
            <li> Feels good but taste aweful.</li>
            <li> Are all these not just a soap for $22 bucks?, with some peppermint drops. May be more towards natural than commercial soaps, but a soap.&lt;br /&gt;One can get some liquid soap and add peppermint drops, rather than pay $22. what is up,  these companies charging so much for a soap.</li>
            <li> I came across this product by accident and ordered Cinnamon and Peppermint.  My son and wife had a reaction to the Cinnamon but everyone loves the Peppermint.  I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 years now and I still have the original jars.  This stuff last forever!  The instructions say to use a full strand which is about 1&amp;#34; long, I use about 1/3 of that and get plenty of foam and my teeth feel great!  Even the next morning they still feel silky smooth, no coating or buildup.  Even my breath has improved, it wasn&#x27;t really bad before but still.  The dentist has even mentioned the difference during my 6 month checkups and cleanings how much improved the and quick  cleanings are because there&#x27;s very little plaque to deal with.  For the record, I still brush with the same Sonicare toothbrush I&#x27;ve for past 5 years.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I love the way this product works! Your teeth feel soooo clean! Once you try it, it would be hard to go back to regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is basically shredded soap.  I wanted to try a natural toothpaste, and appreciate that soap is a natural product, but I just couldn&#x27;t get used to the feeling of soap in my mouth.</li>
            <li> These are great. I&#x27;ve bought them a couple of times now because they just work so well. I love how clean they make my teeth feel. Never going back to tooth paste.</li>
            <li> This product helps your mouth to feel clean. It lasts a long time.  It has even helped me to remove some stains on my teeth that had been there for years. I would purchase the product again and I&#x27;d recommend it.  It took daily use of the product over 3 weeks for the tooth stain to disappear. I was pleasantly surprised that my tooth stain went away but I&#x27;m thankful that it did.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to get used to the soap taste, but does a wonderful job of cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I went years without insurance and finally went back to the dentist to get my teeth cleaned. My dentist said it looked as if I had been away for less than 6 months. This product solved my horrible receding gum line and everything is perfectly pink and healthy. Thanks to tooth soap I can have a confident smile for the first time in my adult life. Don&#x27;t expect great results if you smoke, drink soda, wine, or tea. Cut the unhealthy habits and your teeth will become whiter and healthier.</li>
            <li> I love this Product....you have to get used to no flavor left behind if you feel you need that you can follow with mouth wash , but My Teeth &amp; Gums never felt cleaner and it&#x27;s so easy to use, I&#x27;m converted!</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars because of the taste.  It tastes like someone shredded a bar of soap.  Other than that, my husband and I both love the shreds.  My teeth feel cleaner and healthier, and oddly enough, I don&#x27;t always feel like I need to brush two times a day.  Will be trying the liquid version when we finish these.</li>
            <li> This is the third (or fourth time that I have bought this item.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I can get past the bitter taste, but it caused tooth sensitivity so I had to go back to something better for that.  My daughter got my jar and she&#x27;s still happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for close to 6 months now, and I still can&#x27;t decide if I really like it enough to buy it again or not.  It tastes exactly like what it is:  soap with peppermint oil added.  If you can&#x27;t stand the taste of soap, you probably won&#x27;t like this.  As far as effectiveness goes, I don&#x27;t see that it works any better or worse than your average non-whitening formula toothpaste.  It definitely is economical, though:  one jar can easily last a year, I think.  And it&#x27;s a cool &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; concept, that one little shred of soap about half the size of a toothpick can give you more than enough foam to brush all your teeth, without any harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 months and it&#x27;s great.  To use it take a shred put it in your mouth and chew it a bit.  Then wet your toothbrush with water and brush your teeth like normal.  The soap lathers much better than paste, and I really feel like I am getting a better cleaner mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read in some other reviews that after a while the soap in the jar gets stuck together kind of like shredded cheese that has been melted a little.  So to avoid this I have been pouring a few shreds into the cap and taking the one I want from there instead of sticking my fingers in the jar.  So far it has worked.</li>
            <li> I have been using this about two years.  I always get &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; gum reports from my peridontist !</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars simply because it is awesome!! :-)&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel so much cleaner with this. With toothpaste after a couple hours my teeth would feel like they were &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34; with something but not toothsoap! My teeth are smooth all day. Also one thing I realized is that I don&#x27;t have to Floss as often with toothsoap. The taste is the only problem I have with toothsoap but I can deal with a little soapy taste with a product as good as this.</li>
            <li> Love these. They taste pretty awful at first, but I&#x27;ve become accustomed to them now and that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I love how clean my teeth feel!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what I thought it would. Which is to clean my teeth and tongue without the poisonous intervention of fluoride, cargeenan or any foaming agents which do nothing but leave a film over the teeth and gums. I will definately buy this again and would definately recommend it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste as good as other Tooth Soaps, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and i ran to my toothbrush to give it a try. leaves the teeth feeling squeaky clean like going to the dentist for a cleaning. But it tastes like soap! However, after a good rinse the soap tastes goes away. Good product  overall</li>
            <li> Good fluoride-free alternative to toothpaste. Requires a little acclimation to the taste of soap.</li>
            <li> I bought Tooth Soap after a disaster trying another product I didn&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s natural--there isn&#x27;t fluoride or glycerin, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my whole mouth feel very clean. The last product I tried used salt, which I found unpleasant because my teeth never felt clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to take when traveling (I only carry-on for 85% of my travel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really lathers well. I don&#x27;t know why it pleases me so, but it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hands have to be absolutely dry to use this product. Otherwise the shreds start sticking together and it just because a mess. I&#x27;ve tried to sprinkle a few on the cap and take from there, but even then my hands have to be very dry or it&#x27;s still an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price. While the product lasts awhile, and it&#x27;s not too bad for a natural product, I still feel it&#x27;s a bit on the high side. I might buy another bottle and really keep track of how much it costs per use and change my mind on the price point. If so, I will edit my review accordingly. (I did not take a star off for the price because I&#x27;m uncertain whether it is a fair price or not at this point.)</li>
            <li> Tooth-soap is excellence, great product if your going organic. Only downside is the expiration date says July 2013. Overall great product!!!! Recommended!!!</li>
