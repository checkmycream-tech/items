            <li>Even her orthodontist was impressed and said she was going to start recommending them to her patients.</li>
            <li>WORKED PERFECTLY -</li>
            <li>great for musicians!  </li>
            <li>this one is the best</li>
            <li>The appliance fits perfectly for him and he say it works.</li>
            <li>This worked the best.  </li>
            <li>These are great for adults.  </li>
            <li>They are great at stopping irritation.</li>
            <li>A great idea.</li>
            <li>Great option for protecting braces.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would be great :/&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this works great</li>
            <li>Bought one set of these to see if it was better than what I was using (Dental Orthodontic Lip Guard Covers) and they are not even close.</li>
            <li>It works ok</li>
            <li>I ordered more for his friends in band.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I will even need it by the time I am able to use it, though.</li>
            <li>He was able play better without anything covering the braces.</li>
            <li>I still wish there was something better for horn players with braces.</li>
            <li>because it fits better on my husband&#x27;s lower, metal braces but isn&#x27;t made to fit over ceramic braces.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old fit and sized them himself which was great for me.</li>
            <li>Fairly easy to get in/out of mouth.</li>
            <li>Easy to fit.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews that said the product didn&#x27;t fit well, but I hoped that my mouth would be an exception.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s important to him.</li>
            <li>They would be good if you only need them to cover your front teeth.</li>
            <li>And best of all - no more waking up with sores!</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t fit over my braces and, even if it did, it is huge inside my mouth (I am an adult woman)</li>
            <li>.. simple and effective.</li>
            <li>right off-</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit and after some modification by removing some of the little hooks he was able to get them to fit.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use/apply and simple to clean.</li>
            <li>First of all, I am not affiliated with either of the companies mentioned in this review.</li>
            <li>My 11-year old daughter reports that the lipguard is notably more comfortable to wear than the standard mouthguards, and doesn&#x27;t interfere w/talking.</li>
            <li>When I first got my braces they would rub on my lips at night and make it to where I couldn&#x27;t sleep.</li>
            <li>I believe they&#x27;re a bit bigger than metal braces, so it just doesn&#x27;t quite fit right.</li>
            <li>They fit good only on my front four teeth (top&amp;bottoms) and hardly on the bottom where there&#x27;s the bands.</li>
            <li>I have been using a braces cover for playing the trumpet that you mold much like a sports mouth guard, and that works well</li>
            <li>I cut it to fit my mouth size, but my brackets were not even enough for this to work.</li>
            <li>The guards don&#x27;t snap onto the back.of my braces very well and have to trim that part off.</li>
            <li>he said my teeth need to be much straighter before it would stay on.</li>
            <li>These really save my lips and the insides of my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>While a great concept, if your braces get in the way of the little &#x27;clips&#x27;, these guards will not stay on.&lt;br /&gt;The clips that get in the way are easily removed by cutting them off, but then need to have more clips build onto the band itself.</li>
            <li>Product arrived promptly, shields keep new bands from irritating my daughter&#x27;s gum tissue while getting used to braces, great idea.</li>
            <li>but if you want a  High quality mouth guard, this product isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to talk  with though...</li>
            <li>My son is 13 years old and plays the trombone.</li>
            <li>Presumably it provides less protection, but since my daughter is unwilling to wear the standard versions, I&#x27;m happy to give her at least some level of protection.</li>
            <li>Took a little messing about to get them on the first time, but once they were on it was simple the next time.</li>

            <li> Really couldn&#x27;t be much worse.</li>
            <li> i spent a lot of money on mouth guards for my son who wear braces and play the trombone.</li>
            <li> The bottom one was shorter and edges are rough.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected.  </li>
            <li> Also, the sharp plastic edges hurt when they hit my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I had to cut it which caused sharp edges.</li>
            <li> so I would really look weird when wearing it.</li>
            <li> My son got his braces put on, and the next morning already had a small sore!</li>
            <li> but makes for less pain.</li>
            <li> No need to mess with wax or goo.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money on this one.</li>
            <li> These do not fit correctly</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> totally a waste of money.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> still have some small spaces in my front teeth &amp; power bands on my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult in braces, have been going threw wax like mad.</li>
            <li> too hard to keep it on</li>
            <li> When I got my braces first put on, I need some protection for my lips BAD!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a really good mouth guard for braces.</li>
            <li> But he thought were way too difficult to attach said they didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> I thought playing the trumpet would be impossible with braces</li>
            <li> Not as bad as if I weren&#x27;t to have them on</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> Sometimes they don&#x27;t stay on tho :(</li>
            <li> I hate to say that, but it didn&#x27;t work for me :(</li>
            <li> These are awful</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> My wife got these to help guard her inner lips from her braces when the wax was not working.  She loves it and it works like a charm!  Even her orthodontist was impressed and said she was going to start recommending them to her patients.</li>
            <li> too hard to keep it on</li>
            <li> First of all, I am not affiliated with either of the companies mentioned in this review. Really couldn&#x27;t be much worse. I have been using a braces cover for playing the trumpet that you mold much like a sports mouth guard, and that works well but it is bulky. I thought that this would have a lower profile. I read the reviews that said the product didn&#x27;t fit well, but I hoped that my mouth would be an exception. I was unfortunately one of many who can&#x27;t use this product. I cut it to fit my mouth size, but my brackets were not even enough for this to work. Also, the sharp plastic edges hurt when they hit my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom LIne: I would suggest these http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FK5YLNM/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> Wasted my money on this one. I use the case the product came in, but the product itself is a throw away.</li>
            <li> keeps her rubber band braces in place while she sleep</li>
            <li> These are great for adults.  My husband got braces and was reacting to the metal in his mouth - irritation and fever sores.  By wearing these, he no longer has those problems</li>
            <li> works quite well. The guards don&#x27;t snap onto the back.of my braces very well and have to trim that part off. They are great at stopping irritation. A great idea. I wish the orthodontist kept these at the office.</li>
            <li> Bought one set of these to see if it was better than what I was using (Dental Orthodontic Lip Guard Covers) and they are not even close.</li>
            <li> Omg!! These totally saved me! I thought playing the trumpet would be impossible with braces but because of these I can still play my horn!</li>
            <li> It works ok but it&#x27;s not a really good mouth guard for braces. I&#x27;m a wrestler and when I finish a match my lips still seem to be cut a bit. Not as bad as if I weren&#x27;t to have them on but if you want a  High quality mouth guard, this product isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t fit over my braces and, even if it did, it is huge inside my mouth (I am an adult woman) so I would really look weird when wearing it.</li>
            <li> While a great concept, if your braces get in the way of the little &#x27;clips&#x27;, these guards will not stay on.&lt;br /&gt;The clips that get in the way are easily removed by cutting them off, but then need to have more clips build onto the band itself.</li>
            <li> The grid lock did not match up to my teeth and I had to cut it which caused sharp edges.</li>
            <li> WORKED PERFECTLY - I ordered more for his friends in band. We recommend the product ! Easy to use/apply and simple to clean.</li>
            <li> I see how it COULD work, but I have teeth that are set back from the rest, a tooth that is forward, and a couple of sideways teeth, so I can&#x27;t use this yet. When my orthodontist tried to put this on me, it just kept falling right off- he said my teeth need to be much straighter before it would stay on. I don&#x27;t know if I will even need it by the time I am able to use it, though. :/</li>
            <li> My 11-year old daughter reports that the lipguard is notably more comfortable to wear than the standard mouthguards, and doesn&#x27;t interfere w/talking. Presumably it provides less protection, but since my daughter is unwilling to wear the standard versions, I&#x27;m happy to give her at least some level of protection.</li>
            <li> great for musicians!  i spent a lot of money on mouth guards for my son who wear braces and play the trombone. this one is the best</li>
            <li> Bought for my son with braces who plays trumpet.  Didn&#x27;t fit and after some modification by removing some of the little hooks he was able to get them to fit.  But he thought were way too difficult to attach said they didn&#x27;t help.  He was able play better without anything covering the braces.</li>
            <li> We got these for my son, a trumpet player, to protect his lips when he plays. It took him very little time to get used to them, and it really helped to keep his lips from getting torn up.</li>
            <li> My son is 13 years old and plays the trombone. The appliance fits perfectly for him and he say it works. Plus, he keeps up with it and takes care of it so it&#x27;s important to him.</li>
            <li> My son got his braces put on, and the next morning already had a small sore! He&#x27;s a stomach sleeper, and rubs his face on his pillow when he&#x27;s asleep. This product is a God send! Took a little messing about to get them on the first time, but once they were on it was simple the next time. And best of all - no more waking up with sores! He wears these all the time to sleep. I&#x27;m definitely buying another set, just to have a spare.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this is meant for metal braces.. because it fits better on my husband&#x27;s lower, metal braces but isn&#x27;t made to fit over ceramic braces. I believe they&#x27;re a bit bigger than metal braces, so it just doesn&#x27;t quite fit right. Too bad.</li>
            <li> These do not fit correctly</li>
            <li> The bottom one was shorter and edges are rough. But did offer some comfort. Overpriced.</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly, shields keep new bands from irritating my daughter&#x27;s gum tissue while getting used to braces, great idea.</li>
            <li> Great option for protecting braces.  Easy to fit.  My 13 year old fit and sized them himself which was great for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult in braces, have been going threw wax like mad. I thought this would be great :/&lt;br /&gt;I still have some small spaces in my front teeth &amp; power bands on my bottom teeth. They fit good only on my front four teeth (top&amp;bottoms) and hardly on the bottom where there&#x27;s the bands. It failing to latch on my back teeth, I&#x27;m hoping it stays in place just for night time use.</li>
            <li> These are awful don&#x27;t waste your money. They would be good if you only need them to cover your front teeth. The guard doesn&#x27;t even reach my daughters back teeth !</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to get in/out of mouth. Moderate protection for trumpet playing student. I still wish there was something better for horn players with braces.</li>
            <li> totally a waste of money. garbage.</li>
            <li> my daughter would get sores all over her mouth and the wax given at the ortho would just melt and fall off.. this works great.. simple and effective.</li>
            <li> These really save my lips and the insides of my cheeks.  Kind of hard to talk  with though...but makes for less pain.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my braces.  Nothing lined up</li>
            <li> I hate to say that, but it didn&#x27;t work for me :(</li>
            <li> When I first got my braces they would rub on my lips at night and make it to where I couldn&#x27;t sleep. Now with this product it stops the bubbling. Sometimes they don&#x27;t stay on tho :(</li>
            <li> When I got my braces first put on, I need some protection for my lips BAD!  I bought all kinds of different products.  This worked the best.  I can pop them on and off at any time.  No need to mess with wax or goo.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected.  Just needed to trim.</li>
