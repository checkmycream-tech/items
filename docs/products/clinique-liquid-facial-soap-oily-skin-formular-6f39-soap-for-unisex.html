            <li>my hand to God, most people think I am around 23-25 years old, and I am almost 35.  </li>

            <li>the oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NIce f light foaming action.</li>
            <li>Okay, so this is actually my second order.  </li>

            <li>, I don&#x27;t think I use as much product.</li>
            <li>My complexion is much clearer, smoother and radiant.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Its not an item that you can try and stretch its use from, because you are given a certain amount, and you use the number of pumps necessary to clean your face...</li>
            <li>I only use it during my morning shower and will use it more frequently (getting up, then going to bed) to see if it will help completely eliminate the pimples... but no promises with my oily skin!  </li>
            <li>I only need half a pump to wash my face and if your like me something about seeing a good lather</li>

            <li>If this is your skin type and you&#x27;re goal is to maintain clear skin that is balanced</li>
            <li>At 65 years old I find it</li>
            <li>And to my surprise it actually helps a lot, I&#x27;m very please with the product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Clinique is pricey of course, but if you want solid real results sometimes you have to suck it up and accept</li>
            <li>Such a lovely everyday cleanser for oily or combination skin.  </li>
            <li>MOST frustrating.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Not  that there is anything bad to say about Clinique product.  But I do like this better than the foam cleanser, I don&#x27;t think I use as much product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.  At 65 years old I find it Clem&#x27;s and refreshes without drying out my skin!</li>
            <li> Another stocking stuffer for my wife.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a problem with oily skin, every since I was a child. As an adult I&#x27;ve tried many products to help with oily skin. One day I was just browing thru amazon and came across Clinique Liquid Facial Soap Oil Skin and decided to give it a try. And to my surprise it actually helps a lot, I&#x27;m very please with the product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My wife reports in this time:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light, very refreshing product, no heavy perfume odor when you are done, which is a relief.It leaves you with a citrus-y like finish. Overall very effective product which does as it promises.Well worth the price through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good first step, Especially  you need to remove the day out of your face.</li>
            <li> works great with my skin</li>
            <li> For the price, this foamy soap is a great buy.  The liquid cleasning soap I usually buy is much more expensive, but its glycolic base is amazingly good.  However, when I decide to economize, I turn to Clinique.  It does an excellent job for a good price.</li>
            <li> I like it, my skin is easy to allergies, but this will not, and wash very clean.</li>
            <li> Its great just like I remember</li>
            <li> Why would anyone purchase this product from you for $32.99 when you can get it&lt;br /&gt;online at clinique.com or at a clinique counter for $15.99??&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE LADIES!!!</li>
            <li> I love keep my fave clean all day long  I use it 2 a day it&#x27;s all I need my skin looks good</li>
            <li> If this is your skin type and you&#x27;re goal is to maintain clear skin that is balanced this would be the product for you, of no I totally would recommend purchasing the moisturizing gel to go along with the usage of this product it seems rather incomplete unless you&#x27;re to yourself!</li>
            <li> I have bought bottle after bottle and tried many face washes. this is the first face wash ever to leave my face clear of acne. My complexion is much clearer, smoother and radiant. it does remove all dirt and makeup from face. I use the entire 3 step process as my face cleanser. Love this face wash!</li>
            <li> Entrega en tiempo establecido por el vendedor, producto nuevo y en perfecto estado y correctamente embalado. Compre con toda confianza</li>
            <li> Very good seller.I am really satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Works great great price</li>
            <li> lo recomiendo, son mis productos favoritos para el cuidado de mu cutis, estoy satisfecha con la compra, el precios es adecuado y estaba  mi alcance, en enezuela so costosos.</li>
            <li> e x c e l e n t  p r o d u c t</li>
            <li> I am a guy and I am 39 and I still get pimples... MOST frustrating.  I saw this in the shower because my wife uses it and she encouraged me to try it to help with the pimples.  Surprise, surprise when I find out it helped control the dang tumors that grow on my face!  I only use it during my morning shower and will use it more frequently (getting up, then going to bed) to see if it will help completely eliminate the pimples... but no promises with my oily skin!  Still, it greatly helped me!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT MY FIRST TIME BUYING FACEWASH, ITS RIDICULOUS, THERE IS SO MUCH WATER ADDED INTO THE FASEWASH, WTF!!!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME, THIS IS STUFF I PUT ON MY FACE NOT SOME RANDOM STUFF PEOPLE USE.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and this helps not to have the break outs and controls the oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NIce f light foaming action.</li>
            <li> Another Clinique product that I like a lot. It cleans my face really good and makes my skin looking young.</li>
            <li> This is the product I always use.</li>
            <li> Love this soap works great and smells wonderful</li>
            <li> I enjoy this facial soap, however it is not my favorite. It leaves my skin feeling quite dry. I have combination skin so I would only recommend to those who have no dryness whatsoever (the bottle says it is for combo-oily to oily). Other than the dryness, the soap does leave my skin very clean and indeed minimizes oil and shine. I will be trying a different formula next time if I decide to go with Clinique again (I am currently in love with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this is cheaper at Dillards.</li>
            <li> Very Good! good time, product was bought</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best of the best for cleaning your face.  I have only one complaint, it is a bit expensive and the costs add up if you use it regularly.  Its not an item that you can try and stretch its use from, because you are given a certain amount, and you use the number of pumps necessary to clean your face... One thing I found made the cost a little lighter on my wallet, I use to use 3 pumps to wash my face, and now I only use 2. I was over using the product before.... One pump is not enough.  Oh, and I have been using this for about 10 years, along with the moisturizing gel, and my hand to God, most people think I am around 23-25 years old, and I am almost 35.  I attribute that to the stuff I use on my face! TY</li>
            <li> Excelent product always use it and love it, leaves skin fresh and clean :)</li>
            <li> The top was defective and I had to use my older top to replace it was disappointing.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my wife and she likes the product and says it works effectively.</li>
            <li> Always satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite facial cleanser. It helps keep my facial oil to a minimum, and aids in future breakouts.</li>
            <li> Works well as a soap, no residue feel after rinsing. Love the Clinique brand.</li>
            <li> Looked just like it does in the store! I was afraid it would leak but it didn&#x27;t and it was packaged great!</li>
            <li> My skin is already cleared up after only a week of using. Clinique is pricey of course, but if you want solid real results sometimes you have to suck it up and accept it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily/combo skin, I use it twice daily followed with olay moisturizer. I also do weekly face steaming which is awesome and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Such a lovely everyday cleanser for oily or combination skin.  Never lets me down.  My skin feels great afterward and it&#x27;s not too drying like anything you&#x27;d by in the drugstore.</li>
            <li> recomiendo al 100% niveles altos de confiabilidad y responsable. . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> Pretty good, fully satisfied, the product was what I expected, I received exactly what I expected, i highly recommend, the product was received as was described.</li>
            <li> smooth and easy for use，the package to my home wasn&#x27;t very well,But I like Clinque and best wishes for U！</li>
            <li> Okay, so this is actually my second order.  I ordered the first bottle about two-weeks ago and immediately noticed the difference in my face and the amount of oil it produced.  I have really oily skin but since I am in my mid-forties I still have to avoid drying out my face so I went with the mild wash (just in case).  I absolutely LOVE it.  I only need half a pump to wash my face and if your like me something about seeing a good lather makes me feel better (this one delivers).  The problem with other face washes I&#x27;ve tried they either dry me out completely or they break me out by adding a bunch of additives. Either way in the two weeks I have used this product my skin feels softer, my pores seem smaller and believe it or not my face seems to be producing less oil.  I use this with step 2 astringent and just added the Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel.  I am truly going to be a repeat customer.  I will buy this for family and friends and recommend anyone to try it!  Will not be disappointed.</li>
