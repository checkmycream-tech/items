            <li>perfect to prevent any damage</li>
            <li>This spray is great to add memory to ayour hair and the fragrance is awesome.</li>
            <li>Great for flyaways and securing an updo with a flexible hold.  </li>
            <li>TIGI and bed head are great products.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering again!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived better than on time !!</li>
            <li>This spray  is very light and has a perfect hold.</li>
            <li>but it works and the price was amazing!</li>
            <li>This is the best hairspray ever, and I love the scent.</li>
            <li>The spray in and of itself is good, but the fragrance is nauseating.  </li>
            <li>I am SOOO glad they did!</li>
            <li>I also prefer my hair to move and be touchable while taming flyaways, so this is my favorite hairspray EVER!</li>
            <li>Will continue to purchase this product for sure!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is a great company to do business with - very fast and courteous service selling great products.</li>
            <li>Amazing hairspray.</li>
            <li>My husband loves the scent and is always hugging me to get a nice wiff...</li>
            <li>I think this looks even better in conjunction with a nice textured hair cut and salt spray for that wavy look.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and it feels soo light!</li>
            <li>It has been my favorite for over 10 years</li>
            <li>ro buying more from here.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this hairspray ...</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I truly love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>Best advice; use short bursts.</li>
            <li>If I can get a bottle with a nozzle that doesn&#x27;t clog every other time I use it, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>I have run it under hot water and cleaned the head of it more times than you ever should need too!</li>
            <li>I first learned about these TIGI products by going to Toni and Guy salons and loving the finished look they created.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get a full bottle&#x27;s use if I do it that way.</li>
            <li>Anyway, Tigi&#x27;s  Catwalk Session Series hairspray mist is fine, and sprays evenly without stickiness.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic hairspring but both of the cans I ordered clogged and I couldn&#x27;t fix either can.</li>
            <li>This is such a great price for it.</li>
            <li>The floral scent may not be to some people&#x27;s liking, but I enjoy it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The floral scent may not be to some people&#x27;s liking, but I enjoy it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!)</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this product - Catwalk is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>it seems a little strong at first;, but, it fades and leaves the hair smelling wonderful for the rest of the day!</li>
            <li>I was completely out and didn&#x27;t have the means to go on a hairspray-hunting mission (it would&#x27;ve cost more than the hairspray is worth in fuel! :</li>
            <li>The only thing is the spray will get clogged over time which redirects the spray of the hairspray but a quick run under warm water fixes the problem.  </li>
            <li>I keep them clean and unclogged with hot water, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.</li>
            <li>A great finishing spray that holds firm and well without looking like you put hairspray on.  </li>
            <li>My favorite hairspray by far.  </li>
            <li>It brushes right out at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>that was a nice surprise as I really didn&#x27;t expect to get my money back.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>One thing, the sprayer tip can clog, so I run it under hot water after every spray.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>can that will not spray for more than a second before clogging.</li>
            <li>Sure can&#x27;t cut open the can to get the produce out, so it&#x27;s a loss.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It shipped fast, works great, holds without making your hair too hard or crinkly</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair so most products make it look gross even if it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair in place much longer than smell lasts.</li>
            <li>I double-checked my order against the packing slip, since I was getting ready to contact the Seller to return the two tins for which I did not pay/order.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use hairspray nearly as much as I used to -</li>
            <li>really like this hairspray</li>
            <li>Shipping cost as much as the spray can did.</li>
            <li>Finishing Hairspray - spending more than I normally would for a single tin</li>
            <li>- you know the kind where if you get caught in a gale, suddenly your hair looks like broken airplane wings for the rest of the day ...and, if you get caught in drizzle, it becomes \\&quot;super glue\\&quot;?!  </li>
            <li>but the hair spray won&#x27;t spray normally.</li>
            <li>I am kind of upset because I am in desperate need of hair spray and this is the only kind I like.</li>
            <li>: It has been long-lasting, - I just finished the first tin a couple of days ago, and have only just started using the second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you have to periodically clean it, especially if you try and put the cap back on</li>
            <li>Favorite hairspray, I have a hard time finding it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to keep re-spraying my hair, because, even as the hairspray naturally \\&quot;fades\\&quot; throughout the day, my style holds and does not flop .&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves hair soft and touchable, and my husband likes how it smells.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle/can of it, but the first time I have such a horrendous issue with the can itself.</li>
            <li>In other words, don&#x27;t hold down the top while applying</li>
            <li>It takes just a moment or two to dry, and it brushes out VERY easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like Catwalk by TIGI products; even, though I actually ordered only ONE Session Series</li>
            <li>It drys quickly and does not make your hair stiff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not generally someone who likes a lot if product in her hair as it&#x27;s quite long and gets weighed down easily.</li>

            <li> Finicky of Hairspray Land\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to tight finances, I normally buy hairspray at WalMart.  </li>

            <li> Unfortunately, the item arrived damaged</li>
            <li> Too bad they discontinued it.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed because this is very expensive hairspray and now it is trash.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, used spray one time and then it quit working.</li>
            <li> The aresol can is crap!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fantastic hairspring but both of the cans I ordered clogged and I couldn&#x27;t fix either can. The seller would not accept the 2nd clogged can for return/replacement as 30-days had elapsed.  Tigi needs to totally redesign this looser of a spray can.  Both cans went into the garbage.</li>
            <li> Holding power without stiffness. Would give product 5 stars but don&#x27;t like the smell. Keeps hair in place much longer than smell lasts.</li>
            <li> This is the best styling hair spray I have ever used.  It has been my favorite for over 10 years and I have tried others during this time just to compare.  None come even close.</li>
            <li> Amazing hairspray. Bought it at a salon for over double the price before I found it on Amazon. Gives you hold without being sticky or making your hair look &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;. I have blonde hair so most products make it look gross even if it&#x27;s clean. A must buy!</li>
            <li> the nozzle was damaged and I cannot use it</li>
            <li> My bottle was a little bent up,  but it works and the price was amazing! I look forward ro buying more from here.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray ever, and I love the scent. If I can get a bottle with a nozzle that doesn&#x27;t clog every other time I use it, it would be perfect. 5 stars for the hairspray, 0 stars for the nozzle.</li>
            <li> This spray  is very light and has a perfect hold. This is such a great price for it. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I really like Catwalk by TIGI products; even, though I actually ordered only ONE Session Series Finishing Hairspray - spending more than I normally would for a single tin - I received THREE!!! Woo-Hoo!!! I double-checked my order against the packing slip, since I was getting ready to contact the Seller to return the two tins for which I did not pay/order.  Ultimately, the Seller had sent me a BONUS extra two tins! :0) (THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!) I am SOOO glad they did! I LOVE this hairspray ...and this is coming from the \\&quot;Ms. Finicky of Hairspray Land\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to tight finances, I normally buy hairspray at WalMart.  However, my local store did not have either of the 3 sprays I can/will use: Dove, Suave, and Pantene - all flexible-hold formulas for wavy/curly hair.  I was completely out and didn&#x27;t have the means to go on a hairspray-hunting mission (it would&#x27;ve cost more than the hairspray is worth in fuel! :o0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use hairspray nearly as much as I used to - but, when I do, it HAS to be flexible, manageable hold, since I detest stiff, sticky hair - you know the kind where if you get caught in a gale, suddenly your hair looks like broken airplane wings for the rest of the day ...and, if you get caught in drizzle, it becomes \\&quot;super glue\\&quot;?!  Anyway, Tigi&#x27;s  Catwalk Session Series hairspray mist is fine, and sprays evenly without stickiness.  It takes just a moment or two to dry, and it brushes out VERY easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a workable hairspray, which means I can style with it - perhaps, it&#x27;s partly because of the benefits of having wavy hair with a low-maintenance, layered, longer style - I don&#x27;t have to keep re-spraying my hair, because, even as the hairspray naturally \\&quot;fades\\&quot; throughout the day, my style holds and does not flop .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: It has been long-lasting, - I just finished the first tin a couple of days ago, and have only just started using the second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the fragrance ...it seems a little strong at first;, but, it fades and leaves the hair smelling wonderful for the rest of the day! The floral scent may not be to some people&#x27;s liking, but I enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I would NOT recommend this to others is ...I&#x27;d be afraid it would be sold out the next time I need to repurchase!

            <li> Very disappointed, used spray one time and then it quit working. The spray would no longer come out.  I bought this product before and the same thing happened, thought it was just that bottle, but now after purchasing it again and the same thing I give up!.</li>
            <li> This hair spray is wonderful for keeping your hair in place.  It drys quickly and does not make your hair stiff.  It brushes right out at the end of the day.  One thing, the sprayer tip can clog, so I run it under hot water after every spray.</li>
            <li> really like this hairspray</li>
            <li> The spray in and of itself is good, but the fragrance is nauseating.  Gives me a headache.</li>
            <li> The aresol can is crap! It clogs ALL the time! I have run it under hot water and cleaned the head of it more times than you ever should need too! It went in the garbage!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s possible that the contents in the can was shaken on it&#x27;s travel here but the hair spray won&#x27;t spray normally. it sprays in a straight line and is impossible to use for its intended purpose. I am kind of upset because I am in desperate need of hair spray and this is the only kind I like.</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly and keeps your style in place without giving you helmet-head. Strength/hold-wise I&#x27;d rate this a 3. No foot-long Mohawks will be achieved with this hairspray. It&#x27;s not a super-glue mist that leaves your hair feeling crunchy. It leaves hair soft and touchable, and my husband likes how it smells. Bonus! I&#x27;m not generally someone who likes a lot if product in her hair as it&#x27;s quite long and gets weighed down easily. I also prefer my hair to move and be touchable while taming flyaways, so this is my favorite hairspray EVER!</li>
            <li> This spray wont let you down. This spray is great to add memory to ayour hair and the fragrance is awesome. My husband loves the scent and is always hugging me to get a nice wiff...Thanks!</li>
            <li> I would of given this 5 stars because I use this hair spray but saw the price on Amazon and went for it. Should of known something was up. Big dent in can and sprayer part is broken and I can&#x27;t use it. Shipping cost as much as the spray can did. 😡</li>
            <li> This is a great company to do business with - very fast and courteous service selling great products. They went above &amp; beyond for me!</li>
            <li> This hairspray smells absolutely amazing, lasts forever (a little goes a long way) and leaves my hair shiny and not super stiff. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I truly love this hairspray. This is my second bottle/can of it, but the first time I have such a horrendous issue with the can itself. I keep them clean and unclogged with hot water, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter. I have an over half-full can that will not spray for more than a second before clogging. I am so disappointed because this is very expensive hairspray and now it is trash. Sure can&#x27;t cut open the can to get the produce out, so it&#x27;s a loss.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product - Catwalk is one of my favorites. Unfortunately, the item arrived damaged so I didn&#x27;t get to use it. I did however get to smell it since the contents were all over the inside of the box, and it smells AWESOME!  But the seller refunded me immediately that was a nice surprise as I really didn&#x27;t expect to get my money back. So kudos to this seller for taking care of a customer - Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great for flyaways and securing an updo with a flexible hold.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a crispy look or white traces.  My favorite hairspray by far.  The best part is the smell of this product!  Its heavenly.  The only thing is the spray will get clogged over time which redirects the spray of the hairspray but a quick run under warm water fixes the problem.  Will continue to purchase this product for sure!</li>
            <li> A great finishing spray that holds firm and well without looking like you put hairspray on.  Only bad thing I&#x27;ve seen is the spray knob tends to klog up and you have to periodically clean it, especially if you try and put the cap back on (you will invariably activate the mechanism).  I first learned about these TIGI products by going to Toni and Guy salons and loving the finished look they created.  TIGI and bed head are great products.  I think this looks even better in conjunction with a nice textured hair cut and salt spray for that wavy look.</li>
            <li> Favorite hairspray, I have a hard time finding it. It shipped fast, works great, holds without making your hair too hard or crinkly</li>
            <li> Awesome Stuff! Seller sent in timely Manner!</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! I will be ordering again!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived better than on time !!&lt;br /&gt;Packaged perfect to prevent any damage</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff. Too bad they discontinued it. My guess is because after using the product for some time, the spray stops coming out, even after cleaning the sprayer. Best advice; use short bursts. I&#x27;m able to get a full bottle&#x27;s use if I do it that way. In other words, don&#x27;t hold down the top while applying</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells amazing and it feels soo light! Fast shipping!</li>
