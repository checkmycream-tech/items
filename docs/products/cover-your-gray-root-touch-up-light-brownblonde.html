            <li>It&#x27;s sensational!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good for the day.</li>
            <li>so it did not turn out as good as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>Did the trick for in-between appointments - love it!  </li>
            <li>good quick touch up product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying more...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>looks better when combed or rubbed through hair to avoid a creamy look.</li>
            <li>I was expecting an applicator more like a mascara or eyelash brush</li>
            <li>I love it and will always have this on hand.</li>
            <li>Okay product.  </li>
            <li>I had more luck with medium brown than with light brown.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, the color lasts, one swipe in the morning</li>
            <li>It works well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>You have to paint it on and it doesn&#x27;t go on that easy</li>
            <li>so you could lightly coat hair strands.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the way this was supposed to be applied &amp; it was way too light to a cover.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover anything and it leaves hair full of gunk.  </li>
            <li>Great product as long as you match the right color with your hair.  </li>
            <li>I am blond and it blends right in.</li>
            <li>This root touch-up is a fast solution</li>
            <li>I found it was too orange in colour and did not blend into my hair very well would not buy or reccommend</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Color is only good if your hair is pink.</li>
            <li>which, granted, was not so smart) applying it right before you need to walk out the door and suddenly realize it&#x27;s time for a touch up.  </li>
            <li>so it really fully covers the gray and looks natural.</li>
            <li>This Light Brown- Blonde, in my opinion, will only work for you if you have orange/reddish toned blonde/brown hair.  </li>
            <li>I will order again as I travel frequently and not always home to make timely appointments!  </li>

            <li> perhaps this could work for others, just not what I expected....too gooey and thick and not the right color choice for me</li>
            <li> Overall a disappointing product for me, but might work on a different color hair with a more patient hand.</li>
            <li> grey does not show.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stay in my hair very long.</li>
            <li> it has closed so into the trash it goes.  </li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s a small price to pay for that extra time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other stuff that works</li>
            <li> This product does not do what it advertises:  the applicator is not the standard mascara-style wand, so you rub the liquid onto your roots but it is gooey; the color is orangy on blond hair; once it dries, it&#x27;s rock hard.  </li>
            <li> I was not real confident in what I was doing</li>
            <li> Also, the sponge tip seemed odd; not sure how to describe it.  </li>
            <li> small amount in applicator, but does the job.  </li>
            <li> The product is too thick.</li>

            <li> This product works beautifully for me. Easy to use, the color lasts, one swipe in the morning and I&#x27;m good for the day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cover up also and this did not cover any gray either. Now I know that these kinds of product do not work. A lesson well learned</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Has a lot of pigment so it really fully covers the gray and looks natural. It doesn&#x27;t flake off hours later and it doesn&#x27;t get on your scalp like the sprays can.  I&#x27;m buying more...this is a must have!!!</li>
            <li> Covers well without waxy buildup</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I am blond and it blends right in. Now, doing touch-up dying can wait a while.</li>
            <li> deposits color.  looks better when combed or rubbed through hair to avoid a creamy look. good quick touch up product.</li>
            <li> This Light Brown- Blonde, in my opinion, will only work for you if you have orange/reddish toned blonde/brown hair.  It was so orangey, I can&#x27;t use this and the window to return it has closed so into the trash it goes.  If you decide to try one of these products, don&#x27;t do like I did (which, granted, was not so smart) applying it right before you need to walk out the door and suddenly realize it&#x27;s time for a touch up.  Skip it because if it doesn&#x27;t match, you have a blotch at your part line that stands out A LOT.  Also, the sponge tip seemed odd; not sure how to describe it.  I was expecting an applicator more like a mascara or eyelash brush so you could lightly coat hair strands.  This created glumped up spots that you had to sort of smear around. Overall a disappointing product for me, but might work on a different color hair with a more patient hand.</li>
            <li> This root touch-up is a fast solution&lt;br /&gt;to a comun problem. It saves time and&lt;br /&gt;the grey does not show.&lt;br /&gt;I would recomend it to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;B.Gancman</li>
            <li> I found it was too orange in colour and did not blend into my hair very well would not buy or reccommend</li>
            <li> Product is acceptable. Color is only good if your hair is pink.</li>
            <li> This product does not do what it advertises:  the applicator is not the standard mascara-style wand, so you rub the liquid onto your roots but it is gooey; the color is orangy on blond hair; once it dries, it&#x27;s rock hard.  Look for a different brand with a mascara wand!</li>
            <li> It works well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This gets me by a week or two longer between colors.  I have been showing all my friends who experience root growth.  You just put it in and it blends.  It&#x27;s sensational!  Plus it&#x27;s a small price to pay for that extra time.  I love it and will always have this on hand.</li>
            <li> The product is too thick. It won&#x27;t stay after you conb your hair. My hair is dack brown. It doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> small amount in applicator, but does the job.  blends well with hair color and gives hair that extra color needed as semi-perment colors start to fade - to survive until the next hair appointment.</li>
            <li> Okay product.  Didn&#x27;t stay in my hair very long.</li>
            <li> I would not try it again.  I was not real confident in what I was doing so it did not turn out as good as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Did the trick for in-between appointments - love it!  I will order again as I travel frequently and not always home to make timely appointments!  Thanks</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the way this was supposed to be applied &amp; it was way too light to a cover.</li>
            <li> Great product as long as you match the right color with your hair.  I had more luck with medium brown than with light brown.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover anything and it leaves hair full of gunk.  I&#x27;ve used other stuff that works but this isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li> perhaps this could work for others, just not what I expected....too gooey and thick and not the right color choice for me</li>
            <li> You have to paint it on and it doesn&#x27;t go on that easy</li>
