            <li>Works great and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>Nice size and like the softer push end for cuticles.</li>
            <li>Nice quality.</li>
            <li>Nice cuticle stick does the job well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s spectacular.</li>
            <li>Works well, no problems, it&#x27;s very comfortable and nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars instead of 1 because if it weren&#x27;t for the defect it seems like it would work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>As soon as I received this order I immediately tacked on 2 more to another</li>
            <li>I think the wood ones are better for your nails.</li>
            <li>use this for jamberry application and love it</li>
            <li>They do what they&#x27;re supposed to :)</li>
            <li>This cuticle pusher is an outstanding product.  </li>
            <li>Best and about the only one I could find for her.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much.  </li>
            <li>I can maneuver it quite easily.  </li>
            <li>It was delivered  very quickly.</li>
            <li>for the price this is a fine manicure tool.  </li>
            <li>Nice and gentle cuticle tool.</li>
            <li>Definitely cheap looking, like it came from the dollar store in a nail kit.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the word \\&quot;plastic\\&quot; detour you into thinking this is a cheap item.  </li>
            <li>First, I find that it is more comfortable than a metal cuticle pusher.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t apply my Incoco nail strips so smoothly and easily without this little beauty--Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>It is also very, very helpful in pushing down my Jamberry nail stickers - this does a nice job of helping me get a good seal, and you can apply a lot of pressure to it without feeling as though you are hurting the instrument or the nail.</li>
            <li>I have a metal one, BUT this is much more gentle.</li>
            <li>The rubber tip works great to gently push back the cuticles.</li>
            <li>I was buying this item because I recently tried Jamberry nails and wanted a nice cuticle pusher to use in the application process.</li>
            <li>Slightly larger tip which I liked.</li>
            <li>This seems to be good quality and includes the rubbery tip for cuticle pushing and the other end is pointed for cleaning, I think.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle on my cuticles.  </li>
            <li>I bought these to apply Jamberry manicures and they are so much better than the wooden ones.</li>
            <li>It is very well made!  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much Debra Lynn and Amazon!</li>
            <li>This one works very well!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I need it to do</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not worth my time to return it since I have a 7 month old baby and going to the post office would be a nightmare on a good day.</li>
            <li>Typically I would just use my finger nails to push back my cuticles but this is great.  </li>
            <li>nice little cuticle pusher</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and fits well in my hand.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>i used this to apply my jamberry nail wraps and it helped me to get a much smoother finish</li>
            <li>The soft plastic tip pushes cuticles back with more pliancy than metal or wood cuticle pushers.</li>
            <li>I am not very proactive about pretty nails, but when I developed severe spilling at my nail tips, I started using FlexiNail (love it).  </li>
            <li>This little tool is pretty cute.</li>
            <li>Nice little gadget!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The other sharp end is also good for clearing skin from under the nail, when paired with a chemical cuticle remover.</li>
            <li>Works well &amp; is lasting a long time :)</li>
            <li>My first time buying a cuticle pusher and I was a little skeptical because I have very sensitive cuticles but the tip on this is very soft and gentle on the cuticles and perfect for me!</li>
            <li>It is not too hard and does a fairly good job of pushing back the cuticle.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re worried about the same thing definitely give this a try, it&#x27;s very gentle and wont hurt your cuticles!</li>
            <li>This device gently pushes back cuticles.</li>
            <li>I hope it lasts for years like my old one did.</li>
            <li>We use the soft cuticle pushers in our custom picture framing shop when we are filling corners because we need something that does not scratch the surface of our frames and does not cost a lot of money.  </li>
            <li>The other end is useful for cleaning under the nail or around the cuticle edge.</li>
            <li>The crack makes it completely unusable in it&#x27;s current state even though it&#x27;s brand new.</li>
            <li>Just received this today, exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>This plastic doe foot is great for that - stiff enough to do the job but not harsh enough to scratch the nail or hurt the delicate cuticle border.</li>
            <li>The other side is sharp and you can use it for many different uses.  </li>
            <li>I mean, it works fine.</li>
            <li>the only 4 stars is because it is a bit on the cheap side and not sure how long it will last but was very inexpensive so......</li>
            <li>Works as should, and even like to help push cuticles back softly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like pink.</li>
            <li>Years ago I had a cuticle pusher like this with a soft rubbery tip and when it finally wore out I missed it.  </li>
            <li>This nail tool is NOT cheap looking as one debby-downer stated ;)</li>

            <li> This nail tool is NOT cheap looking as one debby-downer stated ;)</li>
            <li> The rubbery tip is soft enough and firm enough.  </li>
            <li> The only reason for not giving the highest rating is that for some very strange reason, they cannot be shipped to Alaska</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large enough to use easily and small enough that it&#x27;s inconvenient to store.</li>
            <li> I have wanted one of these for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked the sensation of pushing on my cuticles when I&#x27;ve had manicures at the salon, and this rubber pusher is much less uncomfortable than metal, and I would even go so far as to say that it might work better than its metal counterpart.</li>
            <li> It is firm enough to work well, yet soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t hurt delicate cuticles.</li>
            <li> roughly made.  </li>
            <li> The pusher part of this is a soft but sturdy rubber/plastic, not too sharp or hard.</li>
            <li> The plastic pink part is unaffected, but if you were to use the white pusher part it would fall off with any kind of pressure applied because the crack is at the very base (the area connecting it to the pink wand) and goes to over halfway through it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little less than 5 inches long total, not too soft or hard, but a rubbery firm end.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the $5 I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I plan to just suck it up and fix it with some either hot glue or crazy glue and hope that it works out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less harsh on my cuticles and doesn&#x27;t cause bleeding.</li>
            <li> This little tool is a must have if you are using gel-strip nails.</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little wider.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the end of this thing was round and pointed, but instead it&#x27;s sort of concave, and pointed.</li>
            <li> Quality doesn&#x27;t seem extremely heavy duty but definitely not cheap.</li>
            <li> I tried to find something like this in my local drug/big box stores, but everything is either metal or very over-done and complicated and expensive.  </li>
            <li> so it gives if u push too hard,</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s awful that they would package and ship such an obviously damaged product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product. I use this all the time, I&#x27;ve recently started using it to seal my Jamberry nails and it works wonderfully! I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> This little tool is a must have if you are using gel-strip nails. I couldn&#x27;t apply my Incoco nail strips so smoothly and easily without this little beauty--Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> I was buying this item because I recently tried Jamberry nails and wanted a nice cuticle pusher to use in the application process. I just received this in the mail and it, still in package, has a giant crack in the white rubber tip part! The plastic pink part is unaffected, but if you were to use the white pusher part it would fall off with any kind of pressure applied because the crack is at the very base (the area connecting it to the pink wand) and goes to over halfway through it. The crack makes it completely unusable in it&#x27;s current state even though it&#x27;s brand new. I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars instead of 1 because if it weren&#x27;t for the defect it seems like it would work wonderfully. It&#x27;s very sturdy and fits well in my hand. It&#x27;s not worth my time to return it since I have a 7 month old baby and going to the post office would be a nightmare on a good day. I plan to just suck it up and fix it with some either hot glue or crazy glue and hope that it works out but it&#x27;s awful that they would package and ship such an obviously damaged product.</li>
            <li> Bought this to make applying Jamberry nail wraps easier. Works great and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> I was hoping the end of this thing was round and pointed, but instead it&#x27;s sort of concave, and pointed. It still works for what I need, but I wish I would of known this before.</li>
            <li> I mean, it works fine. What else can you say about a cuticle pusher?</li>
            <li> Use this product every week, good quality and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Nice and gentle cuticle tool.</li>
            <li> Just received this today, exactly what I expected. Quality doesn&#x27;t seem extremely heavy duty but definitely not cheap.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t cut or do heavy cuticle pushing, but I do like to keep them neat with a gentle pushing. This plastic doe foot is great for that - stiff enough to do the job but not harsh enough to scratch the nail or hurt the delicate cuticle border. The other sharp end is also good for clearing skin from under the nail, when paired with a chemical cuticle remover.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received this order I immediately tacked on 2 more to another I loved it so much.  Having only 1 usable hand I can maneuver it quite easily.  This nail tool is NOT cheap looking as one debby-downer stated ;) LOL&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;S ONLY, no cons.</li>
            <li> Nice size and like the softer push end for cuticles.</li>
            <li> Typically I would just use my finger nails to push back my cuticles but this is great.  The push tip is pliable so it gives if u push too hard,</li>
            <li> Nice quality. Slightly larger tip which I liked.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works well.</li>
            <li> I have wanted one of these for a long time. This one is perfect. It is firm enough to work well, yet soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t hurt delicate cuticles. It was delivered  very quickly.</li>
            <li> I thought I would save the planet by not buying disposable wood cuticle pushers.  This just doesn&#x27;t have the finesse of the wood ones - roughly made.  I think the wood ones are better for your nails.</li>
            <li> I bought these to apply Jamberry manicures and they are so much better than the wooden ones. I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Bought to help apply the jamberry nail stickers. Works as should, and even like to help push cuticles back softly.</li>
            <li> Great product came just a s described and just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Product is as stated and what I needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little less than 5 inches long total, not too soft or hard, but a rubbery firm end.  Nice little gadget!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pinker than it looked on my computer. I don&#x27;t really like pink.</li>
            <li> use this for jamberry application and love it</li>
            <li> nice little cuticle pusher</li>
            <li> Love it!  Perfect for sealing my Jamberry wraps!</li>
            <li> I use this work my Jamberry nails and love it! It&#x27;s much less harsh on my cuticles and doesn&#x27;t cause bleeding.</li>
            <li> Years ago I had a cuticle pusher like this with a soft rubbery tip and when it finally wore out I missed it.  When I thought about it I would look in stores for a replacement but I never found one.  Happily you can find about anything on Amazon.  The quality is good.  The rubbery tip is soft enough and firm enough.  I hope it lasts for years like my old one did.</li>
            <li> Works just as needed, no complaints here</li>
            <li> What can I say? They do what they&#x27;re supposed to :)</li>
            <li> I have a metal one, BUT this is much more gentle.</li>
            <li> We use the soft cuticle pushers in our custom picture framing shop when we are filling corners because we need something that does not scratch the surface of our frames and does not cost a lot of money.  These are the perfect tool!  The only reason for not giving the highest rating is that for some very strange reason, they cannot be shipped to Alaska so I have to ship to a family member who mails them to me.  It is a hassle for us all, and I cannot understand why this is done.  The postage would be the same no matter where it is going.</li>
            <li> The plastic and rubber parts are sturdy enough to work well but don&#x27;t scrape like metal. With cuticle removing lotion, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> helps for adhering Jamberry nail art</li>
            <li> Great cuticle pusher!</li>
            <li> My first time buying a cuticle pusher and I was a little skeptical because I have very sensitive cuticles but the tip on this is very soft and gentle on the cuticles and perfect for me! If you&#x27;re worried about the same thing definitely give this a try, it&#x27;s very gentle and wont hurt your cuticles!</li>
            <li> This seems to be good quality and includes the rubbery tip for cuticle pushing and the other end is pointed for cleaning, I think.  I tried to find something like this in my local drug/big box stores, but everything is either metal or very over-done and complicated and expensive.  This works perfectly (I use it to smooth my Jamberry nail wraps so they look great for over a week!).</li>
            <li> This cuticle pusher is an outstanding product.  It is very gentle on my cuticles.  This will be the cuticle pusher I use from now on!  I get the job done using this.  The other side is sharp and you can use it for many different uses.  Don&#x27;t let the word \\&quot;plastic\\&quot; detour you into thinking this is a cheap item.  It is very well made!  Thank you so much Debra Lynn and Amazon!</li>
            <li> This little tool is pretty cute. It&#x27;s large enough to use easily and small enough that it&#x27;s inconvenient to store. The soft plastic tip pushes cuticles back with more pliancy than metal or wood cuticle pushers.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.  Works well &amp; is lasting a long time :)</li>
            <li> Perfect for  putting on my Jamberry&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> for the price this is a fine manicure tool.  no complains.  does what i need it to do.  the only 4 stars is because it is a bit on the cheap side and not sure how long it will last but was very inexpensive so......</li>
            <li> I like the durability and softness of the plastic and rubber material. But I feel like it just doesn&#x27;t push back the cuticle as well as a traditional wooden orange stick. I&#x27;m going to stick with it, though and see if just takes my cuticles some time to adjust.</li>
            <li> This one works very well!</li>
            <li> The pusher part of this is a soft but sturdy rubber/plastic, not too sharp or hard. The other end is useful for cleaning under the nail or around the cuticle edge. It does exactly what I need it to do and it was a great price. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> Works great! My wife needed a rubber tipped Culticle tool for applying Nail decals and this does the job perfectly. Best and about the only one I could find for her.</li>
            <li> What I just received is an entirely different product.  The one that arrived is entirely metal.  I will be returning because this is not at all what was described.</li>
            <li> Nice cuticle stick does the job well. Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this product.  I purchase two. You can never have enough of nail products.</li>
            <li> Great price and works well to help me apply my Jamberry nail wraps. :)</li>
            <li> Works great! The rubber tip works great to gently push back the cuticles. Great deal for the price! Just wish it had a wider middle area to make it easier to hold on too.</li>
            <li> Works great for jamberries!!!</li>
            <li> Works well, no problems, it&#x27;s very comfortable and nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this rubber cuticle pusher for use with my Jamberry nail stickers. I love it. I couldn&#x27;t find it at the drug store and ordered it here - it&#x27;s spectacular. First, I find that it is more comfortable than a metal cuticle pusher. I&#x27;ve never liked the sensation of pushing on my cuticles when I&#x27;ve had manicures at the salon, and this rubber pusher is much less uncomfortable than metal, and I would even go so far as to say that it might work better than its metal counterpart. It is also very, very helpful in pushing down my Jamberry nail stickers - this does a nice job of helping me get a good seal, and you can apply a lot of pressure to it without feeling as though you are hurting the instrument or the nail. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i used this to apply my jamberry nail wraps and it helped me to get a much smoother finish</li>
