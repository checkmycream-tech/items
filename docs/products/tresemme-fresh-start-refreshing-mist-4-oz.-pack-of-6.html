            <li>So many friends use this too and look everywhere to buy it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have used it on my grand daughters hair to freshen up their braids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this freshening spray.</li>
            <li>So glad to know I can still get it anytime.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to know it was still available on line.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to carry in your purse or during travel.  </li>
            <li>I would use this spray and shake my hair around so the spray lightly got through the strands.</li>
            <li>and of course my wife is having a fit</li>
            <li>It removes all oder and leaves my hair fresh!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light, yet powerful at removing odor.</li>
            <li>Leaves a clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li>And it smells so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>That was lucky.</li>
            <li>I ordered two cases to make sure I had some till I found a new product...</li>
            <li>This exceeded my expectations and keeps my hair smelling fresh between washings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>; that always had me washing more frequently than I should have been.</li>
            <li>I really cannot say enough good about it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is affordable and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>it has a clean fresh scent and is not heavy.</li>
            <li>So sad they stopped making this product, it&#x27;s awesome!  </li>
            <li>I love it and definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li>It really works in these situations for controlling cigarette odors!</li>
            <li>Dove use to make a product such as this in spray bottle and discontinued many years ago.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was more like a dry shampoo, but it&#x27;s nothing like that.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li>I like being able to give my hair a little freshen up at any time.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li>Then I don&#x27;t have to shampoo with normal shampoo so often.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works a little better for me if I use it after applying dry shampoo, otherwise it can get a little heavy if too much is used - which is easy to do if you love the scent like I do.  </li>
            <li>I surprised at that and surprised they did not leak.  </li>
            <li>On no wash days I just spray after putting my hair up and let it air dry or spray all over hair and do a quick blow dry.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like dry shampoo that weighs my fine hair down.  </li>
            <li>I never knew about how to care for my naturally curly hair that I&#x27;m trying to grow long until about two years ago.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year.  I never knew about how to care for my naturally curly hair that I&#x27;m trying to grow long until about two years ago.

            <li> Great deal for a discontinued product!  I am now stocked for a while!</li>
            <li> This is like febreeze for your hair. I thought it was more like a dry shampoo, but it&#x27;s nothing like that. It only freshens the smell of your hair.</li>
            <li> This spray was amazing when I was smoking! I work in a dentist office and clise to patients. I would use this spray and shake my hair around so the spray lightly got through the strands. I even sprayed it on my clothes! It really works in these situations for controlling cigarette odors!</li>
            <li> I was looking for another (discontinued) product and found this. It works well to revive a hairstyle without completely starting over. Recommended.</li>
            <li> On no wash days I just spray after putting my hair up and let it air dry or spray all over hair and do a quick blow dry.  It removes all oder and leaves my hair fresh!  Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like dry shampoo that weighs my fine hair down.  Leaves a clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I like to use this with the Tresemme Waterless Foam Shampoo when I want to skip a day of washing my hair. It has a great scent and it is too bad that it is difficult to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why you can&#x27;t find this product in stores anymore. I started using it just to freshen my ha ir. But I have curley hair and  when I want to scrunch it this works great. Just spray all over scrunch it up and you&#x27;re ready to go. And it smells so fresh and clean. So glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love it, wish Tresemme still made it !!!! Please bring it back !!!! Wonderful on my hair and not stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> I cannot understand why they stopped making this. This stufff is really good. Great smelling for when skipping a day of hair-washing. So many friends use this too and look everywhere to buy it. I bought 12 bottles to share with them...</li>
            <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s light, smells great and makes my hair feel fresh. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It refreshes your hair--especially needed after strenuous workout, walking or running.  Also conditions while leaving a wonderful smell in your hair.  It also helps release the gunk (oils, hairsprays, etc.) that accumulate after daily styling.  I bought extra bottles and it&#x27;s easy to carry in your purse or during travel.  I have used it on my grand daughters hair to freshen up their braids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now.  This product has been discontinued in the stores that I previously shopped.  I was so glad to know it was still available on line.  Dove use to make a product such as this in spray bottle and discontinued many years ago.  Please, please bring it back on the market.  The price is affordable and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Hard to find these where I live anymore and of course my wife is having a fit so it was great to know I could find them for her online.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the excellent product!!! Can&#x27;t find this in Southern California anymore. I absolutely love this freshening spray. It&#x27;s so light, yet powerful at removing odor. So glad to know I can still get it anytime.</li>
