            <li>It stayed great.</li>
            <li>When I took my scarf off, my curls were still great.</li>
            <li>I could tell there was gel in there, but it was pleasant.</li>
            <li>It works best because it dries in seconds somehow on the hair, strong hold, and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li>But I think its still good without it.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with product.</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>The price is amazing</li>

            <li>This gel is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice product, keeps my hair in its place.</li>
            <li>This Gel is nice.  </li>
            <li>But MahoganyCurls on YouTube just made that gel seem too good to be true!</li>
            <li>This is excellent for defining my natural curl pattern and it doesn&#x27;t flake!  </li>
            <li>, I cannot respond truthfully to your question.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li>I love this gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my short hair.  </li>
            <li>May be better for chemically processed hair.</li>
            <li>Love, love this product.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you look at the size of the tubs you are buying.</li>
            <li>Added benefit of having no alcohol is even better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on my hair from strangers, many queries about the products I use, and a lot of disbelief when I say \\&quot;just gel.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>*: This gel used to cost $7.50 for a 3-pack; now the price has more than doubled.</li>
            <li>Ok, just had to add this.</li>
            <li>but I thought more weight would give the product a better chance of working with my hair.</li>
            <li>Plus if the Krystal- usually everyone&#x27;s harshest, hardest gel is this wonderful, I&#x27;m willing to bet they are ALL wonderful!</li>
            <li>Plus if the Krystal- usually everyone&#x27;s harshest, hardest gel is this wonderful, I&#x27;m willing to bet they are ALL wonderful!</li>
            <li>Alcohol free product with an okay fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love the original eco styler, but this one holds just as well.</li>
            <li>So I went about my day and let my hair dried and to my surprise, it was wonderful!!</li>
            <li>Original review</li>
            <li>And if you shop around, you can find some pretty sweet deals!</li>
            <li>However, it would have been great if they also packaged this in plastic tubes of less than 100gms or some sort of travel friendly pack.</li>
            <li>Although this product has good holding power, it leaves your hair feeling dry, brittle, and flaky.  </li>
            <li>The best part about it is that I&#x27;ve finally been able to achieve 2nd, 3rd and 4th day hair!</li>
            <li>Comparable in result to the Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curly Pudding (which is the best \\&quot;salon\\&quot; product I&#x27;ve tried), but SO much cheaper it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li>Maybe even better than the Krystal!(Free shipping on the Krystal swayed me away from the other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;) I can&#x27;t wait to try each and every one!!  </li>
            <li>The gel is exactly what I need for my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite brand and the only one I use.</li>
            <li>I use it on top of various leave-in conditioners.</li>
            <li>Krystal was not my first choice, so I was a bit frightened to use it.</li>
            <li>But anything makes my hair curly and nice when it&#x27;s WET.</li>
            <li>I have natural African American hair, a mix of kinks and curls, and have had it natural for 20 years or so; this gel is the best product I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried *everything* over the years.</li>
            <li>Great stuff natural African American hair.</li>
            <li>Spend a bit more money on a product that will hold your style, but benefit the health of your hair in the long run.  </li>
            <li>I used the smoothing method of applying this gel to my hair and almost instantly my curls started to clump and separate into beautiful little curls and waves.</li>
            <li>It holds down my 4a hair around the hairline and is a great holding product for doing two-strand twists and such.</li>
            <li>Maybe even better than the Krystal!(Free shipping on the Krystal swayed me away from the other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;) I can&#x27;t wait to try each and every</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>The real test was what will it look like when it DRIES.</li>
            <li>The gel when used alone can make my hair crunchy, but I just add a little coconut oil or extra olive oil first to make the style extra soft with excellent hold.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still not terrible for three large jars, but much more expensive than it used to be.</li>
            <li>Too bad--I won&#x27;t be buying from Amazon any more unless the price comes down.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>One day, I didn&#x27;t even put any oil on it, just a little water and went, still looked fabulous!</li>
            <li>One day, I didn&#x27;t even put any oil on it, just a little water and went, still looked fabulous!</li>
            <li>Amazon is great to get this since it&#x27;s difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li>Conditioner-washed and rinsed and my hair is soft and ready for the Eco Krystal gel.</li>
            <li>this is the only stuff strong enough to work for me.</li>
            <li>I have natural African-American/mixed mostly 3c hair, with a little 3b.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product if you are looking for something to style natural hair.</li>
            <li>It still looked great, there was only normal shrinkage, it wasn&#x27;t dry or excessively crunchy.  </li>
            <li>Love this Gel, no flakes, goes on well after hair is wet and holds for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can do better just buying multiples of the slightly smaller jars sold at the drugstore for less than $2 each.</li>
            <li>So much so, that I just ordered like 224 oz total of this stuff on here!!</li>
            <li>So much so, that I just ordered like 224 oz total of this stuff on here!!</li>
            <li>I have very curly color treated hair and was looking for a new gel that wouldn&#x27;t dry out or alter my haircolor.</li>
            <li>I used it the first time last week actually.</li>
            <li>... Make sure to keep the old jars or something to put your gel in just in case it comes broken.</li>
            <li>... Make sure to keep the old jars or something to put your gel in just in case it comes broken.</li>
            <li>There are no other drying or hair breakage issues.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Those who say this gel dries out your hair may have drier hair than I have (though my hair is pretty dry) or maybe have a different cleansing routine.</li>
            <li>A clear gel with a hold of TEN?!!  </li>
            <li>Only Gel I use, doesn&#x27;t cause any white fuzz, but still lasts pretty long</li>
            <li>I sometimes use some Carol&#x27;s Daughter Black Vanilla spray or Ojon revitalizing mist the next day just to refresh my style if I don&#x27;t feel like fully wetting my head again, but really just a bit of water rubbed over spots that have flattened out while sleeping, etc, has the same effect, especially if I&#x27;ve used enough gel the first day.</li>
            <li>All it takes for 2nd day hair (and so forth) is spritzing with a little water and adding a little more gel as needed for touch-ups each morning.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed by this product after all of the great reviews I read on curly forums.</li>
            <li>No frizz, a bit less shrinkage, and really shiny</li>
            <li>At this point in my life, with young kids and a busy career, I have pared things down to an extremely simple (and cheap) hair routine: conditioner-wash with a Suave product (usually Tropical Coconut) and then liberally apply this gel to wet hair while still in the shower.</li>
            <li>One the lid was broken, one the jar was cracked, but the rest were fine.</li>
            <li>One the lid was broken, one the jar was cracked, but the rest were fine.</li>

            <li> I have tried \\&quot;max hold\\&quot; versions of a bunch of other (expensive/popular) gels and they are not stiff enough to spike my hair.  </li>
            <li> You do have to be careful about what you use with this gel to keep white residue from forming in the hair.  </li>
            <li> and it lasts for a long time</li>
            <li> I was planning to try this product once my hair was longer, it&#x27;s shoulder length (stretched)</li>

            <li> dry hair.</li>
            <li> once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> My hair had movement, it didn&#x27;t take forever to dry either!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can leave hair a bit crunchy when it dries but a little conditioner mixed in takes care of that</li>
            <li> I find it tough to carry a whole 16 ounce jar for a 3 day business trip.</li>
            <li> Might try adding olive oil like other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> doesnt&#x27; smell like other gels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard this from other reviewers as well,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard this from other reviewers as well,</li>
            <li> I did my usual wash and over night conditioning treatment, then after rinsing my conditioner, I applied my Long Aid activator for moisture, as I&#x27;ve read and heard this gel can make your hair hard or dry if there&#x27;s not enough moisture underneath.</li>
            <li> I think one jar will last me a year at least.  </li>
            <li> They come sealed in a little green bag, so your gel shouldn&#x27;t end up all in the box.to dry either!!!  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>

            <li> I like the smell and consistency of this product.  It holds down my 4a hair around the hairline and is a great holding product for doing two-strand twists and such. The best part is hold without crunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 3 16oz at a great price!  I&#x27;m set for the summer and then some.</li>
            <li> The gel is exactly what I need for my hair. Alcohol free product with an okay fragrance. However, it would have been great if they also packaged this in plastic tubes of less than 100gms or some sort of travel friendly pack. I find it tough to carry a whole 16 ounce jar for a 3 day business trip.</li>
            <li> Great stuff natural African American hair. However it does flake if you use a lot and scratch though so use sparingly. Amazon is great to get this since it&#x27;s difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I love the original eco styler, but this one holds just as well. This is excellent for defining my natural curl pattern and it doesn&#x27;t flake!  You do have to be careful about what you use with this gel to keep white residue from forming in the hair.  The gel when used alone can make my hair crunchy, but I just add a little coconut oil or extra olive oil first to make the style extra soft with excellent hold.</li>
            <li> How I thought the product would have worked it did not. At least not for my hear type so, here I am stuck with three(3) jars of product.&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing to compare it to so, I cannot respond truthfully to your question.&lt;br /&gt;From watching a clip on the internet I was told to rub the product in my hear until it was saturated, and using a blow dryer with a diffuser attachment. dry hair.</li>
            <li> Love this Gel, no flakes, goes on well after hair is wet and holds for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this gel from now on!</li>
            <li> Nice product, keeps my hair in its place. Its so much product that I can now wash my hair everyday and not have to worry about running out, which takes care of the flacks issue.  There are no other drying or hair breakage issues.  Might try adding olive oil like other reviewers have mentioned. But I think its still good without it.</li>
            <li> I love this gel. It&#x27;s my favorite brand and the only one I use. Doesn&#x27;t leave white residue in my hair. The price is amazing and I love it! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, caucasian, and this is the only stuff strong enough to work for me. It works best because it dries in seconds somehow on the hair, strong hold, and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my short hair.  Enough hold without stiffness.  I think one jar will last me a year at least.  Disappointed that one of the 3 arrived cracked and haven&#x27;t had time to address the issue. Very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> Only Gel I use, doesn&#x27;t cause any white fuzz, but still lasts pretty long</li>
            <li> I tried this hair product as a cheaper alternative to Kinky Curly products.  There is no comparison.  Although this product has good holding power, it leaves your hair feeling dry, brittle, and flaky.  Spend a bit more money on a product that will hold your style, but benefit the health of your hair in the long run.  May be better for chemically processed hair.</li>
            <li> Love, love this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Its convenient to make all styles</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. No Flakes, comes out with water. Just make sure you look at the size of the tubs you are buying.</li>
            <li> This is the only inexpensive gel that works for short spikes (3/4 inch or less).  I have tried \\&quot;max hold\\&quot; versions of a bunch of other (expensive/popular) gels and they are not stiff enough to spike my hair.  Added benefit of having no alcohol is even better.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It works very well. doesnt&#x27; smell like other gels. and it lasts for a long time</li>
            <li> This Gel is nice.  I am going to also try the one with olive oil, or I might just add some olive oil to this one, as this one does everything it is supposed to do... It maintains moisture, which is what the African American hair needs.</li>
            <li> I have natural African-American/mixed mostly 3c hair, with a little 3b. I just had to come and review this product, because it has my curls looking how I&#x27;ve always wanted them to. No frizz, a bit less shrinkage, and really shiny once it&#x27;s dry. I use it on top of various leave-in conditioners. Haven&#x27;t noticed any flaking, and I&#x27;ve been using it liberally. The best part about it is that I&#x27;ve finally been able to achieve 2nd, 3rd and 4th day hair! (It could probably last longer, but I&#x27;ve decided to redo it for the holiday.) All it takes for 2nd day hair (and so forth) is spritzing with a little water and adding a little more gel as needed for touch-ups each morning. I&#x27;ve been wearing slightly messy up-dos with a few curls for bangs and some curls down on the sides, and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments each day. This gel is amazing. For the price, it truly can&#x27;t be beat. I only wish I&#x27;d started using it earlier.</li>
            <li> I have very curly color treated hair and was looking for a new gel that wouldn&#x27;t dry out or alter my haircolor. I was disappointed by this product after all of the great reviews I read on curly forums. This stuff is like water. It doesn&#x27;t hold or define my curls at all and it leaves my hair feeling a little hard.</li>
            <li> Works and doesn&#x27;t flake and for the price that&#x27;s awesome in my books. Can leave hair a bit crunchy when it dries but a little conditioner mixed in takes care of that</li>
            <li> I have natural African American hair, a mix of kinks and curls, and have had it natural for 20 years or so; this gel is the best product I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried *everything* over the years. At this point in my life, with young kids and a busy career, I have pared things down to an extremely simple (and cheap) hair routine: conditioner-wash with a Suave product (usually Tropical Coconut) and then liberally apply this gel to wet hair while still in the shower. I usually rub my gelled hair in circles to create a slightly \\&quot;knotty\\&quot; textured effect. This gel is the only product that holds my hair the way I like it, defines my curls, prevents frizz, and dries to a shiny, healthy-looking, not too crunchy finish. I get many compliments on my hair from strangers, many queries about the products I use, and a lot of disbelief when I say \\&quot;just gel.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who say this gel dries out your hair may have drier hair than I have (though my hair is pretty dry) or maybe have a different cleansing routine. Because I co-wash, my hair does not get dried out to begin with, and I don&#x27;t need a bunch of leave-in products to moisturize it. Conditioner-washed and rinsed and my hair is soft and ready for the Eco Krystal gel. I sometimes use some Carol&#x27;s Daughter Black Vanilla spray or Ojon revitalizing mist the next day just to refresh my style if I don&#x27;t feel like fully wetting my head again, but really just a bit of water rubbed over spots that have flattened out while sleeping, etc, has the same effect, especially if I&#x27;ve used enough gel the first day. Highly recommend this product if you are looking for something to style natural hair. Comparable in result to the Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curly Pudding (which is the best \\&quot;salon\\&quot; product I&#x27;ve tried), but SO much cheaper it&#x27;s ridiculous. I will never go back to pricier products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*: This gel used to cost $7.50 for a 3-pack; now the price has more than doubled. It&#x27;s still not terrible for three large jars, but much more expensive than it used to be. I can do better just buying multiples of the slightly smaller jars sold at the drugstore for less than $2 each. Too bad--I won&#x27;t be buying from Amazon any more unless the price comes down.</li>
            <li> *Original review below!*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited 6/9/17-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost 5 years later and I&#x27;m still coming back to this gel!! I try others, but this one is the best yet. And if you shop around, you can find some pretty sweet deals! Ok, just had to add this. 😜&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited FOREVER to try Eco Styler Gel and finally caved last week and decided to give it a shot. I was planning to try this product once my hair was longer, it&#x27;s shoulder length (stretched) now but I thought more weight would give the product a better chance of working with my hair. But MahoganyCurls on YouTube just made that gel seem too good to be true! So I took the plunge. I bought the Krystal from the local drugstore. Krystal was not my first choice, so I was a bit frightened to use it. A clear gel with a hold of TEN?!!  That is scary stuff. But it didn&#x27;t contain any alcohol and it was thick and rich like my Long Aid gel so since it didn&#x27;t FEEL like regular styling gel, I hoped it didn&#x27;t affect my hair like regular styling gel either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Anyway, I&#x27;m rambling. I used it the first time last week actually. I did my usual wash and over night conditioning treatment, then after rinsing my conditioner, I applied my Long Aid activator for moisture, as I&#x27;ve read and heard this gel can make your hair hard or dry if there&#x27;s not enough moisture underneath. I like to use clear things in my hair anyway, because creamy or white coloured things make my hair white and that just irks me terribly. I used the smoothing method of applying this gel to my hair and almost instantly my curls started to clump and separate into beautiful little curls and waves. But anything makes my hair curly and nice when it&#x27;s WET. The real test was what will it look like when it DRIES. So I went about my day and let my hair dried and to my surprise, it was wonderful!! It still looked great, there was only normal shrinkage, it wasn&#x27;t dry or excessively crunchy.  I could tell there was gel in there, but it was pleasant. My hair had movement, it didn&#x27;t take forever to dry either!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this was day one... What happens when I want to refresh? Yeah that&#x27;s when it all falls apart. Nope... It stayed great. When I took my scarf off, my curls were still great. I spritzed it with a little water and put some oil on it and that was IT!! I shook it out and my hair looked GREAT! And this went on all WEEK!! One day, I didn&#x27;t even put any oil on it, just a little water and went, still looked fabulous! I am hooked on this gel!! So much so, that I just ordered like 224 oz total of this stuff on here!! I got 4 32oz jars, and 6 16oz jars. I am stocking up!! LoL!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Plus if the Krystal- usually everyone&#x27;s harshest, hardest gel is this wonderful, I&#x27;m willing to bet they are ALL wonderful! Maybe even better than the Krystal!(Free shipping on the Krystal swayed me away from the other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;) I can&#x27;t wait to try each and every one!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Edit to add*:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  A couple of my jars were cracked. One the lid was broken, one the jar was cracked, but the rest were fine. I&#x27;ve heard this from other reviewers as well, so... Make sure to keep the old jars or something to put your gel in just in case it comes broken. They come sealed in a little green bag, so your gel shouldn&#x27;t end up all in the box.to dry either!!!

            <li> The best stuff.  Been using for over 10+ years. I have long thick hair and it&#x27;s the only thing that works.  No alcohol. No flakes.</li>
