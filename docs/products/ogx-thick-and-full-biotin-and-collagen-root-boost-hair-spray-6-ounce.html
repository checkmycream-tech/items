    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Does an excellent job of giving me volume and texture.</li>
            <li>All of Organix products have a wonderful smell, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome!</li>
            <li>I am happy with my purchase, and will order this product from Amazon.com again..</li>
            <li>its a great product to use I will recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li>Makes hair shiny and also smells great.</li>
            <li>For me this is the best product of this kind I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I use this together with my amplifying lotion, and the result is amazing!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>It honestly did nothing for my roots :</li>
            <li>yhid product is great and deliver exactly what it promises</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of the Organix/OGX product line, so was glad when they came out with products for volume!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I choose this rating because I love it</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but otherwise ok</li>
            <li>i okay.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the volume it provided</li>
            <li>I am fine and thin-haired, so I am always looking for hair products to give me volume.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and was looking for something that would add body and bounce to my hair, so tried this product.</li>
            <li>really does make your hair look fuller, have very fine hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t going to create huge hair for most people, but it&#x27;s great for adding body to limp hair!</li>
            <li>Spray on after shower, has a fresh, clean smell, and I enjoy the results..  </li>
            <li>It works better than the Aveda products for volume and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Works OK for lift at the roots, but tends to dry out my baby fine wavy hair.</li>
            <li>-I can understand it&#x27;s something to help create the volume, but the sprayer doesn&#x27;t seem to evenly distribute (and yes, I checked the head of it to make sure it wasn&#x27;t clogged, it actually spayed like this the very first time I used it)</li>
            <li>Good for everyday.  </li>
            <li>The first time was on dry hair and it took a while for it to dry, but once it did, it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly as promised and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>While this stuff smells nice, it almost has an odd texture to it</li>
            <li>It is the only product of this kind I will buy again, but that is a personal preference.</li>
            <li>I have thinning hair on top and it gives me just the right amount of boost for a little height.  </li>
            <li>It lasts most of the day (depending on how much I spray), and the smell beats any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Although this is billed as a lifter, I&#x27;ve found it actually gives me more texture than lift, so I not only spray it on my roots, but throughout my hair.  </li>
            <li>The second time was this morning on wet hair after washing it, and while I still have lots of body and texture, my hair kind of feels a little greasy, but I think that might be cause I conditioned my entire head instead of just my ends (I have very fine hair, but</li>
            <li>lots of it, so it gets weighed down and greasy easily)</li>
            <li>Not sure if it promotes growth, but a fresh clean smell.</li>
            <li>It does create good volume, and I use it in my daily arsenal in combination with a few other products.  </li>
            <li>It might be handy for those with thicker hair that are looking for a boost, but those with fine hair like myself may be disappointed.</li>
            <li>its just right for my hair- does not weigh it down</li>
            <li>First, it left my hair feeling very dry and straw-like.</li>
            <li>It has done wonders for improving the feel of my hair (makes mine soft instead of straw like) and it gives my curls extra bounce.  </li>
            <li>I think the other reviewers are absolutely correct about hair type and the results of this product.  </li>

            <li> Overall, it doesn&#x27;t really make my hair look any fuller, but gives it that weird, dry straw like texture.</li>
            <li> I have thin, straight hair with not much fullness.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, shoulder length hair and have become an expert in volumizing products over the past few years.  </li>
            <li> a little dry shampoo couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Third, my hair was dull instead of shiny.</li>
            <li> Even if the product had succeeded on the first three counts, I don&#x27;t think I would have kept using it because I hated the scent so much.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> 21$ i spent was wasted.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought multiple times since discovering this past summer, and plan to keep buying!</li>
            <li> Fourth, it smells awful - rather like a cheap musky perfume.</li>
            <li> When I see this happening, I take a break from using it for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Noticed a change to my hair after using for a few months</li>
            <li> Makes my hair a little hard to comb</li>
            <li> but unfortunately the price is not right.</li>
            <li> Sadly, my hair and this stuff are not a good match.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair, so I look for anything that will help give my hair a fuller look.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Hair looks sticky and greesy!</li>
            <li> It did not boost as advertised. And made my hair gummie. I did not like it and woukd not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair, so I look for anything that will help give my hair a fuller look. While this stuff smells nice, it almost has an odd texture to it-I can understand it&#x27;s something to help create the volume, but the sprayer doesn&#x27;t seem to evenly distribute (and yes, I checked the head of it to make sure it wasn&#x27;t clogged, it actually spayed like this the very first time I used it) so I just try to comb it through once I spray it on.Overall, it doesn&#x27;t really make my hair look any fuller, but gives it that weird, dry straw like texture. It might be handy for those with thicker hair that are looking for a boost, but those with fine hair like myself may be disappointed. I do give it three stars for the scent and that it does seem to &#x27;toughen&#x27; my hair a bit when I&#x27;m blow drying it, however.</li>
            <li> I think the other reviewers are absolutely correct about hair type and the results of this product.  It is a match for me.  I have coarse, thick, curly hair.

            <li> It honestly did nothing for my roots :c&lt;br /&gt;No volume or anything,&lt;br /&gt;it feels like that 21$ i spent was wasted.</li>
            <li> I like this product. Doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky or greasy looking. The product is exactly as promised and shipping was fast.</li>

            <li> really does make your hair look fuller, have very fine hair and this does the trick, looks like a lot of hair</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job of giving me volume and texture. I only wash my hair twice a week, so I&#x27;ve only used it twice since I&#x27;ve gotten it. The first time was on dry hair and it took a while for it to dry, but once it did, it worked beautifully. The second time was this morning on wet hair after washing it, and while I still have lots of body and texture, my hair kind of feels a little greasy, but I think that might be cause I conditioned my entire head instead of just my ends (I have very fine hair, but lots of it, so it gets weighed down and greasy easily) but it&#x27;s nothing  a little dry shampoo couldn&#x27;t fix.

            <li> use it all the time...its just right for my hair- does not weigh it down</li>
            <li> I am fine and thin-haired, so I am always looking for hair products to give me volume. This product definitely does - I spray on shower-damp hair and blow-dry, and the difference is noticeable instantly. It lasts most of the day (depending on how much I spray), and the smell beats any other product I&#x27;ve used. All of Organix products have a wonderful smell, in my opinion. My boyfriend loves to smell my hair now (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought multiple times since discovering this past summer, and plan to keep buying!</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, shoulder length hair and have become an expert in volumizing products over the past few years.  I&#x27;m a fan of the Organix/OGX product line, so was glad when they came out with products for volume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that volumizing products can give you volume in two ways, either as a lifting product or a texturizing product.  Although this is billed as a lifter, I&#x27;ve found it actually gives me more texture than lift, so I not only spray it on my roots, but throughout my hair.  It does create good volume, and I use it in my daily arsenal in combination with a few other products.  However, because it works by texturizing, I&#x27;ve found that over time, it tends to dry out my hair.  When I see this happening, I take a break from using it for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t going to create huge hair for most people, but it&#x27;s great for adding body to limp hair!</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this product.  Noticed a change to my hair after using for a few months</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because I love it I like that it was shipped on time its a great product to use I will recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> I have thin, straight hair with not much fullness. This product is awesome! Gives lift at the roots that lasts till bed time. It works better than the Aveda products for volume and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have thinning hair on top and it gives me just the right amount of boost for a little height.  Makes hair shiny and also smells great. I used to buy this at Walgreens but they no longer carry this product. I had this in my mail 3 days after ordering.</li>
            <li> Good for everyday.  Not sure if it promotes growth, but a fresh clean smell.</li>
            <li> For me this is the best product of this kind I have ever used. It is the only product of this kind I will buy again, but that is a personal preference.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair a little hard to comb but otherwise ok</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and was looking for something that would add body and bounce to my hair, so tried this product. Sadly, my hair and this stuff are not a good match. First, it left my hair feeling very dry and straw-like. Second, instead of bounce, I had stiffness. Third, my hair was dull instead of shiny. Fourth, it smells awful - rather like a cheap musky perfume. Even if the product had succeeded on the first three counts, I don&#x27;t think I would have kept using it because I hated the scent so much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it as well as the one I buy at Walmart, but i okay.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the volume it provided</li>
            <li> I love this!  Gives me body and height in my crown area!</li>
            <li> yhid product is great and deliver exactly what it promises but unfortunately the price is not right. It&#x27;s selling price is $5.74 elsewhere as oppose to the current price of $7.99</li>
            <li> Works OK for lift at the roots, but tends to dry out my baby fine wavy hair.</li>
