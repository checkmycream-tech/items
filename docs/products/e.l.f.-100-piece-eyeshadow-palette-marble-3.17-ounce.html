            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>but I love this!!</li>
            <li>Although there are still some very nice colors in this pallet, it&#x27;s not at all what I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li>I also bought a Shany palette and the colors in that are bright, beautiful and pigmented.</li>
            <li>The Pallette is great got here in before promised and it really good for beginning makeup users...</li>
            <li>It came in a week before it was suppose to, great shipping! :)</li>
            <li>So pleased, so impressed!!!!</li>
            <li>it was great for the price bought 2 for gifts and both people loved it ..</li>
            <li>Although the price is great, the pigment of the eyeshadows aren&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy :)</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the best quality eyeshadow of all time, but it is fairly well-pigmented and goes on excellently if you use a primer first.</li>
            <li>She loved it.</li>
            <li>I give this product 3 stars because it took a week longer to get here, but it works really good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product for the price.</li>
            <li>My friend has an elf eye shadow kit that is good</li>
            <li>i guess with a good primer</li>
            <li>and she loved it</li>
            <li>I read reviews and thought that it was going to come in not so good</li>
            <li>This is a good starter palette.</li>
            <li>but the pigment is good for the price.</li>
            <li>Mostly good.</li>
            <li>I used this on people who were going to prom and they all loved how the colors looked.</li>
            <li>For the price it is a good buy.</li>
            <li>These arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li>Love love love this eyeshadow!!!</li>
            <li>but i would also recommend a primer because with out one the colors fade EXTREMELY QUICK!!!</li>
            <li>and you will be happy too. :)</li>
            <li>So very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Great variety of colors and there are so many options.  </li>
            <li>This would be a great asset to most make-up kits.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to have so many colors so inexpensively.</li>
            <li>Nice colors, good pigmentation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a shimmer kind of person but the mattes on the palette are good.</li>

            <li>There are a lot of warm colors.</li>
            <li>Colors are nicely pigmented.</li>
            <li>We love the colors are perfect exactly as I wanted</li>
            <li>Perfect gift for my mom shipping was speedy, and colors are vibrant .</li>
            <li>I was very pleased and satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Perfect to have our own makeup kit without professional</li>
            <li>It wears fairly well and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>So if you have brushes that are good or can easily purchase some</li>
            <li>It has so many mate colors, I love it!</li>
            <li>I own 3 ELF pallettes and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love the bright vibrant colors and the pigmentation is great and it stays on FOREVER.</li>
            <li>Great color selection, but they aren&#x27;t very pigmented on their own.  </li>
            <li>Excellent price and such an amazing color choice.</li>
            <li>all the colors are ridiculously bright and true to what you see in the product image.</li>
            <li>The colors application is very light on you skin.</li>
            <li>looks good and the colors stay bold while on.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>There are beautiful neutral colors, matte and also vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>great variaty if colors and it stays in very niec using eye primer :) cant believe it was so cheap !</li>
            <li>you are looking for something to add a bit more pop to your eyes, this palette is for you.</li>
            <li>Love this Pallett.</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift for two of my grand daughters and they love</li>
            <li>This palette has the best colors and last literally all day with a primer underneath.</li>
            <li>:B001TK4LM8 NYX&#x27;s Jumbo Eye Pencil in Milk]] on top--</li>
            <li>I love this palette and it&#x27;s helped me come out of my shell</li>
            <li>The colors are much more muted than shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>but would have been much better if the colors were closer to the picture.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the color variety.</li>
            <li>and I love to blend with my eyeshadows and</li>
            <li>and I have so many options to choose from....</li>
            <li>I love the colors on this palette.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay because they&#x27;re EYE SHADOWS.</li>
            <li>I SAY BUY THIS LOVE</li>
            <li>but every time this top was cracked and even sometime the colors.</li>
            <li>the colors might pop more.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m satisfied ð</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t even used them I love the contrast and mix of all the colors</li>
            <li>am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>The colors are mostly browns, golds, and yellows.</li>
            <li>More colors than I will probably ever need</li>
            <li>but I love to have the options!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wish there wasn&#x27;t as many peach/pink</li>
            <li>I have been able to mix whatever color I&#x27;m in the mood for using this palette though.  </li>
            <li>Versatile and many colors.</li>
            <li>but, the times I have used it, I enjoyed the way the colors came together on my eyes.</li>
            <li>Lovely packaging</li>
            <li>Even though they&#x27;re smelly, I&#x27;m glad to have them -</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>This palette has a good degree of colours and is fun to play with.  </li>
            <li>If you are just getting into makeup or looking for something for a younger girl this could be perfect.  </li>
            <li>AND THEY WERE WAYYY BETTER THAN THIS PALLETTE.</li>
            <li>I love the colors.</li>
            <li>I was completely satisfied with this product and the delivery</li>
            <li>Some have a better affect than others.</li>
            <li>The color selection is very nice &amp; the price is incredibly reasonable.</li>
            <li>Super happy about the delivery being so quick.</li>
            <li>Love my pallet, price was good and the colors are very nice and stay on long.</li>
            <li>i have to use eye primer first, becuse its not the most pigmented eyeshadow, but its very very fine for the price!</li>
            <li>Some cool and some warm colors...</li>
            <li>This palette no only is in a beautiful selection, but it was also very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But top broke easily</li>
            <li>There are so many colors to choose from and they are easy to blend.</li>
            <li>In the picture it looks to be bright colors, but really it&#x27;s a lot of tans, cream colors.</li>
            <li>It exceeded my expectations and i have sensitive skin with no reaction from these powders, which is great.</li>
            <li>ELF is constantly surprising me with their high quality!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a lot of petrolatum in the formula, so there isn&#x27;t much fallout as they&#x27;re fairly creamy.</li>
            <li>The product came right on time and was nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>but most people use it in Original) then [[ASIN</li>
            <li>All the colors were bright and vibrant, none of the squares were cracked.</li>
            <li>so it is easy to carry around.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and the colors show up very well and it arrived safely with no broken colors.</li>
            <li>Not to strong but not too light.</li>
            <li>White eyeliner works great.</li>
            <li>The problem I&#x27;m having with them is that they are Nowhere near as bright as the image makes them seem.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it was e.l.f cosmetics and so cheap.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and stays on</li>
            <li>I liked that one so much that I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li>fantastic colours and pigment.</li>
            <li>They went on smoothly and none of the powder got on my face/everywhere.</li>
            <li>They go on smooth and if you use eyeshadow primer</li>
            <li>Lots of different colors to choose from and they are of great quality.</li>
            <li>Such a great product.</li>
            <li>Cheap quality</li>
            <li>Great for my teenage daughter.</li>
            <li>Affordable, and a great variety of colors for you to mix and match and create all different kinds of looks..</li>
            <li>I really enjoy all my colors I have.</li>
            <li>it is a cruelty free product that is affordable.</li>
            <li>It a great eyeshadow palette especially for makeup beginners.</li>
            <li>She will enjoy .</li>
            <li>It is light weight</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Great quality and it lasted for an entire night of dancing and drinking without smearing or wearing off(all over my face).</li>
            <li>I USE THE URBAN DECAY EYE SHADOW PRIMER WHICH IS GREAT .</li>
            <li>I decided to go cheap in price just in case</li>
            <li>Many eyeshadow palattes are nothing but shimmer, this palatte offers a nice variety</li>
            <li>The pigment is not as strong as some of your higher quality shadows (like MAC)....with that being said, just add another layer of color to darken it :)</li>
            <li>I love how this has tons of neutrals for everyday looks but the colors in it are also absolutely beautiful.</li>
            <li>and i was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I dont think it is a original product.</li>
            <li>I love this SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>My original reasoning for purchase.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of orangey colors and greens but for the most part they all stay on and are pretty pigmented.</li>
            <li>Overall an amazing product for women just looking to get lots of variety for their eyes and inspiring make-up artist</li>
            <li>I now use the nudes and Browns for every day wear and am sure that the brighter colors will come in handy in the future for Halloween costumes.</li>
            <li>The selection is endless and beautiful.</li>
            <li>but I like that because if I want a lighter color thats not in the pallet, I have it right at my fingertips!</li>
            <li>Just right all colors needed!</li>
            <li>I needed blues and grays to complete the look and they were vibrant and sparkly and looked great.</li>
            <li>Its affordable,  and is very pigmented, I couldnt ask for more.</li>
            <li>I think it is a good basic set.</li>
            <li>The colors are cheap looking and don&#x27;t look quite right once applied.</li>
            <li>real great price for such a big amount of eye shadows...</li>
            <li>At first glance the price was so cheap that I almost did not want to buy it.</li>
            <li>colors good, do not stay on long.</li>
            <li>Blends wonderfully and lasts such a long time.</li>
            <li>Perfect, Last long as well the colors are to die for</li>
            <li>, I was able to actually apply the makeup, and it was very smooth and very vibrant in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They went on my eyelids perfectly and blending them wasn&#x27;t tough.</li>
            <li>Best ten dollars I ever spent</li>
            <li>It was worth my money</li>
            <li>so all eyeshadow is pretty awesome and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Those are pretty cool.</li>
            <li>but well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This pallet is worth every cent I paid.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fun experimenting with this palette when I am coming up with look ideas,</li>
            <li>Have Fun</li>
            <li>Shippig Was SUPER FAST</li>
            <li>Of course, I didn&#x27;t expect a great quality because of the price, but I&#x27;m kind of disappointing.</li>
            <li>It got here very fast.</li>
            <li>My little sister loved it when I gave it to her for Christmas.</li>
            <li>In fact, they come across more as muted and natural tones instead of the vibrant colors portrayed in the picture.</li>
            <li>a beginner in the world of makeup, and only being able to use my fingers (because I didn&#x27;t get my brushes in time for the event)</li>
            <li>It arrived exactly on time</li>
            <li>With these three combined I can do so many different looks and</li>
            <li>I love to play with different colors</li>
            <li>Because my sister has the first one that came out</li>
            <li>Plenty of colors some have better pigmentation than others but for the price it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t you still should buy it but be aware of the brushes.</li>
            <li>Not too sure how it last without the primer.</li>
            <li>I love the colors I just wish there was a red in it</li>
            <li>This pallete has quite a selection of colors but many of them look very similar when applied to the eyelid.</li>
            <li>You do you to load on the colors for higher pigmentation</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I love all the colors they just take several layers to achieve the look I want.</li>
            <li>I should be able to mix anything I need to supplement my usual, more neutral eye shadows.</li>
            <li>I ordered another e.l.f. 100 piece eyeshadow palette a few months ago and loved that one</li>
            <li>and the colors are great but be sure to have a good base when applying them so that the colors last.</li>
            <li>I love having such a large selection to choose from.</li>
            <li>Other than that the colors are really nice.....</li>
            <li>Very nice colors I enjoy using this palette and Can&#x27;t wait to buy a second one small mirror and brushes come with it</li>
            <li>but you have to use so much product in order to see it you use the colors  very  fast.</li>
            <li>So, so worth the price, but again I highly recommend the UD primer potion and NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really expect it to be, applying primer really helps though!</li>
            <li>It does not flake off too much; so lasts pretty well.  </li>
            <li>the color are really pretty but not all of them are very opaque but</li>
            <li>The colors are very vibrant and shimmery.  </li>
            <li>This is a fairly large palette with a large variety of colors.  </li>
            <li>The colors are chalky and some aren&#x27;t very pigmented by themselves, BUT if you invest in a few more products you&#x27;re still saving money by going with e.l.f.!</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and show up on your face and eyelids exactly how they are in the palate.</li>
            <li>This is a great little palette for someone who likes to wear a variety of different colors.</li>
            <li>I literally sat in my room all day and stared at the colors for 2 hours because I really like this palette.</li>
            <li>These eye shadows are very powdery.</li>
            <li>The palette is ridiculously cheap and has such a variety of colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not into eyeshadow, so i use it on my clients, and it really works well.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a beginner palette and want a whole variety of colors, this does the job for the price.</li>
            <li>But I also bought a separate brush kit because the brushes don&#x27;t really work that well.</li>
            <li>SOOOO MUCH</li>
            <li>shipped really fast</li>
            <li>they were very pigminted</li>
            <li>They refunded me my money and were very gracious about it.  </li>
            <li>Again thank you so much for the immediate response.</li>
            <li>It even has mixed colors, like silver/black, light brown/dark brown, etc, which I&#x27;ve never seen before.</li>
            <li>so i didnt want to spend much thinking bout getting one for myself for when i take vacations</li>
            <li>but I really like &amp; want to keep this palette</li>
            <li>This is a Real elf palette and the shimmery colors are very pigmented</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>This palette is very well priced for the quality.</li>
            <li>and these shadows are very noticeable.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t expect much because of the price</li>
            <li>The price was great, none of them were broken, and they work well.</li>
            <li>AND IT WAS VERY INEXSPESIVE</li>
            <li>I found that there wasn&#x27;t too much pigment in the colors</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>And since the cost is only $10 with free shipping if you are a prime member,it is actually cheaper than many single shade eyeshadow and certainly cheaper than most compacts with only two or three colors.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this palette and want the colors to be as bright as they&#x27;re supposed to look, definitely get the NYX eye pencil and the UD primer and all the problems other users have mentioned about lack of pigmentation and chalkiness will disappear.</li>
            <li>The color is not too pigmented, which is okay because you can apply layers if you need a more dramatic effect.</li>
            <li>I thought there was going to be more pinks, purples and other colors.</li>
            <li>I had gotten it because it was cheap and didn&#x27;t expect it to be of such high quality.</li>
            <li>I use ELF alot, also use lorac and other more high end products.</li>
            <li>I found that the colors are not bold or bright enough for my liking.  </li>
            <li>and I got a pallet full of only browns....</li>
            <li>So this thing is HUGE, I&#x27;ve never played around much with make-up but really wanted to try some more dramatic eye looks..</li>
            <li>The color goes on and stays vibrant.</li>
            <li>they look really vibrant.</li>
            <li>Colors werent as vibrant and didnt saturate as well as I needed them too.</li>
            <li>Glittery, Matte, Vibrant or Muted.  </li>
            <li>The set I&#x27;d large and there are so many shades and combinations that it will definitely last a long time.</li>
            <li>Only one shadow was missing and to me it wasn&#x27;t a big deal since it was more of a very light tanish color.</li>
            <li>Application is a little light, you really have to load it on, but lots of fun for play and for young girls.</li>
            <li>but I found a palette in store that had more of the shades I wanted and a little cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Also the application is very light and doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>The ones I&#x27;ve tried so far have decent pigmentation.</li>
            <li>My palette came with the silver tone at the top right broken.  </li>
            <li>Especially when looking for higher pigmentation.</li>
            <li>wasnt too sure about ordering it because i havnt cared for elf in the past</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get a chance to use it off because I&#x27;m not one to put on makeup when its really hot outside</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that anyone looking for good eyeshadow buys this over the expensive name brands.</li>
            <li>All the colors work, none fall out, not a big mess, super laid back and easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it is quite large, not deep,</li>
            <li>Just use white on your eyelid before to really make it pop.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 17 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>There are enough colors that anyone should be able to find at least a few that they absolutely love.</li>
            <li>I think I will get the natural palette</li>
            <li>Goes on seamlessly.</li>
            <li>was surprised by this one...</li>
            <li>The colours actually stay on and you don&#x27;t have to apply much to see the colours.</li>
            <li>Its mediocre, seems like something my 9 year old cousin could have more fun with</li>
            <li>It was well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>I did recently drop it on the floor in the bathroom which dislodged a few colors, but I love it.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried about the size and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I just received these shadows and they are decent enough.</li>
            <li>I had bought a smaller palette last year for a friend who was getting married and needed some eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Not a bad little palette.  </li>
            <li>I bought this palette for my niece and there are NO PINK colors like shown in the picture!!</li>
            <li>no broken shadow .. the colors really well pigmented, vibrant green like blue ..</li>
            <li>The elf palette looks dull and the colors are not bright and beautiful like they are portrayed in the picture.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a new one on elf page, a BIG difference.</li>
            <li>I made the decision to step outside my comfort zone and explore new eyeshadow colors.</li>
            <li>and it was super messy when I opened the package...</li>
            <li>I have no regrets with this purchase</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;be only used a couple colors, but they are fantastically colored!  </li>
            <li>Seems like it could be a little &amp;#34;dusty&amp;#34; but if you apply it right, shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.  </li>
            <li>I would totally recommend this to other beginners like me who have no idea what colors they want, and I&#x27;m not sorry I purchased it.</li>
            <li>well mainly, one of the squares was missing its the second one down from the top left so from looking at the picture its an off white so not really a big deal</li>
            <li>The case isn&#x27;t the strongest, the lid to exact is a little flimsy</li>
            <li>I wanted all the colors but its very hard to apply it, once you put it on and start to blend it, it pretty much blends away</li>
            <li>love the pallet i received it with a few colors mixed tho none were broken and very pigment colors last about 8 hours</li>
            <li>Really descent, not super pigmented but it&#x27;s something a white crayon can fix</li>

            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> but I love this!!</li>
            <li> Although there are still some very nice colors in this pallet, it&#x27;s not at all what I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li> I also bought a Shany palette and the colors in that are bright, beautiful and pigmented.</li>
            <li> The Pallette is great got here in before promised and it really good for beginning makeup users...</li>
            <li> It came in a week before it was suppose to, great shipping! :)</li>
            <li> So pleased, so impressed!!!!</li>
            <li> it was great for the price bought 2 for gifts and both people loved it ..</li>
            <li> Although the price is great, the pigment of the eyeshadows aren&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy :)</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the best quality eyeshadow of all time, but it is fairly well-pigmented and goes on excellently if you use a primer first.</li>
            <li> She loved it.</li>
            <li> I give this product 3 stars because it took a week longer to get here, but it works really good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> My friend has an elf eye shadow kit that is good</li>
            <li> i guess with a good primer</li>
            <li> and she loved it</li>
            <li> I read reviews and thought that it was going to come in not so good</li>
            <li> This is a good starter palette.</li>
            <li> but the pigment is good for the price.</li>
            <li> Mostly good.</li>
            <li> I used this on people who were going to prom and they all loved how the colors looked.</li>
            <li> For the price it is a good buy.</li>
            <li> These arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> Love love love this eyeshadow!!!</li>
            <li> but i would also recommend a primer because with out one the colors fade EXTREMELY QUICK!!!</li>
            <li> and you will be happy too. :)</li>
            <li> So very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great variety of colors and there are so many options.  </li>
            <li> This would be a great asset to most make-up kits.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to have so many colors so inexpensively.</li>
            <li> Nice colors, good pigmentation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a shimmer kind of person but the mattes on the palette are good.</li>

            <li> Perfect to have our own makeup kit without professional</li>
            <li> It wears fairly well and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> So if you have brushes that are good or can easily purchase some</li>
            <li> It has so many mate colors, I love it!</li>
            <li> I own 3 ELF pallettes and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love the bright vibrant colors and the pigmentation is great and it stays on FOREVER.</li>
            <li> Great color selection, but they aren&#x27;t very pigmented on their own.  </li>
            <li> Excellent price and such an amazing color choice.</li>
            <li> all the colors are ridiculously bright and true to what you see in the product image.</li>
            <li> The colors application is very light on you skin.</li>
            <li> looks good and the colors stay bold while on.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>

            <li> and I have so many options to choose from....</li>
            <li> I love the colors on this palette.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay because they&#x27;re EYE SHADOWS.</li>
            <li> I SAY BUY THIS LOVE</li>
            <li> but every time this top was cracked and even sometime the colors.</li>
            <li> the colors might pop more.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m satisfied ð</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t even used them I love the contrast and mix of all the colors</li>
            <li> am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> The colors are mostly browns, golds, and yellows.</li>
            <li> More colors than I will probably ever need</li>
            <li> but I love to have the options!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wish there wasn&#x27;t as many peach/pink</li>
            <li> I have been able to mix whatever color I&#x27;m in the mood for using this palette though.  </li>
            <li> Versatile and many colors.</li>
            <li> but, the times I have used it, I enjoyed the way the colors came together on my eyes.</li>
            <li> Lovely packaging</li>
            <li> Even though they&#x27;re smelly, I&#x27;m glad to have them -</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.</li>
            <li> This palette has a good degree of colours and is fun to play with.  </li>
            <li> If you are just getting into makeup or looking for something for a younger girl this could be perfect.  </li>
            <li> AND THEY WERE WAYYY BETTER THAN THIS PALLETTE.</li>
            <li> I love the colors.</li>
            <li> I was completely satisfied with this product and the delivery</li>
            <li> Some have a better affect than others.</li>
            <li> The color selection is very nice &amp; the price is incredibly reasonable.</li>
            <li> Super happy about the delivery being so quick.</li>
            <li> Love my pallet, price was good and the colors are very nice and stay on long.</li>
            <li> i have to use eye primer first, becuse its not the most pigmented eyeshadow, but its very very fine for the price!</li>
            <li> Some cool and some warm colors...</li>
            <li> This palette no only is in a beautiful selection, but it was also very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But top broke easily</li>
            <li> There are so many colors to choose from and they are easy to blend.</li>
            <li> In the picture it looks to be bright colors, but really it&#x27;s a lot of tans, cream colors.</li>
            <li> It exceeded my expectations and i have sensitive skin with no reaction from these powders, which is great.</li>
            <li> ELF is constantly surprising me with their high quality!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of petrolatum in the formula, so there isn&#x27;t much fallout as they&#x27;re fairly creamy.</li>
            <li> The product came right on time and was nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> but most people use it in Original) then [[ASIN</li>
            <li> All the colors were bright and vibrant, none of the squares were cracked.</li>
            <li> so it is easy to carry around.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and the colors show up very well and it arrived safely with no broken colors.</li>
            <li> Not to strong but not too light.</li>
            <li> White eyeliner works great.</li>
            <li> The problem I&#x27;m having with them is that they are Nowhere near as bright as the image makes them seem.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it was e.l.f cosmetics and so cheap.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and stays on</li>
            <li> I liked that one so much that I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> fantastic colours and pigment.</li>
            <li> They went on smoothly and none of the powder got on my face/everywhere.</li>
            <li> They go on smooth and if you use eyeshadow primer</li>
            <li> Lots of different colors to choose from and they are of great quality.</li>
            <li> Such a great product.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality</li>
            <li> Great for my teenage daughter.</li>
            <li> Affordable, and a great variety of colors for you to mix and match and create all different kinds of looks..</li>
            <li> I really enjoy all my colors I have.</li>
            <li> it is a cruelty free product that is affordable.</li>
            <li> It a great eyeshadow palette especially for makeup beginners.</li>
            <li> She will enjoy .</li>
            <li> It is light weight</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Great quality and it lasted for an entire night of dancing and drinking without smearing or wearing off(all over my face).</li>
            <li> I USE THE URBAN DECAY EYE SHADOW PRIMER WHICH IS GREAT .</li>
            <li> I decided to go cheap in price just in case</li>
            <li> Many eyeshadow palattes are nothing but shimmer, this palatte offers a nice variety</li>
            <li> The pigment is not as strong as some of your higher quality shadows (like MAC)....with that being said, just add another layer of color to darken it :)</li>
            <li> I love how this has tons of neutrals for everyday looks but the colors in it are also absolutely beautiful.</li>
            <li> and i was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I dont think it is a original product.</li>
            <li> I love this SO MUCH!</li>
            <li> My original reasoning for purchase.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of orangey colors and greens but for the most part they all stay on and are pretty pigmented.</li>
            <li> Overall an amazing product for women just looking to get lots of variety for their eyes and inspiring make-up artist</li>
            <li> I now use the nudes and Browns for every day wear and am sure that the brighter colors will come in handy in the future for Halloween costumes.</li>
            <li> The selection is endless and beautiful.</li>
            <li> but I like that because if I want a lighter color thats not in the pallet, I have it right at my fingertips!</li>
            <li> Just right all colors needed!</li>
            <li> I needed blues and grays to complete the look and they were vibrant and sparkly and looked great.</li>
            <li> Its affordable,  and is very pigmented, I couldnt ask for more.</li>
            <li> I think it is a good basic set.</li>
            <li> The colors are cheap looking and don&#x27;t look quite right once applied.</li>
            <li> real great price for such a big amount of eye shadows...</li>
            <li> At first glance the price was so cheap that I almost did not want to buy it.</li>
            <li> colors good, do not stay on long.</li>
            <li> Blends wonderfully and lasts such a long time.</li>
            <li> Perfect, Last long as well the colors are to die for</li>
            <li> , I was able to actually apply the makeup, and it was very smooth and very vibrant in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They went on my eyelids perfectly and blending them wasn&#x27;t tough.</li>
            <li> Best ten dollars I ever spent</li>
            <li> It was worth my money</li>
            <li> so all eyeshadow is pretty awesome and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Those are pretty cool.</li>
            <li> but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This pallet is worth every cent I paid.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fun experimenting with this palette when I am coming up with look ideas,</li>
            <li> Have Fun</li>
            <li> Shippig Was SUPER FAST</li>
            <li> Of course, I didn&#x27;t expect a great quality because of the price, but I&#x27;m kind of disappointing.</li>
            <li> It got here very fast.</li>
            <li> My little sister loved it when I gave it to her for Christmas.</li>
            <li> In fact, they come across more as muted and natural tones instead of the vibrant colors portrayed in the picture.</li>
            <li> a beginner in the world of makeup, and only being able to use my fingers (because I didn&#x27;t get my brushes in time for the event)</li>
            <li> It arrived exactly on time</li>
            <li> With these three combined I can do so many different looks and</li>
            <li> I love to play with different colors</li>
            <li> Because my sister has the first one that came out</li>
            <li> Plenty of colors some have better pigmentation than others but for the price it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t you still should buy it but be aware of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Not too sure how it last without the primer.</li>
            <li> I love the colors I just wish there was a red in it</li>
            <li> This pallete has quite a selection of colors but many of them look very similar when applied to the eyelid.</li>
            <li> You do you to load on the colors for higher pigmentation</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I love all the colors they just take several layers to achieve the look I want.</li>
            <li> I should be able to mix anything I need to supplement my usual, more neutral eye shadows.</li>
            <li> I ordered another e.l.f. 100 piece eyeshadow palette a few months ago and loved that one</li>
            <li> and the colors are great but be sure to have a good base when applying them so that the colors last.</li>
            <li> I love having such a large selection to choose from.</li>
            <li> Other than that the colors are really nice.....</li>
            <li> Very nice colors I enjoy using this palette and Can&#x27;t wait to buy a second one small mirror and brushes come with it</li>
            <li> but you have to use so much product in order to see it you use the colors  very  fast.</li>
            <li> So, so worth the price, but again I highly recommend the UD primer potion and NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really expect it to be, applying primer really helps though!</li>
            <li> It does not flake off too much; so lasts pretty well.  </li>
            <li> the color are really pretty but not all of them are very opaque but</li>
            <li> The colors are very vibrant and shimmery.  </li>
            <li> This is a fairly large palette with a large variety of colors.  </li>
            <li> The colors are chalky and some aren&#x27;t very pigmented by themselves, BUT if you invest in a few more products you&#x27;re still saving money by going with e.l.f.!</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and show up on your face and eyelids exactly how they are in the palate.</li>
            <li> This is a great little palette for someone who likes to wear a variety of different colors.</li>
            <li> I literally sat in my room all day and stared at the colors for 2 hours because I really like this palette.</li>
            <li> These eye shadows are very powdery.</li>
            <li> The palette is ridiculously cheap and has such a variety of colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into eyeshadow, so i use it on my clients, and it really works well.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a beginner palette and want a whole variety of colors, this does the job for the price.</li>
            <li> But I also bought a separate brush kit because the brushes don&#x27;t really work that well.</li>
            <li> SOOOO MUCH</li>
            <li> shipped really fast</li>
            <li> they were very pigminted</li>
            <li> They refunded me my money and were very gracious about it.  </li>
            <li> Again thank you so much for the immediate response.</li>
            <li> It even has mixed colors, like silver/black, light brown/dark brown, etc, which I&#x27;ve never seen before.</li>
            <li> so i didnt want to spend much thinking bout getting one for myself for when i take vacations</li>
            <li> but I really like &amp; want to keep this palette</li>
            <li> This is a Real elf palette and the shimmery colors are very pigmented</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> This palette is very well priced for the quality.</li>
            <li> and these shadows are very noticeable.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t expect much because of the price</li>
            <li> The price was great, none of them were broken, and they work well.</li>
            <li> AND IT WAS VERY INEXSPESIVE</li>
            <li> I found that there wasn&#x27;t too much pigment in the colors</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> And since the cost is only $10 with free shipping if you are a prime member,it is actually cheaper than many single shade eyeshadow and certainly cheaper than most compacts with only two or three colors.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this palette and want the colors to be as bright as they&#x27;re supposed to look, definitely get the NYX eye pencil and the UD primer and all the problems other users have mentioned about lack of pigmentation and chalkiness will disappear.</li>
            <li> The color is not too pigmented, which is okay because you can apply layers if you need a more dramatic effect.</li>
            <li> I thought there was going to be more pinks, purples and other colors.</li>
            <li> I had gotten it because it was cheap and didn&#x27;t expect it to be of such high quality.</li>
            <li> I use ELF alot, also use lorac and other more high end products.</li>
            <li> I found that the colors are not bold or bright enough for my liking.  </li>
            <li> and I got a pallet full of only browns....</li>
            <li> So this thing is HUGE, I&#x27;ve never played around much with make-up but really wanted to try some more dramatic eye looks..</li>
            <li> The color goes on and stays vibrant.</li>
            <li> they look really vibrant.</li>
            <li> Colors werent as vibrant and didnt saturate as well as I needed them too.</li>
            <li> Glittery, Matte, Vibrant or Muted.  </li>
            <li> The set I&#x27;d large and there are so many shades and combinations that it will definitely last a long time.</li>
            <li> Only one shadow was missing and to me it wasn&#x27;t a big deal since it was more of a very light tanish color.</li>
            <li> Application is a little light, you really have to load it on, but lots of fun for play and for young girls.</li>
            <li> but I found a palette in store that had more of the shades I wanted and a little cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Also the application is very light and doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> The ones I&#x27;ve tried so far have decent pigmentation.</li>
            <li> My palette came with the silver tone at the top right broken.  </li>
            <li> Especially when looking for higher pigmentation.</li>
            <li> wasnt too sure about ordering it because i havnt cared for elf in the past</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get a chance to use it off because I&#x27;m not one to put on makeup when its really hot outside</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that anyone looking for good eyeshadow buys this over the expensive name brands.</li>
            <li> All the colors work, none fall out, not a big mess, super laid back and easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it is quite large, not deep,</li>
            <li> Just use white on your eyelid before to really make it pop.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 17 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> There are enough colors that anyone should be able to find at least a few that they absolutely love.</li>
            <li> I think I will get the natural palette</li>
            <li> Goes on seamlessly.</li>
            <li> was surprised by this one...</li>
            <li> The colours actually stay on and you don&#x27;t have to apply much to see the colours.</li>
            <li> Its mediocre, seems like something my 9 year old cousin could have more fun with</li>
            <li> It was well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> I did recently drop it on the floor in the bathroom which dislodged a few colors, but I love it.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about the size and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just received these shadows and they are decent enough.</li>
            <li> I had bought a smaller palette last year for a friend who was getting married and needed some eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Not a bad little palette.  </li>
            <li> I bought this palette for my niece and there are NO PINK colors like shown in the picture!!</li>
            <li> no broken shadow .. the colors really well pigmented, vibrant green like blue ..</li>
            <li> The elf palette looks dull and the colors are not bright and beautiful like they are portrayed in the picture.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a new one on elf page, a BIG difference.</li>
            <li> I made the decision to step outside my comfort zone and explore new eyeshadow colors.</li>
            <li> and it was super messy when I opened the package...</li>
            <li> I have no regrets with this purchase</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;be only used a couple colors, but they are fantastically colored!  </li>
            <li> Seems like it could be a little &amp;#34;dusty&amp;#34; but if you apply it right, shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.  </li>
            <li> I would totally recommend this to other beginners like me who have no idea what colors they want, and I&#x27;m not sorry I purchased it.</li>
            <li> well mainly, one of the squares was missing its the second one down from the top left so from looking at the picture its an off white so not really a big deal</li>
            <li> The case isn&#x27;t the strongest, the lid to exact is a little flimsy</li>
            <li> I wanted all the colors but its very hard to apply it, once you put it on and start to blend it, it pretty much blends away</li>
            <li> love the pallet i received it with a few colors mixed tho none were broken and very pigment colors last about 8 hours</li>
            <li> Really descent, not super pigmented but it&#x27;s something a white crayon can fix</li>
            <li> The colors are not of everyday use, I don&#x27;t really need neon yellow or bubble gum pink.</li>
            <li> Long enough for me though</li>
            <li> came broken in the mail....not cool.</li>
            <li> I have done make-up professionally, so I am always looking for hidden treasures.  </li>
            <li> It looks like they are all pretty shallow as for as fill in the plates.</li>
            <li> BUT THE EYESHADOW IS SO DULL AND FADES FAST</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay on your eyes for long.</li>
            <li> Larger container than I expected.</li>
            <li> I get to try a new look everyday and just get to exspress myself!</li>
            <li> Some of the colours are a bit chalky though and there are quite a few that are not very heavily pigmented.  </li>
            <li> that way, I don&#x27;t waste my more expensive products experimenting.</li>
            <li> It has every single color that you could ever imagine and the eye shadow lasts all day.</li>
            <li> If you want matte colors that blend well or pigments that last all day, this is not worth your time.</li>
            <li> I used a lot of these on my wedding day and they stayed all day long!!</li>
            <li> Its not big deal if I mess up and have to start over or just for practicing.</li>
            <li> I.e there is a pink eyeshadow with grey spots in it, or yellow with green spots in it.</li>
            <li> But I think if I buy any palettes in the future I will buy something a little nicer quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very pigmented</li>
            <li> Even when using a primer, they don&#x27;t pop as expected.</li>
            <li> None of the colors are pink as shown.</li>
            <li> Just not very pigmented</li>
            <li> tested out a blue and green and to my suprise</li>
            <li> It is not very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Pink doesnt show up at all no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> It has a wide variety of colors.</li>
            <li> The range of colours gives a wide array of choices.</li>
            <li> That is bigger than I expected!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any issues with fallouts and unlike other the bh cosmetics palette, this shows on your skin/</li>
            <li> The shadows don&#x27;t have a smell like some other makeups do.</li>
            <li> so I cant speak for other sellers.</li>
            <li> those are pretty useless.</li>
            <li> That said, I&#x27;m not sure about the actual quality of the make-up.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t meet my expectations due to the pigment.</li>
            <li> the gray color was everywhere on my pallet, even outside of it, it was a real mess.</li>
            <li> cuz Im not brave enough, then it wouldn&#x27;t be a big lost.</li>
            <li> The shadows themselves are just average.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not very attractive when you open it up...</li>
            <li> So I can see how someone with make up experience would be let down by this palatte.</li>
            <li> But this was a let down as soon as I pulled it out of the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that applying with a slightly damp brush makes the colors brighter.</li>
            <li> and it got there in less than 3 days.</li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical of this eyeshadow palate, because I&#x27;ve had lots of trouble with the quality with e.l.f. products in the past.</li>
            <li> Double negative!</li>
            <li> Just use a makeup brush instead of the little eyeshadow sponges</li>
            <li> I have bought a few items from this line</li>
            <li> this item arrived with a broken case and the makeup was also broken leaving the makeup residue all outside the case it wasn&#x27;t packaged properly to protect the item.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t want to waste hundreds of dollars on pricey palettes,</li>
            <li> you might have to put on a few coats but it stays on for a while.</li>
            <li> A waste of money the eyeshadow does not show up at all.</li>
            <li> Product came with several colors broken and spread probably from the mail</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and it is my go to everyday eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> not sure why this shade was missing...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering from E.L.F. for years and have very, very seldom been disappointed with anything I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Definitely use a primer or this would be useless.</li>
            <li> Seriously dont waste your money</li>
            <li> , 2 colors came destroyed, colors were so strong and horrible.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a not so expensive palette with a wide range of colors and this was just what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li> Its not really pigmented u will definitely need a base of primer.....</li>
            <li> and I was expecting for some of the eyeshadows to be missing or broken</li>
            <li> Must be applied thickly onto primed eyelid.</li>
            <li> The shadows are so hard it&#x27;s as if it didn&#x27;t want to come off on the brush!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in that......and will probably go out and get a different one from the store because I wear browns and pinks....</li>
            <li> Not happy with the opacity of some of the colours.</li>
            <li> The colors look well with primer, but the case came broken and one of the eyeshadows came broken as well.</li>
            <li> None came broken</li>
            <li> Some colore its broken</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow definitely requires using a base and/or primer for the color to show as well as you like.</li>
            <li> The corner of my makeup palette arrived broken when I took it out of the box</li>
            <li> Some of the shadows were cracked, the presentation wasn&#x27;t aesthetically pleasing, and the quality is poor.</li>
            <li> It came on time, nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> The packaging is terrible and looks old.</li>
            <li> THIS PALLETE SUCKS!!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, and none of the colors were broken at all!</li>
            <li> Used NYX Cosmetics Eye Shadow Base in White as base.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t leave it out now because I&#x27;m afraid the moisture or dust from the bathroom will get inside it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always wary of that!</li>
            <li> Kinda surprise, it came out so bad.</li>
            <li> this one was so bad.</li>
            <li> so I got this bad boy.</li>
            <li> MAYBE I GOT A BAD PALLETTE</li>
            <li> Maybe this marble palate is particularly bad but all of my shades were chalky.</li>
            <li> so kinda shocked</li>
            <li> This is an ugly palette and looks nothing like the photo.</li>
            <li> It was extremely disappointing!</li>
            <li> This produce did not include the grays...very disappointed in this purchase and will not order again...</li>
            <li> I am beyond pissed and disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to getting the make up pallet in the picture, but the one I received doesnt have any blues or pinks in it :(</li>
            <li> Was alittle disappointed with the colors.</li>
            <li> so I was a tad disappointed about that</li>
            <li> Got here on time and not one eyeshadow was cracked or broken!!!</li>
            <li> and I have been very disappointed by my purchase.</li>
            <li> horrible colors, not what i tought</li>
            <li> but it was packaged horrible..</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great price/value my gf loves it</li>
            <li> I like the variety of colours and the quality of this product. I would recommend it to my friends and family if they inquire about make-up products.</li>
            <li> This was a great product. I was a little worried about the size and was not disappointed. The set I&#x27;d large and there are so many shades and combinations that it will definitely last a long time. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> this palette is excellent ! great variaty if colors and it stays in very niec using eye primer :) cant believe it was so cheap !</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even last an hour</li>
            <li> All the colors were bright and vibrant, none of the squares were cracked. My little sister loved it when I gave it to her for Christmas. The case isn&#x27;t the strongest, the lid to exact is a little flimsy but if you take care of it it won&#x27;t be an issue!</li>
            <li> This palette no only is in a beautiful selection, but it was also very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a beginner in the world of makeup, and only being able to use my fingers (because I didn&#x27;t get my brushes in time for the event), I was able to actually apply the makeup, and it was very smooth and very vibrant in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something to add a bit more pop to your eyes, this palette is for you. I would definitely order one again!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the colour choice. Not happy with the opacity of some of the colours. Some are too translucent for my taste.</li>
            <li> The colors look well with primer, but the case came broken and one of the eyeshadows came broken as well.</li>
            <li> Great color selection, but they aren&#x27;t very pigmented on their own.  I&#x27;ve found that applying with a slightly damp brush makes the colors brighter.</li>
            <li> Love this Pallett. I own 3 ELF pallettes and this is my favorite. The color goes on and stays vibrant. Just use white on your eyelid before to really make it pop. White eyeliner works great. I use ELF alot, also use lorac and other more high end products. This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Nice colors, good pigmentation. Great for a makeup amatuer like me. Its not big deal if I mess up and have to start over or just for practicing.</li>
            <li> love the pallet i received it with a few colors mixed tho none were broken and very pigment colors last about 8 hours</li>
            <li> I just received these shadows and they are decent enough. The problem I&#x27;m having with them is that they are Nowhere near as bright as the image makes them seem. In fact, they come across more as muted and natural tones instead of the vibrant colors portrayed in the picture. It was extremely disappointing! Although there are still some very nice colors in this pallet, it&#x27;s not at all what I thought I was ordering. I&#x27;m debating about sending it back.</li>
            <li> At first glance the price was so cheap that I almost did not want to buy it. I bought it anyways and I love it! It has great colors &amp; it doesn&#x27;t fall into the creases under your eyes-it just stays where you put it. Very excellent choice. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I ordered another e.l.f. 100 piece eyeshadow palette a few months ago and loved that one so when i saw this one i knew it would be just as great and i was not disappointed. I love how this has tons of neutrals for everyday looks but the colors in it are also absolutely beautiful. This is a great product if you do a lot of smokey eye and want lots of neutrals. The product came right on time and was nicely packaged. Overall an amazing product for women just looking to get lots of variety for their eyes and inspiring make-up artist</li>
            <li> For just $10, this product is REALLY good! The quality is nice also, and I love the colors! Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I ordered these palette for my mom for her birthday. Which is in two weeks. I ordered it ahead of time so it would get there on time and it got there in less than 3 days. She loved it. I couldn&#x27;t believe it was e.l.f cosmetics and so cheap. Super happy about the delivery being so quick.</li>
            <li> Great selection of colors</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for two of my grand daughters and they love it.&lt;br /&gt;Their mom wished I would have gotten her one</li>
            <li> This is the palette to have if you just started using makeup. I just received mine today I am so happy to have this palette in my hands. I literally sat in my room all day and stared at the colors for 2 hours because I really like this palette. Get this palette and you will be happy too. :)</li>
            <li> horrible colors, not what i tought, 2 colors came destroyed, colors were so strong and horrible. It doesnt seem and elf product. I had to buy a new one on elf page, a BIG difference. Not even the package is the same. I dont think it is a original product. Seriously dont waste your money</li>
            <li> lots of color but you have to use so much product in order to see it you use the colors  very  fast.</li>
            <li> These eye shadows are very powdery. They don&#x27;t stay on your eyes for long. I also have to put a lot on my eyes so that you can see I am wearing eye shadow. I have bought a few items from this line and I have been very disappointed by my purchase.</li>
            <li> This palette has the best colors and last literally all day with a primer underneath. Best ten dollars I ever spent</li>
            <li> So many colors to choose from! I get to try a new look everyday and just get to exspress myself! Thank you for the great product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome, I recommend buying this if you want an assortment of eyeshadow colors. It goes on smooth and stays on</li>
            <li> I give this product 3 stars because it took a week longer to get here, but it works really good. Perfect for day time make up. Not to strong but not too light.</li>
            <li> Beautifully pigmented eye shadow. Blends wonderfully and lasts such a long time. I&#x27;m finding myself use colors I never would have thought to use before. Excellent price and such an amazing color choice.</li>
            <li> What can I say except for you can create over a 1000 different looks for a low price! Eye beauty beyond your imagination.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product! There are lots of colors to choose from! I would definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li> Perfect for the price. It arrived exactly on time and I was expecting for some of the eyeshadows to be missing or broken but it arrived in perfect condition! It&#x27;s not very pigmented but I didn&#x27;t really expect it to be, applying primer really helps though! It&#x27;s a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Recieved my eyeshadow is great condition!! However, I definitely thought the pigment was a LOT brighter, when it&#x27;s actually not. Even when using a primer, they don&#x27;t pop as expected. Still a beautiful set though!</li>
            <li> The palette is ridiculously cheap and has such a variety of colors. The colors are chalky and some aren&#x27;t very pigmented by themselves, BUT if you invest in a few more products you&#x27;re still saving money by going with e.l.f.! I use [[ASIN:B00GCDHNCM Urban Decay&#x27;s primer potion]] (I use it in Sin but most people use it in Original) then [[ASIN:B001TK4LM8 NYX&#x27;s Jumbo Eye Pencil in Milk]] on top--the two products combined make the shadows in this palette POP. With these three combined I can do so many different looks and all the colors are ridiculously bright and true to what you see in the product image. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this palette and want the colors to be as bright as they&#x27;re supposed to look, definitely get the NYX eye pencil and the UD primer and all the problems other users have mentioned about lack of pigmentation and chalkiness will disappear. I love this palette and it&#x27;s helped me come out of my shell so much more with bright colors and experimenting with colors I would&#x27;ve never touched! So, so worth the price, but again I highly recommend the UD primer potion and NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil I linked above.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 17 year old daughter.  She loved it! The colors are very vibrant and shimmery.  It does not flake off too much; so lasts pretty well.  Excellent selection of colors</li>
            <li> this item arrived with a broken case and the makeup was also broken leaving the makeup residue all outside the case it wasn&#x27;t packaged properly to protect the item. I was thoroughly displeased.</li>
            <li> The colors are much more muted than shown in the picture. None of the colors are pink as shown. Nice colors but would have been much better if the colors were closer to the picture.</li>
            <li> I love this. I had bought a smaller palette last year for a friend who was getting married and needed some eyeshadow. I liked that one so much that I bought one for myself. I love to play with different colors so I decided to order this. I love it.  It arrived perfectly intact. No breaks cracks, etc. It wears fairly well and is easy to remove. There are enough colors that anyone should be able to find at least a few that they absolutely love. And since the cost is only $10 with free shipping if you are a prime member,it is actually cheaper than many single shade eyeshadow and certainly cheaper than most compacts with only two or three colors.</li>
            <li> Best eye palette for your money. The selection is endless and beautiful. I have a color for every outfit and occasion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into eyeshadow, so i use it on my clients, and it really works well. I don&#x27;t have any issues with fallouts and unlike other the bh cosmetics palette, this shows on your skin/lid especially for darker skin tones.</li>
            <li> Great price! I love the color variety. The pigment is not as strong as some of your higher quality shadows (like MAC)....with that being said, just add another layer of color to darken it :)</li>
            <li> fantastic colours and pigment. The only palette i will ever need. It exceeded my expectations and i have sensitive skin with no reaction from these powders, which is great.</li>
            <li> real great price for such a big amount of eye shadows... i think i would be set for a while...</li>
            <li> Kinda surprise, it came out so bad. My friend has an elf eye shadow kit that is good so kinda shocked this one was so bad.</li>
            <li> Im really in love with this product, is the best eyesshadow that I can buy, is perfect because have beautifull colors for all time. The quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> Because my sister has the first one that came out and so I dicided to buy mine and I love to blend with my eyeshadows and this came in blended in.</li>
            <li> Wonderful it blends so wonderfully and I have so many options to choose from....I think I will get the natural palette</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a beginner palette and want a whole variety of colors, this does the job for the price. However, there is a lot of things I dislike about it. The colors are not of everyday use, I don&#x27;t really need neon yellow or bubble gum pink. Some colors lack pigment and don&#x27;t blend so well either. If you are just beginning to experiment with makeup and you don&#x27;t want to waste hundreds of dollars on pricey palettes, yes buy this one. If you want matte colors that blend well or pigments that last all day, this is not worth your time. Im a big fan of elf, even their eyeshadows, this palette though is not for everyone.</li>
            <li> This eye shadow palette is really nice. The colors are beautiful and are just as displayed (and this is coming from an artist). If you want the makeup to stay all day without having to touch it up again, get primer along with this this. If you have primer, you&#x27;re all set!</li>
            <li> Plenty of colors some have better pigmentation than others but for the price it&#x27;s not a big deal. None came broken so that&#x27;s even better!</li>
            <li> I love the colors on this palette. It has 50/50 neutrals and brights. The package came well packed and all the shadows were intact. Although, there was a bit of the residue from the eye shadows  but that&#x27;s okay because they&#x27;re EYE SHADOWS. IT&#x27;S GOING TO GET EVERYWHERE. I didn&#x27;t feel the need to put primer on my eyes because 1. I don&#x27;t have any, and 2. they last alllll day. I&#x27;m not a shimmer kind of person but the mattes on the palette are good. They went on my eyelids perfectly and blending them wasn&#x27;t tough. They went on smoothly and none of the powder got on my face/everywhere. I would buy this again. It was worth my money LOL!</li>
            <li> Arrived as pictured. This is a gift for my granddaughter so I haven&#x27;t tried the product myself. Larger container than I expected.</li>
            <li> When I got my ELF eye shadow pallet the gray color was everywhere on my pallet, even outside of it, it was a real mess. Other than that the colors are really nice..... you might have to put on a few coats but it stays on for a while.</li>
            <li> Great buy for the money!! There are solids, sparkly shadows, and every shade you would EVER need. The shadows don&#x27;t have a smell like some other makeups do. I used a lot of these on my wedding day and they stayed all day long!! Great buy and product.</li>
            <li> I love this SO MUCH! All the colors work, none fall out, not a big mess, super laid back and easy to use. But I also bought a separate brush kit because the brushes don&#x27;t really work that well. So if you have brushes that are good or can easily purchase some I SAY BUY THIS LOVE IT SOOOO MUCH but if you don&#x27;t you still should buy it but be aware of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Great shadow. I use a primer so all eyeshadow is pretty awesome and long lasting. Not too sure how it last without the primer. Great colors!</li>
            <li> Oh my god look at all these colors! And it&#x27;s only 10 bucks! I like to change up my eyeshadow a lot and I&#x27;m not made of money so I got this bad boy. They go on smooth and if you use eyeshadow primer they look really vibrant. People think I&#x27;m wearing MAC or Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> It is a Good quality of eye shadow and it has a lot of variety in colors! Creates great smokey eyes!</li>
            <li> I love the colors I just wish there was a red in it</li>
            <li> I arrive in perfect condition. no broken shadow .. the colors really well pigmented, vibrant green like blue .. Perfect to have our own makeup kit without professional</li>
            <li> well mainly, one of the squares was missing its the second one down from the top left so from looking at the picture its an off white so not really a big deal but it was packaged horrible.. I picked the box up from my door step and I could feel the three products I ordered sliding around.. you get what you pay for I guess</li>
            <li> Happy with the purchase. Its affordable,  and is very pigmented, I couldnt ask for more. I have no regrets with this purchase</li>
            <li> This produce did not include the grays...very disappointed in this purchase and will not order again...not sure why this shade was missing...</li>
            <li> I love it! plenty of colors to choose from. The color go on nicely. I wish it had some glitter shimmer ones</li>
            <li> i order this as a birthday present for a friend. the colors were great and so was the price.&lt;br /&gt;it shipped really fast but every time this top was cracked and even sometime the colors. i reshipped it 5+ time and still hasn&#x27;t come in not come in not cracked!</li>
            <li> well IÂ´m so happy because none of the shadow was broke, i was worry about it uffff&lt;br /&gt;I totaly recommended.</li>
            <li> Double negative! The shadows are so hard it&#x27;s as if it didn&#x27;t want to come off on the brush! Some of them looked molded btw!</li>
            <li> A waste of money the eyeshadow does not show up at all.</li>
            <li> This is something I am very happy I bought. Lots of different colors to choose from and they are of great quality. When it runs out, which won&#x27;t be anytime soon I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Has soo many colors!! Just not very pigmented i guess with a good primer the colors might pop more.</li>
            <li> Some colore its broken</li>
            <li> When I took it out of the box, some of the eye shadows had cracked and there was powder all over the front screen.  I&#x27;m giving this as a gift and it&#x27;s not very attractive when you open it up...</li>
            <li> i bought this for a gift and she loved it, i stingily recommend it, its has a lot of colors and she looked so beautiful with it.</li>
            <li> Thia pallette met all my expectations.  I was very pleased and satisfied with it. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Really descent, not super pigmented but it&#x27;s something a white crayon can fix so I&#x27;m satisfied ð</li>
            <li> Love love love this eyeshadow!!! So much variety and looks so great! Elf make up last all day! Never had to touch up!</li>
            <li> colors are not so pigmented</li>
            <li> This pallete has quite a selection of colors but many of them look very similar when applied to the eyelid. Colors werent as vibrant and didnt saturate as well as I needed them too. Its mediocre, seems like something my 9 year old cousin could have more fun with</li>
            <li> Very nice colors I enjoy using this palette and Can&#x27;t wait to buy a second one small mirror and brushes come with it but I haven&#x27;t even used them I love the contrast and mix of all the colors</li>
            <li> Was looking for a not so expensive palette with a wide range of colors and this was just what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li> There are no returns allowed on this purchase and like 5 of the colors were busted when I received it.</li>
            <li> The Pallette is great got here in before promised and it really good for beginning makeup users...</li>
            <li> Such a great product. Goes on seamlessly. So very pleased with this purchase. Highest quality eye shadow product. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> It came in a week before it was suppose to, great shipping! :) and the colors are great but be sure to have a good base when applying them so that the colors last.</li>
            <li> I read reviews and thought that it was going to come in not so good shape.&lt;br /&gt;But it came whithin 2 days. Only one shadow was missing and to me it wasn&#x27;t a big deal since it was more of a very light tanish color. but the rest were intact.&lt;br /&gt;I tested out a blue and green and to my suprise they were very pigminted which was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the product. I will recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Its not really pigmented u will definitely need a base of primer.....&lt;br /&gt;hope u will consider on what to purchase</li>
            <li> Though no fault of the manufacture but I found a palette in store that had more of the shades I wanted and a little cheaper.  They refunded me my money and were very gracious about it.  Again thank you so much for the immediate response. I will order from them again.</li>
            <li> I just got this pallet yesterday and it&#x27;s perfect! You do you to load on the colors for higher pigmentation but I like that because if I want a lighter color thats not in the pallet, I have it right at my fingertips!</li>
            <li> This is an ugly palette and looks nothing like the photo. The colors are mostly browns, golds, and yellows. I bought this palette for my niece and there are NO PINK colors like shown in the picture!! I No whites, grays, or blacks either!!! I am beyond pissed and disappointed. The packaging is terrible and looks old.</li>
            <li> Great variety of colors and there are so many options.  Glittery, Matte, Vibrant or Muted.  Whatever your mood you&#x27;ll find it here</li>
            <li> Great selection of colors. It even has mixed colors, like silver/black, light brown/dark brown, etc, which I&#x27;ve never seen before. Those are pretty cool. It came perfect; the colors were intact and not broken.</li>
            <li> Love it! Love the colors and stays on all day!</li>
            <li> The colors are cheap looking and don&#x27;t look quite right once applied.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Painted a sugar skull on my face for Halloween and the shadows provided long-lasting, excellent color.  Used NYX Cosmetics Eye Shadow Base in White as base.</li>
            <li> That is bigger than I expected!!!! It has so many mate colors, I love it!</li>
            <li> You can use it for eyes shadow, blush, bronzer, and eyeliner. I love it!!</li>
            <li> plenty of choices...colors good, do not stay on long. Long enough for me though</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t paint.. Cheap quality</li>
            <li> Great pigment!!! But top broke easily</li>
            <li> Great for my teenage daughter. Application is a little light, you really have to load it on, but lots of fun for play and for young girls.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to getting the make up pallet in the picture, but the one I received doesnt have any blues or pinks in it :( just lots of shades of brown.....I was disappointed in that......and will probably go out and get a different one from the store because I wear browns and pinks....and I got a pallet full of only browns....</li>
            <li> Great color palette.  Case came in the mail cracked.</li>
            <li> Affordable, and a great variety of colors for you to mix and match and create all different kinds of looks.. Some cool and some warm colors...</li>
            <li> Got here on time and not one eyeshadow was cracked or broken!!! So pleased, so impressed!!!!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy all my colors I have. It was well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> More colors than I will probably ever need but I love to have the options!&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it goes on and comes off. It looks like they are all pretty shallow as for as fill in the plates. But for the price you can&#x27;t beat that.&lt;br /&gt;It looks good and the colors stay bold while on.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it is a cruelty free product that is affordable. My original reasoning for purchase. Happy camper.</li>
            <li> I wanted all the colors but its very hard to apply it, once you put it on and start to blend it, it pretty much blends away so it looks like your not wearing anything. It is not very pigmented. Pink doesnt show up at all no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> it was great for the price bought 2 for gifts and both people loved it .. they werent close so i didnt want to spend much thinking bout getting one for myself for when i take vacations</li>
            <li> Love my pallet, price was good and the colors are very nice and stay on long. There are beautiful neutral colors, matte and also vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> I got these for my sister for Christmas, let&#x27;s hope she likes them!</li>
            <li> Not a bad little palette.  I wish there wasn&#x27;t as many peach/pink/nude tones though.  I have been able to mix whatever color I&#x27;m in the mood for using this palette though.  All pieces arrived unbroken.  Great palette for the price.</li>
            <li> I use this palette every morning. I did recently drop it on the floor in the bathroom which dislodged a few colors, but I love it. I will buy a smaller palette next time sticking to the colors I use.</li>
            <li> Shippig Was SUPER FAST It came 2 days before it was supposed to and it has great colors but i would also recommend a primer because with out one the colors fade EXTREMELY QUICK!!!</li>
            <li> Was alittle disappointed with the colors. In the picture it looks to be bright colors, but really it&#x27;s a lot of tans, cream colors. I thought there was going to be more pinks, purples and other colors. Also the application is very light and doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Love it! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> We love the colors are perfect exactly as I wanted</li>
            <li> I LOVE this palette! It a great eyeshadow palette especially for makeup beginners. It has matte, pigmented (shimmer), and marble eyeshadows. I.e there is a pink eyeshadow with grey spots in it, or yellow with green spots in it. It&#x27;s great and the colors show up very well and it arrived safely with no broken colors.</li>
            <li> The color alone doesn&#x27;t show too well. Especially when looking for higher pigmentation. The eyeshadow definitely requires using a base and/or primer for the color to show as well as you like.</li>
            <li> Dont color well. I need to paint every times</li>
            <li> The corner of my makeup palette arrived broken when I took it out of the box so I was a tad disappointed about that but I really like &amp; want to keep this palette and I do not want to return it but I can&#x27;t leave it out now because I&#x27;m afraid the moisture or dust from the bathroom will get inside it. I bought this palette from amazon.com llc so I cant speak for other sellers. This is a Real elf palette and the shimmery colors are very pigmented however the matte colors need primer and extra applications.</li>
            <li> This is a good starter palette. It has a wide variety of colors. The pigment isn&#x27;t that great. So I can see how someone with make up experience would be let down by this palatte.</li>
            <li> was surprised by this one...wasnt too sure about ordering it because i havnt cared for elf in the past but I love this!! colors glide on beautifully!!! great buy for a great price! def recommend this.............</li>
            <li> This 100 piece eye shadow is amazing. It got here very fast. It has every single color that you could ever imagine and the eye shadow lasts all day. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is a great little palette for someone who likes to wear a variety of different colors. It isn&#x27;t the best quality eyeshadow of all time, but it is fairly well-pigmented and goes on excellently if you use a primer first. I read another review before purchasing mine that recommended using the NYX pencil in Milk in conjunction with the eyeshadows. That works great as well.</li>
            <li> Many eyeshadow palattes are nothing but shimmer, this palatte offers a nice variety and it is quite large, not deep, but well worth the price. Very nice texture and great purchase. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> A couple of the shadows were damaged from shipping (I know not your fault) and it was super messy when I opened the package... but the pigment is good for the price. Great buy. Versatile and many colors. Just use a makeup brush instead of the little eyeshadow sponges those are pretty useless.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have noticed that the seller doesn&#x27;t accept returns. I&#x27;m always wary of that! Some of the shadows were cracked, the presentation wasn&#x27;t aesthetically pleasing, and the quality is poor. I&#x27;ve been ordering from E.L.F. for years and have very, very seldom been disappointed with anything I&#x27;ve purchased. But this was a let down as soon as I pulled it out of the box.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, and none of the colors were broken at all! I love the bright vibrant colors and the pigmentation is great and it stays on FOREVER.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for my mom shipping was speedy, and colors are vibrant . She will enjoy . I also placed another order</li>
            <li> So this thing is HUGE, I&#x27;ve never played around much with make-up but really wanted to try some more dramatic eye looks.. The color selection is very nice &amp; the price is incredibly reasonable. That said, I&#x27;m not sure about the actual quality of the make-up. I would totally recommend this to other beginners like me who have no idea what colors they want, and I&#x27;m not sorry I purchased it. But I think if I buy any palettes in the future I will buy something a little nicer quality.</li>
            <li> Although the price is great, the pigment of the eyeshadows aren&#x27;t that good. Of course, I didn&#x27;t expect a great quality because of the price, but I&#x27;m kind of disappointing.</li>
            <li> This are not for me are for my wife she said that she like them they have all the color she need .</li>
            <li> This is a nice, well prepared palette of eye shadows......I really like it. I don&#x27;t get a chance to use it off because I&#x27;m not one to put on makeup when its really hot outside but, the times I have used it, I enjoyed the way the colors came together on my eyes. Nice product.</li>
            <li> the color are really pretty but not all of them are very opaque but besides that they r very good shadows</li>
            <li> I love all the colors they just take several layers to achieve the look I want. This palette is very well priced for the quality.</li>
            <li> Thank you my granddaughter who is 13 loves it</li>
            <li> ELF is constantly surprising me with their high quality! Nice set, well pigmented and has a good variety of colors in it.</li>
            <li> The makeup was broke when it arrived</li>
            <li> This is a fairly large palette with a large variety of colors.  I found that the colors are not bold or bright enough for my liking.  This would be a great asset to most make-up kits.  I have done make-up professionally, so I am always looking for hidden treasures.  This didn&#x27;t meet my expectations due to the pigment.</li>
            <li> great colors, includes any color you can ever want!</li>
            <li> I loveee these colors. I am a big fan of e.l.f. and these shadows are very noticeable. I would recommend this for all makeup lovers!</li>
            <li> Mostly good. There are a lot of orangey colors and greens but for the most part they all stay on and are pretty pigmented.</li>
            <li> Lovely packaging, I don&#x27;t expect much because of the price but overall, I like it because it does the job. I&#x27;m not a make up junkie so it works well for me.</li>
            <li> It came on time, nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> All the eye colors are beautiful. I love having such a large selection to choose from.</li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical of this eyeshadow palate, because I&#x27;ve had lots of trouble with the quality with e.l.f. products in the past. Not this product. The color is not too pigmented, which is okay because you can apply layers if you need a more dramatic effect. I used this on people who were going to prom and they all loved how the colors looked. Very good for the price!</li>
            <li> For the price it is a good buy. The range of colours gives a wide array of choices. It is light weight so it is easy to carry around. The colours actually stay on and you don&#x27;t have to apply much to see the colours. I had no breakouts from using this. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The price was great, none of them were broken, and they work well. I&#x27;m very happy :)</li>
            <li> These arrived in good condition. There are a lot of warm colors. The ones I&#x27;ve tried so far have decent pigmentation. There&#x27;s a lot of petrolatum in the formula, so there isn&#x27;t much fallout as they&#x27;re fairly creamy. What I don&#x27;t like is they smell like hair dye. I&#x27;ve put some on anyway &amp; I&#x27;ll update if there&#x27;s any irritation (I don&#x27;t expect any).  Even though they&#x27;re smelly, I&#x27;m glad to have them - It&#x27;s great to have so many colors so inexpensively. I should be able to mix anything I need to supplement my usual, more neutral eye shadows.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift and she loved it!</li>
            <li> This pallet is worth every cent I paid. I had gotten it because it was cheap and didn&#x27;t expect it to be of such high quality. I highly recommend that anyone looking for good eyeshadow buys this over the expensive name brands.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;be only used a couple colors, but they are fantastically colored!  Seems like it could be a little &amp;#34;dusty&amp;#34; but if you apply it right, shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.  Colors are nicely pigmented.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product. I can&#x27;t wait to play with all the colors!</li>
            <li> Product came with several colors broken and spread probably from the mail</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this palette for a while now and I really enjoy it. It lasts all day and it is my go to everyday eyeshadows. The colors are the colors in the pictures.</li>
            <li> I love this palette, for the price its excelent! i have to use eye primer first, becuse its not the most pigmented eyeshadow, but its very very fine for the price!</li>
            <li> I also bought a Shany palette and the colors in that are bright, beautiful and pigmented. Coastal Scents is another palette that is a winner. The elf palette looks dull and the colors are not bright and beautiful like they are portrayed in the picture. The shadows themselves are just average. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Purchased for Halloween to do sugar skull make up. I needed blues and grays to complete the look and they were vibrant and sparkly and looked great. I now use the nudes and Browns for every day wear and am sure that the brighter colors will come in handy in the future for Halloween costumes. Great quality and it lasted for an entire night of dancing and drinking without smearing or wearing off(all over my face). Very happy with this product! The colors are vibrant and show up on your face and eyelids exactly how they are in the palate.</li>
            <li> came broken in the mail....not cool.</li>
            <li> This palette has a good degree of colours and is fun to play with.  If you are just getting into makeup or looking for something for a younger girl this could be perfect.  Some of the colours are a bit chalky though and there are quite a few that are not very heavily pigmented.  My palette came with the silver tone at the top right broken.  I have a lot of fun experimenting with this palette when I am coming up with look ideas, that way, I don&#x27;t waste my more expensive products experimenting.</li>
            <li> I KNOW THAT IS E.L.F AND IT WAS VERY INEXSPESIVE BUT IVE USED ELF EYESHADOWS BEFORE AND THEY WERE WAYYY BETTER THAN THIS PALLETTE. THIS PALLETE SUCKS!! I ALWAYS USE A PRIMER BEFORE I PUT ON EYESHADOW I USE THE URBAN DECAY EYE SHADOW PRIMER WHICH IS GREAT . BUT THE EYESHADOW IS SO DULL AND FADES FAST IT LOOKS LIKE I DONT EVEN HAVE EYESHADOW ON . I DONT RECCOMEND THIS EYESHADOW....MAYBE I GOT A BAD PALLETTE BUT THAT IS NO EXSCUSE!!</li>
            <li> Must be applied thickly onto primed eyelid.</li>
            <li> There are so many colors to choose from and they are easy to blend. I found that there wasn&#x27;t too much pigment in the colors but it is very good for layering.</li>
            <li> Just as pictured. Makeup came perfectly packed, no cracks or damage to the cakes. And the colors are super bright!</li>
            <li> Just right all colors needed!</li>
            <li> I think it is a good basic set.</li>
            <li> I love the colors. I have very oily skin but this eyeshadow last all day.This is a GREAT product!</li>
            <li> Great product! I got it in almost 2 days!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this out because of the rave over it. Maybe this marble palate is particularly bad but all of my shades were chalky. Definitely use a primer or this would be useless.</li>
            <li> Perfect, Last long as well the colors are to die for</li>
            <li> Came in tact, I love the colors! I was completely satisfied with this product and the delivery</li>
            <li> I made the decision to step outside my comfort zone and explore new eyeshadow colors. I decided to go cheap in price just in case I changed my mind cuz Im not brave enough, then it wouldn&#x27;t be a big lost. Anyway. The colors application is very light on you skin. You have to apply several coats to notice the color. Some have a better affect than others. Have Fun</li>
