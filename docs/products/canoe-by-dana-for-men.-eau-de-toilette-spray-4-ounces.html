            <li>Nice.  </li>
            <li>Canoe is a nice fragrance but doesn&#x27;t smell like the origional Ambush, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>It smells so nice on a man.  </li>
            <li>Good clean smell...</li>
            <li>I just love the scent.</li>

            <li>This is my husbands favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even know they still made it, but this stuff was my favorite, and still is.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product because the splash version tends to use more product.</li>
            <li>Out of all the fragrances I use, Canoe is a favorite cologne of my wife and I.</li>
            <li>My favorite since I was a ladies&#x27; man at the University of Georgia in 1961, before the liberals took over--while we men were in Vietnam--and screwed our country up royally.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cologne for many years</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>this cologne is the best has a very unique smells and last forever.</li>
            <li>One problem with the original was that it was very strong.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this cologne so much!!!</li>
            <li>I bought for a present and they loved it!  </li>
            <li>The original Ambush was my favorite.  </li>
            <li>So many others smell sweet to me.</li>
            <li>The product is fine.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the essence on my face.</li>
            <li>Canoe is a wholly unique scent.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance is clean but not soapy, definitive but not overbearing.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product because it is a nice soft fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance of this classic cologne.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Canoe, so glad that I finally got it.</li>
            <li>This particular product is my wife&#x27;s favorite for me to wear, and has been for years.</li>
            <li>There are so many nice other fragrances out there to try out as well.</li>
            <li>Makes you smell like your fresh out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I have many other colognes, that are much more costly</li>
            <li>This is an Old-school cologne, my husband remembered it and as usual, Amazon had a great price on it.  </li>
            <li>It has a good soft smell that last</li>
            <li>It never fails to please.</li>
            <li>The cost is relatively low, and keeping my wife smiling makes any purchase worthwhile.</li>
            <li>My husband really like it.</li>
            <li>They were very helpful and responsive.</li>
            <li>Was expecting the wonderful smell of the Canoe I used to wear years ago, but was assaulted by this caustic smelling &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; that was instantly thrown into the trash.</li>
            <li>Its a fresh clean scent mixed with a deep rush.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly &amp; will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li>These are the two main characteristics I look for and it had both.</li>
            <li>so I only use two different ones, Pierre Cardin and this one, with this being my favorite.</li>
            <li>I won a bottle of this at a bingo game when I was a kid and have loved it ever since although I don&#x27;t use it all the time.</li>
            <li>Smells as good as it did when I was in high school - and that was a long, long, long time ago!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care for the new Ambush and Canoe</li>
            <li>I ordered this cologne because I&#x27;d read an article from a man who said he&#x27;d worked as a chemist for Dana and that this was the exact same formula as the origional Ambush for women.</li>
            <li>With the current version you can spray a lot on and not worry about having too much cologne on.</li>
            <li>They seem to smell different and really wanted to give him the spray.</li>
            <li>so I got up early today and waited for him</li>
            <li>It is hard to find but worth the hunt!!</li>
            <li>I think of this as a staple in any older gentlemans , and younger ones too, personal cabinet.</li>
            <li>But the current version is a pale shadow of the original.  </li>
            <li>so I double checked that I was clearly ordering the SPRAY.</li>
            <li>False advertisement stating it is a spray, need to be more  specific so others will not be misled.</li>

            <li> The only thing was wrong with it when we got it was that the top was broken completely off.</li>
            <li> I had read other people had the same issue</li>

            <li> I started using Canoe in High School in the late 50&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Package was delivered today and they sent me Eau De Toilette SPLASH (Splash is a watered down version).  </li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> There were no more spray eau de colognes, so I asked for a refund, which i have not checked on to see if i have</li>
            <li> It seems that, in the past few years the spray cologne is very hard to find in stores, so I&#x27;ve been ordering it online.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find sold anywhere except online.</li>
            <li> When I notified them they requested that I remove my complaint</li>
            <li> This used to be the fragrance of choice for men in the 60&#x27;s but is very hard to find now.</li>
            <li> Thoroughly disgusted with this order especially since Amazon states the item is non-returnable.</li>
            <li> Disappointed and will not order frangrances online ever again.</li>
            <li> My bad!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>

            <li> Ordered 4 0z. Canoe Eau De Toilette Spray.  Package was delivered today and they sent me Eau De Toilette SPLASH (Splash is a watered down version).  There is a big difference in fragrance, and price between the Spray and Splash.  Thoroughly disgusted with this order especially since Amazon states the item is non-returnable.</li>
            <li> I wore Canoe in the 1950&#x27;s and later.  I was delighted to find it online.  But the current version is a pale shadow of the original.  One problem with the original was that it was very strong.  With the current version you can spray a lot on and not worry about having too much cologne on.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of this classic cologne. Makes you smell like your fresh out of the shower. It is hard to find sold anywhere except online.</li>
            <li> I started using Canoe in High School in the late 50&#x27;s.  It always gets compliments.  I just love the scent.</li>
            <li> Was expecting the wonderful smell of the Canoe I used to wear years ago, but was assaulted by this caustic smelling &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; that was instantly thrown into the trash. What a waste!</li>
            <li> I have been using this since I was&lt;br /&gt;16. It has a good soft smell that last and I gets my compliments that I smell good. Canoe is best.</li>
            <li> I think of this as a staple in any older gentlemans , and younger ones too, personal cabinet. It never fails to please.</li>
            <li> Thought I would get &#x27;spray&#x27; as my husband has a couple of &#x27;splash&#x27; bottles.  They seem to smell different and really wanted to give him the spray.</li>
            <li> I ordered the spray and received the splash. I had read other people had the same issue so I double checked that I was clearly ordering the SPRAY. Disappointed and will not order frangrances online ever again. THIS IS A SPLASH...not a SPRAY</li>
            <li> The bottle leaked out all of the liquid, and I asked for a replacement or refund. There were no more spray eau de colognes, so I asked for a refund, which i have not checked on to see if i have a credit.&lt;br /&gt;The box smells lovely, so I put it in the closet.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter laughs why i shop on-line to avoid retail stores. However, nobody carries Canoe anymore though my husband loves it and so do I.&lt;br /&gt;I would like the refund.</li>
            <li> The product is fine. The problem is that I purchased this because the advertiser stated that&lt;br /&gt;it was an ATOMIZER spray. It is not. When I notified them they requested that I remove my complaint&lt;br /&gt;about the lie. You would think that instead they would offer the advertised product or encourage a return.&lt;br /&gt;So the product is great, the seller is not</li>
            <li> I purchased the 4 ounce spray Canoe by Dana and the price was a good value. The product seems to be aunthentic however it has been repackaged but why?  I could recommend dealing with this merchant only if the \\&quot;repackage situation\\&quot; is explained. Otherwise it has the look of a rip off.</li>
            <li> My husband really like it. The only thing was wrong with it when we got it was that the top was broken completely off.</li>
            <li> Ordered spray and received splash.  Saw the same problem on other reviews but took  a chance. My bad!</li>
            <li> Nice.  Have used for years.</li>
            <li> Product states it is a spray, it is not!!  It is a splash on.  My husband had wanted a spray.  We have since learned that Dana does not make this in a spray anymore, but he will use it anyway.  False advertisement stating it is a spray, need to be more  specific so others will not be misled.</li>
            <li> This is my husbands favorite cologne. The price was great for the size of bottle. Arrived quickly &amp; will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> This used to be the fragrance of choice for men in the 60&#x27;s but is very hard to find now.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cologne because I&#x27;d read an article from a man who said he&#x27;d worked as a chemist for Dana and that this was the exact same formula as the origional Ambush for women. The origional Ambush was discontinued several years ago and replaced with something that wasn&#x27;t even close. Canoe is a nice fragrance but doesn&#x27;t smell like the origional Ambush, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> I missed the UPS guy yesterday so I got up early today and waited for him, he got here around 12:30 p.m. I love the smell of Canoe, so glad that I finally got it. Canoe, canoe?  Yes, I canoe!</li>
            <li> Good job.  Timing through the mail was great and the product was what I ordered.  I bought for a present and they loved it!  Thank you again for a great experience!</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;ve been wearing it almost my entire life.  The original Ambush was my favorite.  I didn&#x27;t care for the new Ambush and Canoe was the men&#x27;s version, so I just switched to that.  I had a question and contacted the shipper, iFumez, via email.  They were very helpful and responsive.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know they still made it, but this stuff was my favorite, and still is.  I don&#x27;t care if others who smell it are having flashbacks to the 70s.</li>
            <li> This product is great, great fragrance...this seems to be long lasting as well. These are the two main characteristics I look for and it had both. Definitely a buy.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product because it is a nice soft fragrance. I won a bottle of this at a bingo game when I was a kid and have loved it ever since although I don&#x27;t use it all the time. There are so many nice other fragrances out there to try out as well. I also bought a bottle for my brother for his birthday coming up.</li>
            <li> I did not receive what I ordered - I ordered the spray and received the splash which I could have bought in a store anywhere.  Very disappointed.  I am in the process of trying to return it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because the splash version tends to use more product. This particular product is my wife&#x27;s favorite for me to wear, and has been for years. The cost is relatively low, and keeping my wife smiling makes any purchase worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big cologne wearer so I only use two different ones, Pierre Cardin and this one, with this being my favorite. So many others smell sweet to me. This fragrance is clean but not soapy, definitive but not overbearing. Long-lasting.</li>
            <li> Any wife would appreciate this fragrance.  It smells so nice on a man.  He&#x27;s been using it for years off and on.  One of his favorites.</li>
            <li> Smells as good as it did when I was in high school - and that was a long, long, long time ago!</li>
            <li> As the Canoe that I remember. AND is not the same as a bottle from about 10 years ago that I still have some left in.</li>
            <li> Out of all the fragrances I use, Canoe is a favorite cologne of my wife and I. It seems that, in the past few years the spray cologne is very hard to find in stores, so I&#x27;ve been ordering it online. I only hope I can still find it in the years to come.</li>
            <li> This is one of me and my dads favorite colognes! Its a fresh clean scent mixed with a deep rush. I&#x27;ve always gotten compliments on it, and decided to get another bottle of it! I&#x27;ll always make sure I have this in my collection!</li>
            <li> My favorite since I was a ladies&#x27; man at the University of Georgia in 1961, before the liberals took over--while we men were in Vietnam--and screwed our country up royally.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne for many years and I enjoy the essence on my face. I have many other colognes, that are much more costly but I always go back to Canoe.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne so much!!! I get it for my husband for Christmas every year. It is hard to find but worth the hunt!!</li>
            <li> I already use canoe so this purchase was strictly based on price. It was a very good purchase. If you have used canoe in the past then I highly recommend this value.</li>
            <li> This is an Old-school cologne, my husband remembered it and as usual, Amazon had a great price on it.  Very nice, indeed!</li>
            <li> Canoe is a wholly unique scent.  And because it&#x27;s been around so long, it&#x27;s not the fragrance of the day.  Go for it!</li>
            <li> Love the smell. My dad got me into it... Good clean smell...Inexpensive enough....I will buy more...when I run out..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;had to type twenty words.....</li>
            <li> this cologne is the best has a very unique smells and last forever. you will stand out in any room</li>
