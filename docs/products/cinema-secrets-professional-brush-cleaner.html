            <li>I loved the way this stuff cleaned my makeup brushes</li>
            <li>Works better than described!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried MANY!</li>
            <li>This product is Magic!</li>
            <li>Cleans great and easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, but you can easily end up using a lot.</li>
            <li>Amazing brush cleaner.</li>
            <li>that doesn&#x27;t deter you, this cleaner is absolutely the best.</li>
            <li>It made my brushes kind of smell.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell and it hasn&#x27;t affected the texture of my brushes whatsoever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way too strong!  </li>
            <li>This product does have a strong odor that has a vanilla chemical smell, but all in all it does an effective job cleaning my brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure i just have to get used to it</li>
            <li>Just make sure to save up because you will get spoiled by using this product and will want more and more.</li>
            <li>You will do better with dish detergent</li>
            <li>I like how it works, but would love if it came unscented or with a lighter scent.</li>
            <li>After cleaning, the brushes feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love it even more if we could choose a scent, something citrus would be nice for those of us who are repelled by sickly sweet floral scents.</li>
            <li>It leaves your brushes smelling like vanilla and the scent lasts forever too so every time you use your brush you are hit with a light refreshing vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>It smells so good and dries fast.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product out after listening to so many reviews about it.</li>
            <li>and I will update my review if i have found a more product-efficient way to clean it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Cinema secrets brush cleaner dries quickly too!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more economical.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to give this 4.5 stars but it cleans too amazingly not to get an excellent review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The strong smell I was worried about went away as the product evaporated, leaving only a pleasant vanilla scent on my brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Never using anything else to clean my brushes.</li>
            <li>That is what makes this item particularly special.</li>
            <li>Plus, it has a very pleasant, yet not overwhelming, vanilla scent to accompany it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolute favorite brush cleaner</li>
            <li>warning: Everything will smell like sweet floral vanilla, including your body if you use the brushes within a week of cleaning them.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong at first.</li>
            <li>However, it cleans the brushes well, and does dtry extremely quickly.  </li>
            <li>It does what it says, cleans and sanitizes, dries quickly.....</li>
            <li>I would suggest buying the largest size because you will go through this quickly.</li>
            <li>This cleanser really gets my makeup brushes clean!</li>
            <li>I have never had any other kind of brush cleaner be able to do that.</li>
            <li>Super easy and fast.</li>
            <li>I can imagine it being hard for most people, including myself, to invest in a costly cleanser when there are many more brush cleaners available in the market.</li>
            <li>I originally gave this a 5 star when I first tried it.</li>
            <li>I think the best thing about this cleanser though, is that after using it, your brushes will be dry almost immediately and you can go right back to using them within a minute or two of cleaning them.</li>
            <li>It kind of smells like public bathroom cleane .</li>
            <li>If you are questioning whether or not to get this because of the price, don&#x27;t hesitate, it is WELL worth the investment.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I had hoped to just be able to put this in the spray bottle i used with my old brush cleaner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not totally offensive, and honestly it cleans the brushes</li>
            <li>Although I love that it makes brush cleaning faster, it started to make my brushes turn blue.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t believe how much filth this solution sacked out of my makeup brushes!</li>
            <li>After using my CS cleaner It instantly removed all remaining residue that i had not been able to remove for months</li>
            <li>and I feel that I&#x27;ve used a ton of this product (mostly from my blush brushes) despite only dipping in the tiniest bit of my brush into the cleanser.</li>
            <li>so it is very well worth it.</li>
            <li>Really cleaned my brushes.</li>
            <li>it goes fast.</li>
            <li>When I use my makeup brushes, I don&#x27;t really like to smell any &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; because I feel like there are chemicals on the brush</li>
            <li>I bought the  smallest contain of this product and I instantly regretted not buying more due to how fabulous this product is.  </li>
            <li>This does clean brushes, but the scent is overpowering and it can stain light-colored brushes blue.</li>
            <li>The main advantage to this cleaner is the fast drying time.</li>
            <li>It sure beats cleaning brushes the old fashioned way of soaking, scrubbing, &amp; waiting forever for brushes to dry.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more than half</li>
            <li>Next time I will buy the bigger economy size because depending upon how many brushes you need cleaned</li>
            <li>But I think I&#x27;m going to go back to my regular brush cleaning soap once I use this up, as I prefer the softness I get from that more.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the money, having cleaning makeup brushes is crucial and this product really does work, just try to use it sparingly</li>
            <li>The first towel was totally colored.</li>
            <li>for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been previously using the M.A.C brush cleaner as my primary cleanser because it was cheaper, and it got the job done.  </li>
            <li>so the large bottle will last forever.</li>
            <li>I can clean all my makeup brushes in 10 minutes or less.</li>
            <li>If you dont follow directions and submerge your whole brush in solution it will hold onto it and stain blue.</li>
            <li>tried it and all I can say is: wow.</li>
            <li>It did clean &amp; take off ALL the make up on my Sigma brushes within a few seconds.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is stuff is magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li>I was also a little turned off by the strong smell of the liquid product and worried that it might make my brushes smell (like mineral spirits mixed with vanilla scent)&lt;br</li>
            <li>The directions say to dip your brush in the cleanser only a third of the way in to prevent you from using too much product as your brush will absorb the rest.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was thicker, but apparently it is since the spray can&#x27;t pump it out.  </li>
            <li>I hate the smell of the product but it leaves all the brushes very clean and it does dry pretty quickly after use, i do recommend using it</li>
            <li>I needed 3 PAPER TOWELS FOR ONE BRUSH, that&#x27;s how much makeup came out of a brush that had recently been cleaned by a store brand wet cleanser.</li>
            <li>The smell is a strong vanilla smell with an alcohol smell behind it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about contaminating my face with dirty brushes and would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to keep things clean</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product above all other cleaners.</li>
            <li> There is a smell in my brushes after they dry</li>
            <li> What led me to finally switch to this long-sought-after  product was that while my previously cleanser was getting the job done</li>
            <li> Just be careful with your dual fiber brushes.</li>
            <li> empty</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, I&#x27;ve never used a no-rinse brush cleanser and didn&#x27;t know how well it would work.</li>
            <li> Not really sure if I would recommend it or not because everyone has different opinions and preferences.</li>
            <li> , I would just suggest finding a way use less, like a spray bottle or something.</li>
            <li> The cleaner does also leave a vanilla scent on your brushes for a few days.</li>
            <li> I feel that a lot of product is wasted when using.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll continue to use this after I finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> , I know it&#x27;s a small amount but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was the brushes I was using, or if it was the product itself, but I didn&#x27;t like the after effect on my brushes.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s a problem....</li>
            <li> Also, the product made the bristles on my brush really stiff and hard.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a little expensive</li>
            <li> You dip the brush into this stuff and then wipe it off on a paper towel until it no longer leaves makeup behind...</li>
            <li> I use it daily for the brushes that are used for liquid application (foundation, concealer, shadow base, etc)</li>
            <li> I just with this cleaner wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> It cleans so thoroughly, no matter how dirty your brushes are.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anyone will be disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> but I hate the smell.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! Works better than described! Buy now!!</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of the product but it leaves all the brushes very clean and it does dry pretty quickly after use, i do recommend using it and it&#x27;s a bit pricey for the size that your getting for 12.99.</li>
            <li> It kind of smells like public bathroom cleane .</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product &amp; will buy it again. It did clean &amp; take off ALL the make up on my Sigma brushes within a few seconds. It does have a pleasant Vanilla scent which is a bonus. It sure beats cleaning brushes the old fashioned way of soaking, scrubbing, &amp; waiting forever for brushes to dry. I bought the 4 oz. bottle. Next time I will buy the bigger economy size because depending upon how many brushes you need cleaned it&#x27;s more economical.</li>
            <li> This product does have a strong odor that has a vanilla chemical smell, but all in all it does an effective job cleaning my brushes. Just be careful with your dual fiber brushes. If you dont follow directions and submerge your whole brush in solution it will hold onto it and stain blue. Still, it dries fully in about 8 minutes. Thats a plus. The cleaner does also leave a vanilla scent on your brushes for a few days.</li>
            <li> It cleaned my brushes well. But it turned the bristles blue...??? Is that supposed to happen?</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is stuff is magic in a bottle. It cleans so thoroughly, no matter how dirty your brushes are. It leaves your brushes smelling like vanilla and the scent lasts forever too so every time you use your brush you are hit with a light refreshing vanilla scent. It only takes a tiny bit to get the job done too so the large bottle will last forever. I think the best thing about this cleanser though, is that after using it, your brushes will be dry almost immediately and you can go right back to using them within a minute or two of cleaning them. That is what makes this item particularly special. I have never had any other kind of brush cleaner be able to do that. If you are questioning whether or not to get this because of the price, don&#x27;t hesitate, it is WELL worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, I&#x27;ve never used a no-rinse brush cleanser and didn&#x27;t know how well it would work. I was also a little turned off by the strong smell of the liquid product and worried that it might make my brushes smell (like mineral spirits mixed with vanilla scent)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it and all I can say is: wow. You dip the brush into this stuff and then wipe it off on a paper towel until it no longer leaves makeup behind... I needed 3 PAPER TOWELS FOR ONE BRUSH, that&#x27;s how much makeup came out of a brush that had recently been cleaned by a store brand wet cleanser. The first towel was totally colored. The strong smell I was worried about went away as the product evaporated, leaving only a pleasant vanilla scent on my brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying this again, it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Really cleaned my brushes. The smell is a bit strong at first.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works great! Absolute favorite brush cleaner and I&#x27;ve tried MANY! I&#x27;ve been working as a make up artist over 12 years. Cinema secrets brush cleaner dries quickly too!</li>
            <li> Did a great job cleaning my brushes and smells like vanilla once it dries!</li>
            <li> I originally gave this a 5 star when I first tried it. Although I love that it makes brush cleaning faster, it started to make my brushes turn blue. Not sure if I&#x27;ll continue to use this after I finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> Really good makeup brush cleaner. I also like the vanilla scent,light, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> The best brush cleaner!</li>
            <li> This does clean brushes, but the scent is overpowering and it can stain light-colored brushes blue. The main advantage to this cleaner is the fast drying time. But I think I&#x27;m going to go back to my regular brush cleaning soap once I use this up, as I prefer the softness I get from that more.</li>
            <li> This product is Magic! Couldn&#x27;t believe how much filth this solution sacked out of my makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> This is the best brush cleaner and it has a wonderful scent. Cleans great and easily. I would recommend this product above all other cleaners.</li>
            <li> I bought the  smallest contain of this product and I instantly regretted not buying more due to how fabulous this product is.  Yes, it&#x27;s definitely costly, but you truly get what you pay for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been previously using the M.A.C brush cleaner as my primary cleanser because it was cheaper, and it got the job done.  I can imagine it being hard for most people, including myself, to invest in a costly cleanser when there are many more brush cleaners available in the market. What led me to finally switch to this long-sought-after  product was that while my previously cleanser was getting the job done I wanted my  brushes to be in pristine condition for myself and my clients,  although I had cleaned my brushes thoroughly, there was still some residue I could not remove from my brushes, especially lipsticks.  After using my CS cleaner It instantly removed all remaining residue that i had not been able to remove for months (ew, I know).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I&#x27;m now hooked on this product and it will replace my current brush cleaner.  Plus, it has a very pleasant, yet not overwhelming, vanilla scent to accompany it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why only 4 stars? I feel that a lot of product is wasted when using.  The directions say to dip your brush in the cleanser only a third of the way in to prevent you from using too much product as your brush will absorb the rest.  I&#x27;ve only cleansed my brushes once and I feel that I&#x27;ve used a ton of this product (mostly from my blush brushes) despite only dipping in the tiniest bit of my brush into the cleanser. I&#x27;m sure i just have to get used to it and I will update my review if i have found a more product-efficient way to clean it. I&#x27;m going to try using it from a squirt bottle and see if misting my brushes in product receives similar results.</li>
            <li> I had hoped to just be able to put this in the spray bottle i used with my old brush cleaner.  I didn&#x27;t think it was thicker, but apparently it is since the spray can&#x27;t pump it out.  However, it cleans the brushes well, and does dtry extremely quickly.  I use it daily for the brushes that are used for liquid application (foundation, concealer, shadow base, etc)</li>
            <li> Smell so good. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to give this 4.5 stars but it cleans too amazingly not to get an excellent review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only warning: Everything will smell like sweet floral vanilla, including your body if you use the brushes within a week of cleaning them. It&#x27;s overpowering vanilla, for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that doesn&#x27;t deter you, this cleaner is absolutely the best. I&#x27;d love it even more if we could choose a scent, something citrus would be nice for those of us who are repelled by sickly sweet floral scents.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, but you can easily end up using a lot. I think it&#x27;s a little expensive but it&#x27;s worth the money, having cleaning makeup brushes is crucial and this product really does work, just try to use it sparingly, I bought the one ounce and cleaned 4 brushes and it&#x27;s more than half empty, I know it&#x27;s a small amount but still- it goes fast. I don&#x27;t think anyone will be disappointed with this product, I would just suggest finding a way use less, like a spray bottle or something.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush cleaner. I can clean all my makeup brushes in 10 minutes or less. I pour a bit of the solution into a plastic bowl and dip my brushes in then wipe them off on a paper towel. The smell is a strong vanilla smell with an alcohol smell behind it. Reminds me of my dad&#x27;s trumpet cleaner! It&#x27;s not totally offensive, and honestly it cleans the brushes so well I don&#x27;t mind it. Wish I would have gotten a larger size. I will be buying another one soon!</li>
            <li> I just with this cleaner wasn&#x27;t so expensive. It is the best brush cleaner that I have ever come across- so it is very well worth it. Just make sure to save up because you will get spoiled by using this product and will want more and more.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product out after listening to so many reviews about it. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the brushes I was using, or if it was the product itself, but I didn&#x27;t like the after effect on my brushes. It made my brushes kind of smell. When I use my makeup brushes, I don&#x27;t really like to smell any &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; because I feel like there are chemicals on the brush and then I&#x27;m wiping the chemicals on my face, which is what I do not want. Also, the product made the bristles on my brush really stiff and hard. And that didn&#x27;t go away. I had to wash with them under water to get rid of the stiffness. Overall, I personally did not like the product. Not really sure if I would recommend it or not because everyone has different opinions and preferences. But if you do try it out, just go with the smallest size, in case you end up not liking it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! Never using anything else to clean my brushes. Super easy and fast.</li>
            <li> You will do better with dish detergent</li>
            <li> Best brush cleaner out there !!!</li>
            <li> This cleanser really gets my makeup brushes clean! I transferred it to a spray bottle to make things easier and so I wouldn&#x27;t waste too much product. It doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell and it hasn&#x27;t affected the texture of my brushes whatsoever. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about contaminating my face with dirty brushes and would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to keep things clean</li>
            <li> It does what it says, cleans and sanitizes, dries quickly..... but I hate the smell.  It&#x27;s way too strong!  I like how it works, but would love if it came unscented or with a lighter scent.</li>
            <li> Awesome and easy to use brush cleaner!</li>
            <li> It cleans the brushes quite well. After cleaning, the brushes feel nice and smooth. not a fan of the scent though.</li>
            <li> I loved the way this stuff cleaned my makeup brushes and I would give it a 5 star rating but after i read the ingredients online, I am concerned about words like hydrocarbon etc.  Not sure if it&#x27;s a problem....but am loving how it worked!!</li>
            <li> Best makeup cleanser! I will definetly repurchase. It smells so good and dries fast.</li>
            <li> this is the best thing ever, i will try to buy the huge bottle some day. There is a smell in my brushes after they dry but it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> Best brush cleaner I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I would suggest buying the largest size because you will go through this quickly.</li>
