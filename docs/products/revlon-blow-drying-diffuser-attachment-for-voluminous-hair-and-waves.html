            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>This diffuser is very good, in that it is built perfectly.</li>
            <li>plastic prongs do a very good job of holding hair in the diffuser and also keeping my scalp from getting too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>This diffuser gives me beautiful, bouncy curls with body.</li>
            <li>It holds the hair in the diffuser and gives great shape.</li>
            <li>Fits my hair dryer and works great on my hair</li>
            <li>and it is a great price.</li>
            <li>The diffuser is great, but don&#x27;t be decieved.</li>
            <li>But for the price I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li>However, it works great.</li>
            <li>This works great, stays on the dryer snugly, went on the barrel of the dryer no problem.</li>
            <li>now it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>so this is a great deal.</li>
            <li>It fits and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>This works great on my Revlon hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This one works great if you hold it on</li>
            <li>This is a great diffuser.</li>
            <li>Looks nice &amp; works if you have the perfect hair dryer for it.</li>
            <li>Great for the price, as well.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I have had diffusers that fits onto the dryer head before, and this one works great, but it keeps popping off when I use it.</li>
            <li>It was in great condition though.</li>
            <li>Price was great though...</li>
            <li>It fits great on my Conair Infiniti Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer with Cord Reel.</li>
            <li>Best results when your hair is flipped over by touching your chin to your chest.</li>
            <li>It fits easily and dries my hair perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I found this diffuser at Rite Aid for a really good price.  </li>
            <li>It also does a good job of diffusing the air.</li>
            <li>It fit perfectly on my Revlon 1875 dryer.</li>
            <li>You just have to give it a good push.  </li>
            <li>It was a good starter diffuser</li>
            <li>so I bought a $12 Revlon dryer at Target and it fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li>so it fit my dryer perfectly</li>
            <li>It a perfect fit for my hair dryer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the good: this diffuser works.</li>
            <li>Get a good look at the product zoom in if you can.</li>
            <li>Fits my revlon rvdr5108 and works good.</li>
            <li>I loved this diffuser until it broke.</li>
            <li>Fits perfect on my Revlon hair dryer (the cheap one from Target).</li>
            <li>This was a good idea for a product</li>
            <li>Personally I loved the quality of the product upon receipt.</li>
            <li>But it works well &amp; is a good price.</li>
            <li>Oh well, I don&#x27;t need to use it often and it was a good price.</li>
            <li>It looks like a good product.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those days when you don&#x27;t want to do a full blow out.</li>
            <li>It distrubutes the air evenly and not to strong very good drying too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just a very satisfied customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this would work great</li>
            <li>I have very healthy hair</li>
            <li>This product was a GREAT price, and I am so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this would be a great diffuser if it FIT THE DRYER!!  </li>
            <li>LOVE this diffuser!</li>
            <li>I love it!&#x60;</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>and I swear it adds more volume and drys faster!</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>Works great, good price &amp; got here quick.  </li>
            <li>The package say it fits almost all hair dryers and it fit mine just fine and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It worked great before that - fit on my hair dryer</li>
            <li>This diffuser is awesome,makes really nice curls.</li>
            <li>This is the best diffuser I have ever used, and the price is a real bargain.</li>
            <li>so you can compare your own dryer and see if it is similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You know, the kind that puts out heat.</li>
            <li>I own a Revlon blow dryer</li>
            <li>so this gives my hair a nice head start on drying during the winter months.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use this...not loving this item at this time.</li>
            <li>Apart from that, it&#x27;s a really nice diffuser</li>
            <li>This is an extremely nice diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Other than that - great product at a great price!</li>
            <li>Many tutorials online indicate high heat is best, so this diffuser just doesn&#x27;t make the cut.</li>
            <li>I did purchase this one from dan-d-deals, and they have the best customer service I&#x27;ve had the pleasure to experience with internet shopping so far.</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with Sexy Curly Hair to give my hair a nice beach wavy style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure it would fit on my dryer, but I was very happy when it snapped right on.  </li>
            <li>Fits right over the end of my blow dryer.. works great.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li>I was excited to make my hair look good today.</li>
            <li>It is made of very cheap plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fit perfectly onto my (very old) Revlon hairdryer.</li>
            <li>If I turn it just right it mostly stays in place, but I still can&#x27;t figure out exactly what position is the best, so</li>
            <li>would recommend this product to anyone looking for a diffuser to go with a light weight hair dryer!</li>
            <li>While it seems like this diffuser is nice, I had no way of finding out since it won&#x27;t fit my Sedu Revolution dryer.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with it overall.</li>
            <li>It works so well, and I am so glad she bought it.  </li>
            <li>This truly is a curly girl&#x27;s best friend when time is running short</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair look.    </li>
            <li>But I am so glad I went through with the purchase.</li>
            <li>And to my delight, it fit!</li>
            <li>and I liked the fact the Revlon diffuser indicated it fit most dryers.  </li>
            <li>Should have paid more attention to reviews</li>
            <li>Fits my philips dryer nicely, you just have to put some pressure for it to fit</li>
            <li>it was able to stay on.</li>
            <li>Both are top quality products, but the diffuser will not stay onto the hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will never ever be able attach it to ANY dryer.  </li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t work, you are out $6, if it does work for you, you will definitely be pleased.</li>
            <li>and i wanted to add some more texture and volume to it to make the curls more defined .</li>
            <li>Works better now that i have used it a couple times.</li>
            <li>The best way to explain this contraption is: Take your hand and position it like you&#x27;re grabbing something, then imagine a giant rubber band around your fingers.</li>
            <li>even more of a hassle.</li>
            <li>Since I have owned many diffusers over the years and never had this problem until now, I believe that the centerpiece is the cause.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it indicated that the design would fit most popular hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>I own a Remington and found that the design doesn&#x27;t fit and pops off while using the dryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been burned by touching this product while in</li>
            <li>And i&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than the one that came with the dryer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It fits most hair dryers and has not given me problems when travelling as it fitted most hotel hair dryers.</li>
            <li>I love this. :)</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t come close to fitting.  </li>
            <li>The diffuser works ok as a diffuser.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fit on very easily...</li>
            <li>And it was super cheap!!</li>
            <li>They issued a full refund and they were really nice about it, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li>For that reason I gave it three stars, but the price was pretty good.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>I have a normal conair blow-dryer and it works pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li>If you lost yours and can&#x27;t find one to fit, this will work, but it might be a good idea just to invest in a new hair-dryer that comes with its own diffuser attachment designed specifically for the product.</li>
            <li>I think mainly they are trying to avoid things getting too hot...but most good blowdryers have an auto cutoff feature if the blowdryer gets too</li>
            <li>my top requirement is that it must fit this diffuser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure a lot of people returned this item thinking it didn&#x27;t fit, not knowing that you REALLYY have to push it in there.</li>
            <li>Diffuser works great, fits on my hair dryer, and so far, I haven&#x27;t seen any problems.  </li>
            <li>You need to check on this before buying - to be sure yours will fit with it.</li>
            <li>Wish it fit better.</li>
            <li>At first I was thrilled with this product as I hadn&#x27;t been able to find a diffuser separate from a hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>Works fine but won&#x27;t fit most hair dryers.</li>
            <li>I have the Revlon Stylx hairdryer and it fits perfectly, but I have had issues with the diffuser popping off of other dryers when I take it with me on vacation.</li>
            <li>felt like I should write an accurate review of this product; because really, it&#x27;s quite good</li>
            <li>This slides on easily and adjusts to the size of the hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>but i set it on my chair and push the diffuser on that way and it went on easy and stayed on, but was easy to take off.</li>
            <li>It fit my blow dryer perfectly, although previous reviews stated fitting issues.  </li>
            <li>I have a Revlon hair dryer, which made it a perfect fit, but I think the design would work with other hair dryers.</li>
            <li>At first, I really liked the diffuser but today while trying to use it, it would not stay on the dryer.</li>
            <li>When I first opened it I thought it was a bit large, but after using it I realize that this is actually great because it dries my hair in no time.</li>
            <li>I think it is getting good use by its new owners.  </li>
            <li>This diffuser is just fine.</li>
            <li>the diffuser fits fine when inserted onto the barrel of the dryer, but once I turn it on, the vibration of the dryer causes the diffuser to pop off.</li>
            <li>Fits the Revlon RVDR5045 dryer just fine, and stays on.</li>
            <li>First, I really like this diffuser and think it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li>just fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely a great buy, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t need to buy a whole new blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Huge design flaw.  </li>
            <li>It fits both of my blowdryers because it has an expandable fit and is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>and, lo and behold, it fit and stayed in place.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t serve my purpose if I have to get a dryer as per the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;There should be specifications mentioned as per size, shape of the dryer nozzle required to be fit with the diffuser for consumer&#x27;s ease.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a diffuser to fit it.</li>
            <li>It does fit my \\&quot;Revlon Ceramic 1875 Ionic</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fit my Conair dryer</li>
            <li>This thing is supposed to fit every hairdryer but does not.</li>
            <li>It fits my blow dryer nicely, but after 10 minutes or so the plastic warms up too much and it falls off of my dryer.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit my dryer &#x3D; -</li>
            <li>so I thought this Revlon diffuser would fit on it.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m yet to use it since it didn&#x27;t fit on my blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a diffuser to fit my Revlon hairdryer, and this model is designed for that.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit any or our hair dryers</li>
            <li>I have 2 hairdryers and this fit on only one, and that&#x27;s not even a great fit.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t actually fit the hairdryer.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t fit at all</li>
            <li>I hope I can find one that will fit my dryer.</li>
            <li>I have two blow dryers and this didn&#x27;t fit either one.  </li>
            <li>(It does, however, say that it is supposed to fit ALL Revlon hairdryers).</li>
            <li>My hairdryer is a conair and there was no possibility of making this fit.</li>
            <li>The inside mouth of the diffuser then expands to fit the mouth of the dryer.</li>
            <li>As I look at the reviews I see a lot of people saying how it doesn&#x27;t fit their hair dryer.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li>The description does say the diffuser will fit all Revlon hair dryers however...</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t fit ANY of my REVLON dryers...</li>
            <li>, is there a diffuser that would fit my Revlon folding ionic hairdryer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cheap, yes.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>and i thought it would fit on the end of it.</li>
            <li>It seems too breakable, even it if did fit on the nozzle, for me to want to keep it.</li>
            <li>I have 2 Revlon hair dryers and it fit neither</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit my Revlon hair drier.</li>
            <li>It did fit my Revlon 1875 blow dryer</li>
            <li>Then there is flexible plastic that stretches to fit whatever size blow dryer</li>
            <li>I dont know how this would fit on ANY dryer...</li>
            <li>It adds fantastic volume to my hair and keeps my waves intact.</li>
            <li>Says it fit all hairdryers and it does not.</li>
            <li>The fitted side of the diffuser has flexible fingers inside so presumably it would fit any size nozzle.  </li>
            <li>However, fit IS an issue.</li>
            <li>I tried it on 3 hair blowers before I found one it fit.</li>
            <li>Could not get the item to fit</li>
            <li>But it just doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone have tips on which dryers fit well with this diffuser?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>This fits my blowdryer perfectly, may come of easily if you put it down while connected to the blowdrier, but it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for - I hadn&#x27;t been able to find a diffuser to fit my Revlon hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Fits over a classic blow dryer and is nicely priced.</li>
            <li>This works great for those of us with long hair.</li>
            <li>you use your blow dryer for more than 2-3 minutes, be aware of flying diffuser...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I bought this diffuser since I lost the one that originally came with my Revlon hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really excited about getting this diffuser.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll have to buy a new dryer that comes with its own diffuser in order to get what I want.  </li>
            <li>but with great volume because this product helps you to quickly dry your roots.</li>
            <li>Bought this at the local store because I wasn&#x27;t sure it would fit my hair dryer and wanted to be able to return it easily.  </li>
            <li>I can see how it might be easy to think it doesnt fit, at first.</li>
            <li>What I love about the RV480 is the large cupped shape.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>waste.&lt;br /&gt;Should be removed from Amazon right away!  </li>
            <li>Sassoon Cool touch 1600.</li>
            <li>My hair looks full and my curls look defined</li>
            <li>This would be good for a blow dryer that it actually fits on.</li>
            <li>This diffuser stays on fine until it gets warm, which is not long because well, it&#x27;s attached to a HAIR DRYER.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally straight but has a slight wave so this diffuser works perfect!  </li>
            <li>My hair looks less frizzy than it did when I used the cheap diffuser that came with my dryer, so that makes me happy, too.</li>
            <li>This problem could easily have been avoided if Amazon would just list a simple measurement for all the diffusers, which I&#x27;m sure manufacturers could easily provide.  </li>
            <li>But other then that it came on time and works great.</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;But, I&#x27;m a pretty creative girl and since I dont use it very often I jimmy rigged it to fit my dryer.&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser</li>
            <li>Lucky it didn&#x27;t catch on fire.</li>
            <li>These attachments make a tremendous difference in managing my curl.</li>
            <li>Universal and doesn&#x27;t fit either one of the 2 hair dryers I own.</li>
            <li>The very first time using it</li>
            <li>first, I thought it was not going to fit and was about to return it.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>This diffuser fit my Babyliss dryer on the first two times</li>
            <li>This is my very first diffuser</li>
            <li>It works great with my blow dryer, which is older (bigger) than the newer models.</li>
            <li>A diffuser this nice and large would normally be about $20 -</li>
            <li>The ONE downside (which is pretty significant) is that after about 8 minutes of constant use, the plastic heats up and becomes more flexible, and then the diffuser starts popping off the blow dryer!</li>
            <li>It fit my dyer pretty well, and I love the soft even curls I can get with the diffuser.</li>
            <li>I tried many diffusers in the past but this Revlon Ceramic Finger Diffuser is simply on of the best on the market.</li>
            <li>It popped right on my hair-dryer and has only fallen off once (but has been used dozens of times at this point so that&#x27;s pretty good).  </li>
            <li>You have to really force it onto your dryer but it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Great little add-on to my set of hair care products.  </li>
            <li>It slides right off the barrel of the dryer and gets very hot to the touch while in use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not in the mood to buy a new hair dryer when the one I have works great, but without the diffuser my hair is all flat &amp; lifeless.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t fit with my Revlon Ionic 1875W dryer, although it says &amp;#34; fits with all Revlon dryers.&amp;#34; Very upset</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t worth keeping.</li>
            <li>worth it?</li>
            <li>but my natural waves need an bit of help to produce a more curly look.  </li>
            <li>As the reviewer said, the trick is to push it on more completely -- until it snaps on.  </li>
            <li>I guess my next blow dryer purchase will be one that comes with its own diffuser.</li>
            <li>sometimes it slips off, but totally worth it for a blow dryer</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair, and have used this particular kind of diffuser for years.  </li>
            <li>The good thing about this item is that you may use it on other blowdryer models.</li>
            <li>Diffuser pops right off.</li>
            <li>i thought that maybe they just hadn&#x27;t put it on right.</li>
            <li>And you&#x27;re absolutely right.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t stay on - pops right off the hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>When I turn on the blowdryer, it slides right off from the force of the heated air.  </li>
            <li>I wish it did fit because it did do a decent job in my hair</li>
            <li>This fit my blowdryer nice and snug so at doesn&#x27;t fall off when upside down.  </li>
            <li>, this is the best $6 I have spent in a long time!  </li>
            <li>Based on previous reviews, I was not afraid to give it a good shove and listened for a click, but to no avail.</li>
            <li>It really diffuses the warm air so that it is not harsh, concentrated, and fast.</li>
            <li>I have generally voluminous hair with a bit of a kink and wanted to bring out more texture.  </li>
            <li>great, just had to gently but firmly push on to my hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I received my purchase very quickly and am completely satified with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This fit on my hair-dryer, gave me big soft curls, and was cheap, but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time nice and in new condition but didn&#x27;t fit my Revlon or other model of hair dryers.</li>
            <li>I held it in place until my fingers got too hot.  </li>
            <li>I should have done this in the first place, but was hoping that this Revlon one would work.</li>
            <li>This is my first diffuser.</li>
            <li>It lifts my hair and sculpts it into pretty, flowing waves.  </li>
            <li>According to my wife, this does exactly what she wanted and was 1/3 the cost of one from a beauty store.</li>
            <li>Made to adapt to many different sizes, this works very well!</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change about the diffuser is possibly more \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; that hold the hair up while drying.  </li>
            <li>I had hoped because this diffuser the same brand as my dryer, it would be better.</li>
            <li>It says it fits all Revlon hair dryers, but it doesn&#x27;t fit mine, and my dryer isn&#x27;t old, either.  </li>
            <li>At first I tried and tried to push the diffuser on the blow dryer but it would not go on.</li>
            <li>but if you have thick hair it would be great.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t stay on at first, but I did my research and read that an elastic band around the hairdryer will keep it on, and guess what...it does.</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it did pop off when I used the higher speed or heat.</li>
            <li>I can use the higher speed or heat with no problems at all.</li>
            <li>Glad there are still some diffusers that actually stay on my hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Universal to me means it fits all or most products.</li>
            <li>It does get REALLY hot</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own brand of hair dryers, it kept slipping off.</li>
            <li>Did not fit my hair dryer; but, if it had, I would have loved the product.</li>
            <li>I bought this item (6 days ago) to go with my new quiet hair dryer that did not come with its own diffuser.</li>
            <li>and so I was happy to replace it with something made by the same company (since I assumed that a universal diffuser made by the same brand as my hair dryer would fit said hair dryer).</li>
            <li>It does indicate this is the instructions for the diffuser, but since no hair-dryers offer only low heat, it&#x27;s clearly not the best option.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good for everyday use and a more loose wave rather than a curl.</li>
            <li>It really does work way better than just hair drying alone with my massive curly hair.  </li>
            <li>(although it&#x27;s sort of unavoidable when you&#x27;re blow drying it) and, although I am more happy about this than I am unhappy (because I have a LOT of hair!), it doesn&#x27;t add a significant amount of volume to your hair.  </li>
            <li>I run my Revlon Ionic dryer on medium heat on the high setting to get the  right amount of dryness without burning anything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it, but I think it would be worth just going out and buying a new hairdryer with a diffuser made for that dryer.</li>
            <li>This fit several dryers and works exactly as described</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair is blown dry and curly</li>
            <li>this diffuser is quite large and has a fits any size barrel.</li>
            <li>too large for my head/hair...</li>
            <li>It says its universal because the claws can stretch to fit pretty much any hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Overall though, it works fine as a diffuser.</li>
            <li>I love it, and will continue to use it, as it is a gentle way to dry my frizzy, wavy hair and not have the frizzes!</li>
            <li>I bought this diffuser to fit on a Revlon dryer that I&#x27;ve had for several years now after learning how to use a diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like to rate something as &amp;#34;I</li>
            <li>But it was too much tension; it just popped off - EVERY TIME.</li>
            <li>The only reason I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the fit issue.</li>
            <li>The trick is to find a dryer that is straight on the end.</li>
            <li>With my daughter&#x27;s help, I finally got the diffuser to fit my hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really complain.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon and Revlon.</li>
            <li>You really have to push the diffuser on until it snaps</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t get the diffuser on straight, it will pop off of the dryer.</li>
            <li>May fit some dryers, but It is definitely not universal, even among the Revlon brand.</li>
            <li>Before attempting to return it or get upset, you need to really push your blowdryer into it with FORCE for it to lock in.</li>
            <li>but it does like to launch straight off the drier as if rubber band propelled.</li>
            <li>Logic would tell you the universal diffuser made by Revlon would fit.     </li>
            <li>and when it pops off and falls onto the floor, the cheap \\&quot;metal\\&quot; piece in the middle bends and no longer fits into the diffuser.</li>
            <li>I really like this diffuser, but it always pops off the end of my blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I really want a diffuser because i have wavy hair</li>
            <li>- it doesn&#x27;t even fit the same brand of hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>it is just what I expected and the size is even more convenient.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The diffusers was very inexpensive so I cant complain too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stays on very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t fit my hair dryer, when I saw that it was &#x27;universal</li>
            <li>&#x27; I thought it would fit my standard blow dryer, not the case.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve put it on 3 different hair dryers (non Revlon), and it doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>I just brush my hair while blow drying so that it drys straight</li>
            <li>It fits on the dryer very well, distributes the heat evenly and makes my curls really pop out.  </li>
            <li>In fact, when I tried to get the diffuser to stay on the Revlon unit, the struggle was so intense I ended up dropping the dryer</li>
            <li>really like this...with this on the hair drier</li>
            <li>I had to do a bit of trouble shooting and my own rigging to get it to stay on my dryer.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it appears to be made out of very cheap, flimsy plastic.</li>
            <li>The original diffuser that came with my Conair dryer had started to melt a bit, and often left my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li>But im betting it would still pop off most other makers.</li>
            <li>but I feel like it made my hair more frizzy compared to other diffusers.</li>
            <li>The well to the diffuser is deep enough and the fingers in just the right place!!!</li>
            <li>It will go on but pops off very easily (i.e., just when using it normally or setting it down</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it is ceramic, and it drys my thick curls quickly without causing &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I may just need to get my technique down :)</li>
            <li>and I bought a new dryer that came with a diffuser so it fits!</li>
            <li>Fits reasonably well on my new Conair ceramic blow dryer.</li>
            <li>so I just kept it, but I ended up buying a whole new dryer with the fuser</li>
            <li>The plastic goes pretty small, but if the barrel of your blow dryer is more that 2 1/2 inches in diameter</li>
            <li>One thing I read on the reviews, and which happened to me at first -- the first time you put it on the dryer, it may scoot back off and act like it doesn&#x27;t want to connect.  </li>
            <li>and I suspect it would fit just about any dryer due to its smart design.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t be used on high speed or heat.</li>
            <li>I do highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Well made product and is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I purchased this diffuser from Ulta and had high hopes for it.  </li>
            <li>However I have used it with the fan setting on high and didn&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li>I carry this in my gym bag, and it been in use for about 6 months, so it may get jostled a little more than one for home use, but it broke.</li>
            <li>but I wish it stayed on the blowdryer a little better.</li>
            <li>So far I really like this diffuser.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical from reviews but it is great.</li>
            <li>I contacted customer service via Amazon and the people at Discount Jungle got back to me right away.  </li>
            <li>so the diffuser just popped right back off.  </li>
            <li>I can put it right up against my scalp and gently move the hair up to dry it in place..</li>
            <li>It must be kept on low, though, but that is a fine temp, especially if you&#x27;re using it close to the hair.  </li>
            <li>I read a lot of other reviews, stating it didn&#x27;t fit the blowdryer.</li>
            <li>Other reviews say these don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually a very good diffuser, but it&#x27;s silly to buy it without knowing how big it is.</li>
            <li>Let me just say, I&#x27;m looking for a new blowdryer and</li>
            <li>is on for a new one - any suggestions?</li>
            <li>this is arkward as we live 1/2hr drive from the closest drop-off.</li>
            <li>I live abroad and cannot find a diffuser anywhere.</li>
            <li>I will have to buy a new dryer.</li>
            <li>I get a new dryer</li>
            <li>Im a new Amazon user and have no clue what to do.</li>
            <li>I have two different hair dryers, different size nozzles, and this doesn&#x27;t fit either without popping off, so I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>It fit easily on my hair dryer, but you do have to have one that has a longer nozzle; dryers with short and thick nozzles will not accommodate this attachment.</li>
            <li>This one only fit on my tiny travel-size (folding) Babyliss dryer, which has a miniature barrel.  </li>
            <li>I bought this diffuser, hoping it would make my naturally curly hair look better when I blow dried</li>
            <li>/&gt;You fit the diffuser onto the barrel of your blow dryer by sliding the barrel into the open back of the diffuser.</li>
            <li>This was supposed to be a &#x27;universal&#x27; diffuser but the fact that it didn&#x27;t fit three different blow dryers I have tells me otherwise.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not clearly stated on Amazon that this diffuser is only for use on low heat / low speed, for good reason, it&#x27;s very light and has very little thermal mass.</li>
            <li>So, bottom line--if your hair doesn&#x27;t take very long to dry, and you won&#x27;t be using the diffuser longer than 8 minutes at a time, you might want to consider buying this product because it&#x27;s very effective and well-designed other than its falling off after 8 minutes of use.</li>
            <li>Stay away, stay very far away from this diffuser.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about a regular old dryer whipping the curls right out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>It was the exact same one and just what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Although this diffuser attachment did not fit on my main dryer, it did fit on my backup.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, you absolutely cannot use this on anything higher that low heat at low speed.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is meant to be universal only for full size dryers because I tried it with my Revlon Soft Feel 1875W Travel Dryer</li>
            <li>I did not want to try another &#x27;universal&#x27; diffuser, instead I just bought a whole new dryer with diffuser included.</li>
            <li>It has several flanges surrounded by a tight rubber band, and the idea is that the tip of the hair drier would fit between the flames and be held fast by the rubber band, however the flames are angled inward and the river band ends up pushing the diffuser of of the end of the drier.</li>
            <li>If your hair dryer is a little bigger, it would probably work better.</li>
            <li>As mentioned, universal diffuser, I expected it to fit around my Revlon hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and decided to also give my hair a break from the straightening iron.  </li>
            <li>I find myself re-inserting it quite frequently.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that Amazon fixed the situation by refunding my purchase.</li>
            <li>Cost just as much to ship it back as it cost</li>
            <li>I have been looking for one since my old one is so used and they no longer carry it at the store where I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I REALLY tried to make it stay, but short of duct tape, that diffuser is not staying on.</li>
            <li>It works just as well as my old one.  </li>
            <li>As soon as the air warms up, the diffuser tends to pop off of the end of the dryer, causing me to have to repeatedly adjust it and adding considerably to drying time</li>
            <li>Fits snugly on my old blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Does not fit Remington blow dryers but will fit ALL Revlon dryers.</li>
            <li>I could&#x27;t find this guy at any store near me (Walgreen or Rite aid) and I didn&#x27;t have time to go shopping for it.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>old)...</li>
            <li>I read nearly all the review before buying this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Its tames the frizz and allows the curls to follow its natural curl with out having to use lots of product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>soon (mine is 10 years old).</li>
            <li>I have to use an old dryer that I put away for emergencies.</li>
            <li>Worth the small price instead of buying a whole new hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This solution is super flimsy, but it actually does the trick of keeping the diffuser on for the 10 minutes it takes to dry my roots.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it cut down my drying time by a lot, and it made my wavy hair shiny, defined, and relatively frizz free.</li>
            <li>I read some other reviews saying they discovered that right before almost returning the thing.</li>
            <li>Fits like a glove and helps her to get the long tresses dry in quick time.</li>
            <li>The problem is the claws have no grip and will not stay on a large dryer and are too big for a smaller dryer.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Gives me lots of curl with its gentle dry.</li>
            <li>It allows your hair to dry fast without burning or cause damage to your hair.</li>
            <li>Even if it had fit, I would not be satisfied with it, because (1) there are very few &#x27;fingers&#x27;, and (2) the cup is very shallow, so if you have long hair or a lot of hair, it will just flow out of the top and your hair will not be very effectively dried during the diffusing process.</li>
            <li>on one side and therefore no longer stays locked in place creating a large hole in the center of the diffuser, defeating the purpose of it.     </li>
            <li>I read a review and then realized that you have push it on hard to fit.</li>
            <li>It fit on my blow dryer, but it was hard to put on.</li>
            <li>, you can only use this on a low setting; it states that in the instructions; and anyway, when you are working with curls you would never use a high setting --it destroys the curls, diffuser or no diffuser.</li>
            <li>It would go completely on, and then slowly slide right off!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;s suppose to be a universal fit.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed that this didn&#x27;t fit either of my dryers better.</li>
            <li>After reading up on products to help hold the curl in, it was apparent a diffuser was step one.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and have been using the same diffuser for LITERALLY 12 years!  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t even worth the trouble to return it...</li>
            <li>It is poorly made, made in China - and the claim that it fits most hair dryers is a joke</li>
            <li>hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser does get hot to the touch after a few mins of use, but given a few seconds to cool it&#x27;s no problem.</li>
            <li>To be fair, my blow dyer is a Con-Air and not a Revlon, and I think that has a lot to do with it, but it&#x27;s pretty annoying.</li>
            <li>The odd thing is that after that first use, the diffuser has not popped off once.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers said the diffuser did not fit properly and that might be true; however, if I didn&#x27;t put pressure on the diffuser when putting it on the dryer, I would have said the same thing.  </li>
            <li>I have really long hair, and it just takes way too long to dry using low (basically cool) air.  </li>
            <li>Once this universal diffuser arrives, you find out you can&#x27;t use the high heat or blow settings of the hairdryer, so hair takes longer to dry</li>
            <li>first I thought that it would not fit my dryer</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth the effort to return for $6, and it works if I hold the pieces together, but I&#x27;m disappointed that a universal diffuser isn&#x27;t even universal enough to work with its own brand of hair dryer.</li>
            <li>but when i leave it to dry naturally its all over the place.</li>
            <li>Your hair dries smooth, shinny with lots of body  and no frizz to my long thick hair.</li>
            <li>It would cost as much to send it back as it did to buy it, so might as well keep it and give myself a concussion or black eye every once in awhile.</li>
            <li>I expected that it might not fit my mini dryer, but it also doesn&#x27;t fit my Conair 1875 hairdryer, which is a pretty common size.</li>
            <li>It takes a little shove to pop it in place and then it&#x27;s a tight, solid, snug fit, as if it&#x27;s part of the dryer.</li>
            <li>The only things I really didn&#x27;t like were the extra little bits of frizz</li>

            <li> Awesome.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is very good, in that it is built perfectly.</li>
            <li> plastic prongs do a very good job of holding hair in the diffuser and also keeping my scalp from getting too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good luck!</li>
            <li> This diffuser gives me beautiful, bouncy curls with body.</li>
            <li> It holds the hair in the diffuser and gives great shape.</li>
            <li> Fits my hair dryer and works great on my hair</li>
            <li> and it is a great price.</li>
            <li> The diffuser is great, but don&#x27;t be decieved.</li>
            <li> But for the price I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> However, it works great.</li>
            <li> This works great, stays on the dryer snugly, went on the barrel of the dryer no problem.</li>
            <li> now it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> so this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> It fits and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> This works great on my Revlon hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This one works great if you hold it on</li>
            <li> This is a great diffuser.</li>
            <li> Looks nice &amp; works if you have the perfect hair dryer for it.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, as well.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I have had diffusers that fits onto the dryer head before, and this one works great, but it keeps popping off when I use it.</li>
            <li> It was in great condition though.</li>
            <li> Price was great though...</li>
            <li> It fits great on my Conair Infiniti Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer with Cord Reel.</li>
            <li> Best results when your hair is flipped over by touching your chin to your chest.</li>
            <li> It fits easily and dries my hair perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I found this diffuser at Rite Aid for a really good price.  </li>
            <li> It also does a good job of diffusing the air.</li>
            <li> It fit perfectly on my Revlon 1875 dryer.</li>
            <li> You just have to give it a good push.  </li>
            <li> It was a good starter diffuser</li>
            <li> so I bought a $12 Revlon dryer at Target and it fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li> so it fit my dryer perfectly</li>
            <li> It a perfect fit for my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the good: this diffuser works.</li>
            <li> Get a good look at the product zoom in if you can.</li>
            <li> Fits my revlon rvdr5108 and works good.</li>
            <li> I loved this diffuser until it broke.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect on my Revlon hair dryer (the cheap one from Target).</li>
            <li> This was a good idea for a product</li>
            <li> Personally I loved the quality of the product upon receipt.</li>
            <li> But it works well &amp; is a good price.</li>
            <li> Oh well, I don&#x27;t need to use it often and it was a good price.</li>
            <li> It looks like a good product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those days when you don&#x27;t want to do a full blow out.</li>
            <li> It distrubutes the air evenly and not to strong very good drying too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a very satisfied customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this would work great</li>
            <li> I have very healthy hair</li>
            <li> This product was a GREAT price, and I am so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this would be a great diffuser if it FIT THE DRYER!!  </li>
            <li> LOVE this diffuser!</li>
            <li> I love it!&#x60;</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> and I swear it adds more volume and drys faster!</li>
            <li> i love it!</li>
            <li> Works great, good price &amp; got here quick.  </li>
            <li> The package say it fits almost all hair dryers and it fit mine just fine and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It worked great before that - fit on my hair dryer</li>
            <li> This diffuser is awesome,makes really nice curls.</li>
            <li> This is the best diffuser I have ever used, and the price is a real bargain.</li>
            <li> so you can compare your own dryer and see if it is similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You know, the kind that puts out heat.</li>
            <li> I own a Revlon blow dryer</li>
            <li> so this gives my hair a nice head start on drying during the winter months.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this...not loving this item at this time.</li>
            <li> Apart from that, it&#x27;s a really nice diffuser</li>
            <li> This is an extremely nice diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Other than that - great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Many tutorials online indicate high heat is best, so this diffuser just doesn&#x27;t make the cut.</li>
            <li> I did purchase this one from dan-d-deals, and they have the best customer service I&#x27;ve had the pleasure to experience with internet shopping so far.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with Sexy Curly Hair to give my hair a nice beach wavy style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure it would fit on my dryer, but I was very happy when it snapped right on.  </li>
            <li> Fits right over the end of my blow dryer.. works great.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> I was excited to make my hair look good today.</li>
            <li> It is made of very cheap plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fit perfectly onto my (very old) Revlon hairdryer.</li>
            <li> If I turn it just right it mostly stays in place, but I still can&#x27;t figure out exactly what position is the best, so</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to anyone looking for a diffuser to go with a light weight hair dryer!</li>
            <li> While it seems like this diffuser is nice, I had no way of finding out since it won&#x27;t fit my Sedu Revolution dryer.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with it overall.</li>
            <li> It works so well, and I am so glad she bought it.  </li>
            <li> This truly is a curly girl&#x27;s best friend when time is running short</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair look.    </li>
            <li> But I am so glad I went through with the purchase.</li>
            <li> And to my delight, it fit!</li>
            <li> and I liked the fact the Revlon diffuser indicated it fit most dryers.  </li>
            <li> Should have paid more attention to reviews</li>
            <li> Fits my philips dryer nicely, you just have to put some pressure for it to fit</li>
            <li> it was able to stay on.</li>
            <li> Both are top quality products, but the diffuser will not stay onto the hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will never ever be able attach it to ANY dryer.  </li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t work, you are out $6, if it does work for you, you will definitely be pleased.</li>
            <li> and i wanted to add some more texture and volume to it to make the curls more defined .</li>
            <li> Works better now that i have used it a couple times.</li>
            <li> The best way to explain this contraption is: Take your hand and position it like you&#x27;re grabbing something, then imagine a giant rubber band around your fingers.</li>
            <li> even more of a hassle.</li>
            <li> Since I have owned many diffusers over the years and never had this problem until now, I believe that the centerpiece is the cause.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it indicated that the design would fit most popular hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> I own a Remington and found that the design doesn&#x27;t fit and pops off while using the dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been burned by touching this product while in</li>
            <li> And i&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than the one that came with the dryer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It fits most hair dryers and has not given me problems when travelling as it fitted most hotel hair dryers.</li>
            <li> I love this. :)</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t come close to fitting.  </li>
            <li> The diffuser works ok as a diffuser.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit on very easily...</li>
            <li> And it was super cheap!!</li>
            <li> They issued a full refund and they were really nice about it, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> For that reason I gave it three stars, but the price was pretty good.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I have a normal conair blow-dryer and it works pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li> If you lost yours and can&#x27;t find one to fit, this will work, but it might be a good idea just to invest in a new hair-dryer that comes with its own diffuser attachment designed specifically for the product.</li>
            <li> I think mainly they are trying to avoid things getting too hot...but most good blowdryers have an auto cutoff feature if the blowdryer gets too</li>
            <li> my top requirement is that it must fit this diffuser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure a lot of people returned this item thinking it didn&#x27;t fit, not knowing that you REALLYY have to push it in there.</li>
            <li> Diffuser works great, fits on my hair dryer, and so far, I haven&#x27;t seen any problems.  </li>
            <li> You need to check on this before buying - to be sure yours will fit with it.</li>
            <li> Wish it fit better.</li>
            <li> At first I was thrilled with this product as I hadn&#x27;t been able to find a diffuser separate from a hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> Works fine but won&#x27;t fit most hair dryers.</li>
            <li> I have the Revlon Stylx hairdryer and it fits perfectly, but I have had issues with the diffuser popping off of other dryers when I take it with me on vacation.</li>
            <li> felt like I should write an accurate review of this product; because really, it&#x27;s quite good</li>
            <li> This slides on easily and adjusts to the size of the hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> but i set it on my chair and push the diffuser on that way and it went on easy and stayed on, but was easy to take off.</li>
            <li> It fit my blow dryer perfectly, although previous reviews stated fitting issues.  </li>
            <li> I have a Revlon hair dryer, which made it a perfect fit, but I think the design would work with other hair dryers.</li>
            <li> At first, I really liked the diffuser but today while trying to use it, it would not stay on the dryer.</li>
            <li> When I first opened it I thought it was a bit large, but after using it I realize that this is actually great because it dries my hair in no time.</li>
            <li> I think it is getting good use by its new owners.  </li>
            <li> This diffuser is just fine.</li>
            <li> the diffuser fits fine when inserted onto the barrel of the dryer, but once I turn it on, the vibration of the dryer causes the diffuser to pop off.</li>
            <li> Fits the Revlon RVDR5045 dryer just fine, and stays on.</li>
            <li> First, I really like this diffuser and think it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> just fine</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely a great buy, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t need to buy a whole new blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Huge design flaw.  </li>
            <li> It fits both of my blowdryers because it has an expandable fit and is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> and, lo and behold, it fit and stayed in place.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t serve my purpose if I have to get a dryer as per the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;There should be specifications mentioned as per size, shape of the dryer nozzle required to be fit with the diffuser for consumer&#x27;s ease.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a diffuser to fit it.</li>
            <li> It does fit my \\&quot;Revlon Ceramic 1875 Ionic</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit my Conair dryer</li>
            <li> This thing is supposed to fit every hairdryer but does not.</li>
            <li> It fits my blow dryer nicely, but after 10 minutes or so the plastic warms up too much and it falls off of my dryer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit my dryer &#x3D; -</li>
            <li> so I thought this Revlon diffuser would fit on it.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m yet to use it since it didn&#x27;t fit on my blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a diffuser to fit my Revlon hairdryer, and this model is designed for that.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit any or our hair dryers</li>
            <li> I have 2 hairdryers and this fit on only one, and that&#x27;s not even a great fit.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t actually fit the hairdryer.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t fit at all</li>
            <li> I hope I can find one that will fit my dryer.</li>
            <li> I have two blow dryers and this didn&#x27;t fit either one.  </li>
            <li> (It does, however, say that it is supposed to fit ALL Revlon hairdryers).</li>
            <li> My hairdryer is a conair and there was no possibility of making this fit.</li>
            <li> The inside mouth of the diffuser then expands to fit the mouth of the dryer.</li>
            <li> As I look at the reviews I see a lot of people saying how it doesn&#x27;t fit their hair dryer.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li> The description does say the diffuser will fit all Revlon hair dryers however...</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t fit ANY of my REVLON dryers...</li>
            <li> , is there a diffuser that would fit my Revlon folding ionic hairdryer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cheap, yes.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> and i thought it would fit on the end of it.</li>
            <li> It seems too breakable, even it if did fit on the nozzle, for me to want to keep it.</li>
            <li> I have 2 Revlon hair dryers and it fit neither</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit my Revlon hair drier.</li>
            <li> It did fit my Revlon 1875 blow dryer</li>
            <li> Then there is flexible plastic that stretches to fit whatever size blow dryer</li>
            <li> I dont know how this would fit on ANY dryer...</li>
            <li> It adds fantastic volume to my hair and keeps my waves intact.</li>
            <li> Says it fit all hairdryers and it does not.</li>
            <li> The fitted side of the diffuser has flexible fingers inside so presumably it would fit any size nozzle.  </li>
            <li> However, fit IS an issue.</li>
            <li> I tried it on 3 hair blowers before I found one it fit.</li>
            <li> Could not get the item to fit</li>
            <li> But it just doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone have tips on which dryers fit well with this diffuser?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> This fits my blowdryer perfectly, may come of easily if you put it down while connected to the blowdrier, but it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for - I hadn&#x27;t been able to find a diffuser to fit my Revlon hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Fits over a classic blow dryer and is nicely priced.</li>
            <li> This works great for those of us with long hair.</li>
            <li> you use your blow dryer for more than 2-3 minutes, be aware of flying diffuser...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser since I lost the one that originally came with my Revlon hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really excited about getting this diffuser.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll have to buy a new dryer that comes with its own diffuser in order to get what I want.  </li>
            <li> but with great volume because this product helps you to quickly dry your roots.</li>
            <li> Bought this at the local store because I wasn&#x27;t sure it would fit my hair dryer and wanted to be able to return it easily.  </li>
            <li> I can see how it might be easy to think it doesnt fit, at first.</li>
            <li> What I love about the RV480 is the large cupped shape.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> waste.&lt;br /&gt;Should be removed from Amazon right away!  </li>
            <li> Sassoon Cool touch 1600.</li>
            <li> My hair looks full and my curls look defined</li>
            <li> This would be good for a blow dryer that it actually fits on.</li>
            <li> This diffuser stays on fine until it gets warm, which is not long because well, it&#x27;s attached to a HAIR DRYER.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally straight but has a slight wave so this diffuser works perfect!  </li>
            <li> My hair looks less frizzy than it did when I used the cheap diffuser that came with my dryer, so that makes me happy, too.</li>
            <li> This problem could easily have been avoided if Amazon would just list a simple measurement for all the diffusers, which I&#x27;m sure manufacturers could easily provide.  </li>
            <li> But other then that it came on time and works great.</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;But, I&#x27;m a pretty creative girl and since I dont use it very often I jimmy rigged it to fit my dryer.&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser</li>
            <li> Lucky it didn&#x27;t catch on fire.</li>
            <li> These attachments make a tremendous difference in managing my curl.</li>
            <li> Universal and doesn&#x27;t fit either one of the 2 hair dryers I own.</li>
            <li> The very first time using it</li>
            <li> first, I thought it was not going to fit and was about to return it.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> This diffuser fit my Babyliss dryer on the first two times</li>
            <li> This is my very first diffuser</li>
            <li> It works great with my blow dryer, which is older (bigger) than the newer models.</li>
            <li> A diffuser this nice and large would normally be about $20 -</li>
            <li> The ONE downside (which is pretty significant) is that after about 8 minutes of constant use, the plastic heats up and becomes more flexible, and then the diffuser starts popping off the blow dryer!</li>
            <li> It fit my dyer pretty well, and I love the soft even curls I can get with the diffuser.</li>
            <li> I tried many diffusers in the past but this Revlon Ceramic Finger Diffuser is simply on of the best on the market.</li>
            <li> It popped right on my hair-dryer and has only fallen off once (but has been used dozens of times at this point so that&#x27;s pretty good).  </li>
            <li> You have to really force it onto your dryer but it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Great little add-on to my set of hair care products.  </li>
            <li> It slides right off the barrel of the dryer and gets very hot to the touch while in use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in the mood to buy a new hair dryer when the one I have works great, but without the diffuser my hair is all flat &amp; lifeless.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t fit with my Revlon Ionic 1875W dryer, although it says &amp;#34; fits with all Revlon dryers.&amp;#34; Very upset</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t worth keeping.</li>
            <li> worth it?</li>
            <li> but my natural waves need an bit of help to produce a more curly look.  </li>
            <li> As the reviewer said, the trick is to push it on more completely -- until it snaps on.  </li>
            <li> I guess my next blow dryer purchase will be one that comes with its own diffuser.</li>
            <li> sometimes it slips off, but totally worth it for a blow dryer</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair, and have used this particular kind of diffuser for years.  </li>
            <li> The good thing about this item is that you may use it on other blowdryer models.</li>
            <li> Diffuser pops right off.</li>
            <li> i thought that maybe they just hadn&#x27;t put it on right.</li>
            <li> And you&#x27;re absolutely right.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t stay on - pops right off the hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> When I turn on the blowdryer, it slides right off from the force of the heated air.  </li>
            <li> I wish it did fit because it did do a decent job in my hair</li>
            <li> This fit my blowdryer nice and snug so at doesn&#x27;t fall off when upside down.  </li>
            <li> , this is the best $6 I have spent in a long time!  </li>
            <li> Based on previous reviews, I was not afraid to give it a good shove and listened for a click, but to no avail.</li>
            <li> It really diffuses the warm air so that it is not harsh, concentrated, and fast.</li>
            <li> I have generally voluminous hair with a bit of a kink and wanted to bring out more texture.  </li>
            <li> great, just had to gently but firmly push on to my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I received my purchase very quickly and am completely satified with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This fit on my hair-dryer, gave me big soft curls, and was cheap, but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time nice and in new condition but didn&#x27;t fit my Revlon or other model of hair dryers.</li>
            <li> I held it in place until my fingers got too hot.  </li>
            <li> I should have done this in the first place, but was hoping that this Revlon one would work.</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser.</li>
            <li> It lifts my hair and sculpts it into pretty, flowing waves.  </li>
            <li> According to my wife, this does exactly what she wanted and was 1/3 the cost of one from a beauty store.</li>
            <li> Made to adapt to many different sizes, this works very well!</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change about the diffuser is possibly more \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; that hold the hair up while drying.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped because this diffuser the same brand as my dryer, it would be better.</li>
            <li> It says it fits all Revlon hair dryers, but it doesn&#x27;t fit mine, and my dryer isn&#x27;t old, either.  </li>
            <li> At first I tried and tried to push the diffuser on the blow dryer but it would not go on.</li>
            <li> but if you have thick hair it would be great.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t stay on at first, but I did my research and read that an elastic band around the hairdryer will keep it on, and guess what...it does.</li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it did pop off when I used the higher speed or heat.</li>
            <li> I can use the higher speed or heat with no problems at all.</li>
            <li> Glad there are still some diffusers that actually stay on my hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Universal to me means it fits all or most products.</li>
            <li> It does get REALLY hot</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own brand of hair dryers, it kept slipping off.</li>
            <li> Did not fit my hair dryer; but, if it had, I would have loved the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this item (6 days ago) to go with my new quiet hair dryer that did not come with its own diffuser.</li>
            <li> and so I was happy to replace it with something made by the same company (since I assumed that a universal diffuser made by the same brand as my hair dryer would fit said hair dryer).</li>
            <li> It does indicate this is the instructions for the diffuser, but since no hair-dryers offer only low heat, it&#x27;s clearly not the best option.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for everyday use and a more loose wave rather than a curl.</li>
            <li> It really does work way better than just hair drying alone with my massive curly hair.  </li>
            <li> (although it&#x27;s sort of unavoidable when you&#x27;re blow drying it) and, although I am more happy about this than I am unhappy (because I have a LOT of hair!), it doesn&#x27;t add a significant amount of volume to your hair.  </li>
            <li> I run my Revlon Ionic dryer on medium heat on the high setting to get the  right amount of dryness without burning anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it, but I think it would be worth just going out and buying a new hairdryer with a diffuser made for that dryer.</li>
            <li> This fit several dryers and works exactly as described</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair is blown dry and curly</li>
            <li> this diffuser is quite large and has a fits any size barrel.</li>
            <li> too large for my head/hair...</li>
            <li> It says its universal because the claws can stretch to fit pretty much any hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Overall though, it works fine as a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I love it, and will continue to use it, as it is a gentle way to dry my frizzy, wavy hair and not have the frizzes!</li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser to fit on a Revlon dryer that I&#x27;ve had for several years now after learning how to use a diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like to rate something as &amp;#34;I</li>
            <li> But it was too much tension; it just popped off - EVERY TIME.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the fit issue.</li>
            <li> The trick is to find a dryer that is straight on the end.</li>
            <li> With my daughter&#x27;s help, I finally got the diffuser to fit my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really complain.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon and Revlon.</li>
            <li> You really have to push the diffuser on until it snaps</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t get the diffuser on straight, it will pop off of the dryer.</li>
            <li> May fit some dryers, but It is definitely not universal, even among the Revlon brand.</li>
            <li> Before attempting to return it or get upset, you need to really push your blowdryer into it with FORCE for it to lock in.</li>
            <li> but it does like to launch straight off the drier as if rubber band propelled.</li>
            <li> Logic would tell you the universal diffuser made by Revlon would fit.     </li>
            <li> and when it pops off and falls onto the floor, the cheap \\&quot;metal\\&quot; piece in the middle bends and no longer fits into the diffuser.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser, but it always pops off the end of my blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> I really want a diffuser because i have wavy hair</li>
            <li> - it doesn&#x27;t even fit the same brand of hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> it is just what I expected and the size is even more convenient.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The diffusers was very inexpensive so I cant complain too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stays on very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t fit my hair dryer, when I saw that it was &#x27;universal</li>
            <li> &#x27; I thought it would fit my standard blow dryer, not the case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put it on 3 different hair dryers (non Revlon), and it doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> I just brush my hair while blow drying so that it drys straight</li>
            <li> It fits on the dryer very well, distributes the heat evenly and makes my curls really pop out.  </li>
            <li> In fact, when I tried to get the diffuser to stay on the Revlon unit, the struggle was so intense I ended up dropping the dryer</li>
            <li> really like this...with this on the hair drier</li>
            <li> I had to do a bit of trouble shooting and my own rigging to get it to stay on my dryer.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it appears to be made out of very cheap, flimsy plastic.</li>
            <li> The original diffuser that came with my Conair dryer had started to melt a bit, and often left my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> But im betting it would still pop off most other makers.</li>
            <li> but I feel like it made my hair more frizzy compared to other diffusers.</li>
            <li> The well to the diffuser is deep enough and the fingers in just the right place!!!</li>
            <li> It will go on but pops off very easily (i.e., just when using it normally or setting it down</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it is ceramic, and it drys my thick curls quickly without causing &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I may just need to get my technique down :)</li>
            <li> and I bought a new dryer that came with a diffuser so it fits!</li>
            <li> Fits reasonably well on my new Conair ceramic blow dryer.</li>
            <li> so I just kept it, but I ended up buying a whole new dryer with the fuser</li>
            <li> The plastic goes pretty small, but if the barrel of your blow dryer is more that 2 1/2 inches in diameter</li>
            <li> One thing I read on the reviews, and which happened to me at first -- the first time you put it on the dryer, it may scoot back off and act like it doesn&#x27;t want to connect.  </li>
            <li> and I suspect it would fit just about any dryer due to its smart design.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be used on high speed or heat.</li>
            <li> I do highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Well made product and is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I purchased this diffuser from Ulta and had high hopes for it.  </li>
            <li> However I have used it with the fan setting on high and didn&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li> I carry this in my gym bag, and it been in use for about 6 months, so it may get jostled a little more than one for home use, but it broke.</li>
            <li> but I wish it stayed on the blowdryer a little better.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this diffuser.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical from reviews but it is great.</li>
            <li> I contacted customer service via Amazon and the people at Discount Jungle got back to me right away.  </li>
            <li> so the diffuser just popped right back off.  </li>
            <li> I can put it right up against my scalp and gently move the hair up to dry it in place..</li>
            <li> It must be kept on low, though, but that is a fine temp, especially if you&#x27;re using it close to the hair.  </li>
            <li> I read a lot of other reviews, stating it didn&#x27;t fit the blowdryer.</li>
            <li> Other reviews say these don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a very good diffuser, but it&#x27;s silly to buy it without knowing how big it is.</li>
            <li> Let me just say, I&#x27;m looking for a new blowdryer and</li>
            <li> is on for a new one - any suggestions?</li>
            <li> this is arkward as we live 1/2hr drive from the closest drop-off.</li>
            <li> I live abroad and cannot find a diffuser anywhere.</li>
            <li> I will have to buy a new dryer.</li>
            <li> I get a new dryer</li>
            <li> Im a new Amazon user and have no clue what to do.</li>
            <li> I have two different hair dryers, different size nozzles, and this doesn&#x27;t fit either without popping off, so I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> It fit easily on my hair dryer, but you do have to have one that has a longer nozzle; dryers with short and thick nozzles will not accommodate this attachment.</li>
            <li> This one only fit on my tiny travel-size (folding) Babyliss dryer, which has a miniature barrel.  </li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser, hoping it would make my naturally curly hair look better when I blow dried</li>
            <li> /&gt;You fit the diffuser onto the barrel of your blow dryer by sliding the barrel into the open back of the diffuser.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be a &#x27;universal&#x27; diffuser but the fact that it didn&#x27;t fit three different blow dryers I have tells me otherwise.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not clearly stated on Amazon that this diffuser is only for use on low heat / low speed, for good reason, it&#x27;s very light and has very little thermal mass.</li>
            <li> So, bottom line--if your hair doesn&#x27;t take very long to dry, and you won&#x27;t be using the diffuser longer than 8 minutes at a time, you might want to consider buying this product because it&#x27;s very effective and well-designed other than its falling off after 8 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> Stay away, stay very far away from this diffuser.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about a regular old dryer whipping the curls right out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> It was the exact same one and just what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Although this diffuser attachment did not fit on my main dryer, it did fit on my backup.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, you absolutely cannot use this on anything higher that low heat at low speed.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is meant to be universal only for full size dryers because I tried it with my Revlon Soft Feel 1875W Travel Dryer</li>
            <li> I did not want to try another &#x27;universal&#x27; diffuser, instead I just bought a whole new dryer with diffuser included.</li>
            <li> It has several flanges surrounded by a tight rubber band, and the idea is that the tip of the hair drier would fit between the flames and be held fast by the rubber band, however the flames are angled inward and the river band ends up pushing the diffuser of of the end of the drier.</li>
            <li> If your hair dryer is a little bigger, it would probably work better.</li>
            <li> As mentioned, universal diffuser, I expected it to fit around my Revlon hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and decided to also give my hair a break from the straightening iron.  </li>
            <li> I find myself re-inserting it quite frequently.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that Amazon fixed the situation by refunding my purchase.</li>
            <li> Cost just as much to ship it back as it cost</li>
            <li> I have been looking for one since my old one is so used and they no longer carry it at the store where I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I REALLY tried to make it stay, but short of duct tape, that diffuser is not staying on.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as my old one.  </li>
            <li> As soon as the air warms up, the diffuser tends to pop off of the end of the dryer, causing me to have to repeatedly adjust it and adding considerably to drying time</li>
            <li> Fits snugly on my old blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Does not fit Remington blow dryers but will fit ALL Revlon dryers.</li>
            <li> I could&#x27;t find this guy at any store near me (Walgreen or Rite aid) and I didn&#x27;t have time to go shopping for it.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> old)...</li>
            <li> I read nearly all the review before buying this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Its tames the frizz and allows the curls to follow its natural curl with out having to use lots of product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> soon (mine is 10 years old).</li>
            <li> I have to use an old dryer that I put away for emergencies.</li>
            <li> Worth the small price instead of buying a whole new hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This solution is super flimsy, but it actually does the trick of keeping the diffuser on for the 10 minutes it takes to dry my roots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it cut down my drying time by a lot, and it made my wavy hair shiny, defined, and relatively frizz free.</li>
            <li> I read some other reviews saying they discovered that right before almost returning the thing.</li>
            <li> Fits like a glove and helps her to get the long tresses dry in quick time.</li>
            <li> The problem is the claws have no grip and will not stay on a large dryer and are too big for a smaller dryer.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Gives me lots of curl with its gentle dry.</li>
            <li> It allows your hair to dry fast without burning or cause damage to your hair.</li>
            <li> Even if it had fit, I would not be satisfied with it, because (1) there are very few &#x27;fingers&#x27;, and (2) the cup is very shallow, so if you have long hair or a lot of hair, it will just flow out of the top and your hair will not be very effectively dried during the diffusing process.</li>
            <li> on one side and therefore no longer stays locked in place creating a large hole in the center of the diffuser, defeating the purpose of it.     </li>
            <li> I read a review and then realized that you have push it on hard to fit.</li>
            <li> It fit on my blow dryer, but it was hard to put on.</li>
            <li> , you can only use this on a low setting; it states that in the instructions; and anyway, when you are working with curls you would never use a high setting --it destroys the curls, diffuser or no diffuser.</li>
            <li> It would go completely on, and then slowly slide right off!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;s suppose to be a universal fit.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that this didn&#x27;t fit either of my dryers better.</li>
            <li> After reading up on products to help hold the curl in, it was apparent a diffuser was step one.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and have been using the same diffuser for LITERALLY 12 years!  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t even worth the trouble to return it...</li>
            <li> It is poorly made, made in China - and the claim that it fits most hair dryers is a joke</li>
            <li> hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser does get hot to the touch after a few mins of use, but given a few seconds to cool it&#x27;s no problem.</li>
            <li> To be fair, my blow dyer is a Con-Air and not a Revlon, and I think that has a lot to do with it, but it&#x27;s pretty annoying.</li>
            <li> The odd thing is that after that first use, the diffuser has not popped off once.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers said the diffuser did not fit properly and that might be true; however, if I didn&#x27;t put pressure on the diffuser when putting it on the dryer, I would have said the same thing.  </li>
            <li> I have really long hair, and it just takes way too long to dry using low (basically cool) air.  </li>
            <li> Once this universal diffuser arrives, you find out you can&#x27;t use the high heat or blow settings of the hairdryer, so hair takes longer to dry</li>
            <li> first I thought that it would not fit my dryer</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth the effort to return for $6, and it works if I hold the pieces together, but I&#x27;m disappointed that a universal diffuser isn&#x27;t even universal enough to work with its own brand of hair dryer.</li>
            <li> but when i leave it to dry naturally its all over the place.</li>
            <li> Your hair dries smooth, shinny with lots of body  and no frizz to my long thick hair.</li>
            <li> It would cost as much to send it back as it did to buy it, so might as well keep it and give myself a concussion or black eye every once in awhile.</li>
            <li> I expected that it might not fit my mini dryer, but it also doesn&#x27;t fit my Conair 1875 hairdryer, which is a pretty common size.</li>
            <li> It takes a little shove to pop it in place and then it&#x27;s a tight, solid, snug fit, as if it&#x27;s part of the dryer.</li>
            <li> The only things I really didn&#x27;t like were the extra little bits of frizz</li>
            <li> The bowl was the smallest of the three i purchased and would not fit most of my hair which is thick and long and goes to below my chest.</li>
            <li> Can only be used with such low heat and power settings that it would be faster to air dry.  </li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t immediately lock into place until I pushed pretty hard -</li>
            <li> It said universal, so I thought it would go with my Hot Tools blow dryer, but it didn&#x27;t fit :(</li>
            <li> It was flat</li>
            <li> I ordered the Revlon diffuser after deciding to give my hair a &#x27;break&#x27; from the flat iron every now and then.  </li>
            <li> You definitely need a long nozzle for this to go on.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it overheating my hair dryer as long as I have it on low heat.</li>
            <li> I would prefer if it was bigger, cause I have long hair.</li>
            <li> I had a diffuser just like this one years ago and it was so old that the middle piece was blowing out a little when the dryer was on</li>
            <li> The key is the bowl design that scrunches up and holds the curls while I dry my roots.  </li>
            <li> It was a channel diffuser, and my hair ended up in one big poof with a single curl.  </li>
            <li> It starts to melt - seriously - at any higher heat.</li>
            <li> Might work better on other dryers, but it&#x27;s not perfect.  </li>
            <li> And you really have to push hard for it to get on.</li>
            <li> It was also very open in the center</li>
            <li> As long as it fits your dryer, this is an affordable way to create salon-styles at home.      </li>
            <li> long.</li>
            <li> I used it, but then, on the third time I tried to use it, the silver disc in the center popped out and the diffuser popped off the dryer.</li>
            <li> It constantly kept slipping off mid-drying session and smacking me on the head/in the face.</li>
            <li> Until I find the metal center and pop it back in</li>
            <li> I actually use the fingers to fluff up my curly hair while I&#x27;m drying it.  </li>
            <li> I thought at first that it did not fit any of them and was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t frizz my hair or take too long to dry it.</li>
            <li> I tried to let my hair air dry for awhile, but it just takes too long when I have to go to work.</li>
            <li> I used this on average of every other day for just over a year when the metal disk in the metal popped out and could not be fixed.  </li>
            <li> No matter how hard I push, it just pops off (in fact the gray center pushes out because it&#x27;s not made for certain hair dryers).</li>
            <li> Saw the other reviews but thought it would work for me since my dryer is the same brand.  </li>
            <li> Even tried in on my other dryer with a smaller nozzle.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid I would break it, but that&#x27;s the only way it&#x27;ll fit onto your dryer.  </li>
            <li> It redistributes heat and helps with a curling product or smoothing blow dry.</li>
            <li> I hate to give this a low rating since I haven&#x27;t even used the actual product, but since it&#x27;s supposed to be universal and doesn&#x27;t fit my dryer, I thought I would warn anyone else who has the same dryer so that you are also not out the price of this diffuser.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say I didn&#x27;t actually get to try it since this universal diffuser did not fit my Revlong hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not universal at all,  unless universal is a dryer brand ...    Don&#x27;t waste your money .....</li>
            <li> it might not fit because that how big the opening on the back of the diffuser is.</li>
            <li> This is not a huge problem for me because I have short hair that only takes about 10 minutes to blow dry.</li>
            <li> Even though I have your average Revlon hair dryer, this supposed universal diffuser does not work.  </li>
            <li> Not because it was loose but because it would not grip and the angle and texture of the dryer would not keep it on.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this one will last as long as my previous one!</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t hold the curls at all and left my hair a mess.</li>
            <li> It takes a little extra strength to get it on the dryer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This clearly fits on all blow dryers; again, you have to push hard until it</li>
            <li> Hold to dry in place one time until almost completely dry, for less fuzz.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that it occasionally pops off.  </li>
            <li> I had it about 2 weeks and the silver center piece popped out because the edge securing it melted away.  </li>
            <li> the center disc popped out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this diffuser keeps slipping off while in use.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;clips\\&quot; that keep the center ceramic piece in place have melted (?)</li>
            <li> Paid $5 and it is well spent.</li>
            <li> so I have to be really careful when drying my hair.</li>
            <li> Though the diffuser is marketed as \\&quot;universal\\&quot; it did not fit on my hair dryer, which was a standard size.  </li>
            <li> I have a smaller hair dryer that folds, this diffuser will not fit over the end.  </li>
            <li> I have a BabyBliss blowdryer with a narrow nozzle and this diffuser flies off of it constantly.  </li>
            <li> I have a different dryer and it does not fit.</li>
            <li> so be careful if you are adjusting it while the blow dryer is on,</li>
            <li> It said it was universal but it  did not fit my hair dryer</li>
            <li> My hair dryer&#x27;s barrel gets larger as you get closer to the base, but don&#x27;t most?  </li>
            <li> The metal center popped right out, and now it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy enough to push it back on, but a little annoying.</li>
            <li> but I am not positive.</li>
            <li> When that happened I just held it on the end of the dryer with one hand and held the dryer with the other.</li>
            <li> Beware, other than that I give it a thumbs up</li>
            <li> Should have believed the other reviews--Despite pairing this with a Revlon hair dryer (let alone any other &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; brand) it would not attach to the hair dryer at all.</li>
            <li> I just held it on with one hand, and held the dryer with the other.</li>
            <li> This was in cheapest and cheapest made of the other 2 diffusers i bought, It popped off as soon as i putit on my dryer.</li>
            <li> But not consistently...</li>
            <li> I read other reviews that said it wouldn&#x27;t stay on and ignored them, assuming the user wasn&#x27;t doing something correctly.  </li>
            <li> I cant blame the maker since my dryer is a high end and small niche maker &amp;#34;j&#x27;bere&amp;#34; and has grooves that make it hard to find attachments for.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I couldn&#x27;t get this diffuser to fit any of my three hair dryers, no matter how hard I tried.</li>
            <li> Did not fit properly to my Revlon hair dryer it kept slipping off of it :/</li>
            <li> I have very thick and wavy hair that takes 12 hours or more to air dry on cold winter days</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s not right until it falls off.  </li>
            <li> just have to push it little harder and it will fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It narrowly missed the toilet a few times.</li>
            <li> , that was the only hard part.</li>
            <li> I push it hard enough for it to start splaying.</li>
            <li> have a basic hair dryer not revlon and it stll worked, kinda hard to put on</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think people should leave negative reviews if they didn&#x27;t measure properly or didn&#x27;t push it in all the way!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this product as it doesn&#x27;t fit my Revlon hairdryer as I had expected it to from the write up.</li>
            <li> The cupping part holds your hair in place if you let it drop down into it.</li>
            <li> Have to tape it down</li>
            <li> Just invert it on the counter and press the nose of your blow dryer down in.</li>
            <li> The backup dryer had a narrow nozzle that protruded far beyond the base, whereas the other one had a stubby nozzle that was too wide and didn&#x27;t extend far enough beyond the base to fit the diffuser.  </li>
            <li> This products works to tame it, the device says \\&quot;universal\\&quot; but on my hairdryer it is forever slipping off the nozzle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit difficult to get it to fit on my hair dryer, I have to push it on very hard.</li>
            <li> I purchased this diffuser less than a year ago to use with my Conair pro level dryer (bought separately)    1.</li>
            <li> I have an ION select Revlon Hair Dryer (less than 2 yrs.</li>
            <li> Unless you have an oddly shaped hair dryer, I would encourage you to take a chance on this.  </li>
            <li> and I would recommend it for very basic, casual, daily use.</li>
            <li> Try to lay the diffuser flat on a hard service and push the dryer on diffuser with a little pressure.</li>
            <li> This diffuser didn&#x27;t just fail to stay on my blow dryers and wasn&#x27;t just too tight to put on: its barrel was actually narrower than the barrels of the two major-brand home dryers I have (2 different brands).  </li>
            <li> I have to hold it down while I dry my hair, which makes it really hard to do.</li>
            <li> , it had hair spray caked onto it, it was a mess.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li> How can they advertise that it works with \\&quot;all\\&quot; Revlon hairdryers when that&#x27;s not true.</li>
            <li> i have thick curly hair and sometimes sitting around for half the day waiting for my hair to dry just isn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> This diffuser was very difficult to put on to my dryer and once I got it on, it just fell right off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fabulous and does not give you that salon curl, but it gets about half way there.</li>
            <li> Also did not fit on myt slightly tapered hairdryer.</li>
            <li> solution for this was to take a bunch of little wire ties and fasten the diffuser and the metal part of the mouth of my dryer together.  </li>
            <li> It popped off of mine no matter what I did -- and mine is a very average size.</li>
            <li> Did not fit my REVLON blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Did not fit either of my hair dryers.</li>
            <li> Ordered the Defuzer and it did not fit onto my wifes blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> dryers&amp;#34;- it even says that on the box... it does not fit my Revlon 1875.</li>
            <li> This does not fit my REVLON dryer, which is a RV544 Ionic Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer sold here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mechanism that grips the dryer is poorly designed so there isn&#x27;t enough friction to keep it on.</li>
            <li> What a waste, guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This did not fit any of the four hairdryers in my house:  </li>
            <li> This did not fit my Conair Ion dryer.</li>
            <li> Does not fit on my hair dryer at all &amp; pops off my sister-in-laws.</li>
            <li> The diffuser will not fit on my dryer no matter what I do, it just repeatedly slips off.</li>
            <li> comes with a rubber band type device wrapped around a few plastic claws.  </li>
            <li> I have a Revlon dryer and this diffuser does not fit.  </li>
            <li> I have a Babyliss Pro hair dryer, and it has a slightly narrow nozzle.</li>
            <li> Does not fit Revlon dryer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time in purchasing this.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t had an problems yet and have been using it for a few months now.</li>
            <li> I should of tried it before I broke the box, what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The extra cost is frustrating.</li>
            <li> I need a diffuser that will work on at least medium heat, if not hot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not that serious.  </li>
            <li> I saw a couple reviews saying that the diffuser &amp;#34;pops&amp;#34; off and you can fix the problem by pressing down hard until it clicks in.</li>
            <li> I will be returning it and am disappointed as it says right on the box that it fits all Revlon dryers</li>
            <li> It was so inexpensive that I don&#x27;t feel too bad that it only lasted that long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that the ceramic piece makes a difference, but</li>
            <li> Not sure why someone would be using a diffuser if not on curly hair?</li>
            <li> The design works, and I use it nearly every morning to keep my hair from freezing in the winter cold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which part is ceramic (the silver plate?)</li>
            <li> I thought the mouth of the diffuser was too small of the blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this diffuser actually burns my hair.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to say, but it&#x27;s going back.</li>
            <li> This item DID NOT FIT my Jilbere hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether to return the diffuser or get a hairdryer that this fits on.</li>
            <li> So, I learned my lesson the hard way --</li>
            <li> It was hard to find one that doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> the people who claim this \\&quot;pops off\\&quot; the blow dryer -- you have to push it on really hard until it clicks in place</li>
            <li> Trick is you have to push it on hard.</li>
            <li> I pushed the diffuser as hard as I could but heard no clicks.</li>
            <li> At least, it didn&#x27;t work for mine.</li>
            <li> The plastic is very thin and flimsy--the product is not high quality in any way.</li>
            <li> A total disappointment.</li>
            <li> Came in a couple days late.  </li>
            <li> It just slowly slips off  while trying to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why that happened, but I am thankful it did!</li>
            <li> The fingers were just too inflexible with no gripping capability</li>
            <li> probably thinking, it&#x27;s not that serious...</li>
            <li> Not good technique, IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I went past the 30 day return period.</li>
            <li> Have very thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell from the picture, but the center has a ceramic base, which helps with the drying time.  </li>
            <li> It will squeeze onto the base of my hair dryer, but then slides back off; there is no way to keep it in place.  </li>
            <li> so I continued to balance my broken, crusty diffuser on my hair dryer every morning.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave frizziness behind</li>
            <li> Poorly constructed and flimsy.</li>
            <li> So frustrating!</li>
            <li> The reason I can&#x27;t give it five stars is because the instruction booklet that comes with it is useless.</li>
            <li> the wrong model</li>
            <li> Seems expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The diffuser that comes with the dryer is useless, hence my purchase of this diffuser.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this is not the case.</li>
            <li> Revlon and Amazon don&#x27;t seem to realize that by merely making or selling schlock they depreciate their brand value in the consumer&#x27;s mind.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when as a brand you become -- irrelevant.</li>
            <li> Was somewhat skeptical when I ordered this based on the reviews posted, but have found it to work well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s design is slightly questionable too.</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s broken!  </li>
            <li> With the failed attempts, it kept sliding off.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t expensive</li>
            <li> It is made of very thin plastic.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Very irritating.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to push it on for fear of breaking it, but I did just that</li>
            <li> I tried cutting the fingers out and still no luck.  </li>
            <li> I bought this despite the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> give \\&quot;0\\&quot; stars -- too bad.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t think of another work around, so had to return it. :(</li>
            <li> I thought it was supposed to just snap on, so when it didn&#x27;t, I was majorly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the quality of the Revlon RV480.  </li>
            <li> That seems quite dangerous!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t freeze this winter when it is so cold!</li>
            <li> However, I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> This makes it very awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I was so mad!</li>
            <li> I cant get the stupid thing to stay on.</li>
            <li> hate it,&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> In essence, another made in China piece of crap.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d hate to return the diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Really annoying.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, as it states that it fits all Revlon blow dryers.</li>
            <li> and it was horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this diffuser to fit on a Revlon dryer that I&#x27;ve had for several years now after learning how to use a diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought that it would not fit my dryer but you have to push it on over the end of the dryer, the inside of the diffuser is flexible plastic and will go over the end of your dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a diffuser to go with a light weight hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like to rate something as &amp;#34;I hate it,&amp;#34; but I could NOT get this diffusor to stay on my hair dryer. The tube that goes over the end of my dryer had flexible &amp;#34;strands&amp;#34; that, I think, were supposed to provide tension against the dryer shaft. But it was too much tension; it just popped off - EVERY TIME. So frustrating! I held it in place until my fingers got too hot.  I couldn&#x27;t think of another work around, so had to return it. :(</li>
            <li> Although I had a Revlon blowdryer and this diffuser was Revlon as well, I had to return the item because it would not stay attached to the dryer during use.  I did not want to try another &#x27;universal&#x27; diffuser, instead I just bought a whole new dryer with diffuser included.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and decided to also give my hair a break from the straightening iron.  I found this diffuser at Rite Aid for a really good price.  I had it about 2 weeks and the silver center piece popped out because the edge securing it melted away.  Lucky it didn&#x27;t catch on fire.</li>
            <li> The diffuser didn&#x27;t work with my dryer and I was bummed.  I contacted customer service via Amazon and the people at Discount Jungle got back to me right away.  They issued a full refund and they were really nice about it, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> This fit several dryers and works exactly as described</li>
            <li> LOVE this diffuser! The only reason I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the fit issue. I have the Revlon Stylx hairdryer and it fits perfectly, but I have had issues with the diffuser popping off of other dryers when I take it with me on vacation. When that happened I just held it on the end of the dryer with one hand and held the dryer with the other. The trick is to find a dryer that is straight on the end. If the barrel has a curve to it the diffuser will pop off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, lets get to how awesome this thing is! Let me just say, I&#x27;m looking for a new blowdryer and my top requirement is that it must fit this diffuser. I tried using a standard &amp;#34;diffuser&amp;#34; that came with a blowdryer and it was horrible. It was flat so it didn&#x27;t hold the curls at all and left my hair a mess. It was also very open in the center so it didn&#x27;t actually diffuse any of the airflow. What I love about the RV480 is the large cupped shape. It holds the hair in the diffuser and gives great shape. It also does a good job of diffusing the air. This diffuser gives me beautiful, bouncy curls with body. And, for the money, you should definitely give it a try!</li>
            <li> I got this diffuser for my Conair ceramic hair dryer. It didn&#x27;t fit on very easily...I had to use some muscle to get the diffuser on the hair dryer. Once I got it on, it wouldn&#x27;t stay. The diffuser kept popping off. I tried using it anyway but I had to hold the diffuser to the hair dryer and it still kept coming off. I eventually gave up on it and returned it. I wish it did fit because it did do a decent job in my hair but it wasn&#x27;t worth keeping.</li>
            <li> Stay away, stay very far away from this diffuser. The very first time using it the center disc popped out. I find myself re-inserting it quite frequently. Given another chance I would NEVER buy this. I didn&#x27;t spend enough money on it to pay to send it back, even though I should have on principle alone.</li>
            <li> It fits both of my blowdryers because it has an expandable fit and is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> i like that it is bowl shaped to help hold my hair into the center while drying, though it does seem to pop off my dryer somewhat frequently, which is a nuisance.</li>
            <li> As long as it fits your dryer, this is an affordable way to create salon-styles at home.      Although this diffuser attachment did not fit on my main dryer, it did fit on my backup.  The backup dryer had a narrow nozzle that protruded far beyond the base, whereas the other one had a stubby nozzle that was too wide and didn&#x27;t extend far enough beyond the base to fit the diffuser.  Consider your dryer&#x27;s style before purchasing.</li>
            <li> While it seems like this diffuser is nice, I had no way of finding out since it won&#x27;t fit my Sedu Revolution dryer.  It will squeeze onto the base of my hair dryer, but then slides back off; there is no way to keep it in place.  I hate to give this a low rating since I haven&#x27;t even used the actual product, but since it&#x27;s supposed to be universal and doesn&#x27;t fit my dryer, I thought I would warn anyone else who has the same dryer so that you are also not out the price of this diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be taking my hair dryer into a beauty supply shop to see if I can find a diffuser that will work for it.  I should have done this in the first place, but was hoping that this Revlon one would work.</li>
            <li> I have a Revlon Ion Select hair dryer. I can push the diffuser on all of the way, but then it immediately shoots off the end of the hairdryer. It will not stay on.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I couldn&#x27;t get this diffuser to fit any of my three hair dryers, no matter how hard I tried. I guess I&#x27;ll just have to purchase a separate diffuser. I did purchase this one from dan-d-deals, and they have the best customer service I&#x27;ve had the pleasure to experience with internet shopping so far. If you have the opportunity to buy from them, don&#x27;t hesitate. No....I don&#x27;t work for them, and I&#x27;m not related to the owner! I&#x27;m just a very satisfied customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amending this review. With my daughter&#x27;s help, I finally got the diffuser to fit my hair dryer. I was afraid to push it on for fear of breaking it, but I did just that and, lo and behold, it fit and stayed in place. I didn&#x27;t realize that the inside of the diffuser is flexible plastic. So although I can&#x27;t change the stars that I gave it, I&#x27;ll just give it 4 stars in this amended statement. The reason I can&#x27;t give it five stars is because the instruction booklet that comes with it is useless.</li>
            <li> As mentioned, universal diffuser, I expected it to fit around my Revlon hair dryer. It doesn&#x27;t serve my purpose if I have to get a dryer as per the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;There should be specifications mentioned as per size, shape of the dryer nozzle required to be fit with the diffuser for consumer&#x27;s ease. Mentioning as &amp;#34;universal&#x27; diffuser is somewhat misleading.</li>
            <li> This works great for those of us with long hair. The cupping part holds your hair in place if you let it drop down into it. Hold to dry in place one time until almost completely dry, for less fuzz.</li>
            <li> I have the frizziest hair of all time. This products works to tame it, the device says \\&quot;universal\\&quot; but on my hairdryer it is forever slipping off the nozzle. Beware, other than that I give it a thumbs up</li>
            <li> Works fine but won&#x27;t fit most hair dryers. Have to tape it down</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser. It fit perfectly on my Revlon 1875 dryer. When I first opened it I thought it was a bit large, but after using it I realize that this is actually great because it dries my hair in no time. Very happy with it overall.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a diffuser after I had gotten one for Easter and it melted part of the blow dryer.  It was a channel diffuser, and my hair ended up in one big poof with a single curl.  So, I learned my lesson the hard way -- NEVER use a channel diffuser on wavy hair, especially if you are trying to make it wavier!  But I gave diffusers another shot, and my mom bought me this for my birthday.  It works so well, and I am so glad she bought it.  I wasn&#x27;t too sure it would fit on my dryer, but I was very happy when it snapped right on.  You just have to give it a good push.  I was afraid I would break it, but that&#x27;s the only way it&#x27;ll fit onto your dryer.  This truly is a curly girl&#x27;s best friend when time is running short and there&#x27;s no way you can air-dry.  It lifts my hair and sculpts it into pretty, flowing waves.  Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about a regular old dryer whipping the curls right out of my hair.  I can&#x27;t really complain.  The only things I really didn&#x27;t like were the extra little bits of frizz (although it&#x27;s sort of unavoidable when you&#x27;re blow drying it) and, although I am more happy about this than I am unhappy (because I have a LOT of hair!), it doesn&#x27;t add a significant amount of volume to your hair.  But I would still definitely recommend this to everyone I know.  I love it!&#x60;</li>
            <li> Fits my hair dryer and works great on my hair</li>
            <li> Had to return. Did not fit my REVLON blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t need-one came with the hairdryer</li>
            <li> Thought it would be a universal size. I have two different hair dryers, different size nozzles, and this doesn&#x27;t fit either without popping off, so I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is very good, in that it is built perfectly. It has a deep bowl-like curve that allows curls to nest in the diffuser. It really diffuses the warm air so that it is not harsh, concentrated, and fast. I love the way it makes my hair look.    The ONE downside (which is pretty significant) is that after about 8 minutes of constant use, the plastic heats up and becomes more flexible, and then the diffuser starts popping off the blow dryer! My hair stylist has the same one and said the same thing happens to her. This is not a huge problem for me because I have short hair that only takes about 10 minutes to blow dry. The last two minutes are always irritating--I have to hold the diffuser onto the dryer. AND I know it&#x27;s not because my dryer is too big or the wrong model--it&#x27;s a Revlon and is recommended for use with this product.    So, bottom line--if your hair doesn&#x27;t take very long to dry, and you won&#x27;t be using the diffuser longer than 8 minutes at a time, you might want to consider buying this product because it&#x27;s very effective and well-designed other than its falling off after 8 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> According to my wife, this does exactly what she wanted and was 1/3 the cost of one from a beauty store.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for! The package say it fits almost all hair dryers and it fit mine just fine and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not clearly stated on Amazon that this diffuser is only for use on low heat / low speed, for good reason, it&#x27;s very light and has very little thermal mass. I appreciate that Amazon fixed the situation by refunding my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have a Revlon 1875 Ionic hairdryer. I have been searching for a diffuser to fit it. I went to Sally&#x27;s and purchased the Conair diffuser, which was supposed to be \\&quot;universal\\&quot; for all dryers. These are lies. So since I couldn&#x27;t find a diffuser at any of my local stores, I turned to Amazon. I found this product, and debated whether or not to get it. But I am so glad I went through with the purchase. As soon as I recieved it in the mail I tore open the package and immediately tried to attatch it to my dryer. I thought it was supposed to just snap on, so when it didn&#x27;t, I was majorly disappointed. A bit bummed and irritated, I stubbornly tried to get the nozzle in there anyway. And to my delight, it fit! I&#x27;m sure a lot of people returned this item thinking it didn&#x27;t fit, not knowing that you REALLYY have to push it in there. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Did not fit either of my hair dryers.</li>
            <li> Received this in 2 days.  Fits right over the end of my blow dryer.. works great. Love it!</li>
            <li> She said it was supposed to fit her revlin hair dyer but doesn&#x27;t she&#x27;s not happy with it</li>
            <li> Ordered the Defuzer and it did not fit onto my wifes blow dryer.  The Defuzer kept popping off.  Cost just as much to ship it back as it cost so we are keeping it for a flower pot maybe.</li>
            <li> Bought this at the local store because I wasn&#x27;t sure it would fit my hair dryer and wanted to be able to return it easily.  It fits easily and dries my hair perfectly.  The part that fits to the hair dryer is made to attach to different sized dryers.  The attachment doesn&#x27;t snap onto it, instead it slips over the part of the hair dryer where the air comes out(don&#x27;t know if there is a name for it--nozzle???).  Made to adapt to many different sizes, this works very well! Worth the small price instead of buying a whole new hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It does fit my \\&quot;Revlon Ceramic 1875 Ionic Ceramic\\&quot; Blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought it was not going to fit and was about to return it.&lt;br /&gt;You just have to push it little harder and it will fit.&lt;br /&gt;However, this diffuser keeps slipping off while in use.&lt;br /&gt;If you use your blow dryer for more than 2-3 minutes, be aware of flying diffuser...</li>
            <li> Diffuser works great, fits on my hair dryer, and so far, I haven&#x27;t seen any problems.  I&#x27;m not sure that the ceramic piece makes a difference, but oh well!</li>
            <li> This diffuser is just fine. It&#x27;s not fabulous and does not give you that salon curl, but it gets about half way there. It&#x27;s pretty good for everyday use and a more loose wave rather than a curl. It fit easily on my hair dryer, but you do have to have one that has a longer nozzle; dryers with short and thick nozzles will not accommodate this attachment. I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this purchase. It was a good starter diffuser and I would recommend it for very basic, casual, daily use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this diffuser less than a year ago to use with my Conair pro level dryer (bought separately)    1. the diffuser fits fine when inserted onto the barrel of the dryer, but once I turn it on, the vibration of the dryer causes the diffuser to pop off. I&#x27;ve had to use a bungee cord to keep the diffuser on the dryer while in use.     2. the \\&quot;clips\\&quot; that keep the center ceramic piece in place have melted (?) on one side and therefore no longer stays locked in place creating a large hole in the center of the diffuser, defeating the purpose of it.     Needless to say, I&#x27;m on Amazon today to buy another (and better quality) diffuser.</li>
            <li> My dryer turned itself off when I tried to move from low heat to medium heat.  The diffuser had an orange glow going on before the dryer turned off.  I have really long hair, and it just takes way too long to dry using low (basically cool) air.  I need a diffuser that will work on at least medium heat, if not hot.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is awesome,makes really nice curls. I have been looking for one since my old one is so used and they no longer carry it at the store where I purchased it.It was hard to find one that doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy.The well to the diffuser is deep enough and the fingers in just the right place!!! Great curls!!!! Thanks Amazon and Revlon.</li>
            <li> This is advertised as &amp;#34;fits all Revlon dryers&amp;#34;- it even says that on the box... it does not fit my Revlon 1875. It wasn&#x27;t worth the effort to return for $6, and it works if I hold the pieces together, but I&#x27;m disappointed that a universal diffuser isn&#x27;t even universal enough to work with its own brand of hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This is only &amp;#34;UNIVERSAL&amp;#34; for Revlon. Did not fit my hair dryer; but, if it had, I would have loved the product.</li>
            <li> This is the best diffuser I have ever used, and the price is a real bargain. I could not believe the head of curls I ended up with using this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the people who claim this \\&quot;pops off\\&quot; the blow dryer -- you have to push it on really hard until it clicks in place -- then it stays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you can only use this on a low setting; it states that in the instructions; and anyway, when you are working with curls you would never use a high setting --it destroys the curls, diffuser or no diffuser. Not sure why someone would be using a diffuser if not on curly hair? Not good technique, IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clearly fits on all blow dryers; again, you have to push hard until it clicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt like I should write an accurate review of this product; because really, it&#x27;s quite good and it is a great price.</li>
            <li> This diffuser does not connect well to my Revlon hair dryer.  It slides right off the barrel of the dryer and gets very hot to the touch while in use (I only low settings as instructed).</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this diffuser on my Sedu Revolution 4000i, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on. Diffuser pops right off. I REALLY tried to make it stay, but short of duct tape, that diffuser is not staying on. Getting a refund.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Revlon diffuser after deciding to give my hair a &#x27;break&#x27; from the flat iron every now and then.  My hair is wavy, but not curly.  After reading up on products to help hold the curl in, it was apparent a diffuser was step one.  My current hair dryer did not have a diffuser and I liked the fact the Revlon diffuser indicated it fit most dryers.  I was not disappointed!  Some reviewers said the diffuser did not fit properly and that might be true; however, if I didn&#x27;t put pressure on the diffuser when putting it on the dryer, I would have said the same thing.  You really have to push the diffuser on until it snaps and then you can back it off a bit.  The only thing I would change about the diffuser is possibly more \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; that hold the hair up while drying.  Other than that - great product at a great price! Oh - and I actually end up with \\&quot;curly\\&quot; hair!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and have been using the same diffuser for LITERALLY 12 years!  I have tried several diffusers and have never found anything that worked as well so I continued to balance my broken, crusty diffuser on my hair dryer every morning. That was until last week when I received this diffuser!  It works just as well as my old one.  The key is the bowl design that scrunches up and holds the curls while I dry my roots.  It didn&#x27;t fit my Conair dryer so I bought a $12 Revlon dryer at Target and it fit perfectly.  Love, love, love this product! And it was super cheap!!</li>
            <li> The diffuser pops off my Conair CP5540 Pro Thermal Ceramic Twin Turbo 1800-Watt Hair Dryer and I have to use a head band to keep it on the dryer. It has started popping off when I do this so my only alternative is to use my O-State duck tape to keep it on the hair dryer</li>
            <li> This fits my blowdryer perfectly, may come of easily if you put it down while connected to the blowdrier, but it is well worth the price. The good thing about this item is that you may use it on other blowdryer models.</li>
            <li> Works great, good price &amp; got here quick.  This fit my blowdryer nice and snug so at doesn&#x27;t fall off when upside down.  It takes a little extra strength to get it on the dryer.</li>
            <li> This thing is supposed to fit every hairdryer but does not. I cant get the stupid thing to stay on. I have to hold it down while I dry my hair, which makes it really hard to do. Try a different brand or model.</li>
            <li> Fits the Revlon RVDR5045 dryer just fine, and stays on. Seems expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> Amazon does not list a basic measurement for any of the adjustable or \\&quot;universal\\&quot; diffusers it has for sale.  Some buyers complain that the so-called universal diffuser they bought doesn&#x27;t fit their blow dryer(s), but the problem is worse than that  This diffuser didn&#x27;t just fail to stay on my blow dryers and wasn&#x27;t just too tight to put on: its barrel was actually narrower than the barrels of the two major-brand home dryers I have (2 different brands).  This problem could easily have been avoided if Amazon would just list a simple measurement for all the diffusers, which I&#x27;m sure manufacturers could easily provide.  This one only fit on my tiny travel-size (folding) Babyliss dryer, which has a miniature barrel.  It&#x27;s actually a very good diffuser, but it&#x27;s silly to buy it without knowing how big it is.</li>
            <li> Can anyone make a universal diffuser that actually fits a hair dryer? This does not fit my REVLON dryer, which is a RV544 Ionic Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer sold here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Revlon-RV544PKF-1875W-Tourmaline-Ceramic/dp/B000FS05VG/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1426618024&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;RV544+revlon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dryer&#x27;s nose measures about 6.25&amp;#34; around at the smallest circumference, and 7.5&amp;#34; at the largest circumference. It is 4&amp;#34; long. I include this so you can compare your own dryer and see if it is similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser that comes with the dryer is useless, hence my purchase of this diffuser. This diffuser stays on fine until it gets warm, which is not long because well, it&#x27;s attached to a HAIR DRYER. You know, the kind that puts out heat. It stays on for about 1 minute, then literally LAUNCHES itself off my hair dryer and bonks me in the face or head, or whichever direction it&#x27;s being pointed at the time. I had hoped because this diffuser the same brand as my dryer, it would be better. Sadly, this is not the case. It would cost as much to send it back as it did to buy it, so might as well keep it and give myself a concussion or black eye every once in awhile. I could use it to bean my husband with when he gets snarky. Maybe the bands will stretch out enough for it to stay on eventually. Ugh. Save your money, especially if you have my type of dryer.</li>
            <li> As soon as the air warms up, the diffuser tends to pop off of the end of the dryer, causing me to have to repeatedly adjust it and adding considerably to drying time</li>
            <li> The diffuser is great, but don&#x27;t be decieved. It is not universal. I could not get it to work with my hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the quality of the Revlon RV480.  It is made of very thin plastic.  Can&#x27;t be used on high speed or heat.</li>
            <li> It fits my blow dryer nicely, but after 10 minutes or so the plastic warms up too much and it falls off of my dryer. So towards the end of drying my hair I have to be cautious of how I hold the dryer so the diffuser stays on. But for the price I&#x27;m happy with the product. The bowl and teeth work well to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> great, just had to gently but firmly push on to my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t get the diffuser on straight, it will pop off of the dryer. However, it works great. It fit my dyer pretty well, and I love the soft even curls I can get with the diffuser.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit my dryer &#x3D; - (</li>
            <li> Even though I have your average Revlon hair dryer, this supposed universal diffuser does not work.  When I can even get the diffuser onto my hair dryer, it immediately pops back off.  Didn&#x27;t bother to return it because it only cost $8 to begin with.</li>
            <li> This product slides off my Revlon dryer. May fit some dryers, but It is definitely not universal, even among the Revlon brand.</li>
            <li> I own a Revlon blow dryer so I thought this Revlon diffuser would fit on it.  I had to do a bit of trouble shooting and my own rigging to get it to stay on my dryer. I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;s suppose to be a universal fit.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted a diffuser for my hairdryer. When I try to put it on my dryer it just pops back up. It will not stay seated on my hairdryer so obviously it doesn&#x27;t work. Unfortunately I went past the 30 day return period. I would definitely not recommend to anyone. At least, it didn&#x27;t work for mine.</li>
            <li> I run my Revlon Ionic dryer on medium heat on the high setting to get the  right amount of dryness without burning anything. Works like a charm, my waves are wavy!</li>
            <li> Paid $5 and it is well spent. It is well made and designed so it fit my dryer perfectly and I suspect it would fit just about any dryer due to its smart design. I have very thick and wavy hair that takes 12 hours or more to air dry on cold winter days so this gives my hair a nice head start on drying during the winter months. It doesn&#x27;t frizz my hair or take too long to dry it. No damage to my hair either after a month of using it every day.</li>
            <li> Was perfect with this dryer</li>
            <li> I read the posts from others about this not staying on well and thought that because I have a Revlon hair dryer, it would work well for me. No such luck. It will go on but pops off very easily (i.e., just when using it normally or setting it down gently).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this would work great but I&#x27;m yet to use it since it didn&#x27;t fit on my blow dryer.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for - I hadn&#x27;t been able to find a diffuser to fit my Revlon hair dryer. This works great, stays on the dryer snugly, went on the barrel of the dryer no problem.</li>
            <li> First, I really like this diffuser and think it&#x27;s a great price. I read a lot of other reviews, stating it didn&#x27;t fit the blowdryer. Before attempting to return it or get upset, you need to really push your blowdryer into it with FORCE for it to lock in. I read some other reviews saying they discovered that right before almost returning the thing. Just use some force and it will lock into place. I think the max size was 1 1/2 inches - but I am not positive. You need to check on this before buying - to be sure yours will fit with it. Mine didn&#x27;t immediately lock into place until I pushed pretty hard - now it&#x27;s great. A diffuser this nice and large would normally be about $20 - so this is a great deal. I don&#x27;t think people should leave negative reviews if they didn&#x27;t measure properly or didn&#x27;t push it in all the way!</li>
            <li> This works perfectly. Fits snugly on my old blow dryer. Just invert it on the counter and press the nose of your blow dryer down in. Simple way to attach it and that method solves any issues people mentioned</li>
            <li> I was looking for a diffuser to fit my Revlon hairdryer, and this model is designed for that.  The attachment does work great.&lt;br /&gt;Only one drawback,:  t is held on by gravity alone and prone to pop off.</li>
            <li> Had to buy this because I bought a hair dryer that had a defuser in the picture but that was NOT the dryer that I received. In fact it was a completely different dryer. Anyway... It fits and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> This works great on my Revlon hair dryer. Gives me lots of curl with its gentle dry.</li>
            <li> I had a diffuser just like this one years ago and it was so old that the middle piece was blowing out a little when the dryer was on, it had hair spray caked onto it, it was a mess.  (I used it daily for about 2-3 years) I searched for this everywhere and found one at Wal-mart, used that one up for about the same amount of time and then couldn&#x27;t find it again until I came on this website.  It was the exact same one and just what I was looking for.  My hair is naturally straight but has a slight wave so this diffuser works perfect!  Thank you</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t stay on dryer.  Should have paid more attention to reviews</li>
            <li> This diffuser was very difficult to put on to my dryer and once I got it on, it just fell right off. The plastic is very thin and flimsy--the product is not high quality in any way. You get what you pay for, I guess!</li>
            <li> I think next time I&#x27;ll just buy a matching set. This one works great if you hold it on but it does like to launch straight off the drier as if rubber band propelled. It narrowly missed the toilet a few times.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit any or our hair dryers</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that this didn&#x27;t fit either of my dryers better. It has to held in place or it pops off. This makes it very awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I have 2 hairdryers and this fit on only one, and that&#x27;s not even a great fit. You definitely need a long nozzle for this to go on. And you really have to push hard for it to get on. Even then, it pops off with a touch of it so I have to be really careful when drying my hair. I&#x27;m using it, but I think it would be worth just going out and buying a new hairdryer with a diffuser made for that dryer.</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t stay on my hair dryer. The mechanism that grips the dryer is poorly designed so there isn&#x27;t enough friction to keep it on. Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased a diffuser before this one. The design works, and I use it nearly every morning to keep my hair from freezing in the winter cold. I have a Revlon hair dryer, which made it a perfect fit, but I think the design would work with other hair dryers. I&#x27;m not sure which part is ceramic (the silver plate?) but I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it overheating my hair dryer as long as I have it on low heat.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time nice and in new condition but didn&#x27;t fit my Revlon or other model of hair dryers. Returned for refund.</li>
            <li> Though the diffuser is marketed as \\&quot;universal\\&quot; it did not fit on my hair dryer, which was a standard size.  I even tried the suggestions of forcing it on, but realize that my hair dryer was too big for the designated size.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!. It allows your hair to dry fast without burning or cause damage to your hair. Your hair dries smooth, shinny with lots of body  and no frizz to my long thick hair. It a perfect fit for my hair dryer. I do highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I know others had problems with this diffuser staying on the dryer, I have the Revlon RV544 hair dryer and they work perfect together.I should mention thogh, that I never take it off the drye. It might be one of the reasons I never had a problem with it.</li>
            <li> Should have believed the other reviews--Despite pairing this with a Revlon hair dryer (let alone any other &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; brand) it would not attach to the hair dryer at all. What a waste, guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> i have thick curly hair and sometimes sitting around for half the day waiting for my hair to dry just isn&#x27;t working. this diffuser is quite large and has a fits any size barrel.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t actually fit the hairdryer. It slips on but pops off.</li>
            <li> I have to say I didn&#x27;t actually get to try it since this universal diffuser did not fit my Revlong hair dryer. Maybe it is meant to be universal only for full size dryers because I tried it with my Revlon Soft Feel 1875W Travel Dryer and it didn&#x27;t fit at all, had to return it.</li>
            <li> Got this because I have a Revlon hair dryer.  Tried to put it on my Revlon hair dryer and all it does is pop off the end of my Revlon hair dryer.  I even tried taping it to my Revlon hair dryer and it continues to fall off of my Revlon hair dryer.  Am I making my point here?  It does NOT work with just any and every Revlon hair dryer.  Save your money and get a dryer that comes with a diffuser designed to work with it.  It&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to end up doing in the end.</li>
            <li> Does not fit Remington blow dryers but will fit ALL Revlon dryers.</li>
            <li> I could&#x27;t find this guy at any store near me (Walgreen or Rite aid) and I didn&#x27;t have time to go shopping for it.&lt;br /&gt;As a add on item I had to find something to buy it with, that was the only hard part. But other then that it came on time and works great.</li>
            <li> Kept popping off.  Saw the other reviews but thought it would work for me since my dryer is the same brand.  Nope.  Even tried in on my other dryer with a smaller nozzle.  Nope.  Huge design flaw.  Don&#x27;t imagine this would stay on any dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser since I lost the one that originally came with my Revlon hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the good: this diffuser works. My hair comes out bouncy and with waves intact. It fits on my dryer, though I did have to shove the barrel into the diffuser with some force to make it stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, you absolutely cannot use this on anything higher that low heat at low speed. Many tutorials online indicate high heat is best, so this diffuser just doesn&#x27;t make the cut. It starts to melt - seriously - at any higher heat. That seems quite dangerous! It does indicate this is the instructions for the diffuser, but since no hair-dryers offer only low heat, it&#x27;s clearly not the best option. If you lost yours and can&#x27;t find one to fit, this will work, but it might be a good idea just to invest in a new hair-dryer that comes with its own diffuser attachment designed specifically for the product.</li>
            <li> It fits but sometimes it falls off my blow dryer. Wish it fit better.</li>
            <li> It says it fits all Revlon hair dryers, but it doesn&#x27;t fit mine, and my dryer isn&#x27;t old, either.  I&#x27;d return it but it&#x27;s not worth the trouble.  I hope I can find one that will fit my dryer.</li>
            <li> This did not fit any of the four hairdryers in my house:  1)Bespoke Labs T3 Featherweight, 2) Conair 1875, 3) Conair Ion Shine 1875 and 4) Vidal Sassoon Cool touch 1600.</li>
            <li> I have an ION select Revlon Hair Dryer (less than 2 yrs. old)...and was in need of a diffuser. Logic would tell you the universal diffuser made by Revlon would fit.     Not so. As soon as you put on the dryer it popped off. In essence, another made in China piece of crap.  Wasn&#x27;t even worth the trouble to return it...the same day in the trash.    Revlon and Amazon don&#x27;t seem to realize that by merely making or selling schlock they depreciate their brand value in the consumer&#x27;s mind. That&#x27;s when as a brand you become -- irrelevant.</li>
            <li> 3 words to describe this Product - Made In China ....   It&#x27;s not universal at all,  unless universal is a dryer brand ...    Don&#x27;t waste your money .....</li>
            <li> Bought this because I was looking for an inexpensive diffuser to bring to the gym.  I didn&#x27;t remember the brand at the time I made the purchase, but knew that they had a skinny shape.  This slides on easily and adjusts to the size of the hairdryer.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Even though I have a Revlon dryer, this thing kept shooting off the end of my dryer about two minutes in.  Very irritating.</li>
            <li> I have two blow dryers and this didn&#x27;t fit either one.  I expected that it might not fit my mini dryer, but it also doesn&#x27;t fit my Conair 1875 hairdryer, which is a pretty common size.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work on my dryer. I tried to modify it but it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It keeps popping off the hairdryer rendering it unusable.</li>
            <li> According to Amazon, it appeared that it was a Universal diffuser attachment. Nowhere on the actual packaging does it say this (It does, however, say that it is supposed to fit ALL Revlon hairdryers). My hairdryer is a conair and there was no possibility of making this fit. Even if it had fit, I would not be satisfied with it, because (1) there are very few &#x27;fingers&#x27;, and (2) the cup is very shallow, so if you have long hair or a lot of hair, it will just flow out of the top and your hair will not be very effectively dried during the diffusing process.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair is blown dry and curly so I don&#x27;t freeze this winter when it is so cold!</li>
            <li> Wife enjoys the product with Revlon RVDR 5001. Fits like a glove and helps her to get the long tresses dry in quick time. Well made product and is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have two blow dryers (Conair and Revlon). I thought at first that it did not fit any of them and was a waste of money. It actually now fits both of them. Trick is you have to push it on hard. At first I tried and tried to push the diffuser on the blow dryer but it would not go on. I thought the mouth of the diffuser was too small of the blow dryer.  I read a review and then realized that you have push it on hard to fit. Try to lay the diffuser flat on a hard service and push the dryer on diffuser with a little pressure. The inside mouth of the diffuser then expands to fit the mouth of the dryer.</li>
            <li> Fits my philips dryer nicely, you just have to put some pressure for it to fit</li>
            <li> This diffuser fit my Babyliss dryer on the first two times I used it, but then, on the third time I tried to use it, the silver disc in the center popped out and the diffuser popped off the dryer. The diffuser would not stay on the dryer.</li>
            <li> Ok. As I look at the reviews I see a lot of people saying how it doesn&#x27;t fit their hair dryer. Before you purchase the product ALWAYS!! Get a good look at the product zoom in if you can. It says on the box for use with all REVLON hair dryers. If you don&#x27;t have a hair dryer by Revlon that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t fit and why you&#x27;re having problems. It does work when used and I love it! Especially for my wash and go. My hair looks full and my curls look defined so I do suggest the product if you have the correct dryer! 😉</li>
            <li> Fits my revlon rvdr5108 and works good.</li>
            <li> too large for my head/hair...but if you have thick hair it would be great. Also did not fit on myt slightly tapered hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this despite the bad reviews. I saw a couple reviews saying that the diffuser &amp;#34;pops&amp;#34; off and you can fix the problem by pressing down hard until it clicks in. I pushed the diffuser as hard as I could but heard no clicks. I push it hard enough for it to start splaying. It just slowly slips off  while trying to use it. Yes, I use it on the lowest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the Revlon Retractable Cord, Fold &amp; Go hair dryer. The dryer is tapered, so I don&#x27;t know if that is a factor. The description does say the diffuser will fit all Revlon hair dryers however...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because the diffuser seemed to work the thirty seconds it was able to stay on.</li>
            <li> This did not fit my Conair Ion dryer. It constantly kept slipping off mid-drying session and smacking me on the head/in the face. I will hang onto it since I need to upgrade my hair dryer, and this time I will purchase a dryer with a non-tapered barrel.</li>
            <li> It does not stay on the Revelon Quiet Pro. Very disappointed, as it states that it fits all Revlon blow dryers. Will return.</li>
            <li> Not truly universal... keeps popping off my Revlon hair dryer.  Can only be used with such low heat and power settings that it would be faster to air dry.  A total disappointment.</li>
            <li> PUT AN ELASTIC BAND ON YOUR HAIRDRYER! It will keep the diffuser from popping off. This is a great diffuser. It wouldn&#x27;t stay on at first, but I did my research and read that an elastic band around the hairdryer will keep it on, and guess what...it does.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those days when you don&#x27;t want to do a full blow out.</li>
            <li> I have a Revlon blow dryer, which was supposedly compatible with this product; however, it would not stay on the dryer and it kept falling off.  I eventually duct taped it onto the blow dryer  in order to use it.  It works well, though--it cut down my drying time by a lot, and it made my wavy hair shiny, defined, and relatively frizz free.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t fit ANY of my REVLON dryers... waste.&lt;br /&gt;Should be removed from Amazon right away!  Big rip-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t give \\&quot;0\\&quot; stars -- too bad.</li>
            <li> Help!!! Does anyone know how I may keep the diffuser attached to my Revlon folding hairdryer?  Both are top quality products, but the diffuser will not stay onto the hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In some of the reviews, buyers indicated that they had to force the diffuser onto the hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d hate to return the diffuser.  Especially, if I can use it for another hair dryer.  Do you know of ones that it would fit?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, is there a diffuser that would fit my Revlon folding ionic hairdryer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any suggestions, anyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> cheap, yes. worth it? not in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;as others have stated, \\&quot;pops\\&quot; off my hair dryer. i thought that maybe they just hadn&#x27;t put it on right. so it doesn&#x27;t fit. and when it pops off and falls onto the floor, the cheap \\&quot;metal\\&quot; piece in the middle bends and no longer fits into the diffuser. you might as well be using a dryer without a diffuser at that point.&lt;br /&gt;used mine 4 times and it went into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;the search is on for a new one - any suggestions?</li>
            <li> Do not order it. You will never ever be able attach it to ANY dryer.  I ordered it with recommended Revlon. Not even close!&lt;br /&gt;It is not designed to be attached. You can try to duck tape it on. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I received my purchase very quickly and am completely satified with my purchase. I will reccoment you to all of my firends.</li>
            <li> Looks nice &amp; works if you have the perfect hair dryer for it. Does not fit on my hair dryer at all &amp; pops off my sister-in-laws.</li>
            <li> It product doesn&#x27;t work, I have a revlon hair dryer and the product doesn&#x27;t fix on it. I lose my money.</li>
            <li> Great little add-on to my set of hair care products.  I have generally voluminous hair with a bit of a kink and wanted to bring out more texture.  This did the trick!  Wash your hair with a curling/volumizing shampoo, then run some mousse through your  hair with your fingers.  Next step is to use the diffuser, holding it pointing upward with the hair laying atop it.  This has worked wonders for me - I come out with hair looking like the mane of a lion.  Great for the price, as well.</li>
            <li> There were several reviews that stated that this diffuser wouldn&#x27;t stay on their blow-dryers, but I decided to take a chance anyways.  I have had no issues, and I have to say, this is the best $6 I have spent in a long time!  I have a normal conair blow-dryer and it works pretty awesome.  Unless you have an oddly shaped hair dryer, I would encourage you to take a chance on this.  If it doesn&#x27;t work, you are out $6, if it does work for you, you will definitely be pleased.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best that ive used. It distrubutes the air evenly and not to strong very good drying too.</li>
            <li> It fit my blow dryer perfectly, although previous reviews stated fitting issues.  It works great with my blow dryer, which is older (bigger) than the newer models.</li>
            <li> Fits onto all of my hair dryers (different brands from different continents).  My only complaint would be that it occasionally pops off.  It&#x27;s easy enough to push it back on, but a little annoying.</li>
            <li> I loved this diffuser until it broke. I carry this in my gym bag, and it been in use for about 6 months, so it may get jostled a little more than one for home use, but it broke. The metal center popped right out, and now it&#x27;s useless. Until I find the metal center and pop it back in I can&#x27;t use this...not loving this item at this time.</li>
            <li> have a basic hair dryer not revlon and it stll worked, kinda hard to put on but i set it on my chair and push the diffuser on that way and it went on easy and stayed on, but was easy to take off.</li>
            <li> This is my very first diffuser and I really like it! You have to really force it onto your dryer but it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this product as it doesn&#x27;t fit my Revlon hairdryer as I had expected it to from the write up. It was returned. Also it would have been helpful if the purchase receipt had been in the box. Although this item was shipped via USPS I had to return it via UPS.....this is arkward as we live 1/2hr drive from the closest drop-off.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser, but it always pops off the end of my blow dryer. To be fair, my blow dyer is a Con-Air and not a Revlon, and I think that has a lot to do with it, but it&#x27;s pretty annoying. Apart from that, it&#x27;s a really nice diffuser and I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> It said universal, so I thought it would go with my Hot Tools blow dryer, but it didn&#x27;t fit :(</li>
            <li> Fits perfect on my Revlon hair dryer (the cheap one from Target). Works really well. I use it when I want to make my wavy hair extra curly. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It works well, but it is not the best product. I would prefer if it was bigger, cause I have long hair.</li>
            <li> Fits my Conair dryer perfectly. Other reviews say these don&#x27;t fit. I can see how it might be easy to think it doesnt fit, at first. It takes a little shove to pop it in place and then it&#x27;s a tight, solid, snug fit, as if it&#x27;s part of the dryer. I&#x27;m replacing a similar diffuser that I&#x27;ve had for a decade. Have very thick, curly hair. These attachments make a tremendous difference in managing my curl. Great product. Hopefully this one will last as long as my previous one!</li>
            <li> This would be good for a blow dryer that it actually fits on. It popped off of mine no matter what I did -- and mine is a very average size. Returned.</li>
            <li> It popped right on my hair-dryer and has only fallen off once (but has been used dozens of times at this point so that&#x27;s pretty good).  It really does work way better than just hair drying alone with my massive curly hair.  It doesn&#x27;t leave frizziness behind and I swear it adds more volume and drys faster!</li>
            <li> Does not attached to my blow dryer</li>
            <li> The original diffuser that came with my Conair dryer had started to melt a bit, and often left my hair frizzy. I tried to let my hair air dry for awhile, but it just takes too long when I have to go to work. I bought this diffuser, hoping it would make my naturally curly hair look better when I blow dried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this diffuser. The first time I used it, it did pop off when I used the higher speed or heat. I just held it on with one hand, and held the dryer with the other. It was not convenient, but it was doable. The odd thing is that after that first use, the diffuser has not popped off once. I can use the higher speed or heat with no problems at all. I&#x27;m not sure why that happened, but I am thankful it did! My hair looks less frizzy than it did when I used the cheap diffuser that came with my dryer, so that makes me happy, too.</li>
            <li> I really want a diffuser because i have wavy hair and i wanted to add some more texture and volume to it to make the curls more defined . So i bought this product because i have a Revlon hair dyer and i thought it would fit on the end of it. Well.... it didnt so i got some tape and tapped it on there but i wish every time i wanted to use it i wouldnt have to tape it on.</li>
            <li> This was a good idea for a product but it doesn&#x27;t stay on my blow dryer. It fits onto it, but if I let go it SHOTS off. Spring loaded diffuser.</li>
            <li> Was somewhat skeptical when I ordered this based on the reviews posted, but have found it to work well. Don&#x27;t expect the diffuser to &amp;#34;snap&amp;#34; on to the blow dryer, the fingers just hold it on to the end of the dryer. Love the fact that it is ceramic, and it drys my thick curls quickly without causing &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34;. Fits reasonably well on my new Conair ceramic blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Hananair Blow Dryer and it fits well however it will come off. Works better now that i have used it a couple times.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about getting this diffuser. My revlon hair dryer came with one, but it broke a while back and so I was happy to replace it with something made by the same company (since I assumed that a universal diffuser made by the same brand as my hair dryer would fit said hair dryer). However, I am extremely disappointed. The diffuser will not fit on my dryer no matter what I do, it just repeatedly slips off. Other than that, it appears to be made out of very cheap, flimsy plastic. It seems too breakable, even it if did fit on the nozzle, for me to want to keep it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on the barrel of the blow dryer.  I tried it on two different blow dryers</li>
            <li> I read nearly all the review before buying this diffuser.  I figured it would be either a hit or miss.  It was a miss for me.  I have 2 Revlon hair dryers and it fit neither one.&lt;br /&gt;But, I&#x27;m a pretty creative girl and since I dont use it very often I jimmy rigged it to fit my dryer.&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser comes with a rubber band type device wrapped around a few plastic claws.  The best way to explain this contraption is: Take your hand and position it like you&#x27;re grabbing something, then imagine a giant rubber band around your fingers. (Use your imagination, here)  That is what the inside of this diffuser looks like.  It says its universal because the claws can stretch to fit pretty much any hair dryer.  The problem is the claws have no grip and will not stay on a large dryer and are too big for a smaller dryer.&lt;br /&gt;My solution for this was to take a bunch of little wire ties and fasten the diffuser and the metal part of the mouth of my dryer together.  This solution is super flimsy, but it actually does the trick of keeping the diffuser on for the 10 minutes it takes to dry my roots.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re probably thinking, it&#x27;s not that serious... why go through all that for a $5 diffuser.  And you&#x27;re absolutely right.  It&#x27;s really not that serious.  I wish I wouldnt have bought it, I wish I would have just walked to Rite Aid and picked up a $15 hair dryer with the diffuser already in the box.  But to return it to Amazon... even more of a hassle.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair, and have used this particular kind of diffuser for years.  When I could no longer find it in the stores, I found it on Amazon and ordered it.  It lasts until the rubber band on the inside of the diffuser breaks, and then it is time to order another one.  I love it, and will continue to use it, as it is a gentle way to dry my frizzy, wavy hair and not have the frizzes!</li>
            <li> I have had diffusers that fits onto the dryer head before, and this one works great, but it keeps popping off when I use it. For that reason I gave it three stars, but the price was pretty good.</li>
            <li> This one was purchased as a gift.  I think it is getting good use by its new owners.  Personally I loved the quality of the product upon receipt.</li>
            <li> I purchased this diffuser from Ulta and had high hopes for it.  I have very healthy hair but my natural waves need an bit of help to produce a more curly look.  Unfortunately, this diffuser actually burns my hair.  Since I have owned many diffusers over the years and never had this problem until now, I believe that the centerpiece is the cause.  I am tossing this one...</li>
            <li> I have a smaller hair dryer that folds, this diffuser will not fit over the end.  Cannot use it to give it a proper rating</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t stay on - pops right off the hair dryer.  It is poorly made, made in China - and the claim that it fits most hair dryers is a joke - it doesn&#x27;t even fit the same brand of hair dryer.  Mine is in the trash.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit my Revlon hair drier. I bought it because it says it fits all Revlon products. It&#x27;s design is slightly questionable too. It has several flanges surrounded by a tight rubber band, and the idea is that the tip of the hair drier would fit between the flames and be held fast by the rubber band, however the flames are angled inward and the river band ends up pushing the diffuser of of the end of the drier. There are no clips or anything to attach it with it relies solely on friction.</li>
            <li> I used this on average of every other day for just over a year when the metal disk in the metal popped out and could not be fixed.  It was so inexpensive that I don&#x27;t feel too bad that it only lasted that long.  It worked great before that - fit on my hair dryer just fine and did wonders for my wavy hair.  I will buy the same one to replace the last.</li>
            <li> I bought this item (6 days ago) to go with my new quiet hair dryer that did not come with its own diffuser. At first, I really liked the diffuser but today while trying to use it, it would not stay on the dryer. AT ALL! It repeatedly slipped off. Sorry to say, but it&#x27;s going back.</li>
            <li> Came in a couple days late.  Took me a minute to realize how it was supposed to go on the blow dryer, and it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions.  Otherwise, I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I live abroad and cannot find a diffuser anywhere. Thanks it is just what I expected and the size is even more convenient.</li>
            <li> I have a BabyBliss blowdryer with a narrow nozzle and this diffuser flies off of it constantly.  I guess it serves its purpose but I wish it stayed on the blowdryer a little better.</li>
            <li> Once this universal diffuser arrives, you find out you can&#x27;t use the high heat or blow settings of the hairdryer, so hair takes longer to dry</li>
            <li> This was in cheapest and cheapest made of the other 2 diffusers i bought, It popped off as soon as i putit on my dryer. I cant blame the maker since my dryer is a high end and small niche maker &amp;#34;j&#x27;bere&amp;#34; and has grooves that make it hard to find attachments for. But im betting it would still pop off most other makers.It is made of very cheap plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffusers was very inexpensive so I cant complain too much. The bowl was the smallest of the three i purchased and would not fit most of my hair which is thick and long and goes to below my chest.</li>
            <li> Did not fit properly to my Revlon hair dryer it kept slipping off of it :/</li>
            <li> It did fit my Revlon 1875 blow dryer but I feel like it made my hair more frizzy compared to other diffusers. I returned it</li>
            <li> I bought this because it indicated that the design would fit most popular hair dryers.  I own a Remington and found that the design doesn&#x27;t fit and pops off while using the dryer.</li>
            <li> Glad there are still some diffusers that actually stay on my hairdryer. This one is perfect.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this diffuser. I use it in combination with Sexy Curly Hair to give my hair a nice beach wavy style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You fit the diffuser onto the barrel of your blow dryer by sliding the barrel into the open back of the diffuser. Then there is flexible plastic that stretches to fit whatever size blow dryer you&#x27;re using. The plastic goes pretty small, but if the barrel of your blow dryer is more that 2 1/2 inches in diameter it might not fit because that how big the opening on the back of the diffuser is. It&#x27;s stays on very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is a sticker on the diffuser that instructs the user to use the product only with the blowdryer on the lowest fan and heat setting. However I have used it with the fan setting on high and didn&#x27;t have a problem. I think mainly they are trying to avoid things getting too hot...but most good blowdryers have an auto cutoff feature if the blowdryer gets too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser does get hot to the touch after a few mins of use, but given a few seconds to cool it&#x27;s no problem. I&#x27;ve never been burned by touching this product while in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic prongs do a very good job of holding hair in the diffuser and also keeping my scalp from getting too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great buy, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t need to buy a whole new blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it will not stay on my blowdryer.  When I turn on the blowdryer, it slides right off from the force of the heated air.  Very disappointing.  It was in great condition though.</li>
            <li> I dont know how this would fit on ANY dryer...are you kidding me? My dryer is TINY  as it is, this has got to be  for one of those MINI hair dryers and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I have a Revlon dryer and this diffuser does not fit.  I will be returning it and am disappointed as it says right on the box that it fits all Revlon dryers</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t fit my hair dryer, when I saw that it was &#x27;universal&#x27; I thought it would fit my standard blow dryer, not the case. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have a standard blow dryer (nothing fancy) and this falls off every 10 seconds. It is supposed to have springs inside so it &#x27;fits any blow dryer&#x27; but they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely nice diffuser.  Actually, I bought it because the one that came with the dryer got lost.  And i&#x27;m glad I did.  It&#x27;s much better than the one that came with the dryer.  It&#x27;s hard to tell from the picture, but the center has a ceramic base, which helps with the drying time.  I actually use the fingers to fluff up my curly hair while I&#x27;m drying it.  It must be kept on low, though, but that is a fine temp, especially if you&#x27;re using it close to the hair.  One thing I read on the reviews, and which happened to me at first -- the first time you put it on the dryer, it may scoot back off and act like it doesn&#x27;t want to connect.  As the reviewer said, the trick is to push it on more completely -- until it snaps on.  Just a hint.</li>
            <li> I have a Babyliss Pro hair dryer, and it has a slightly narrow nozzle. I have to shove it on all the way and it still sometimes pops off. If your hair dryer is a little bigger, it would probably work better. Overall though, it works fine as a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair but when i leave it to dry naturally its all over the place. I tried many diffusers in the past but this Revlon Ceramic Finger Diffuser is simply on of the best on the market. Its tames the frizz and allows the curls to follow its natural curl with out having to use lots of product.&lt;br /&gt;It fits most hair dryers and has not given me problems when travelling as it fitted most hotel hair dryers.</li>
            <li> It must only work with Revlon hair dryers. I&#x27;ve put it on 3 different hair dryers (non Revlon), and it doesn&#x27;t fit. No matter how hard I push, it just pops off (in fact the gray center pushes out because it&#x27;s not made for certain hair dryers). Universal to me means it fits all or most products. This definitely does not. I have to hold it on with one hand and hold the actual dryer with another...real conveient. I regret purchasing it, but it&#x27;s the only one I can find anywhere sold separately. I guess my next blow dryer purchase will be one that comes with its own diffuser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this would be a great diffuser if it FIT THE DRYER!!  I have a Revlon Dryer (Ionic Quiet Dryer) and it slips off.  There is no hope of this diffuser working for it at all.  I think I&#x27;ll have to buy a new dryer that comes with its own diffuser in order to get what I want.  C&#x27;est la vie!</li>
            <li> Does not fit Revlon dryer. Don&#x27;t waste your time in purchasing this. Even Tried several dryers.. Disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Not &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34;. Won&#x27;t fit with my Revlon Ionic 1875W dryer, although it says &amp;#34; fits with all Revlon dryers.&amp;#34; Very upset</li>
            <li> i love it! it fits my Revlon blow dryer perfectly. i haven&#x27;t had an problems yet and have been using it for a few months now.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it. I have a different dryer and it does not fit. I will have to buy a new dryer.</li>
            <li> Universal and doesn&#x27;t fit either one of the 2 hair dryers I own. My next purchase a dryer that comes with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> works great! sometimes it slips off, but totally worth it for a blow dryer the didn&#x27;t come with a diffusor!</li>
            <li> This is just o.k.  I bought it to go on a Babyliss Pro 2800 dryer, and sometimes it flies off while I&#x27;m drying my hair.  It has landed on my head several times, and that just hurts!  If I turn it just right it mostly stays in place, but I still can&#x27;t figure out exactly what position is the best, so I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s not right until it falls off.  Might work better on other dryers, but it&#x27;s not perfect.  Price was great though...it will do for now.</li>
            <li> At first I was thrilled with this product as I hadn&#x27;t been able to find a diffuser separate from a hairdryer.  However, it kept popping off my hairdryer so I ended up sending it back.</li>
            <li> (Jonathan&#x27;s wife here) I bought this because the blow dryer i already have did not come with a diffuser attachment. It fits great on my Conair Infiniti Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer with Cord Reel. It does slip off on occasion and i just have to push it to get it back on. It does get REALLY hot so be careful if you are adjusting it while the blow dryer is on, or with in minutes of use. This product was a GREAT price, and I am so glad I bought it. It adds fantastic volume to my hair and keeps my waves intact. I also use it just to give my hair massive volume. I just brush my hair while blow drying so that it drys straight but with great volume because this product helps you to quickly dry your roots. Best results when your hair is flipped over by touching your chin to your chest.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit difficult to get it to fit on my hair dryer, I have to push it on very hard. But it works well &amp; is a good price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this diffuser to give my hair a beachy wave look. It works! But not consistently...I may just need to get my technique down :)</li>
            <li> I read other reviews that said it wouldn&#x27;t stay on and ignored them, assuming the user wasn&#x27;t doing something correctly.  Well, count me among them, because mine won&#x27;t stay on either.  My hair dryer&#x27;s barrel gets larger as you get closer to the base, but don&#x27;t most?  I did give it 2 stars because it seems well-made and I like the design.  I&#x27;ll keep it around in case I get a new dryer soon (mine is 10 years old).</li>
            <li> It fit on my blow dryer, but it was hard to put on. After about a week it started popping off in the middle of drying my hair... Really annoying.</li>
            <li> It fits on the dryer very well, distributes the heat evenly and makes my curls really pop out.  I love this. :)</li>
            <li> Says it fit all hairdryers and it does not. Returning.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be a &#x27;universal&#x27; diffuser but the fact that it didn&#x27;t fit three different blow dryers I have tells me otherwise.  One of my dryers is (was) also a Revlon brand and it didn&#x27;t come close to fitting.  In fact, when I tried to get the diffuser to stay on the Revlon unit, the struggle was so intense I ended up dropping the dryer and now it&#x27;s broken!  The fitted side of the diffuser has flexible fingers inside so presumably it would fit any size nozzle.  The fingers were just too inflexible with no gripping capability so the diffuser just popped right back off.  I tried cutting the fingers out and still no luck.  I passed on a to a friend who had no luck with it either. This went in the trash and I bought a new dryer that came with a diffuser so it fits!</li>
            <li> The diffuser works ok as a diffuser. Nothing special. However, fit IS an issue. I tried it on 3 hair blowers before I found one it fit. I could slip it onto all of them, but it only held onto one. Based on previous reviews, I was not afraid to give it a good shove and listened for a click, but to no avail. With the failed attempts, it kept sliding off. Not because it was loose but because it would not grip and the angle and texture of the dryer would not keep it on. I have to use an old dryer that I put away for emergencies. Oh well, I don&#x27;t need to use it often and it was a good price.</li>
            <li> This item DID NOT FIT my Jilbere hair dryer! I was so mad! It would go completely on, and then slowly slide right off! Im a new Amazon user and have no clue what to do. HELP!</li>
            <li> Could not get the item to fit it&#x27;s own brand of hair dryers, it kept slipping off. I should of tried it before I broke the box, what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It said it was universal but it  did not fit my hair dryer it wasn&#x27;t expensive so I just kept it, but I ended up buying a whole new dryer with the fuser</li>
            <li> This item did not grip well to the dryer and came apart on the second use. Poorly constructed and flimsy.</li>
            <li> On the box are the words: \\&quot;For use with all REVLON hair dryers\\&quot;. I have a Revlon 1875 &amp; I can&#x27;t get this Revlon diffuser to attach in any way. It looks like a good product. It looks like it might work. I was excited to make my hair look good today. But it just doesn&#x27;t fit. How can they advertise that it works with \\&quot;all\\&quot; Revlon hairdryers when that&#x27;s not true. I&#x27;m not in the mood to buy a new hair dryer when the one I have works great, but without the diffuser my hair is all flat &amp; lifeless. I&#x27;m not sure whether to return the diffuser or get a hairdryer that this fits on. The extra cost is frustrating. I&#x27;m going to contact Revlon.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone have tips on which dryers fit well with this diffuser?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> This fit on my hair-dryer, gave me big soft curls, and was cheap, but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all. Awesome.</li>
            <li> Just as described. fit perfectly onto my (very old) Revlon hairdryer. I was skeptical from reviews but it is great.</li>
            <li> Been needing one of these for years...fits on my Chi Blower with no problem.</li>
            <li> really like this...with this on the hair drier I can put it right up against my scalp and gently move the hair up to dry it in place..it does not blow around but stays how I put it in place with product...</li>
            <li> Fits over a classic blow dryer and is nicely priced. It redistributes heat and helps with a curling product or smoothing blow dry.</li>
