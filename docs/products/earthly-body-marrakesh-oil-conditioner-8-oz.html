            <li>This product has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner makes your hair feel silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>What I love most is that I have very fine wavy hair and live near the beach</li>
            <li>One of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve been using various conditioners for a long time.  </li>
            <li>The product rinses well, leaves hair very shiney, the scent is very natural and enjoyable , the price is affodable</li>
            <li>I love the light scent, it smells clean and slightly of coconut.</li>
            <li>this entire product line is worth much more.</li>

            <li>not only is this the first inexpensive conditioner that i&#x27;ve used which actually noticeably smooths my hair and minimizes breakage, it also doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and prevents fly aways all day.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>WELL worth it, get the leave on oil too especially if you are trying to grown your hair out.</li>
            <li>I keep them at the salon where I get my hair styled in lieu of their professional products.</li>

            <li>Left my hair feeling very soft and natural, but not oily or bulky like some conditioners</li>
            <li>The scent is like no other conditioner I have ever used before.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has made my very thick and coarse hair so much more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to only use a small amount, a little goes a long way.</li>

            <li> I have very thick wavy, dry hair.  This product has made a huge difference.  I love it!  My husband says it makes me smell like  hippy though.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has made my very thick and coarse hair so much more manageable.  I will always use this product!</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes your hair feel silky smooth.  The scent is like no other conditioner I have ever used before. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am hook to this product now I had been using it for a year ..makes your hair silky and soft and smells great!!  wouldnt change it now</li>
            <li> The product rinses well, leaves hair very shiney, the scent is very natural and enjoyable , the price is affodable</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this product.  Will never be without it.  Wish they would continue the 100% more free, that was an awesome buy.</li>
            <li> One of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve been using various conditioners for a long time.  Left my hair feeling very soft and natural, but not oily or bulky like some conditioners</li>
            <li> This works wonders on my dry curly hair. I love the smell. I also use their shampoo and leave-in conditioner. My hair looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> See my review of the shampoo..love the way my hair smells &amp; behaves after using the combo of these products. And they are both very friendly to the pocketbook. I keep them at the salon where I get my hair styled in lieu of their professional products. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It makes my frizzy, wavy hair behave! Make sure to only use a small amount, a little goes a long way. With my medium-length hair one bottle of this lasts almost 3 months.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is wonderful. It smells delicious and my hair has never been so soft and manageable, especially in the dead of winter!</li>
            <li> You have to try this product if: You have color treated hair, if your hair is course, if you have thick dry brittle hair, swim...</li>
            <li> This smells really great and makes my fine hair shiny smooth.</li>
            <li> I constantly and will only buy Marrakesh brand shampoo and condition.&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I both lover the smell. Can&#x27;t to find in stores, I have only been able to find on Amazon.Amazon has it for a great price and a wonderful product. (2nd time I have bought through Amazon!)</li>
            <li> I was searching for a natural shampoo to replace my chemical shampoos. Hoping this would solve my dry hair problems. I was wrong! Not only did this made my hair like dry hay, I was actually losing hair! I thought it was just a coincidence &amp; couldn&#x27;t figure why it was doing so. That&#x27;s when I realized it was the shampoo that&#x27;s causing it. Reading the reviews &amp; shampoo product I hoped that it was do good. But I guess it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. Not me at least.</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner ever!</li>
            <li> This is the best product out there. Love this stuff. I have natural curly hair so I have to use product in my hair to tame it. Love the smell. This makes a great gift also</li>
            <li> We love the smell of this.  My daughter always gets compliments on how nice her hair smells.  Thought it would make her hair a little easier to tame as it is very thick and long.  Didn&#x27;t do much to help detangle.</li>
            <li> this entire product line is worth much more. I love the light scent, it smells clean and slightly of coconut. What I love most is that I have very fine wavy hair and live near the beach so generally the humidity makes my hair frizzy after a few hours. not only is this the first inexpensive conditioner that i&#x27;ve used which actually noticeably smooths my hair and minimizes breakage, it also doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and prevents fly aways all day. I am asked constantly if i just got a hair cut. It makes my split ends disappear and my hair feels absolutely healthy and softer than it ever has. WELL worth it, get the leave on oil too especially if you are trying to grown your hair out.</li>
            <li> This product is a winner!  It smooths out my hair beautifully and it has a wonderful smell that lasts for days.  I would recommend this conditioner for everyone.</li>
            <li> My hair did not get smooth and was still left matted and tangled.  When drying my hair I had a lot of knots.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Dried my hair out horribly . Doesn&#x27;t make it shine . Feels like horse hair. NOT WORTH IT AT ALL .</li>
