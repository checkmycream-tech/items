            <li>Good quality&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a great idea, but needs to have the lower head (closest to the hand) kind of float.</li>
            <li>Good price.  </li>
            <li>It feels good in my mouth as it massages my gums</li>
            <li>Saw this, read good reviews, no brainer.  </li>
            <li>BUT THEY ARE GOOD ALL BRUSES ARE OVER PRICED</li>
            <li>I would also recommend that these heads be used in conjunction with the Braun EB25-3 Oral-B Triumph FlossAction brush heads and a good whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>

            <li>Thanks Oral B for making wonderful products for oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>it works OK, but not as good as the Prowhite brush head.  </li>
            <li>but I am able to get a good two months out of each brush.</li>
            <li>I believe it to be fairly priced, and absolutely love the results.</li>

            <li>I have been using the Oral-B Dual Clean for about 6 months, it works great and inexpensive than the $80 systems.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Dual Clean brushes are great.</li>
            <li>But this head is great for quickie between meal cleaning, and as a bonus is pretty good at brushing off my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Great product and makes my teeth feel clean and refreshed after brushing.</li>

            <li>I really believe my teeth are in better shape because of using an electric toothbrush and Oral-B makes the best.</li>

            <li>however, i did get my refund, But  I am lost as to how to get a good price on a genuine set of brush</li>
            <li>I love my electric toothbrush - the manual kind cannot compare.  </li>
            <li>these are perfect thestiffnessnot too soft not too stiffperfect dtiffness to me</li>
            <li>I am always satisfied after brushing using this kind of brush head.</li>
            <li>it is much better having your own teeth.</li>
            <li>It does an effective job for me and it is definitely better than a manual brush.  </li>
            <li>This fits perfect, and gave it an upgrade to my old aging system.</li>
            <li>These are the best toothbrush heads, in my opinion, by far.</li>

            <li>Amazon and Oral-B have made it easy to replace my brush head through Prime ordering!</li>
            <li>pack of three that go strong!</li>
            <li>This product works as good as the original and was sent in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>They are as good of quality as the original</li>
            <li>GOOD INSTRUMENT FOR CLEAN TEETH</li>
            <li>Leaves a good clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I love to drink teas and teas can stain very easily.  </li>
            <li>A good bargain and the right kind which I couldn&#x27;t find in a store.</li>
            <li>When I first started using electric tooth brushes I was told that they are great for brushing tongue, roof of mouth, inside cheek, etc.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s funny to leave a review for a toothbrush replacement head, but this one is really great.</li>
            <li>great price for exactly what I needed .</li>
            <li>These work great, they&#x27;re not breaking or anything, but I&#x27;m on the first head</li>
            <li>Great product for the whole family!</li>
            <li>I like the Oral B electric tooth brush and these heads are very good when they are new.  </li>
            <li>Brushes heads are excellent, They clean very well and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>These Oral B dual clean replacement brushes are really exceptional brushes.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with my purchase of the Oral-B Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head.  </li>
            <li>Good product, but nothing revolutionary or invasively large about it like part of me was kind of expecting after reading the reviews here.</li>
            <li>I love OralB produce for almost one year.</li>
            <li>I am okay with them, but prefer just the eound head one.</li>
            <li>This is the brush I like because is has many directions of motion for cleaning.</li>
            <li>This is also better than the Crest Toothbrush operated by AA batteries as the batteries will lose power.</li>
            <li>These are the real heads and work great.  </li>
            <li>I feel it does a better job of cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I just make sure I brush over the sink.</li>
            <li>The product itself works great, Amazon has made it much more reasonable.  </li>
            <li>IT WAS AN OK TOOTH BRUSH</li>
            <li>We love our electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I will know better after my six months dental checkup and will do a follow-up review at that time.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the Dual Brush.</li>
            <li>I feel like I am getting more cleaning done.</li>
            <li>WHY PAY MORE IN THE STORE.</li>
            <li>MY TEETH LOVE</li>
            <li>should be somewhere between 3 and 4 dollars, at most.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found</li>
            <li>The dual action head provides better brushing and they fit the machine perfectly.</li>
            <li>So glad to find these as none of the stores carry this item.</li>
            <li>B0002KHTG6 Oral-B Pro White]], and these are the best!</li>
            <li>Maybe I like this brush better because I&#x27;m a guy</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast makes me a happy customer. :)</li>
            <li>Glad I gave it a try and teeth</li>
            <li>I have been using this product now for many years.  </li>
            <li>This product is better than the toothbrush heads I buy in the store.  </li>
            <li>It is priced reasonably and does a great job.</li>
            <li>I am convinced that my teeth look whiter, remain plaque free for a longer period of time and that my gums and tongue are cleaned more effectively.  </li>
            <li>have never been as satisfied with a toothbrush head as these and would gladly recommend them to friends, family and even strangers.</li>
            <li>I realize that this an over the top review</li>
            <li>but I love these toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I had the best results as shown by our last cleanings.  </li>
            <li>After many attempts to reduce tartar, we didn&#x27;t see results until we used this brush head type.  </li>
            <li>I love this two-phase Braun toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li>It does take up more space in the mouth though for those withouth a lot of room.</li>
            <li>If there is a better and more durable alternative brush/brush-head, please let me know.</li>
            <li>Figured i would give my Oral B one more chance.  </li>
            <li>It does not seem to put much more of a load on the motor.</li>
            <li>I have seen prices for 1 head, that were more than what I paid for these 3 heads.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t forget to order them (and to get even better</li>
            <li>These work better than the ones that came with the brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found these on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I will buy again if available!</li>
            <li>price is more than inexpensive for the quality - it&#x27;s downright super-affordable.</li>
            <li>I like these dual heads for better teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li>Works better than a manual toothbrush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>, I think that this head does an even better job.  </li>
            <li>Great toothbrush refills at reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad we were able to find it here.</li>
            <li>They worked okay.  </li>
            <li>I think this is the best toothbrush out there based on my experience using electrics over the last 20 years or so.</li>
            <li>Each replacement brush is different but both are WONDERFUL</li>
            <li>These brushes do a fantastic job!</li>
            <li>I love the dual actiona plus the timer on my brush.</li>
            <li>i love these bestter than the softer ones</li>

            <li>We love these and the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>a significantly better experience?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a cheapskate, I never thought I&#x27;d like the idea of paying more for toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>It feels much more substantial, and although it may not offer more cleaning power, it does offer peace of mind.</li>
            <li>Another added advantage is that it is much better for brushing your tongue.</li>
            <li>I love my oral b electric tooth brush.</li>

            <li>I love these brush heads.</li>
            <li>It works great, but the cost is too much.</li>

            <li>This model brush more than met my expectations.</li>
            <li>I have a relatively old power handle, but these brushes fit it perfectly and perform as advertised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Except to the molars, my jaw is curved, as I assume most are.  </li>
            <li>the 15% is better than any coupon I&#x27;d ever seen for my replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>so it does a better job.</li>
            <li>I like but 5 stars I love</li>
            <li>so this is automatically a better option for me than the others)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>More paste &#x3D; more goo&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to add more information if I find anything else</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve used it exclusively for 4 years with the Dual action brushes because I get great coverage while brushing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, DON&#x27;T buy unless its \\&quot;SOLD\\&quot; \\&quot;AND\\&quot; \\&quot;FULFILLED\\&quot; by Amazon, there are many reports about cheap counterfeits here (</li>

            <li>Unlike the original set you receive this one both vibrates at the bottom and oscillates at the top.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the other types of Oral-B brush heads that go with their handle, but this one cleans the best.  </li>
            <li>I love my toothbrush and these are the replacements for the original heads that came with my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but they seem to use more battery life than the original brush heads where they are dual action.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this - and it&#x27;s better than the original brush I had on the Oral B.  </li>
            <li>I love the price and how easy everything was, defenely will buy this product againg, the brush was in the original package and mint conditions.</li>
            <li>I (and my dentist and periodondist) love the way the Oral-B Dual Clean Brush Head cleans my teeth and all along the gum line.  </li>

            <li>They fit my Oral B electric toothbrush (which I love) just fine and work just fine.</li>
            <li>Easy to keep charged...</li>

            <li>The replacements are easy to change.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kinda &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; on these.&lt;br /&gt;They may clean better?  </li>
            <li>The dual clean brush heads are my families favorite and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to add more information if I find anything else worth considering</li>

            <li>Easy shopping.  </li>
            <li>- they seem to clean more thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I love how they clean my teeth</li>
            <li>However your schedule is set up for teeth cleaning; having the hygienist repeatedly tell you to floss more; given every size shape or color tooth brush; then I purchase the electric tooth brush with the dual clean BRUSH HEAD.</li>
            <li>My oral-B toothbrush has been around for years and is still going strong.  </li>

            <li>I like to replace my brush heads every three months, this little pack was perfect.</li>
            <li>The brush is the perfect size to not be too large to reach into the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li>These heads are huge . . .</li>
            <li>There is a huge difference between manual, battery operated and the Oral-B electric brushes.</li>

            <li>I thought it was great pricing, will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>just want genuine replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>This is such a great &amp; durable product.</li>
            <li>this product is great, the only problem is the size</li>
            <li>Overall though it&#x27;s great to mix it up</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>, I have decided to keep an additional 3 pak available at all</li>
            <li>Fit was accurate and they work well.  </li>
            <li>Items didn&#x27;t fit my product.  </li>
            <li>these items fit my toothbrush and work quite well.  </li>
            <li>The front head of this one is smooth cylinder head.</li>
            <li>Such a great price for these.  </li>
            <li>The Oral B replacement heads fit my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I tried the cheap aftermarket copies.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Avoid cheap knock off.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone with a petite mouth use this as their primary toothbrush head.</li>
            <li>For me I&#x27;m happy to get a solid product and toss the wrapping.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t even know this type was available.</li>
            <li>Upon reading the instructions, we discovered that replacement heads were available.  </li>
            <li>I did not try to return because someone in our family has a toothbrush that it does fit, but we still need brush heads for our Pulsonics.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Happy, don&#x27;t feel big in my mouth.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t something I genuinely cared about</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t something I genuinely cared about</li>
            <li>Amazon is the lowest price that I have found for this brush head and all the orders have been genuine Oral-B products.</li>
            <li>and it seems genuine.</li>
            <li>I have tried to be cheap and buy the store brand version of these toothbrush heads that claim they&#x27;ll fit my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The replacement heads fit my Brawn electric tooth brush and work</li>
            <li>Fit on my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>When I turn it on and use it, the light on the charger starts dancing letting me the vibes are going though my eyeballs.</li>
            <li>The heads fit my brush model</li>
            <li>Fit brush.</li>
            <li>Go on easily and clean your teeth well.  </li>
            <li>The are the actual name-brand replacement parts, are reasonably priced and work wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say I am a convert, but it has been a good experience so far.</li>
            <li>So far so good will reorder when I run out of the three.</li>
            <li>Other then that very good.</li>
            <li>I think that the larger brush head and rigid bristles are great for me, but my wife prefers the gentler bristle brush heads that originally came with the tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend and reorder for sure !!</li>
            <li>Getting 3 for the price is also very economical.</li>
            <li>the service was very fast and the item worked great and was a better price than I could find locally.</li>
            <li>It feels like they clean twice as good as the old type.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t think it is quite as good as the flossing action brush which I give 5 stars thus the 4 star rating for the dual clean.</li>
            <li>These fit perfectly and work like little champions!</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t fit the head I was originally shopping for.</li>
            <li>I have used these on my Braum Triumph Professional Care 9000 electric toothbrush for years, Amazon offers absolute best price I have ever found, I love this type of brush because I get great reports from my dentist keeping cost low on my checkups twice a year.</li>
            <li>The Dual Clean heads don&#x27;t fit in the traveling case, so I still purchase the FlossAction for traveling and when my mouth was swollen and sore after getting some wisdom teeth pulled.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I cannot think of anything in particular I&#x27;d want or need in an improved version of this toothbrush head.</li>
            <li>price is already a bargain but with additional available discounts like Free Super Saver Shipping, it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li>but when it came to getting replacement brushes so I could share the brush with immediate family or just keep on brushing they want an arm and a leg for them - much more reasonable on AMAZON!</li>
            <li>I originally subscribed to this product at a price around 8 dollars for three.  </li>
            <li>If you can get this for a deal, its worth it!  </li>
            <li>These are perfect for people that don&#x27;t like the small toothbrush head that comes on the precision brush.</li>
            <li>I had been very satisfied with the Oral B Floss Action Brush Heads until I tried the Oral-B DualAction Premium Power Toothbrush Head Refill.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Could not find the identical brush like I had originally purchased so went to amazon and found this.</li>
            <li>The brushes were sealed in original packaging.</li>
            <li>but when Amazon had a sale on the original ones, I bought them too.</li>
            <li>Original replacement brushes and just what I needed.</li>
            <li>THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR ORIGINAL ORAL B REPLACEMENT BRUSH HEADS.</li>
            <li>Well, if I didn&#x27;t love the Oral B I wouldn&#x27;t have been in hot pursuit of replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li>Thanks!  :)</li>
            <li>Original parts original performance.</li>
            <li>This is the original one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>But they are absolutely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>but they just are nothing like the original Oral B replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li>The replacement heads were received and are performing as I would expect them (it) to perform just like the original one performed.</li>
            <li>First of all, my product was authentic and I&#x27;m not disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li>I like to switch with each brush change from this style to the original style.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if these are the original Oral-B brand or not</li>
            <li>I prefer the original sized brush head.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re sticking to the original Oral-B ones.</li>
            <li>Pro: Works as original in stores with way lower prices&lt;br /&gt;Con:</li>
            <li>I was excited to replace mine and these</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting for :)</li>
            <li>previously(which came in the original set).</li>
            <li>These are superb and exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found these because they saved me so much money!</li>
            <li>and Amazon usually has the best price.  </li>
            <li>I bought Oral-B dual clean 3 month ago and now I brush my teeth for two minutes; their are cleaner and brushing is fun now!</li>
            <li>It is so nice to fing replacement parts for something, rather than buy a new one.</li>

            <li>, I stick with the Dual Clean.</li>

            <li>Fits my Oral B Precision Clean Battery toothbrush, too.</li>
            <li>I like the way my teeth and gums feel as the brush heads clean and floss my teeth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for 10 years and have always received praise from my dentist over how clean my teeth are.</li>
            <li>Enter, the dual clean brush head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been liking the ease and speed of getting my teeth clean, and my dentist has been liking the results.</li>
            <li>I tried several heads and the Prowhite head is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I bought the dual clean as the brush has dual heads and thus twice the brushing area.  </li>
            <li>Get my teeth really clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>and these heads clean it well.</li>
            <li>Leaves my teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>But this should not be a reason to take away from the cleaning power of the brush and the freshness and clean feeling of your gums and teeth after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought these because I thought they would be more effective than the smaller heads.</li>
            <li>I dont feel like I have clean teeth if I use anything else</li>
            <li>My dentist can not believe how clean it keeps my teeth.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much more than the regular FlexiSoft head that I immediately ordered the 3-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried others but my teeth doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it does with the Dual Clean Brush Heads.</li>
            <li>This one however, although claims to help you clean by having two parts, does not work that well.</li>
            <li>dentist clean.</li>
            <li>This brush head does it&#x27;s job, which is to clean your pearly whites.</li>
            <li>I can attest that my teeth feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li>My teeth just never felt clean even though I was brushing for 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>These replacement brushes used with the cordless toothbrush always clean teeth well and my dental hygienist always complements me on how well I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve seen many complain about the size being too large.</li>
            <li>Large size &#x3D; more paste being used&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>The price is right!  </li>
            <li>This came with the exact heads that I needed - fit fine on my Oral B Braun Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a good portion of the other ones that Oral-B offers, but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I love Dual Clean for the double brushes work magic and have proven most effective in my overall tooth/gum maintenance in between my dental visits.  </li>
            <li>These fit my Oral-B electric toothbrush properly and I have been very satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>this one is absolutely necesary if you want more people to use this brush</li>
            <li>Never wanted to pay this much for an eletric toothbrush, but after many of the $10 market ones I got this.  </li>
            <li>It is good for people with big mouths (like me!).</li>
            <li>This 3-ct package cost only $13.xx good price.</li>
            <li>The brush heads last a good while as well.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s an even better deal if you can catch on sale, or as part of Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;Subscribe &amp; Save\\&quot; program (if you REALLY like brushing your teeth).</li>
            <li>My teeth feel super clean afterward.</li>
            <li>BEST quality for least $$.</li>
            <li>Good solid product.  </li>
            <li>I really think it does a better job of brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li>spin brush heads out there that do not stand up to the true thing.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush heads are good; I give this 4 stars instead of 5 because they seem to wear out on the earlier side</li>
            <li>My husband and I changed from manual toothbrushes when the dentist expressed concern that we were not doing such a good job along the gum line of our teeth.</li>
            <li>Nice to have the dual action head.</li>
            <li>I was using the single head until I tried the dual head and liked it much better.</li>
            <li>This brush head can cover a lot or real estate for a quick clean up as well as being a great regular tooth brush head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing which is very important for me is that since it has a bigger size, it allows more paste to be put onto it...</li>
            <li>The Oral B Dueal Clean Replacment Brush Heads fit my Oral-B Vitality Braum Brush Holder exactly.  </li>
            <li>This brush head is also great if you like to brush other parts of your mouth, not just your teeth.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant difference in how clean my teeth are after brushing with this head and the others, this being far better.</li>
            <li>works great, I use this brand all the time , the prices really are not much different then at walmart</li>
            <li>/&gt;This fits most of the current line of Braun brushes, but check your manual to be sure.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it does a better job than the default, smaller [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Glad to find this particular brush.</li>
            <li>After trying all of the available Oral-B Brush heads, this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>These brush heads are super.</li>
            <li>However, the brush head is huge and honestly designed for larger mouths.</li>
            <li>I love the feel that my Oral-B toothbrush leaves my teeth and these brushes are the main reason.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>surely buy more in the future</li>
            <li>So I am glad I was able to get proper replacements.</li>
            <li>This particular replacement brush head contains more bristles than the brush head that came with the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and they arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job cleaning teeth, you can really feel the difference using this as compared to a regular brush, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for everyone in the family, we have 4 of them now :)</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon, I found the right fitting brush heads</li>
            <li>It makes it feel more like a normal toothbrush instead of an electric one.</li>
            <li>I tried this as a normal replacement head and found I enjoyed using my OralB toothbrush again.  </li>
            <li>I liked my original brush head because it had multiple types and density of bristles within the one head.</li>
            <li>They fit exactly on my hand piece.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for and the price was fabulous.  </li>
            <li>So far, I like the ultra soft and sensitive one the best.</li>
            <li>The Dual Clean heads are by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>The Dual Clean, along w/ the Floss Action replacement heads, are my favorite.</li>
            <li>My teeth definitely are more clean after using this brush head!</li>
            <li>More so my mistake for trying something new.</li>
            <li>Love these new brushes.  </li>
            <li>A great compliment to the Oral-B Precision Black 7000 Rechargeable Unit and the brush head that I needed.</li>
            <li>I am happy I purchased this because the brush heads are reminiscent to a regular toothbrush&#x27;s head except it is more powerful and worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is also a good idea to have extras around to use in your travel bag and makes traveling with a toothbrush pretty simple.</li>
            <li>I did love these brush heads at first, but after time, not so much.  </li>
            <li>I wish they made them at a more reasonable price even though it still does its job pretty well.</li>
            <li>Cleans teeth very well, even better than the stock brush head I received when I first bought the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Well I won&#x27;t be buying them again because they are too large for my mouth, though the quality is just fine.</li>
            <li>Read all the awesome reviews and while it is great, it is harder to get to the inner side of the teeth due to it&#x27;s size.  </li>
            <li>I like Oral-B Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head very much.</li>
            <li>I like using these for my Oral B vitality a lot more than the regular dinky little circular ones - these give a better clean and are a good price</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>I was leery of the shape at first, but after one brushing, I&#x27;m hooked!  </li>
            <li>So not only do I get my replacement heads conviently through the mail, but I also save more than getting them at, (dare I say it?), Walmart!</li>
            <li>and it does the job very well!!</li>
            <li>I like the dual clean because they brush a wider area for the same amount of time and do a better job for those of us who need an electric toothbrush to get our teeth clean.</li>
            <li>I feel the dual clean gives me a more thorough clean with the 2 brushes working a larger area simultaneously.  </li>
            <li>This is a really useful head for any of the toothbrushes it fits.</li>
            <li>Its worth it.</li>
            <li>It may be worth a try.</li>
            <li>The dual cleaning brushes really help achieve a fresh, super clean feeling after brushing.</li>
            <li>People with smaller mouths may want to try both brushes to see which is more comfortable for them.</li>
            <li>It is kind of big</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, keep smile&#x27;n</li>
            <li>Is a nice electric toothbrush , the brush is simple wonderfull.</li>
            <li>Love the multirush action.</li>
            <li>build quality, good functionality, and overall very satisfactory.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to get such a bargain.  </li>
            <li>I have these on a recurring order and love that they are sent just when you need to replace the old ones.  </li>
            <li>I love the dual action of this brush...</li>
            <li>The only kind I use.</li>
            <li>In my opinion they are well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>These are almost twice as big as the sonicare kind.</li>
            <li>I got these on sale for 13.99 and will worth it.</li>
            <li>I get these as part of a subscription, so they help insure that I use a replacement brush more frequently that would otherwise happen.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I bought the economical 3-pack.  </li>
            <li>man oh man, does it get foamy, an indication of freshly cleaned dental and gum surfaces.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With an \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; toothbrush, I always looked for the most bristles I could find</li>
            <li>Using this in conjunction with the Professional Deep Sweep gives a great cleaning.</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth better than Floss Action head.</li>
            <li>The floss action is my favorite.</li>
            <li>These are well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Based from my experience the floss action is a better brush.</li>
            <li>No need to worry, it would come in handy later on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are by far My Favorite Brushes:&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>Useful life is about 3 months.  </li>
            <li>Actually gave these to my son, who uses the right kind of Oral-B handle.  </li>
            <li>These Dual Action brushes seem to clean better and more area than the regular circular brush.  </li>
            <li>Just wish the price point was better and with in even, not odd count.</li>
            <li>arrived quick and they were exactly what we needed for our Oral B toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>bristles arrived quickly and were exactly as advertised... no complaints.</li>
            <li>This particular toothbrush head fits the old Braun electric toothbrush that I own.  </li>
            <li>This is a replacement head for an Oral B electrical toothbrush, and I like these larger toothbrush heads since they clean the teeth better, well they work for me.</li>
            <li>and now that I removed the bottom brush I can go back to getting a gentler better clean.</li>
            <li>whereas the original was much easier.</li>
            <li>is fast and the product is not a knock off of the original product.</li>
            <li>Came on time and was done the right way.</li>
            <li>Oral-B got it right with these replacement brush heads.  </li>
            <li>He seemed to think we (me and the missus) were doing something right.</li>
            <li>and when I found them here did not expect them to be the right ones.</li>
            <li>Priced just right also.</li>
            <li>I can order and have it right a way.  </li>
            <li>and I never run out, and always get the right one.</li>
            <li>I find it very comfortable and it covers more of my teeth in less time.</li>
            <li>This brush does work well and helps clean my teeth very thoroughly.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;dual-clean&amp;#34; head is very thorough and will clean your teeth well.</li>
            <li>My teeth are as clean as they have ever been thanks to Oral-B</li>
            <li>I have to do so much brushing to get my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Oral-B Dual clean brush head cleans my teeth really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it before and it really works on keeping my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>My whole mouth feels really clean</li>
            <li>How do people keep their teeth clean with just a straight toothbrush?  </li>
            <li>That head worked very well, so I decided to try the dual clean ones.</li>
            <li>I was concerned as to whether they would fit an older Oral-B tooth brush - but no problem.</li>
            <li>Every use is like a trip to the dentist with dual heads that really leave you feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Sometimes seems better to buy a whole new device than replacements.</li>
            <li>fact, this is the same size as a typical brush head and it is awesome!  </li>
            <li>work fine, just like new</li>
            <li>We really like that they are a full head and agree our teeth feel cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>The dual cleaning makes plaque and left over food removal more effective and longer lasting.</li>
            <li>Maybe because my brush is a few years old, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find a good replacement on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The double brush (dual clean) feels better than one in my opinion because it covers more area and feels closer to a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Relatively inexpensive and easy to change!</li>
            <li>BUT THE ORIGINAL SINGLE SPINNING HEAD CLEANER SEEMED TO DO A BETTER JOB.</li>
            <li>to large to use!  </li>
            <li>I have ordered these particular brushheads a number of timesn for use with the Oral-B Dual Clean rechargable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother with the generic, they aren&#x27;t near as good.</li>
            <li>I used to have a Sonicare, but switched over to Oral-B because Oral-B&#x27;s electric toothbrushes seemed just as good (and actually, I prefer Oral-B now), and the replacement toothbrush heads are considerably cheaper as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are great for those of us that have mouths big enough to use them.  </li>
            <li>It seems to clean my teeth better than the single headed brush.</li>
            <li>The EB17 is still great for getting in tight spots, particularly the  backs of the rearmost molars.</li>
            <li>, it was a huge step up from the old Ora brush!</li>
            <li>These heads do a great job at getting down between teeth and into the gumline, and with regular flossing my mouth is always fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>this is a great item to pair my new brush now I can reach the more tough spot.</li>
            <li>have all of my wisdom teeth because I have very straight teeth.</li>
            <li>, I have not stepped up to the Sonic, have other things I need to spend my money on, but these keep my teeth and gums very clean and do a super job!</li>
            <li>Felt like a brand new toothbrush, just like the original.</li>
            <li>Amazon had exactly the correct Oral B replacement heads, 3 to a package, for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>They are great because they prevent one from brushing too hard as compared to using a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I get great values from Amazon and hardly ever have to pay shipping fees.</li>
            <li>The single heads are quite easy and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, these brushes are Oral-B made, they work well and were available at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Love how it seems that more of my teeth get brushed at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I think I like the smaller ones better.</li>
            <li>exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Decided to give Amazon a try and sure enough there</li>
            <li>Same replacement heads at a better price.</li>
            <li>I bought this first anticipating the Oral B Advancedpower 950TX would work,of which was writen about/reviewed.hopefully</li>
            <li>I like that the head is larger and feels like it cleans more at once.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful, strong..but expensive.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time and works exactly as the one replaced.</li>
            <li>I feel like I can have a more efficient brush with these, when compared to the smaller heads.</li>
            <li>I love Oral B products and these brushes especially that I can order in  quantity.  </li>
            <li>AGAIN, WHY PAY MORE AT THE STORE FOR THE SAME ITEM ;-)</li>
            <li>Vertically, the distance from the topmost to the bottommost bristle is exactly an inch.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>These toothbrush heads are no larger than those found on many manual brushes.</li>
            <li>that I do it more regularly.</li>
            <li>better value than at any local store....</li>
            <li>This product is stronger, more durable and lasting.  </li>
            <li>They were the exact replacement for the ones I had been using.  </li>
            <li>like these brush heads better than any I&#x27;ve tried, but a toothbrush is a matter of personal choice.  </li>
            <li>Could not find this in walmart where I first bought it and the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>First rate product.  </li>
            <li>So glad to finally have these again.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this upon seeing the relatively consistent number of 4/5 reviews.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Individually they cost considerably more.  </li>
            <li>These toothbrush heads are great--much better than the one with only one head.  </li>
            <li>I cannot recommend this product any higher.  </li>
            <li>So these are exactly what they say they are--replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t believe that I&#x27;d find exactly the replacements I wanted at a price I wanted.</li>
            <li>personally like the Deep Sweep heads better, for they allow you a bit more control.</li>
            <li>The yellow bristles help to give a bit more firmness to the bristles on these brush</li>
            <li>work exactly as how I would imagine Oral B products to be.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads are reasonably priced and they do not fall apart!</li>
            <li>They really really do work as advertised!</li>
            <li>I always found the name brand replacements heads to be much better quality than the generic ones.</li>
            <li>Go for the real deal!</li>
            <li>The bigger the package of replacement brushes that you buy the better the price.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>the first is the most compact and cleans well, the 2nd is my preferred head for the Oral-B&#x27;s and the one I&#x27;ll buy consistently.</li>
            <li>Smaller heads are better and easier to use.</li>
            <li>he wanted something shaped more like a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>found these at a much better price than any place locally.  </li>
            <li>Always go with electronic tooth brushes since they will reduce plaque better than regular tooth</li>
            <li>I did not time them exactly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried just about every available replacement toothbrush for my Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000</li>
            <li>Cleans twice as much surface area!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>With that said they are of great quality and do last a long time, both in build and cleanliness.</li>
            <li>but if you want to save more go for the larger packages.</li>
            <li>I will most likely re-order these when i finish.</li>
            <li>The larger size equates to better cleaning for our house.</li>
            <li>These heads are much better than the smaller ones and cheaper on Amazon than Walmart.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;After all, it is not expensive when comparing to the one sold in supermarkets.</li>
            <li>The retail store price is higher than Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>I know Oral-B is aware of this problem</li>
            <li>it is a wee bit too much!</li>
            <li>Was looking for a head that was more regular toothbrush sized.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper then retail!</li>
            <li>They are toothbrush heads, and they function exactly as a toothbrush should.</li>
            <li>Finally was able to find these.</li>
            <li>I co0uld have gotten these at the supermarket for a much higher price, but I saved a bundle.</li>
            <li>I later found out that it&#x27;s better to get the advice of your dentist before selecting the brush for your electrical toothbrush that is appropriate for your specific needs.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The surface is bigger and I hope the cleaning is about twice more efficient.</li>
            <li>, so they are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>These replacement heads are great and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I was able to fix an issue I was having with my back molars.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I love that the second brush serves almost like a floss.  </li>
            <li>I love the Oral-B electric toothbrush and this head (compared to the smaller one).</li>
            <li>These fit into the professional Oral-B toothbrushes</li>
            <li>I was glad to see that Amazon had them and even had an option to get regular shipments of them sent</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Glad I can choose from different brushes.</li>
            <li>However, because it is bigger, it uses more power from the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I found it on Amazon and it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Exactly what it said it was.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>This product does a much better job of cleaning below the gum line than an regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I went to Amazon.com and found the exact system wanted and purchased it and then decided to search for these replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Joking aside that is what I thought when I stuck this into my mouth for the first time.</li>
            <li>I will definitely keep buying it here :)</li>
            <li>When I first bought my Oral-B brush, I immediately regretted not buying a Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I only need to brush for 2 minutes with this brush head and it is much more thorough.</li>
            <li>The brush head does exactly what it is advertised to do , looks just like advertised, arrived exactly as anticipated - no complaints at all.</li>
            <li>while the ordinary Oral-B head is superior to Sonicare, this head is really powerful.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what they say they are.  </li>
            <li>item works great but was significantly late in arriving</li>
            <li>These brush heads arguably clean better than the other Oral-B brush options.  </li>
            <li>This set of replacement brushes is the real thing for the right Oral-B handle.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m really getting my teeth clean--in the right way.</li>
            <li>These Dual Clean ones, being quite a bit larger, clean marginally better but give you less room to clean spots you think are necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At my last dental check-up, my dentist noted that, on top of the usual good news, my teeth didn&#x27;t have the tea-stains that he was used to seeing.  </li>
            <li>product and help keep teeth tar free with gentle dual action cleaning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, but the head is larger than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I was between the dual clean, the floss action, and the whitening one.  </li>
            <li>and she said, \\&quot;Wow, those are some clean teeth.</li>
            <li>the dual action is just what I need to clean and help remove plaque.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel as clean as when I get out of the dentist&#x27;s office after a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, yes, there is a lot more toothbrush there, but it&#x27;s covering twice the area and if you brush for the same amount of time as before it feels so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>The heads did not fit my oral-B toothbrush although the ordering description inferred that it fit &#x27;most&#x27; units.  </li>
            <li>and since I&#x27;m \\&quot;extremely\\&quot; used to the regular toothbrushes, this serves as a good way to make the transition to the electric toothbrushes (besides I like the regular size toothbrushes anyways</li>
            <li>The larger size allows you to brush a larger area of teeth at once, which is good if you&#x27;re used to the feel and size of a manual brush.</li>
            <li>I think what bothered me most about the bigger head is that the angles at which you approach your teeth are now more limited because of the increased brush size.  </li>
            <li>They felt large at first, but I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They last a long time, and make my teeth feel very clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>and I get positive feedback from my dentist.</li>
            <li>It feels much better in action than the old, single circular brush; I think it&#x27;s doing a better job of cleaning, too.</li>
            <li>, bristles looked different; like a regular tooth brush, genuine brush heads are more compact.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My local big chain store no longer carries this product and I wasn&#x27;t sure if the heads would fit my model of Oral-B electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed and was much cheaper than I could ever find in a store.</li>
            <li>They are the original Oral-B heads that I regularly use, not the knock-offs that lose bristles with each use.&lt;br /&gt;These are well worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li>These are high quality and do the job right.</li>
            <li>I have an old Braun electric tooth brush that had just the round part as a brush head, i bought this hoping it would fit and work, and it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it a few times now, and it is still working perfect with no issues.</li>
            <li>I bought them to replace my Deep Sweep heads, and they have worked quite well so far (they cover slightly more area overall, and certainly with more focus on dents).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apparently it cleans so much better than my manual toothbrush, and a little better than Sonic Care.</li>
            <li>Much better than the single head brush one.</li>
            <li>They cover more area than a single</li>
            <li>definitely my favorite replacement head compared to the single head.</li>
            <li>beware, the brush heads are rather large.  </li>
            <li>The tooth brush heads are LARGE.</li>
            <li>I  need a large size for example)&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>I  need a large size for example)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is that these are too large and bulky for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d certainly buy them again.</li>
            <li>I do not find the brush head to be too large.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Oral B for  25 years, I can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li>I really like the dual brush head compared to the single brush head, as it brushes in more than one way.</li>
            <li>Service was fine; received them in relatively short time.</li>
            <li>The main reason I purchased with Amazon was because it cost $25 at Wal-Mart for these 3 replacement heads!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend getting one head first, and then deciding whether it works for you or not.</li>
            <li>Based on the many other positive reviews, I picked these up.</li>
            <li>and I really think using it has improved the health of my gums</li>
            <li>and I really think using it has improved the health of my gums.  </li>
            <li>Price through Amazon is very competitive, even beating WalMart after taking into account shipping.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>HOW MUCH THEY MARK UP PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li>Arrived in a very timely fashion.</li>
            <li>and I do not think the heads are too big to fit in my mouth at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And is much cheaper than $9 per head at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>All in all, that fits the tooth brush very well</li>
            <li>These work really well without spreading toothpaste all over you.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just because brushing seems so much easier</li>
            <li>This is my favorite of all the brush heads , can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.&lt;br /&gt;The best all round brush.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend it!  </li>
            <li>This product is very efficient.</li>
            <li>For a couple of bucks more, I think it&#x27;s money well spent.</li>
            <li>Ordered it and it arrived fast.</li>
            <li>these replacement heads work very well with my Braun Oral - B Vitality electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This electric toothbrush works very well.</li>
            <li>I brush thoroughly, and this toothbrush makes thorough brushing much easier than a manual toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the 3-pak option is very convenient and saves money.</li>
            <li>Would recommend the Power Toothbrush Head for anyone who wants a robust tooth cleaning experience.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon DBM</li>
            <li>I really like the toothbrush these go with.  </li>
            <li>This brush head cleans very well.  </li>
            <li>How could a gizmo really make brushing my teeth</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used the regular heads and thought &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34; when I saw these available.</li>
            <li>Really cleans well...</li>
            <li>Price at Amazon is much lower</li>
            <li>In my experience, your money is better spent on the floss brushes.</li>
            <li>Now that I am using the Gentle brush heads, prescribed by my periodontist, the receding has subsided.  </li>
            <li>They have been practical and have made economic sense to me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I realize you don&#x27;t need to replace your brush head very often</li>
            <li>This one seems to be too much brush for me.</li>
            <li>I really like these heads.  </li>
            <li>Bought one for the whole family and have had them for almost a year now.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>simply functions as a bonus - instead of something I genuinely care about...</li>
            <li>Dualaction (i couldn&#x27;t really differentiate between the two functions while in use</li>
            <li>Dualaction (i couldn&#x27;t really differentiate between the two functions while in use</li>
            <li>and they were shipped so fast to me.</li>
            <li>Found these at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I think they are reasonable in cost and toss them when they wear out.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Vnetta</li>
            <li>your time (and, ironically probably your money) and buy the real Oral B.</li>
            <li>It cleans very well.</li>
            <li>Just didn&#x27;t realize that these attach differently than the heads that fit our handles.  </li>
            <li>Loves it soon much.</li>
            <li>They come three to a pack and are much cheaper to buy via Amazon than in the drugstore (you can&#x27;t find them at Wal-Mart).</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Works very well with my Triumph toothbrush</li>
            <li>Too much going on and not needed in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Thanks for asking...</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my teeth and also on my gums.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li>Be ready to see if you can return.</li>
            <li>These work very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like the feel of this brush on my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>It cleans very well.  </li>
            <li>It really cleans your teeth.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>The shipping is fast.</li>
            <li>However in this case, it&#x27;s really really snug.</li>
            <li>I have used this style brush for several years and get good dental checkups with minimal scraping by the hygienist.</li>
            <li>My husband seemed to really liked them, but next time I will buy the smaller brushes for myself.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the regular old heads</li>
            <li>extra bristles with their side-to-side oscillation add more oomph to the Oral B&#x27;s tingle-inducing cleaning action.  </li>
            <li>This brush head does a better job than the round head units that come with the toothbrush.t&lt;br /&gt;Considering the cost of dental care, the Oral B system is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>The dual action is my second favorite.</li>
            <li>The extra action doubles the brush work and pays off in a more thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li>I like the dual clean because they seem to do a better job of cleaning your teeth and gums than the smaller single head solutions that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the dual clean over the standard single brush head style, which I have used for years.  </li>
            <li>As other reviewers have stated, these brush heads are a bit large, and so far on 2/2 of them the lower brush head has loosened providing a nice gap for my tongeue/cheek to get pinched in.</li>
            <li>Much quicker than just the original circular head since it covers more area while still getting into hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>The dual action cleans your teeth and massages gums with just the right amount of pressure.</li>
            <li>The smaller heads just do not feel like they clean as well - would like to see a larger pack available.</li>
            <li>Several other people in my family had and loved it.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Dual Clean brush head works very well and it was moderately priced.</li>
            <li>It really gives you an extra clean.</li>
            <li>In fact this package contains three replacements at a price below what many other retailers are listing for just one.</li>
            <li>Personally, I feel its size is very comparable to any normal sized toothbrush (not including travel or cheap freebie brushes).</li>
            <li>No different than the original</li>
            <li>These are original Oral-B heads same as the one in the toothbrush so no surprises here.</li>
            <li>it came with, she would only use the Dual Clean one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course this does not eliminate actual flossing but the brush does clean well.  </li>
            <li>I notice that when I floss after brushing with the dual clean there is scarcely any debris left between my teeth, if any at all.  </li>
            <li>The dual clean head just feels too big and bulky.</li>
            <li>These brushes definitely give my teeth a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I purchased the oral B toothbrush and it came with one head that only had a single brush, this is great as a three pack for me and my boyfriend, WITH different color rings</li>
            <li>I really like my electric tooth brush,  and these re-fills do the job, but I brush a lot, so I have to keep buying them, and I feel the cost is high.  </li>
            <li>I replaced my old small brush heads with these Dual Clean brushes and i love them.</li>
            <li>It may feel HUGE if you&#x27;re switching from the round heads, but you will quickly adjust!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my Oral-B. Like it better than the single action heads.</li>
            <li>And while I love my electric toothbrush, this price is simply not worth it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not putting nearly as much stress on my gums as I do with a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>They seem to be what the normal consumer who cannot shop the malls really needs.</li>
            <li>The dual clean brush head is larger than the ones I&#x27;ve been using; they are more similar in size to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>To me, the single head is fine for children.  </li>
            <li>The top brush spins while the bottom one moves up and down</li>
            <li>When I rinse, I see more loosened debris swirling down the drain.  </li>
            <li>The problem has become finding the correct replacement brushes since new generations have come along; problem solved!</li>
            <li>Ever since using the Oral-B spin brush, I have not encountered any new dental issues, and my dentist says my gums are healthier too!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these to anyone that would rather not have a mouth full of silver (or those fancy white ones!).</li>
            <li>The head-size of these is a little large, but they&#x27;re just right in terms of softness (closer to soft than medium, but still sturdy enough that my teeth feel smooth and clean after each brushing).  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than an new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>They probably do clean a little better, but I am not sure how much compared to the original brushes.</li>
            <li>THE COST WAS HALF THE PRICE OF MANY STORES</li>
            <li>Birthday gift for better half-</li>
            <li>but they cover more area so that brushing is less strenuous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have tried several different heads, including the floss action, dual clean and precision clean heads.</li>
            <li>These replacement brushes are the only ones available as far as I know.  </li>
            <li>I have had the Oral B system for 4 years now and my dental check-ups seem to have steadily improved.</li>
            <li>Nothing beats this particular brush head.  </li>
            <li>I brush twice a day for about 1.5min each time and the bottom brush head loosens off the main assembly within just 1 month of use.</li>
            <li>The main reason I order this from Amazon is for convenience.  </li>
            <li>The price went up so I bought some generic ones that are ok but not of the same quality.</li>
            <li>ive tried several of the different heads for my brush but this one, the dualaction, is my favorite.</li>
            <li>But work decent.</li>
            <li>This brush head seems to do a more thorough job at cleaning than the regular smaller ones.</li>
            <li>but I truly like the larger head as it seems to do so much more work than the smaller head.</li>
            <li>It keeps the plaque at bay while doing a decent job of cleaning your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>The same as the oral-B brushes you can buy at your local store, but with a slightly better price.</li>
            <li>My local super market wanted me to buy 6 heads.</li>
            <li>I should have bought the single one just to try it out, but I was certain I&#x27;d love the bigger one.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you buy these and brush for two minutes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li>If you can afford it I highly recommend getting Oral-B.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this replacement head.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and supplier.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>If anything, I&#x27;m surprised the default head that comes with most Vitality and other Oral-B Electric brands is the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>original head was slightly different and never had any issue except getting old and brushes needed replacement.</li>
            <li>It felt bulkier than the floss action too even though I have large teeth.</li>
            <li>It took a little more time to be delivered than was the norm</li>
            <li>Did not mean to get the Dual heads.  </li>
            <li>to use something a little more substantial for shipping.</li>
            <li>You pay a little more for these</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used the Oral-B Professional Dual Clean brush for several years.  </li>
            <li>If one becomes used to the small head on most electric tooth brushes,it might seem large in comparison.</li>
            <li>Dual action probly has twice the amount of bristles at werq and feels more like a real toothbrush than the funky little ones that these brushes come with.</li>
            <li>bristles are soft and it works really</li>
            <li>I tried my husband&#x27;s floss action brush head this morning and found it much easier to maneuver.</li>
            <li>This corrects that problem and really adds a lot of cleaning and gum massaging to the brush action.  </li>
            <li>The bristles get too soft to really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If anything, the fact that you have a normal toothbrush going to town in your mouth, is a plus.</li>
            <li>The ones that are &amp;#34;rotating&amp;#34; only, and the &amp;#34;Professional Deep Sweep are far better . . .</li>
            <li>They run for almost the same price so it should be worth it.</li>
            <li>After 1 month of normal use, the bottom part broke off and exposed a metal part.</li>
            <li>reason for that is that its pretty much the closest to a traditional toothbrush considering its size...</li>
            <li>worth consideringothers feeling differently -</li>
            <li>THEY ARE WAY OVER PRICED, BUT THAT IS NORMAL</li>
            <li>SO much reasonably priced compared to the store and EXACTLY the same!</li>
            <li>My teeth are soo clean after using this brush...never again use the single brush head.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the single head version that came with the brush over the dual clean model.  </li>
            <li>But other than that they work fine.</li>
            <li>frankly, the other size refills do a fairly good job as well, but I personally feel that I&#x27;m not using enough paste while brushing with them</li>
            <li>This wider brush is just as good as the single round brush.</li>
            <li>Merchant finally made things right.  </li>
            <li>where better than the plain circle.</li>
            <li>The simple reason is that with the smaller head (with just the cicle of bristles), I feel like I have more control and can really get around my back teeth.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t appear as though it&#x27;s that big, but it feels very large in mouth.  </li>
            <li>It should be included when you buy a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>THE NEW STIFFNESS</li>
            <li>We will probably buy these over and over until something new comes up and our dentist recommends it.</li>
            <li>It solved all of my problems with my toothbrush, and we gave the new toothbrush handle and a new head to our youngest son.  </li>
            <li>There were no brush covers for the new brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Then, they designed a NEW type of brush.  </li>
            <li>Also, i like the dual clean because it feels more of a toothbrush than the small single heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These Oral-B Professional Dual Clean replacement heads work very well as expected and have a relatively long and useful service life.</li>
            <li>These brushes heads are as expected for Oral-B Dual Clean Tooth brush.</li>
            <li>But you immediately get use to it after the first couple brushes and in all reality its no bigger than your normal tooth brush.</li>
            <li>This dual-head replacement brush is exactly what came with my initial powered tooth brush purchase.</li>
            <li>bought the Tooth Brush unit from Walmart and their price turns out not to be any lower than most other stores selling the same item!</li>
            <li>These replacement heads are exactly what I was looking for but couldn&#x27;t find in my local stores.  </li>
            <li>Wow, this will strip the paint off my house!.  </li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant to try this brush, but I thought because my teeth are a bit larger</li>
            <li>Was surprised to find that they are made in Germany [not China]!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d like the double brush design but after a week I&#x27;m now used to it and the regular heads seem tiny.  </li>
            <li>My last dentist checkup (first in 3 yrs) went like this...  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price locally and they shipped fast too with prime!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll see how long the brush head lasts, but for now, this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Love using it, I used this dual head cleaning for years, and I stopped using it because I couldn&#x27;t find it no more.  </li>
            <li>At first, they seemed really big in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Been using them for a month and no trouble whatsoever!  </li>
            <li>I ordered this once and its the EXACT same product that Oral B Sells.</li>
            <li>also, the first time I ordered them, I was sent a completely different type of brush head..</li>
            <li>These heads cover more brushing surface area and last longer than other heads.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend the floss Action one!</li>
            <li>Consistent use of these brushes does help to keep my dental bill low.  </li>
            <li>- it really depends on what size of toothbrushes you generally prefer I&#x27;d say -</li>

            <li>I guess the point is to save time, and brush more teeth surface at once, assuming that is the purpose of the small section of bristles on the bottom.</li>
            <li>i used the small head before, now this dual head works better</li>
            <li>I saved $20 by purchasing the exact same product that I have always bought in discount stores.</li>
            <li>, so then I tried another one from the package and it&#x27;s the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>These are the same as those included when I first purchased the product.</li>
            <li>I like the feel of the bigger brush head personally as it feels more the size of a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Since using this brush, I have had much better evaluations by dental professionals than in the past.  </li>
            <li>Prior to purchasing the Dual Clean brush heads I had only used the FlossAction and ProWhite brush heads.  </li>
            <li>My husband used to have an expensive sonicare and found this to get his teeth more clean.</li>
            <li>It certainly is not so bad that I won&#x27;t use them or felt a need to return them, but next time I need new heads I&#x27;ll go with the regular head.</li>
            <li>The dual clean works well, and I would recommend it to other buyers.</li>
            <li>I find it less comfortable when  brushing.  </li>
            <li>You end up using a greater number of the knock-offs, so the final trade off in price actually ends up being a lot less than it first appears</li>
            <li>This larger head seems to be the next step up, and in my opinion, it hits the sweet</li>
            <li>I had read the reviews about this bigger head, and I thought cool, twice the brushing power in the same amount of time!  </li>
            <li>They also seem to break-in pretty fast which may be good for some people and bad for others.</li>
            <li>He originally had the smaller head that came with the Braun unit (only the round part on top) and he thinks this bigger head gets his teeth cleaner.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush heads do not last long compare to the original heads years ago.</li>
            <li>I bought the unit because it needs only a couple of AA batteries which are easily replaced, unlike most rechargeable units which are kaput when the batteries fail to hold a charge.</li>
            <li>Have not tried the smaller headed brushes, but these do not seem too large.</li>
            <li>I thought I could not be any happier when I switched from a traditional tooth brush to using an Oral-B Smart Series electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li>They fit, they were on sale, and they came with their little gasket.</li>
            <li>You get a bit of extra brushing action when focusing on the top brush as if it were the regular single head.  </li>
            <li>However, it is hard to find any more in stores.  </li>
            <li>Replacements are many times hard to find</li>
            <li>These heads really get food bits (I know, sound icky) out from between your teeth.</li>
            <li>they work great, but will have to take extra care if you have any teeth that are not perfectly aligned.</li>
            <li>The Dual heads just aren&#x27;t as powerful and make it more difficult to reach a lot of places.</li>
            <li>Great brush heads, unfortunately my Oral-B toothbrush finally gave out on me</li>
            <li>My teeth felt much cleaner, which was confirmed a few months later by my dentist.</li>
            <li>I could not find a clear definition of the model numbers</li>
            <li>I have an oral b triumph and was using the circular sensitive toothbrush version until I got a sample pack and tried these.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see a difference between using this and just the regular brush head replacement.</li>
            <li>Still, something in me wants to say that toothbrush heads (especially when you&#x27;ve already dropped &gt;25 dollars for the body)</li>
            <li>/&gt;While others swear by higher-end brushes and/or sonic brushes, I have found that the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; I get from this brushing system is (so far) unsurpassed.  </li>
            <li>purchase couldn&#x27;t have been easier and seller sent what was advertised as stated and received purchase early.  </li>
            <li>soft.</li>
            <li>I enjoy having the choice of using the round brush and elongated.</li>
            <li>The dual action helps in cleaning the plaque and gingivitis.   </li>
            <li>As far as using the battery faster...</li>
            <li>In my experience this replacement head and electric toothbrush is the closest you can come to a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I really like the standard brushes and even the whitening/polishing version</li>
            <li>My fiance also started using it instead of her old electric brush</li>
            <li>Turned out the battery needed a charge and the dual brush was simply too much.</li>
            <li>Seems the replacement heads at my grocery store are about as much as the entire device.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it twice a day for about 2 years and never had any trouble Once</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than my local Walmart which was 2 for 19.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also had to accept paying nearly 4-5 times the value to get official heads over the knock-off.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel I have as much control as I had with the smaller brush head.</li>
            <li>With the flossing action brush one can feel the slim rubber tabs getting in between your teeth.  </li>
            <li>So much for &#x27;quality&#x27; German product.</li>
            <li>I like the size of them over the floss action heads and will keep using them.</li>
            <li>when we \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; to Oral-B from Sonicare and thought we would really like them since they are the same style of heads that we have been using for years.</li>
            <li>They are coming way too frequently.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the Floss Action over all others.</li>
            <li>That being said, my wife prefers this model over the floss action type.</li>
            <li>Just as the old ones.</li>
            <li>You get that just  professional cleaned feeling after each use.</li>
            <li>I still have my old aging ORAL-B professional care system, one with just the oscillating head.</li>
            <li>Item didn&#x27;t match description or work with ORAL-B Sonic Care Complete</li>
            <li>They are completely compatible with my Braun motor.</li>
            <li>These are a direct replacement for the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 series toothbrush, amongst others.  </li>
            <li>The cheap knock-offs fall apart after a few uses.</li>
            <li>I have no problems with them so far</li>
            <li>but I really wanted this bigger toothbrush head instead of the one that comes with it.  </li>
            <li>I replace my heads frequently.  </li>
            <li>I used serveral brush heads before, including the one packaged with the Oral B 5000 and the ultra sensitive head.</li>
            <li>However, one stil should use floss and proxy brushes as well for a complete cleanup.  </li>
            <li>I have a Braun/Oral B Triumph Professional Care.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used my Oral-B Professional toothbrush for over a year now.</li>
            <li>I bought this along with the floss action</li>
            <li>(Though I wish they came in &#x27;soft&#x27;.</li>
            <li>is it going to overwhelm you with bristling action.</li>
            <li>After switching to this head, I really feel a big difference in the degree of cleanliness of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Although a bit more expensive, the Oral B replacements are well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>what these brushes are, they are very expensive, although Amazon&#x27;s price was pretty good.</li>
            <li>I are the only ones that seem to work right in my mouth and are soft enough, not to hurt.</li>
            <li>too big for normal mouth!</li>
            <li>these work fine, but Oral-B keeps revising the toothbrush head line-up in ways that its hard to figure out what you&#x27;re buying, and how the new heads compare to the old ones I used to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s harder to clean the back side of your front teeth though.</li>
            <li>brush doesn&#x27;t feel big at all, it actually feels like using a normal toothbrush which is very comforting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Oral-B toothbrush unit and these dual action replacement brush heads (rotary and back &amp; forth).</li>
            <li>The larger brush gets loose quickly and can pinch my lip</li>
            <li>vibrating spinny brushes get your mouth clean without being so harsh on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My local stores do not carry the older brushes.</li>
            <li>Imagine it this way (assuming you&#x27;re using the regular Oral-B brush heads currently, the similar ones with just the top circular component): it&#x27;s like the same motion, with the form factor of a regular (non-mechanical) manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>just as long you select an electric toothbrush in the first place (I could certainly tell a big difference between regular and electric toothbrushes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just as long you select an electric toothbrush in the first place (I could certainly tell a big difference between regular and electric toothbrushes)    </li>
            <li>They last a long time and they  get  my teeth  clean and white.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find them on Amazon, they&#x27;re not easy to find</li>
            <li>The heads do wear down a little quickly and I have seen generic heads available for cheaper</li>
            <li>not only was the price less than bb&amp;b with a coupon but free shipping..</li>
            <li>The bristles are hard enough to really give you a smooth tooth finish after brushing for 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles are hard enough to really give you a smooth tooth finish after brushing for 2 minutes.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced it really matters what heads you have, as long as you have an Oral-B toothbrush</li>
            <li>and you are not forced to use the tiny circle heads - with the subscribe and save program</li>
            <li>dentist did warn that, with these spin brushes, one needs to resist the urge to manually add to the brush action (as opposed to just generally guiding the brush); otherwise, a spin brush tends to promote gum recession.</li>
            <li>With an average price of a touch over 4 dollars per head, it sure beats the jaw-dropping prices at Walgreens and other pharmacies (a pack of three for $30??</li>
            <li>I was leery about this product given that it is double the size of the normal Oral B toothbrush head.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>This is not intended to be brushed with like a normal toothbrush, however.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I went back to the normal brush head.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Dual Clean brush heads provide the much needed extra clean teeth feeling that traditional hand tooth brush heads fail to provide.</li>
            <li>Large size makes for a traditional feel if you are making a transition from the regular toothbrushes to the electric ones</li>
            <li>This brush is a little too big to feel comfortable, yet it works well, and</li>
            <li>Everyone in the household had a dramatic drop in dental work at exactly the same time we started using electric tooth brushes and, in particular the dual clean brush heads.</li>
            <li>I can feel the difference on my teeth compared to a standard non-electric or the new cheaper/smaller oral B electric that runs on a AAA battery.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the same Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush for years and just replace with new brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Of course your teeth are your life, it is like using a new tooth brush and the digital read out tell you when you have to replace the brush.</li>
            <li>It is larger than the standard brush but not that much.</li>
            <li>Only con is that replacement heads are expensive,,,but can be found at a reasonable price at various Amazon vendors....</li>
            <li>I tried a knockoff generic brand and the head kept falling off the brush so back to the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I have tried all of the different Oral-B brush heads, this is my least favorite.</li>
            <li>We were pleased with the product and never have a problem with them fitting on our brush base.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Dual Clean Brush for years and am quite partial to it over single head brushes.  </li>
            <li>I really like this little brush, but one needs to be careful in buying replacement heads as there are several kinds available that will not work.</li>
            <li>Also, because it is bigger, it&#x27;s harder to close your mouth around the wand, which means you get more toothpaste goo running down the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It still has the spinning round head, but next to it is a head that makes it more standard toothbrush shape and size that moves back and forth.  </li>
            <li>I find that the small brush heads just don&#x27;t work as well as these dual clean brush heads.</li>
            <li>me, three things really matter (in no particular order):</li>
            <li>Original quality Oral-B, not a cheap generic.  </li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s because these larger heads feel softer than the original round heads.</li>
            <li>They also didn&#x27;t seem to clean as well as the smaller, round heads...</li>
            <li>The heads arrived quickly and are just like what you will find in your local Walgreens or Costco but for a lot less.</li>
            <li>Whereas the regular Oral-B heads are kinda small, the Dual Clean heads are large enough to feel like you&#x27;re brushing your entire tooth (instead of section by section).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I wish I&#x27;d just started out with the rotary Oral-B brushes that came with the toothbrush initially, because it&#x27;s such a high powered tool in my mouth it overwhelms me, as a beginner.</li>
            <li>These are becoming hard to find in local stores for an affordable price.  </li>
            <li>Takes less time to brush my teeth but does not thoroughly clean, especially the back and in between.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This toothbrush head is larger than the norm, but I like the dual action</li>
            <li>but they are marked &amp;#34;made in Germany&amp;#34; on the back of the package!</li>
            <li>This toothbrush head is larger than the norm, but I like the dual action</li>
            <li>Just be sure to open wide as a few times</li>
            <li>I could never go back to a manual brush or even a electric brush that simply has one smooth round brush.</li>
            <li>Bought these replacement heads along with the Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care and must say that even though it is the only replacement brush head I have been using it will probably be the only one along with the floss action replacement</li>
            <li>They are some of the only ones have found that are stiff-hard vs soft.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a double action going on in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Overall I like the soft bristles, and it cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li>I have used these for years and don&#x27;t plan to make any changes in the near future.</li>
            <li>Works very well as expected.</li>
            <li>is I am not careful to keep lips curled out of the way.  </li>
            <li>The brush is bigger but it&#x27;s no bigger than a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>it took a few days to get used to it, but its worth it</li>
            <li>would highly recommend as does my dentist the dual head brush vs single.</li>
            <li>While I had gotten used to just the small, round head (and my regular dental check-ups have been better since I began using it!)</li>
            <li>These have a larger coverage area than the floss brush, but they don&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling as slick and clean as the floss heads do..</li>
            <li>I bought this product from the vendor after my research because the vendor&#x27;s price was much cheaper than any other I checked, including Wal-Mart, Kohl&#x27;s, etc.  </li>
            <li>In fact I got so tired of how hard it felt on my gums that I took a screwdriver and popped off the lower head so that now I just have the circular head and am now happy.  </li>
            <li>Then, when I finally tried the dual action head it slowed the toothbrush down so much that I thought it burned it out.</li>
            <li>They fit my Braun Oral b electric toothbrush and last at least 3 months.</li>
            <li>since larger area is covered, the whole \\&quot;brush your teeth\\&quot; takes less time than with Floss Action or Prowhite brush head refills.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different brush heads that can be used with my Oral-B electric toothbrush, including the [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral-B Floss Action]] and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Bigger than I expected but works really well.</li>
            <li>so I was surprised to discover I actually prefer the smaller Oral B toothbrush head to this one!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overwhelming, nor (assuming you do a reasonable, dentist-sanctioned brush job normally in life)</li>
            <li>It is by far the most difficult item to find in stores like Walmart, Target, Walgreen&#x27;s, CVS, grocery chains, etc;  </li>
            <li>Many of the broken skin/mucus-membranes will inevitably turn into canker sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They have single-handedly decreased our dentist bill more than anything else we&#x27;ve done, even when you don&#x27;t brush for the entire two minutes</li>
            <li>personally I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was actually making a difference as such - I simply use it as a normal toothbrush and the DualAction</li>
            <li>Worth the little extra money, but do note that the brush is over twice as big with this addition...</li>
            <li>The head is long, so it is hard to get more than one of the two heads into flat contact with the teeth at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One brush cleans with a rotary action, the other with an up-and-down action.</li>
            <li>For the 2 other people throughout history who glance at this review and are also 6&#x27;7\\&quot; and have reasonably proportioned body parts: this brush head isn&#x27;t that big.</li>
            <li>Does get some tooth paste stuck down deep the bristles however so it requires a solid wash under hot water at times to remove hardened tooth paste.</li>
            <li>This will really boil down to preference for anyone.  </li>
            <li>It appears that my cleaning time is cut by half, this brush really does its job.</li>
            <li>It covers much more area per second of brushing time, although it makes it more difficult to get behind the last teeth on each row.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the up and down action on these, along with the circular action of the tip.  </li>
            <li>I too was a little nervous getting these brushes when they look fairly large.</li>
            <li>I have pretty much tried all the replacements for the Oral-B professional, and I have to say that this product is mediocre.</li>
            <li>but I suppose that&#x27;s normal considering the continuous rotations of the toothbrush + the extra paste used in this refill compared to the other ones</li>
            <li>The large size may not suit everyone as some might feel that the size is a little too big (I personally don&#x27;t...</li>
            <li>It is hard to find one dual brush head  yet three in a pack is rare .I</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve tried this dual action brush, you will never go back to the single swirly Braun brush!  </li>

            <li> I believe it to be fairly priced, and absolutely love the results.</li>

            <li> The Oral-B Dual Clean brushes are great.</li>

            <li> I love my electric toothbrush - the manual kind cannot compare.  </li>
            <li> these are perfect thestiffnessnot too soft not too stiffperfect dtiffness to me</li>
            <li> I am always satisfied after brushing using this kind of brush head.</li>
            <li> it is much better having your own teeth.</li>
            <li> It does an effective job for me and it is definitely better than a manual brush.  </li>
            <li> This fits perfect, and gave it an upgrade to my old aging system.</li>
            <li> These are the best toothbrush heads, in my opinion, by far.</li>

            <li> Amazon and Oral-B have made it easy to replace my brush head through Prime ordering!</li>
            <li> pack of three that go strong!</li>

            <li> They are as good of quality as the original</li>

            <li> A good bargain and the right kind which I couldn&#x27;t find in a store.</li>
            <li> When I first started using electric tooth brushes I was told that they are great for brushing tongue, roof of mouth, inside cheek, etc.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s funny to leave a review for a toothbrush replacement head, but this one is really great.</li>
            <li> great price for exactly what I needed .</li>
            <li> These work great, they&#x27;re not breaking or anything, but I&#x27;m on the first head</li>
            <li> Great product for the whole family!</li>
            <li> I like the Oral B electric tooth brush and these heads are very good when they are new.  </li>
            <li> Brushes heads are excellent, They clean very well and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> These Oral B dual clean replacement brushes are really exceptional brushes.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase of the Oral-B Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head.  </li>
            <li> Good product, but nothing revolutionary or invasively large about it like part of me was kind of expecting after reading the reviews here.</li>
            <li> I love OralB produce for almost one year.</li>
            <li> I am okay with them, but prefer just the eound head one.</li>
            <li> This is the brush I like because is has many directions of motion for cleaning.</li>
            <li> This is also better than the Crest Toothbrush operated by AA batteries as the batteries will lose power.</li>
            <li> These are the real heads and work great.  </li>
            <li> I feel it does a better job of cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I just make sure I brush over the sink.</li>
            <li> The product itself works great, Amazon has made it much more reasonable.  </li>
            <li> IT WAS AN OK TOOTH BRUSH</li>
            <li> We love our electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I will know better after my six months dental checkup and will do a follow-up review at that time.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the Dual Brush.</li>
            <li> I feel like I am getting more cleaning done.</li>
            <li> WHY PAY MORE IN THE STORE.</li>
            <li> MY TEETH LOVE</li>
            <li> should be somewhere between 3 and 4 dollars, at most.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found</li>
            <li> The dual action head provides better brushing and they fit the machine perfectly.</li>
            <li> So glad to find these as none of the stores carry this item.</li>
            <li> B0002KHTG6 Oral-B Pro White]], and these are the best!</li>
            <li> Maybe I like this brush better because I&#x27;m a guy</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast makes me a happy customer. :)</li>
            <li> Glad I gave it a try and teeth</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for many years.  </li>
            <li> This product is better than the toothbrush heads I buy in the store.  </li>
            <li> It is priced reasonably and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I am convinced that my teeth look whiter, remain plaque free for a longer period of time and that my gums and tongue are cleaned more effectively.  </li>
            <li> have never been as satisfied with a toothbrush head as these and would gladly recommend them to friends, family and even strangers.</li>
            <li> I realize that this an over the top review</li>
            <li> but I love these toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I had the best results as shown by our last cleanings.  </li>
            <li> After many attempts to reduce tartar, we didn&#x27;t see results until we used this brush head type.  </li>
            <li> I love this two-phase Braun toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li> It does take up more space in the mouth though for those withouth a lot of room.</li>
            <li> If there is a better and more durable alternative brush/brush-head, please let me know.</li>
            <li> Figured i would give my Oral B one more chance.  </li>
            <li> It does not seem to put much more of a load on the motor.</li>
            <li> I have seen prices for 1 head, that were more than what I paid for these 3 heads.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t forget to order them (and to get even better</li>
            <li> These work better than the ones that came with the brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found these on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I will buy again if available!</li>
            <li> price is more than inexpensive for the quality - it&#x27;s downright super-affordable.</li>
            <li> I like these dual heads for better teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li> Works better than a manual toothbrush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> , I think that this head does an even better job.  </li>
            <li> Great toothbrush refills at reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad we were able to find it here.</li>
            <li> They worked okay.  </li>
            <li> I think this is the best toothbrush out there based on my experience using electrics over the last 20 years or so.</li>
            <li> Each replacement brush is different but both are WONDERFUL</li>
            <li> These brushes do a fantastic job!</li>
            <li> I love the dual actiona plus the timer on my brush.</li>

            <li> a significantly better experience?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a cheapskate, I never thought I&#x27;d like the idea of paying more for toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It feels much more substantial, and although it may not offer more cleaning power, it does offer peace of mind.</li>
            <li> Another added advantage is that it is much better for brushing your tongue.</li>
            <li> I love my oral b electric tooth brush.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Except to the molars, my jaw is curved, as I assume most are.  </li>
            <li> the 15% is better than any coupon I&#x27;d ever seen for my replacement heads.  </li>

            <li> It is better than my original brush and works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> I like the original better, but the quality for both of them are A+.</li>
            <li> I love brushing my teeth and was excited to find this product for this price.</li>
            <li> This replacement brush set is even better than the original brushes that came with my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Unlike the original set you receive this one both vibrates at the bottom and oscillates at the top.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the other types of Oral-B brush heads that go with their handle, but this one cleans the best.  </li>
            <li> I love my toothbrush and these are the replacements for the original heads that came with my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but they seem to use more battery life than the original brush heads where they are dual action.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this - and it&#x27;s better than the original brush I had on the Oral B.  </li>
            <li> I love the price and how easy everything was, defenely will buy this product againg, the brush was in the original package and mint conditions.</li>
            <li> I (and my dentist and periodondist) love the way the Oral-B Dual Clean Brush Head cleans my teeth and all along the gum line.  </li>
            <li> These work, and they&#x27;re easy to change out.  </li>
            <li> They fit my Oral B electric toothbrush (which I love) just fine and work just fine.</li>
            <li> Easy to keep charged...</li>
            <li> Love the dual clean brushes.  </li>
            <li> The replacements are easy to change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; on these.&lt;br /&gt;They may clean better?  </li>
            <li> The dual clean brush heads are my families favorite and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sure to add more information if I find anything else worth considering</li>
            <li> It keeps my gums clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> Easy shopping.  </li>
            <li> - they seem to clean more thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I love how they clean my teeth</li>
            <li> However your schedule is set up for teeth cleaning; having the hygienist repeatedly tell you to floss more; given every size shape or color tooth brush; then I purchase the electric tooth brush with the dual clean BRUSH HEAD.</li>
            <li> My oral-B toothbrush has been around for years and is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend the system Oral B and these replacements</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and still going strong</li>
            <li> The first time I used this brush head, I could tell that it was much more effective than the original.</li>
            <li> Great product, the real thing for the right price, I&#x27;ll buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> These are long-lasting and very effective, much more so than the standard brush heads.  </li>
            <li> These are a great replacement for the original brush heads that came with my oral-b professional brush handle.</li>
            <li> Apparently using this brush and my oral pik my gums are in great condition.</li>
            <li> Normally these are fairly reliable</li>
            <li> Not bad, but could be better.</li>
            <li> best electric toothbrush heads, hands down.</li>
            <li> Site was easy to manipulate and the process and shipment was smooth and as promised.</li>
            <li> Usable, so they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> It works fine with 5000 series.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both work fine on my porcelain implant bridges.</li>
            <li> This is fine, but I wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and half the price that CVS had it.</li>
            <li> They fit will and are easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine</li>
            <li> I am using one of these brushes and it works fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine and was about 1/3</li>
            <li> I think they are fine.</li>

            <li> and they fit fine.</li>
            <li> I like to replace my brush heads every three months, this little pack was perfect.</li>
            <li> The brush is the perfect size to not be too large to reach into the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li> These heads are huge . . .</li>
            <li> There is a huge difference between manual, battery operated and the Oral-B electric brushes.</li>
            <li> Saves me money with free shipping.</li>
            <li> They Do sound like Winners to me.&lt;br /&gt;Hopeful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an Oral-B product so there was no doubt the would fit.</li>
            <li> I thought it was great pricing, will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> just want genuine replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> This is such a great &amp; durable product.</li>
            <li> this product is great, the only problem is the size</li>
            <li> Overall though it&#x27;s great to mix it up</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> , I have decided to keep an additional 3 pak available at all</li>
            <li> Fit was accurate and they work well.  </li>
            <li> Items didn&#x27;t fit my product.  </li>
            <li> these items fit my toothbrush and work quite well.  </li>
            <li> The front head of this one is smooth cylinder head.</li>
            <li> Such a great price for these.  </li>
            <li> The Oral B replacement heads fit my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I tried the cheap aftermarket copies.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Avoid cheap knock off.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone with a petite mouth use this as their primary toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> For me I&#x27;m happy to get a solid product and toss the wrapping.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even know this type was available.</li>
            <li> Upon reading the instructions, we discovered that replacement heads were available.  </li>
            <li> I did not try to return because someone in our family has a toothbrush that it does fit, but we still need brush heads for our Pulsonics.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Happy, don&#x27;t feel big in my mouth.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t something I genuinely cared about</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t something I genuinely cared about</li>
            <li> Amazon is the lowest price that I have found for this brush head and all the orders have been genuine Oral-B products.</li>
            <li> and it seems genuine.</li>
            <li> I have tried to be cheap and buy the store brand version of these toothbrush heads that claim they&#x27;ll fit my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads fit my Brawn electric tooth brush and work</li>
            <li> Fit on my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> When I turn it on and use it, the light on the charger starts dancing letting me the vibes are going though my eyeballs.</li>
            <li> The heads fit my brush model</li>
            <li> Fit brush.</li>
            <li> Go on easily and clean your teeth well.  </li>
            <li> The are the actual name-brand replacement parts, are reasonably priced and work wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I am a convert, but it has been a good experience so far.</li>
            <li> So far so good will reorder when I run out of the three.</li>
            <li> Other then that very good.</li>
            <li> I think that the larger brush head and rigid bristles are great for me, but my wife prefers the gentler bristle brush heads that originally came with the tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend and reorder for sure !!</li>
            <li> Getting 3 for the price is also very economical.</li>
            <li> the service was very fast and the item worked great and was a better price than I could find locally.</li>
            <li> It feels like they clean twice as good as the old type.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t think it is quite as good as the flossing action brush which I give 5 stars thus the 4 star rating for the dual clean.</li>
            <li> These fit perfectly and work like little champions!</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t fit the head I was originally shopping for.</li>
            <li> I have used these on my Braum Triumph Professional Care 9000 electric toothbrush for years, Amazon offers absolute best price I have ever found, I love this type of brush because I get great reports from my dentist keeping cost low on my checkups twice a year.</li>
            <li> The Dual Clean heads don&#x27;t fit in the traveling case, so I still purchase the FlossAction for traveling and when my mouth was swollen and sore after getting some wisdom teeth pulled.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, I cannot think of anything in particular I&#x27;d want or need in an improved version of this toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> price is already a bargain but with additional available discounts like Free Super Saver Shipping, it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li> but when it came to getting replacement brushes so I could share the brush with immediate family or just keep on brushing they want an arm and a leg for them - much more reasonable on AMAZON!</li>
            <li> I originally subscribed to this product at a price around 8 dollars for three.  </li>
            <li> If you can get this for a deal, its worth it!  </li>
            <li> These are perfect for people that don&#x27;t like the small toothbrush head that comes on the precision brush.</li>
            <li> I had been very satisfied with the Oral B Floss Action Brush Heads until I tried the Oral-B DualAction Premium Power Toothbrush Head Refill.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Could not find the identical brush like I had originally purchased so went to amazon and found this.</li>
            <li> The brushes were sealed in original packaging.</li>
            <li> but when Amazon had a sale on the original ones, I bought them too.</li>
            <li> Original replacement brushes and just what I needed.</li>
            <li> THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR ORIGINAL ORAL B REPLACEMENT BRUSH HEADS.</li>
            <li> Well, if I didn&#x27;t love the Oral B I wouldn&#x27;t have been in hot pursuit of replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> Thanks!  :)</li>
            <li> Original parts original performance.</li>
            <li> This is the original one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> But they are absolutely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> but they just are nothing like the original Oral B replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads were received and are performing as I would expect them (it) to perform just like the original one performed.</li>
            <li> First of all, my product was authentic and I&#x27;m not disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li> I like to switch with each brush change from this style to the original style.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if these are the original Oral-B brand or not</li>
            <li> I prefer the original sized brush head.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re sticking to the original Oral-B ones.</li>
            <li> Pro: Works as original in stores with way lower prices&lt;br /&gt;Con:</li>
            <li> I was excited to replace mine and these</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting for :)</li>
            <li> previously(which came in the original set).</li>
            <li> These are superb and exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found these because they saved me so much money!</li>
            <li> and Amazon usually has the best price.  </li>
            <li> I bought Oral-B dual clean 3 month ago and now I brush my teeth for two minutes; their are cleaner and brushing is fun now!</li>
            <li> It is so nice to fing replacement parts for something, rather than buy a new one.</li>

            <li> , I stick with the Dual Clean.</li>

            <li> Fits my Oral B Precision Clean Battery toothbrush, too.</li>
            <li> I like the way my teeth and gums feel as the brush heads clean and floss my teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for 10 years and have always received praise from my dentist over how clean my teeth are.</li>
            <li> Enter, the dual clean brush head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been liking the ease and speed of getting my teeth clean, and my dentist has been liking the results.</li>
            <li> I tried several heads and the Prowhite head is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I bought the dual clean as the brush has dual heads and thus twice the brushing area.  </li>
            <li> Get my teeth really clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> and these heads clean it well.</li>
            <li> Leaves my teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> But this should not be a reason to take away from the cleaning power of the brush and the freshness and clean feeling of your gums and teeth after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought these because I thought they would be more effective than the smaller heads.</li>
            <li> I dont feel like I have clean teeth if I use anything else</li>
            <li> My dentist can not believe how clean it keeps my teeth.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much more than the regular FlexiSoft head that I immediately ordered the 3-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried others but my teeth doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it does with the Dual Clean Brush Heads.</li>
            <li> This one however, although claims to help you clean by having two parts, does not work that well.</li>
            <li> dentist clean.</li>

            <li> My teeth just never felt clean even though I was brushing for 6 minutes.</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes used with the cordless toothbrush always clean teeth well and my dental hygienist always complements me on how well I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen many complain about the size being too large.</li>
            <li> Large size &#x3D; more paste being used&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> The price is right!  </li>
            <li> This came with the exact heads that I needed - fit fine on my Oral B Braun Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a good portion of the other ones that Oral-B offers, but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I love Dual Clean for the double brushes work magic and have proven most effective in my overall tooth/gum maintenance in between my dental visits.  </li>
            <li> These fit my Oral-B electric toothbrush properly and I have been very satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> this one is absolutely necesary if you want more people to use this brush</li>
            <li> Never wanted to pay this much for an eletric toothbrush, but after many of the $10 market ones I got this.  </li>
            <li> It is good for people with big mouths (like me!).</li>
            <li> This 3-ct package cost only $13.xx good price.</li>
            <li> The brush heads last a good while as well.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s an even better deal if you can catch on sale, or as part of Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;Subscribe &amp; Save\\&quot; program (if you REALLY like brushing your teeth).</li>
            <li> My teeth feel super clean afterward.</li>

            <li> Good solid product.  </li>
            <li> I really think it does a better job of brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> spin brush heads out there that do not stand up to the true thing.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush heads are good; I give this 4 stars instead of 5 because they seem to wear out on the earlier side</li>
            <li> My husband and I changed from manual toothbrushes when the dentist expressed concern that we were not doing such a good job along the gum line of our teeth.</li>
            <li> Nice to have the dual action head.</li>
            <li> I was using the single head until I tried the dual head and liked it much better.</li>
            <li> This brush head can cover a lot or real estate for a quick clean up as well as being a great regular tooth brush head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing which is very important for me is that since it has a bigger size, it allows more paste to be put onto it...</li>
            <li> The Oral B Dueal Clean Replacment Brush Heads fit my Oral-B Vitality Braum Brush Holder exactly.  </li>
            <li> This brush head is also great if you like to brush other parts of your mouth, not just your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant difference in how clean my teeth are after brushing with this head and the others, this being far better.</li>
            <li> works great, I use this brand all the time , the prices really are not much different then at walmart</li>
            <li> /&gt;This fits most of the current line of Braun brushes, but check your manual to be sure.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it does a better job than the default, smaller [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Glad to find this particular brush.</li>
            <li> After trying all of the available Oral-B Brush heads, this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> These brush heads are super.</li>
            <li> However, the brush head is huge and honestly designed for larger mouths.</li>
            <li> I love the feel that my Oral-B toothbrush leaves my teeth and these brushes are the main reason.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li> surely buy more in the future</li>
            <li> So I am glad I was able to get proper replacements.</li>
            <li> This particular replacement brush head contains more bristles than the brush head that came with the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and they arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job cleaning teeth, you can really feel the difference using this as compared to a regular brush, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for everyone in the family, we have 4 of them now :)</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon, I found the right fitting brush heads</li>
            <li> It makes it feel more like a normal toothbrush instead of an electric one.</li>
            <li> I tried this as a normal replacement head and found I enjoyed using my OralB toothbrush again.  </li>
            <li> I liked my original brush head because it had multiple types and density of bristles within the one head.</li>
            <li> They fit exactly on my hand piece.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and the price was fabulous.  </li>
            <li> So far, I like the ultra soft and sensitive one the best.</li>
            <li> The Dual Clean heads are by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> The Dual Clean, along w/ the Floss Action replacement heads, are my favorite.</li>
            <li> My teeth definitely are more clean after using this brush head!</li>
            <li> More so my mistake for trying something new.</li>
            <li> Love these new brushes.  </li>
            <li> A great compliment to the Oral-B Precision Black 7000 Rechargeable Unit and the brush head that I needed.</li>
            <li> I am happy I purchased this because the brush heads are reminiscent to a regular toothbrush&#x27;s head except it is more powerful and worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is also a good idea to have extras around to use in your travel bag and makes traveling with a toothbrush pretty simple.</li>
            <li> I did love these brush heads at first, but after time, not so much.  </li>
            <li> I wish they made them at a more reasonable price even though it still does its job pretty well.</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth very well, even better than the stock brush head I received when I first bought the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Well I won&#x27;t be buying them again because they are too large for my mouth, though the quality is just fine.</li>
            <li> Read all the awesome reviews and while it is great, it is harder to get to the inner side of the teeth due to it&#x27;s size.  </li>
            <li> I like Oral-B Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head very much.</li>
            <li> I like using these for my Oral B vitality a lot more than the regular dinky little circular ones - these give a better clean and are a good price</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> I was leery of the shape at first, but after one brushing, I&#x27;m hooked!  </li>
            <li> So not only do I get my replacement heads conviently through the mail, but I also save more than getting them at, (dare I say it?), Walmart!</li>
            <li> and it does the job very well!!</li>
            <li> I like the dual clean because they brush a wider area for the same amount of time and do a better job for those of us who need an electric toothbrush to get our teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I feel the dual clean gives me a more thorough clean with the 2 brushes working a larger area simultaneously.  </li>
            <li> This is a really useful head for any of the toothbrushes it fits.</li>
            <li> Its worth it.</li>
            <li> It may be worth a try.</li>
            <li> The dual cleaning brushes really help achieve a fresh, super clean feeling after brushing.</li>
            <li> People with smaller mouths may want to try both brushes to see which is more comfortable for them.</li>
            <li> It is kind of big</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, keep smile&#x27;n</li>
            <li> Is a nice electric toothbrush , the brush is simple wonderfull.</li>
            <li> Love the multirush action.</li>
            <li> build quality, good functionality, and overall very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to get such a bargain.  </li>
            <li> I have these on a recurring order and love that they are sent just when you need to replace the old ones.  </li>
            <li> I love the dual action of this brush...</li>
            <li> The only kind I use.</li>
            <li> In my opinion they are well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> These are almost twice as big as the sonicare kind.</li>
            <li> I got these on sale for 13.99 and will worth it.</li>
            <li> I get these as part of a subscription, so they help insure that I use a replacement brush more frequently that would otherwise happen.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, I bought the economical 3-pack.  </li>
            <li> man oh man, does it get foamy, an indication of freshly cleaned dental and gum surfaces.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With an \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; toothbrush, I always looked for the most bristles I could find</li>
            <li> Using this in conjunction with the Professional Deep Sweep gives a great cleaning.</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth better than Floss Action head.</li>
            <li> The floss action is my favorite.</li>
            <li> These are well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Based from my experience the floss action is a better brush.</li>
            <li> No need to worry, it would come in handy later on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are by far My Favorite Brushes:&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Useful life is about 3 months.  </li>
            <li> Actually gave these to my son, who uses the right kind of Oral-B handle.  </li>
            <li> These Dual Action brushes seem to clean better and more area than the regular circular brush.  </li>
            <li> Just wish the price point was better and with in even, not odd count.</li>
            <li> arrived quick and they were exactly what we needed for our Oral B toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> bristles arrived quickly and were exactly as advertised... no complaints.</li>
            <li> This particular toothbrush head fits the old Braun electric toothbrush that I own.  </li>
            <li> This is a replacement head for an Oral B electrical toothbrush, and I like these larger toothbrush heads since they clean the teeth better, well they work for me.</li>
            <li> and now that I removed the bottom brush I can go back to getting a gentler better clean.</li>
            <li> whereas the original was much easier.</li>
            <li> is fast and the product is not a knock off of the original product.</li>
            <li> Came on time and was done the right way.</li>
            <li> Oral-B got it right with these replacement brush heads.  </li>
            <li> He seemed to think we (me and the missus) were doing something right.</li>
            <li> and when I found them here did not expect them to be the right ones.</li>
            <li> Priced just right also.</li>
            <li> I can order and have it right a way.  </li>
            <li> and I never run out, and always get the right one.</li>
            <li> I find it very comfortable and it covers more of my teeth in less time.</li>
            <li> This brush does work well and helps clean my teeth very thoroughly.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;dual-clean&amp;#34; head is very thorough and will clean your teeth well.</li>
            <li> My teeth are as clean as they have ever been thanks to Oral-B</li>
            <li> I have to do so much brushing to get my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Dual clean brush head cleans my teeth really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it before and it really works on keeping my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> My whole mouth feels really clean</li>
            <li> How do people keep their teeth clean with just a straight toothbrush?  </li>
            <li> That head worked very well, so I decided to try the dual clean ones.</li>
            <li> I was concerned as to whether they would fit an older Oral-B tooth brush - but no problem.</li>
            <li> Every use is like a trip to the dentist with dual heads that really leave you feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Sometimes seems better to buy a whole new device than replacements.</li>
            <li> fact, this is the same size as a typical brush head and it is awesome!  </li>
            <li> work fine, just like new</li>
            <li> We really like that they are a full head and agree our teeth feel cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> The dual cleaning makes plaque and left over food removal more effective and longer lasting.</li>
            <li> Maybe because my brush is a few years old, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find a good replacement on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The double brush (dual clean) feels better than one in my opinion because it covers more area and feels closer to a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Relatively inexpensive and easy to change!</li>
            <li> BUT THE ORIGINAL SINGLE SPINNING HEAD CLEANER SEEMED TO DO A BETTER JOB.</li>
            <li> to large to use!  </li>
            <li> I have ordered these particular brushheads a number of timesn for use with the Oral-B Dual Clean rechargable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with the generic, they aren&#x27;t near as good.</li>
            <li> I used to have a Sonicare, but switched over to Oral-B because Oral-B&#x27;s electric toothbrushes seemed just as good (and actually, I prefer Oral-B now), and the replacement toothbrush heads are considerably cheaper as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are great for those of us that have mouths big enough to use them.  </li>
            <li> It seems to clean my teeth better than the single headed brush.</li>
            <li> The EB17 is still great for getting in tight spots, particularly the  backs of the rearmost molars.</li>
            <li> , it was a huge step up from the old Ora brush!</li>
            <li> These heads do a great job at getting down between teeth and into the gumline, and with regular flossing my mouth is always fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> this is a great item to pair my new brush now I can reach the more tough spot.</li>
            <li> have all of my wisdom teeth because I have very straight teeth.</li>
            <li> , I have not stepped up to the Sonic, have other things I need to spend my money on, but these keep my teeth and gums very clean and do a super job!</li>
            <li> Felt like a brand new toothbrush, just like the original.</li>
            <li> Amazon had exactly the correct Oral B replacement heads, 3 to a package, for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> They are great because they prevent one from brushing too hard as compared to using a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I get great values from Amazon and hardly ever have to pay shipping fees.</li>
            <li> The single heads are quite easy and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, these brushes are Oral-B made, they work well and were available at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Love how it seems that more of my teeth get brushed at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I think I like the smaller ones better.</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Decided to give Amazon a try and sure enough there</li>
            <li> Same replacement heads at a better price.</li>
            <li> I bought this first anticipating the Oral B Advancedpower 950TX would work,of which was writen about/reviewed.hopefully</li>
            <li> I like that the head is larger and feels like it cleans more at once.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful, strong..but expensive.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time and works exactly as the one replaced.</li>
            <li> I feel like I can have a more efficient brush with these, when compared to the smaller heads.</li>
            <li> I love Oral B products and these brushes especially that I can order in  quantity.  </li>
            <li> AGAIN, WHY PAY MORE AT THE STORE FOR THE SAME ITEM ;-)</li>
            <li> Vertically, the distance from the topmost to the bottommost bristle is exactly an inch.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads are no larger than those found on many manual brushes.</li>
            <li> that I do it more regularly.</li>
            <li> better value than at any local store....</li>
            <li> This product is stronger, more durable and lasting.  </li>
            <li> They were the exact replacement for the ones I had been using.  </li>
            <li> like these brush heads better than any I&#x27;ve tried, but a toothbrush is a matter of personal choice.  </li>
            <li> Could not find this in walmart where I first bought it and the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> First rate product.  </li>
            <li> So glad to finally have these again.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this upon seeing the relatively consistent number of 4/5 reviews.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Individually they cost considerably more.  </li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads are great--much better than the one with only one head.  </li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this product any higher.  </li>
            <li> So these are exactly what they say they are--replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe that I&#x27;d find exactly the replacements I wanted at a price I wanted.</li>
            <li> personally like the Deep Sweep heads better, for they allow you a bit more control.</li>
            <li> The yellow bristles help to give a bit more firmness to the bristles on these brush</li>
            <li> work exactly as how I would imagine Oral B products to be.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are reasonably priced and they do not fall apart!</li>
            <li> They really really do work as advertised!</li>
            <li> I always found the name brand replacements heads to be much better quality than the generic ones.</li>
            <li> Go for the real deal!</li>
            <li> The bigger the package of replacement brushes that you buy the better the price.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> the first is the most compact and cleans well, the 2nd is my preferred head for the Oral-B&#x27;s and the one I&#x27;ll buy consistently.</li>
            <li> Smaller heads are better and easier to use.</li>
            <li> he wanted something shaped more like a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> found these at a much better price than any place locally.  </li>
            <li> Always go with electronic tooth brushes since they will reduce plaque better than regular tooth</li>
            <li> I did not time them exactly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried just about every available replacement toothbrush for my Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000</li>
            <li> Cleans twice as much surface area!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> With that said they are of great quality and do last a long time, both in build and cleanliness.</li>
            <li> but if you want to save more go for the larger packages.</li>
            <li> I will most likely re-order these when i finish.</li>
            <li> The larger size equates to better cleaning for our house.</li>
            <li> These heads are much better than the smaller ones and cheaper on Amazon than Walmart.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;After all, it is not expensive when comparing to the one sold in supermarkets.</li>
            <li> The retail store price is higher than Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> I know Oral-B is aware of this problem</li>
            <li> it is a wee bit too much!</li>
            <li> Was looking for a head that was more regular toothbrush sized.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper then retail!</li>
            <li> They are toothbrush heads, and they function exactly as a toothbrush should.</li>
            <li> Finally was able to find these.</li>
            <li> I co0uld have gotten these at the supermarket for a much higher price, but I saved a bundle.</li>
            <li> I later found out that it&#x27;s better to get the advice of your dentist before selecting the brush for your electrical toothbrush that is appropriate for your specific needs.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The surface is bigger and I hope the cleaning is about twice more efficient.</li>
            <li> , so they are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are great and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I was able to fix an issue I was having with my back molars.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love that the second brush serves almost like a floss.  </li>
            <li> I love the Oral-B electric toothbrush and this head (compared to the smaller one).</li>
            <li> These fit into the professional Oral-B toothbrushes</li>
            <li> I was glad to see that Amazon had them and even had an option to get regular shipments of them sent</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Glad I can choose from different brushes.</li>
            <li> However, because it is bigger, it uses more power from the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I found it on Amazon and it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it said it was.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This product does a much better job of cleaning below the gum line than an regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I went to Amazon.com and found the exact system wanted and purchased it and then decided to search for these replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Joking aside that is what I thought when I stuck this into my mouth for the first time.</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep buying it here :)</li>
            <li> When I first bought my Oral-B brush, I immediately regretted not buying a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I only need to brush for 2 minutes with this brush head and it is much more thorough.</li>
            <li> The brush head does exactly what it is advertised to do , looks just like advertised, arrived exactly as anticipated - no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> while the ordinary Oral-B head is superior to Sonicare, this head is really powerful.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what they say they are.  </li>
            <li> item works great but was significantly late in arriving</li>
            <li> These brush heads arguably clean better than the other Oral-B brush options.  </li>
            <li> This set of replacement brushes is the real thing for the right Oral-B handle.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m really getting my teeth clean--in the right way.</li>
            <li> These Dual Clean ones, being quite a bit larger, clean marginally better but give you less room to clean spots you think are necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At my last dental check-up, my dentist noted that, on top of the usual good news, my teeth didn&#x27;t have the tea-stains that he was used to seeing.  </li>
            <li> product and help keep teeth tar free with gentle dual action cleaning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, but the head is larger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I was between the dual clean, the floss action, and the whitening one.  </li>
            <li> and she said, \\&quot;Wow, those are some clean teeth.</li>
            <li> the dual action is just what I need to clean and help remove plaque.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel as clean as when I get out of the dentist&#x27;s office after a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, yes, there is a lot more toothbrush there, but it&#x27;s covering twice the area and if you brush for the same amount of time as before it feels so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> The heads did not fit my oral-B toothbrush although the ordering description inferred that it fit &#x27;most&#x27; units.  </li>
            <li> and since I&#x27;m \\&quot;extremely\\&quot; used to the regular toothbrushes, this serves as a good way to make the transition to the electric toothbrushes (besides I like the regular size toothbrushes anyways</li>
            <li> The larger size allows you to brush a larger area of teeth at once, which is good if you&#x27;re used to the feel and size of a manual brush.</li>
            <li> I think what bothered me most about the bigger head is that the angles at which you approach your teeth are now more limited because of the increased brush size.  </li>
            <li> They felt large at first, but I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They last a long time, and make my teeth feel very clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> and I get positive feedback from my dentist.</li>
            <li> It feels much better in action than the old, single circular brush; I think it&#x27;s doing a better job of cleaning, too.</li>
            <li> , bristles looked different; like a regular tooth brush, genuine brush heads are more compact.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My local big chain store no longer carries this product and I wasn&#x27;t sure if the heads would fit my model of Oral-B electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed and was much cheaper than I could ever find in a store.</li>
            <li> They are the original Oral-B heads that I regularly use, not the knock-offs that lose bristles with each use.&lt;br /&gt;These are well worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> These are high quality and do the job right.</li>
            <li> I have an old Braun electric tooth brush that had just the round part as a brush head, i bought this hoping it would fit and work, and it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it a few times now, and it is still working perfect with no issues.</li>
            <li> I bought them to replace my Deep Sweep heads, and they have worked quite well so far (they cover slightly more area overall, and certainly with more focus on dents).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apparently it cleans so much better than my manual toothbrush, and a little better than Sonic Care.</li>
            <li> Much better than the single head brush one.</li>
            <li> They cover more area than a single</li>
            <li> definitely my favorite replacement head compared to the single head.</li>
            <li> beware, the brush heads are rather large.  </li>
            <li> The tooth brush heads are LARGE.</li>
            <li> I  need a large size for example)&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I  need a large size for example)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is that these are too large and bulky for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d certainly buy them again.</li>
            <li> I do not find the brush head to be too large.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Oral B for  25 years, I can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li> I really like the dual brush head compared to the single brush head, as it brushes in more than one way.</li>
            <li> Service was fine; received them in relatively short time.</li>
            <li> The main reason I purchased with Amazon was because it cost $25 at Wal-Mart for these 3 replacement heads!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend getting one head first, and then deciding whether it works for you or not.</li>
            <li> Based on the many other positive reviews, I picked these up.</li>
            <li> and I really think using it has improved the health of my gums</li>
            <li> and I really think using it has improved the health of my gums.  </li>
            <li> Price through Amazon is very competitive, even beating WalMart after taking into account shipping.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> HOW MUCH THEY MARK UP PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a very timely fashion.</li>
            <li> and I do not think the heads are too big to fit in my mouth at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And is much cheaper than $9 per head at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> All in all, that fits the tooth brush very well</li>
            <li> These work really well without spreading toothpaste all over you.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just because brushing seems so much easier</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of all the brush heads , can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.&lt;br /&gt;The best all round brush.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend it!  </li>
            <li> This product is very efficient.</li>
            <li> For a couple of bucks more, I think it&#x27;s money well spent.</li>
            <li> Ordered it and it arrived fast.</li>
            <li> these replacement heads work very well with my Braun Oral - B Vitality electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush works very well.</li>
            <li> I brush thoroughly, and this toothbrush makes thorough brushing much easier than a manual toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the 3-pak option is very convenient and saves money.</li>
            <li> Would recommend the Power Toothbrush Head for anyone who wants a robust tooth cleaning experience.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon DBM</li>
            <li> I really like the toothbrush these go with.  </li>
            <li> This brush head cleans very well.  </li>
            <li> How could a gizmo really make brushing my teeth</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used the regular heads and thought &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34; when I saw these available.</li>
            <li> Really cleans well...</li>
            <li> Price at Amazon is much lower</li>
            <li> In my experience, your money is better spent on the floss brushes.</li>
            <li> Now that I am using the Gentle brush heads, prescribed by my periodontist, the receding has subsided.  </li>
            <li> They have been practical and have made economic sense to me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I realize you don&#x27;t need to replace your brush head very often</li>
            <li> This one seems to be too much brush for me.</li>
            <li> I really like these heads.  </li>
            <li> Bought one for the whole family and have had them for almost a year now.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> simply functions as a bonus - instead of something I genuinely care about...</li>
            <li> Dualaction (i couldn&#x27;t really differentiate between the two functions while in use</li>
            <li> Dualaction (i couldn&#x27;t really differentiate between the two functions while in use</li>
            <li> and they were shipped so fast to me.</li>
            <li> Found these at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I think they are reasonable in cost and toss them when they wear out.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Vnetta</li>
            <li> your time (and, ironically probably your money) and buy the real Oral B.</li>
            <li> It cleans very well.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t realize that these attach differently than the heads that fit our handles.  </li>
            <li> Loves it soon much.</li>
            <li> They come three to a pack and are much cheaper to buy via Amazon than in the drugstore (you can&#x27;t find them at Wal-Mart).</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Works very well with my Triumph toothbrush</li>
            <li> Too much going on and not needed in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Thanks for asking...</li>
            <li> It is gentle on my teeth and also on my gums.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li> Be ready to see if you can return.</li>
            <li> These work very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like the feel of this brush on my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> It cleans very well.  </li>
            <li> It really cleans your teeth.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> The shipping is fast.</li>
            <li> However in this case, it&#x27;s really really snug.</li>
            <li> I have used this style brush for several years and get good dental checkups with minimal scraping by the hygienist.</li>
            <li> My husband seemed to really liked them, but next time I will buy the smaller brushes for myself.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the regular old heads</li>
            <li> extra bristles with their side-to-side oscillation add more oomph to the Oral B&#x27;s tingle-inducing cleaning action.  </li>
            <li> This brush head does a better job than the round head units that come with the toothbrush.t&lt;br /&gt;Considering the cost of dental care, the Oral B system is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> The dual action is my second favorite.</li>
            <li> The extra action doubles the brush work and pays off in a more thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> I like the dual clean because they seem to do a better job of cleaning your teeth and gums than the smaller single head solutions that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the dual clean over the standard single brush head style, which I have used for years.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, these brush heads are a bit large, and so far on 2/2 of them the lower brush head has loosened providing a nice gap for my tongeue/cheek to get pinched in.</li>
            <li> Much quicker than just the original circular head since it covers more area while still getting into hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> WOW!!!  </li>
            <li> The dual action cleans your teeth and massages gums with just the right amount of pressure.</li>
            <li> The smaller heads just do not feel like they clean as well - would like to see a larger pack available.</li>
            <li> Several other people in my family had and loved it.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Dual Clean brush head works very well and it was moderately priced.</li>
            <li> It really gives you an extra clean.</li>
            <li> In fact this package contains three replacements at a price below what many other retailers are listing for just one.</li>
            <li> Personally, I feel its size is very comparable to any normal sized toothbrush (not including travel or cheap freebie brushes).</li>
            <li> No different than the original</li>
            <li> These are original Oral-B heads same as the one in the toothbrush so no surprises here.</li>
            <li> it came with, she would only use the Dual Clean one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course this does not eliminate actual flossing but the brush does clean well.  </li>
            <li> I notice that when I floss after brushing with the dual clean there is scarcely any debris left between my teeth, if any at all.  </li>
            <li> The dual clean head just feels too big and bulky.</li>
            <li> These brushes definitely give my teeth a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I purchased the oral B toothbrush and it came with one head that only had a single brush, this is great as a three pack for me and my boyfriend, WITH different color rings</li>
            <li> I really like my electric tooth brush,  and these re-fills do the job, but I brush a lot, so I have to keep buying them, and I feel the cost is high.  </li>
            <li> I replaced my old small brush heads with these Dual Clean brushes and i love them.</li>
            <li> It may feel HUGE if you&#x27;re switching from the round heads, but you will quickly adjust!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my Oral-B. Like it better than the single action heads.</li>
            <li> And while I love my electric toothbrush, this price is simply not worth it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not putting nearly as much stress on my gums as I do with a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They seem to be what the normal consumer who cannot shop the malls really needs.</li>
            <li> The dual clean brush head is larger than the ones I&#x27;ve been using; they are more similar in size to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> To me, the single head is fine for children.  </li>
            <li> The top brush spins while the bottom one moves up and down</li>
            <li> When I rinse, I see more loosened debris swirling down the drain.  </li>
            <li> The problem has become finding the correct replacement brushes since new generations have come along; problem solved!</li>
            <li> Ever since using the Oral-B spin brush, I have not encountered any new dental issues, and my dentist says my gums are healthier too!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these to anyone that would rather not have a mouth full of silver (or those fancy white ones!).</li>
            <li> The head-size of these is a little large, but they&#x27;re just right in terms of softness (closer to soft than medium, but still sturdy enough that my teeth feel smooth and clean after each brushing).  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than an new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They probably do clean a little better, but I am not sure how much compared to the original brushes.</li>
            <li> THE COST WAS HALF THE PRICE OF MANY STORES</li>
            <li> Birthday gift for better half-</li>
            <li> but they cover more area so that brushing is less strenuous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried several different heads, including the floss action, dual clean and precision clean heads.</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes are the only ones available as far as I know.  </li>
            <li> I have had the Oral B system for 4 years now and my dental check-ups seem to have steadily improved.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats this particular brush head.  </li>
            <li> I brush twice a day for about 1.5min each time and the bottom brush head loosens off the main assembly within just 1 month of use.</li>
            <li> The main reason I order this from Amazon is for convenience.  </li>
            <li> The price went up so I bought some generic ones that are ok but not of the same quality.</li>
            <li> ive tried several of the different heads for my brush but this one, the dualaction, is my favorite.</li>
            <li> But work decent.</li>
            <li> This brush head seems to do a more thorough job at cleaning than the regular smaller ones.</li>
            <li> but I truly like the larger head as it seems to do so much more work than the smaller head.</li>
            <li> It keeps the plaque at bay while doing a decent job of cleaning your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> The same as the oral-B brushes you can buy at your local store, but with a slightly better price.</li>
            <li> My local super market wanted me to buy 6 heads.</li>
            <li> I should have bought the single one just to try it out, but I was certain I&#x27;d love the bigger one.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you buy these and brush for two minutes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> If you can afford it I highly recommend getting Oral-B.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this replacement head.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and supplier.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> If anything, I&#x27;m surprised the default head that comes with most Vitality and other Oral-B Electric brands is the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> original head was slightly different and never had any issue except getting old and brushes needed replacement.</li>
            <li> It felt bulkier than the floss action too even though I have large teeth.</li>
            <li> It took a little more time to be delivered than was the norm</li>
            <li> Did not mean to get the Dual heads.  </li>
            <li> to use something a little more substantial for shipping.</li>
            <li> You pay a little more for these</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used the Oral-B Professional Dual Clean brush for several years.  </li>
            <li> If one becomes used to the small head on most electric tooth brushes,it might seem large in comparison.</li>
            <li> Dual action probly has twice the amount of bristles at werq and feels more like a real toothbrush than the funky little ones that these brushes come with.</li>
            <li> bristles are soft and it works really</li>
            <li> I tried my husband&#x27;s floss action brush head this morning and found it much easier to maneuver.</li>
            <li> This corrects that problem and really adds a lot of cleaning and gum massaging to the brush action.  </li>
            <li> The bristles get too soft to really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If anything, the fact that you have a normal toothbrush going to town in your mouth, is a plus.</li>
            <li> The ones that are &amp;#34;rotating&amp;#34; only, and the &amp;#34;Professional Deep Sweep are far better . . .</li>
            <li> They run for almost the same price so it should be worth it.</li>
            <li> After 1 month of normal use, the bottom part broke off and exposed a metal part.</li>
            <li> reason for that is that its pretty much the closest to a traditional toothbrush considering its size...</li>
            <li> worth consideringothers feeling differently -</li>
            <li> THEY ARE WAY OVER PRICED, BUT THAT IS NORMAL</li>
            <li> SO much reasonably priced compared to the store and EXACTLY the same!</li>
            <li> My teeth are soo clean after using this brush...never again use the single brush head.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the single head version that came with the brush over the dual clean model.  </li>
            <li> But other than that they work fine.</li>
            <li> frankly, the other size refills do a fairly good job as well, but I personally feel that I&#x27;m not using enough paste while brushing with them</li>
            <li> This wider brush is just as good as the single round brush.</li>
            <li> Merchant finally made things right.  </li>
            <li> where better than the plain circle.</li>
            <li> The simple reason is that with the smaller head (with just the cicle of bristles), I feel like I have more control and can really get around my back teeth.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t appear as though it&#x27;s that big, but it feels very large in mouth.  </li>
            <li> It should be included when you buy a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> THE NEW STIFFNESS</li>
            <li> We will probably buy these over and over until something new comes up and our dentist recommends it.</li>
            <li> It solved all of my problems with my toothbrush, and we gave the new toothbrush handle and a new head to our youngest son.  </li>
            <li> There were no brush covers for the new brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Then, they designed a NEW type of brush.  </li>
            <li> Also, i like the dual clean because it feels more of a toothbrush than the small single heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These Oral-B Professional Dual Clean replacement heads work very well as expected and have a relatively long and useful service life.</li>
            <li> These brushes heads are as expected for Oral-B Dual Clean Tooth brush.</li>
            <li> But you immediately get use to it after the first couple brushes and in all reality its no bigger than your normal tooth brush.</li>
            <li> This dual-head replacement brush is exactly what came with my initial powered tooth brush purchase.</li>
            <li> bought the Tooth Brush unit from Walmart and their price turns out not to be any lower than most other stores selling the same item!</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are exactly what I was looking for but couldn&#x27;t find in my local stores.  </li>
            <li> Wow, this will strip the paint off my house!.  </li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant to try this brush, but I thought because my teeth are a bit larger</li>
            <li> Was surprised to find that they are made in Germany [not China]!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d like the double brush design but after a week I&#x27;m now used to it and the regular heads seem tiny.  </li>
            <li> My last dentist checkup (first in 3 yrs) went like this...  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price locally and they shipped fast too with prime!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see how long the brush head lasts, but for now, this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Love using it, I used this dual head cleaning for years, and I stopped using it because I couldn&#x27;t find it no more.  </li>
            <li> At first, they seemed really big in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Been using them for a month and no trouble whatsoever!  </li>
            <li> I ordered this once and its the EXACT same product that Oral B Sells.</li>
            <li> also, the first time I ordered them, I was sent a completely different type of brush head..</li>
            <li> These heads cover more brushing surface area and last longer than other heads.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend the floss Action one!</li>
            <li> Consistent use of these brushes does help to keep my dental bill low.  </li>
            <li> - it really depends on what size of toothbrushes you generally prefer I&#x27;d say -</li>
            <li> it really depends on what size of toothbrushes you generally prefer I&#x27;d say -</li>
            <li> I guess the point is to save time, and brush more teeth surface at once, assuming that is the purpose of the small section of bristles on the bottom.</li>
            <li> i used the small head before, now this dual head works better</li>
            <li> I saved $20 by purchasing the exact same product that I have always bought in discount stores.</li>
            <li> , so then I tried another one from the package and it&#x27;s the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> These are the same as those included when I first purchased the product.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the bigger brush head personally as it feels more the size of a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Since using this brush, I have had much better evaluations by dental professionals than in the past.  </li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing the Dual Clean brush heads I had only used the FlossAction and ProWhite brush heads.  </li>
            <li> My husband used to have an expensive sonicare and found this to get his teeth more clean.</li>
            <li> It certainly is not so bad that I won&#x27;t use them or felt a need to return them, but next time I need new heads I&#x27;ll go with the regular head.</li>
            <li> The dual clean works well, and I would recommend it to other buyers.</li>
            <li> I find it less comfortable when  brushing.  </li>
            <li> You end up using a greater number of the knock-offs, so the final trade off in price actually ends up being a lot less than it first appears</li>
            <li> This larger head seems to be the next step up, and in my opinion, it hits the sweet</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews about this bigger head, and I thought cool, twice the brushing power in the same amount of time!  </li>
            <li> They also seem to break-in pretty fast which may be good for some people and bad for others.</li>
            <li> He originally had the smaller head that came with the Braun unit (only the round part on top) and he thinks this bigger head gets his teeth cleaner.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush heads do not last long compare to the original heads years ago.</li>
            <li> I bought the unit because it needs only a couple of AA batteries which are easily replaced, unlike most rechargeable units which are kaput when the batteries fail to hold a charge.</li>
            <li> Have not tried the smaller headed brushes, but these do not seem too large.</li>
            <li> I thought I could not be any happier when I switched from a traditional tooth brush to using an Oral-B Smart Series electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> They fit, they were on sale, and they came with their little gasket.</li>
            <li> You get a bit of extra brushing action when focusing on the top brush as if it were the regular single head.  </li>
            <li> However, it is hard to find any more in stores.  </li>
            <li> Replacements are many times hard to find</li>
            <li> These heads really get food bits (I know, sound icky) out from between your teeth.</li>
            <li> they work great, but will have to take extra care if you have any teeth that are not perfectly aligned.</li>
            <li> The Dual heads just aren&#x27;t as powerful and make it more difficult to reach a lot of places.</li>
            <li> Great brush heads, unfortunately my Oral-B toothbrush finally gave out on me</li>
            <li> My teeth felt much cleaner, which was confirmed a few months later by my dentist.</li>
            <li> I could not find a clear definition of the model numbers</li>
            <li> I have an oral b triumph and was using the circular sensitive toothbrush version until I got a sample pack and tried these.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see a difference between using this and just the regular brush head replacement.</li>
            <li> Still, something in me wants to say that toothbrush heads (especially when you&#x27;ve already dropped &gt;25 dollars for the body)</li>
            <li> /&gt;While others swear by higher-end brushes and/or sonic brushes, I have found that the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; I get from this brushing system is (so far) unsurpassed.  </li>
            <li> purchase couldn&#x27;t have been easier and seller sent what was advertised as stated and received purchase early.  </li>
            <li> soft.</li>
            <li> I enjoy having the choice of using the round brush and elongated.</li>
            <li> The dual action helps in cleaning the plaque and gingivitis.   </li>
            <li> As far as using the battery faster...</li>
            <li> In my experience this replacement head and electric toothbrush is the closest you can come to a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I really like the standard brushes and even the whitening/polishing version</li>
            <li> My fiance also started using it instead of her old electric brush</li>
            <li> Turned out the battery needed a charge and the dual brush was simply too much.</li>
            <li> Seems the replacement heads at my grocery store are about as much as the entire device.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it twice a day for about 2 years and never had any trouble Once</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than my local Walmart which was 2 for 19.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also had to accept paying nearly 4-5 times the value to get official heads over the knock-off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel I have as much control as I had with the smaller brush head.</li>
            <li> With the flossing action brush one can feel the slim rubber tabs getting in between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> So much for &#x27;quality&#x27; German product.</li>
            <li> I like the size of them over the floss action heads and will keep using them.</li>
            <li> when we \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; to Oral-B from Sonicare and thought we would really like them since they are the same style of heads that we have been using for years.</li>
            <li> They are coming way too frequently.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the Floss Action over all others.</li>
            <li> That being said, my wife prefers this model over the floss action type.</li>
            <li> Just as the old ones.</li>
            <li> You get that just  professional cleaned feeling after each use.</li>
            <li> I still have my old aging ORAL-B professional care system, one with just the oscillating head.</li>
            <li> Item didn&#x27;t match description or work with ORAL-B Sonic Care Complete</li>
            <li> They are completely compatible with my Braun motor.</li>
            <li> These are a direct replacement for the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 series toothbrush, amongst others.  </li>
            <li> The cheap knock-offs fall apart after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I have no problems with them so far</li>
            <li> but I really wanted this bigger toothbrush head instead of the one that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> I replace my heads frequently.  </li>
            <li> I used serveral brush heads before, including the one packaged with the Oral B 5000 and the ultra sensitive head.</li>
            <li> However, one stil should use floss and proxy brushes as well for a complete cleanup.  </li>
            <li> I have a Braun/Oral B Triumph Professional Care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my Oral-B Professional toothbrush for over a year now.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the floss action</li>
            <li> (Though I wish they came in &#x27;soft&#x27;.</li>
            <li> is it going to overwhelm you with bristling action.</li>
            <li> After switching to this head, I really feel a big difference in the degree of cleanliness of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Although a bit more expensive, the Oral B replacements are well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> what these brushes are, they are very expensive, although Amazon&#x27;s price was pretty good.</li>
            <li> I are the only ones that seem to work right in my mouth and are soft enough, not to hurt.</li>
            <li> too big for normal mouth!</li>
            <li> these work fine, but Oral-B keeps revising the toothbrush head line-up in ways that its hard to figure out what you&#x27;re buying, and how the new heads compare to the old ones I used to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder to clean the back side of your front teeth though.</li>
            <li> brush doesn&#x27;t feel big at all, it actually feels like using a normal toothbrush which is very comforting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Oral-B toothbrush unit and these dual action replacement brush heads (rotary and back &amp; forth).</li>
            <li> The larger brush gets loose quickly and can pinch my lip</li>
            <li> vibrating spinny brushes get your mouth clean without being so harsh on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My local stores do not carry the older brushes.</li>
            <li> Imagine it this way (assuming you&#x27;re using the regular Oral-B brush heads currently, the similar ones with just the top circular component): it&#x27;s like the same motion, with the form factor of a regular (non-mechanical) manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> just as long you select an electric toothbrush in the first place (I could certainly tell a big difference between regular and electric toothbrushes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just as long you select an electric toothbrush in the first place (I could certainly tell a big difference between regular and electric toothbrushes)    </li>
            <li> They last a long time and they  get  my teeth  clean and white.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find them on Amazon, they&#x27;re not easy to find</li>
            <li> The heads do wear down a little quickly and I have seen generic heads available for cheaper</li>
            <li> not only was the price less than bb&amp;b with a coupon but free shipping..</li>
            <li> The bristles are hard enough to really give you a smooth tooth finish after brushing for 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are hard enough to really give you a smooth tooth finish after brushing for 2 minutes.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced it really matters what heads you have, as long as you have an Oral-B toothbrush</li>
            <li> and you are not forced to use the tiny circle heads - with the subscribe and save program</li>
            <li> dentist did warn that, with these spin brushes, one needs to resist the urge to manually add to the brush action (as opposed to just generally guiding the brush); otherwise, a spin brush tends to promote gum recession.</li>
            <li> With an average price of a touch over 4 dollars per head, it sure beats the jaw-dropping prices at Walgreens and other pharmacies (a pack of three for $30??</li>
            <li> I was leery about this product given that it is double the size of the normal Oral B toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is not intended to be brushed with like a normal toothbrush, however.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I went back to the normal brush head.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Dual Clean brush heads provide the much needed extra clean teeth feeling that traditional hand tooth brush heads fail to provide.</li>
            <li> Large size makes for a traditional feel if you are making a transition from the regular toothbrushes to the electric ones</li>
            <li> This brush is a little too big to feel comfortable, yet it works well, and</li>
            <li> Everyone in the household had a dramatic drop in dental work at exactly the same time we started using electric tooth brushes and, in particular the dual clean brush heads.</li>
            <li> I can feel the difference on my teeth compared to a standard non-electric or the new cheaper/smaller oral B electric that runs on a AAA battery.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush for years and just replace with new brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Of course your teeth are your life, it is like using a new tooth brush and the digital read out tell you when you have to replace the brush.</li>
            <li> It is larger than the standard brush but not that much.</li>
            <li> Only con is that replacement heads are expensive,,,but can be found at a reasonable price at various Amazon vendors....</li>
            <li> I tried a knockoff generic brand and the head kept falling off the brush so back to the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all of the different Oral-B brush heads, this is my least favorite.</li>
            <li> We were pleased with the product and never have a problem with them fitting on our brush base.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Dual Clean Brush for years and am quite partial to it over single head brushes.  </li>
            <li> I really like this little brush, but one needs to be careful in buying replacement heads as there are several kinds available that will not work.</li>
            <li> Also, because it is bigger, it&#x27;s harder to close your mouth around the wand, which means you get more toothpaste goo running down the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It still has the spinning round head, but next to it is a head that makes it more standard toothbrush shape and size that moves back and forth.  </li>
            <li> I find that the small brush heads just don&#x27;t work as well as these dual clean brush heads.</li>
            <li> me, three things really matter (in no particular order):</li>
            <li> Original quality Oral-B, not a cheap generic.  </li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s because these larger heads feel softer than the original round heads.</li>
            <li> They also didn&#x27;t seem to clean as well as the smaller, round heads...</li>
            <li> The heads arrived quickly and are just like what you will find in your local Walgreens or Costco but for a lot less.</li>
            <li> Whereas the regular Oral-B heads are kinda small, the Dual Clean heads are large enough to feel like you&#x27;re brushing your entire tooth (instead of section by section).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I wish I&#x27;d just started out with the rotary Oral-B brushes that came with the toothbrush initially, because it&#x27;s such a high powered tool in my mouth it overwhelms me, as a beginner.</li>
            <li> These are becoming hard to find in local stores for an affordable price.  </li>
            <li> Takes less time to brush my teeth but does not thoroughly clean, especially the back and in between.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This toothbrush head is larger than the norm, but I like the dual action</li>
            <li> but they are marked &amp;#34;made in Germany&amp;#34; on the back of the package!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush head is larger than the norm, but I like the dual action</li>
            <li> Just be sure to open wide as a few times</li>
            <li> I could never go back to a manual brush or even a electric brush that simply has one smooth round brush.</li>
            <li> Bought these replacement heads along with the Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care and must say that even though it is the only replacement brush head I have been using it will probably be the only one along with the floss action replacement</li>
            <li> They are some of the only ones have found that are stiff-hard vs soft.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a double action going on in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Overall I like the soft bristles, and it cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have used these for years and don&#x27;t plan to make any changes in the near future.</li>
            <li> Works very well as expected.</li>
            <li> is I am not careful to keep lips curled out of the way.  </li>
            <li> The brush is bigger but it&#x27;s no bigger than a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> it took a few days to get used to it, but its worth it</li>
            <li> would highly recommend as does my dentist the dual head brush vs single.</li>
            <li> While I had gotten used to just the small, round head (and my regular dental check-ups have been better since I began using it!)</li>
            <li> These have a larger coverage area than the floss brush, but they don&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling as slick and clean as the floss heads do..</li>
            <li> I bought this product from the vendor after my research because the vendor&#x27;s price was much cheaper than any other I checked, including Wal-Mart, Kohl&#x27;s, etc.  </li>
            <li> In fact I got so tired of how hard it felt on my gums that I took a screwdriver and popped off the lower head so that now I just have the circular head and am now happy.  </li>
            <li> Then, when I finally tried the dual action head it slowed the toothbrush down so much that I thought it burned it out.</li>
            <li> They fit my Braun Oral b electric toothbrush and last at least 3 months.</li>
            <li> since larger area is covered, the whole \\&quot;brush your teeth\\&quot; takes less time than with Floss Action or Prowhite brush head refills.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brush heads that can be used with my Oral-B electric toothbrush, including the [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral-B Floss Action]] and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected but works really well.</li>
            <li> so I was surprised to discover I actually prefer the smaller Oral B toothbrush head to this one!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming, nor (assuming you do a reasonable, dentist-sanctioned brush job normally in life)</li>
            <li> It is by far the most difficult item to find in stores like Walmart, Target, Walgreen&#x27;s, CVS, grocery chains, etc;  </li>
            <li> Many of the broken skin/mucus-membranes will inevitably turn into canker sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They have single-handedly decreased our dentist bill more than anything else we&#x27;ve done, even when you don&#x27;t brush for the entire two minutes</li>
            <li> personally I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was actually making a difference as such - I simply use it as a normal toothbrush and the DualAction</li>
            <li> Worth the little extra money, but do note that the brush is over twice as big with this addition...</li>
            <li> The head is long, so it is hard to get more than one of the two heads into flat contact with the teeth at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One brush cleans with a rotary action, the other with an up-and-down action.</li>
            <li> For the 2 other people throughout history who glance at this review and are also 6&#x27;7\\&quot; and have reasonably proportioned body parts: this brush head isn&#x27;t that big.</li>
            <li> Does get some tooth paste stuck down deep the bristles however so it requires a solid wash under hot water at times to remove hardened tooth paste.</li>
            <li> This will really boil down to preference for anyone.  </li>
            <li> It appears that my cleaning time is cut by half, this brush really does its job.</li>
            <li> It covers much more area per second of brushing time, although it makes it more difficult to get behind the last teeth on each row.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the up and down action on these, along with the circular action of the tip.  </li>
            <li> I too was a little nervous getting these brushes when they look fairly large.</li>
            <li> I have pretty much tried all the replacements for the Oral-B professional, and I have to say that this product is mediocre.</li>
            <li> but I suppose that&#x27;s normal considering the continuous rotations of the toothbrush + the extra paste used in this refill compared to the other ones</li>
            <li> The large size may not suit everyone as some might feel that the size is a little too big (I personally don&#x27;t...</li>
            <li> It is hard to find one dual brush head  yet three in a pack is rare .I</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve tried this dual action brush, you will never go back to the single swirly Braun brush!  </li>
            <li> Now my only complaint is that I have a half dozen new single head brushes around that weren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it always slows down accurately on its timer to encourage the brusher to move to another tooth area, but to me that doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t brushed any other surfaces with them</li>
            <li> I had to develop an arm movement that would first put one of the heads against my teeth and then pivot the angle of my hand into my mouth to get the second head into contact with the same teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head closest to the hand can NOT be used on the back molars, at least not in my mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe it doesn&#x27;t expire nor come in anything other than soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a small person either, I&#x27;m 6&#x27;1\\&quot; and 190lbs, with an average size mouth.  </li>
            <li> The larger size also means that it feels less precise, which is bad if you enjoyed the feeling of precision the other smaller brush heads offer.</li>
            <li> heads are pretty hardy, one can last me for at least over 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> The smaller of the two brushes separates from the back long before the brush is worn out.  </li>
            <li> While it cleaned well, the brush head was so large that I had trouble keeping it in my mouth and keeping my mouth closed, especially when trying to reach my back teeth.  </li>
            <li> She thinks the head is to large, so people with a small mouth please take that into account.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a kid or someone with a really small mouth.</li>
            <li> the others are too small, this one covers the whole tooth.</li>
            <li> just wish basic shipping didn&#x27;t take so long.</li>
            <li> The head&#x27;s last a long time and</li>
            <li> They are soft enough that they don&#x27;t hurt my gums and firm enough to reach the places where food likes to hide and remove it.</li>
            <li> Being a notoriously hard brusher, the tiny round default brush just didn&#x27;t seem like enough clean.</li>
            <li> They last a long time, do a thorought cleaning.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is terrific for my needs; I have had long time peridontal disease.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not that different than the standard head, it&#x27;s just bigger.  </li>
            <li> Bristles were long lasting and durable.</li>
            <li> The dual action of circular cleaning as well as the up and down movement does a through job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> I was first afraid it would not fit my brush, but it fit properly.</li>
            <li> If you have a smaller mouth or  all your wisdom teeth, stick to the original because it is difficult to get the back teeth.</li>
            <li> But after a few days use, I have a new favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every new package that I buy now (and I buy quite a few throughout the year), I have problems with the bristles falling out while I am brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> head is a little larger than a conventional toothbrush but not so much as to become uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t but believe that they get your teeth considerably cleaner and in less time.</li>
            <li> I bought an assortment pack with a half dozen heads and didn&#x27;t get to the dual action brush for a while.</li>
            <li> Disappointing that Oral-B doesn&#x27;t make the model head to brush more obvious.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different Oral-B heads, and so far the Prowhite heads are my favorite:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had trouble getting the brush into the far reaches of my mouth whereas before with the smaller head I had no problems.  </li>
            <li> seems like they are little hard than the original one that I had.</li>
            <li> If you have a smaller mouth, you might want to just try the single pack</li>
            <li> this is only my second round of replacements, but so far it seems the average lifespan is anywhere from 2.5 to 3 months (with total daily usage of ~5 minutes).</li>
            <li> I tried the single brush and it just seems like it wasn&#x27;t covering enough teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to the single head brush.</li>
            <li> Now I have gotten used to the size (and the bottom head does vibrate), but I will still get the single head next time.</li>
            <li> I had bought the basic electric toothbrush from Oral-B that comes with the single, circular brush head.</li>
            <li> Has the same small brush head action combined with the larger size I desired.</li>
            <li> During use, the loose head will constantly pinch and break skin inside of the mouth.</li>
            <li> You really DO want to replace heads every few months, after the outer blue bristles fade half-way down.</li>
            <li> I love that I can get these much less expensive that at the local stores</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a lot thicker than the smaller heads, so when I&#x27;m trying to brush my back teeth, there&#x27;s not enough room for it to oscillate, making it less</li>
            <li> My wife prefers the single action heads because she has trouble inserting and manipulating the brush head in her smaller mouth.</li>
            <li> You can find the smaller, single round brush in just about any store, but not the dual action.</li>
            <li> They are harder to find than the small round head replacements, but it is worth it to order them here!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush heads clean well and last at least if not more than 3 months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since the head consists of two sets of brushes, both a rotating cup and a squared layer, this in itself is the only setback with the head since it can be seen as a little large compared to the other Oral-B heads which have only a round cup.</li>
            <li> knew it was fake because packaging seemed cheap, made in Germany</li>
            <li> I always though electric toohbrushes were for suckers with too much money.</li>
            <li> Appear to be real, but not nearly as good as the smaller floss heads.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my Oral-B 4000 Electric Toothbrush and unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this replacement brush is often unavailable in stores so I am grateful to Amazon for making it available.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time finding out what Oral-B brush model that the heads would fit.  </li>
            <li> You can price these brushes all day long</li>
            <li> They double the surface area being brushed over the standard brush (just  a rotating round brush)and all at no perceived power loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> arrived about a week earlier than expected..</li>
            <li> I will revert back to the regular, round brushes next time.</li>
            <li> Brushes are larger than expected but work well</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long before it felt the brush head that I just replaced.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes a long time.  </li>
            <li> (yes, I know it&#x27;s a ridiculously long name, but hey, I didn&#x27;t come up with it).</li>
            <li> I will continue to use these as long as the brush holds up.</li>
            <li> Excuse the capitals.</li>
            <li> I have been using an Oral-B Vitality brush for a long time-</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a long time and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> After a trip to a local store came home empty handed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Unfortunatetly, the ordering match-up was not clear, so I will put the items in the &#x27;bak drawer&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Previously I ordered the generic brand and they lasted a very short period of time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used to date, and they definitely do the job.ading in the bristles, and chances are the inside and other nooks/crevices will start to discolor (I&#x27;ve noticed a color between pink and red).</li>
            <li> if you like the small size of the other head, this might be too much.</li>
            <li> Beats most places I&#x27;ve checked, and you know how expensive these can be!</li>
            <li> In fact, they&#x27;ve been lasting twice longer than my other heads in my experience.  </li>
            <li> I have used these for several years and would not want to use any other.</li>
            <li> Saves me some time over the regular brush heads due to the size of these.</li>
            <li> the whole unit was very highly rated on Consumer Reports and nothing about it has been a disappointment.</li>
            <li> few persons posted reviews of having received fake brush heads and to eliminate this I would suggest if you&#x27;re looking to buy these heads make sure the supplier is Amazon where I have bought mine from without this setback</li>
            <li> /&gt;The dual-brush head is a bit bigger than the traditional round head.</li>
            <li> B00006ANDQ Precision Brush Head]] mentioned earlier, which (if I remember correctly) consisted of a tiny round patch of bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this brush head was when we bought a refill pack that included 1 of these brush heads and a couple of the small round brush heads.</li>
            <li> Will be back in a few months for the next set.</li>
            <li> Like the larger brush head over just the smaller round head.  </li>
            <li> What else can one say about them since I&#x27;m not a new user and these are not a new product.</li>
            <li> I prefer the dual head both for comfort and function when compared with single head brushes.</li>
            <li> than the single heads.</li>
            <li> My brush came with just the single oscillating brush head.</li>
            <li> and then when you do they are very expensive, to find them at this price and to know I can easily just order them makes my life simple!</li>
            <li> While I did have nostalgia for this traditional style due to its effectiveness on the front teeth I also found slightly less agility on the inner side of the teeth.  </li>
            <li> The only pitfall is, if you are a seriously hard brusher (like myself), each head will only last about two weeks.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll see noticeable fading in the bristles, and chances are the inside and other nooks/crevices will start to discolor (I&#x27;ve noticed a color between pink and red).</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I hate paying the price, it&#x27;s worth my dental health to pay the extra for a real deal.</li>
            <li> Due to its size/weight, it loses much of its spinning/oscillating power.</li>
            <li> The lower part of the brush becomes loose and \\&quot;catches\\&quot; on your gum/tongue while brushing.  </li>
            <li> What I can tell is that it&#x27;s WAY bigger than the standard &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; round head, and I can tell no difference in layman&#x27;s use other than it eats up battery life twice as fast.&lt;br /&gt;Considering</li>
            <li> They are slightly firmer, which is something I personally like.</li>
            <li> At first, this veteran user of the EB17 Flexisoft head was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> Previously I had bought the generic version, what a joke...</li>
            <li> I only wish it cost less per unit.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how they are technically supposed to last</li>
            <li> It is about the same size as a regular small toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The only caveat is that the brush heads do need to be replaced once worn down; if used properly (2 minutes twice a day), they will make 3 months without issue, although some may wear them down slower/faster due to differing brush</li>
            <li> The replacement brush is not suitable for users who prefer soft to medium brush.</li>
            <li> Combination of two bristle heads gives you lots of coverage but still access to tight spaces in the back of the mouth.</li>
            <li> Initially it takes a bit getting used to since I have been using the single round head brush for 2 years.</li>
            <li> Yes it feels a little bigger in your mouth</li>
            <li> I only wish these are a little cheaper...</li>
            <li> it is a little bigger than the regular one, but i think it cleans my teeth a little bitter.</li>
            <li> I did not see an expiration date nor whether the brush was hard or soft on the package.</li>
            <li> The part of the head which does the rotating had gotten loose!</li>
            <li> i love my brush , unfortunately these are now hard to find .</li>
            <li> I used the single headed brush Oral B and I have used other electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Bacteria and many of the things that create bad breath hang out in these areas not just on the teeth.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if  it is the supplier or the product in general.  </li>
            <li> No thanks).</li>
            <li> Although the performance is not what i expected( provides 40,000 pulsations per minutes), i like it</li>
            <li> The dual brush allows for getting at all areas in the mouth and covers a wide area when held sideways.</li>
            <li> but they did finally arrive a few weeks</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, but my fault for not looking at the picture.  </li>
            <li> 2 out of the 3 replacement brush heads were damaged, the plastic was crushed and broke.</li>
            <li> They arrive as expected and time.</li>
            <li> This was  shipped in an envelope and one of the brush packages was crushed</li>
            <li> round and back and forth.</li>
            <li> , what else would you expected to buy from Oral-B.</li>
            <li> I tried using them on one brand-new handle, one that&#x27;s been used for a few months, and one that is my standard</li>
            <li> , everything went as expected and advertised.</li>
            <li> Did not like it as it was too rough.  </li>
            <li> they were what i expected.</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads seem to be fine.&lt;br /&gt;Not to rough and not to soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Initially I was worried that it would not fit.  </li>
            <li> bristles a bit stiffer than I expected</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I ordered the 3-pack, when I should&#x27;ve gotten a single one and try it out first.</li>
            <li> They are less likely to wear your Gums down prematurely</li>
            <li> It was a little uncomfortable at first since it is larger than the brush head I had been using before.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these previously through Amazon as the dual-action re-fills are hard to find in stores and are more expensive.</li>
            <li> It definitely did not for me and am now stuck with 3 useless heads that I will be using as normal toothbushes...</li>
            <li> I hate the Single head but really love</li>
            <li> And as I&#x27;ve recently learned, heavy brushing with a conventional toothbrush can wear down the gums and expose a part of the tooth that&#x27;s not supposed to be exposed, causing issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One brush spins and the other vibrates.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> They work extremely well.</li>
            <li> Will never switch to any other.</li>
            <li> the other one is still running after two years.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I keep buying these is that there is no better alternative on the market.</li>
            <li> In addition, the neck is shorter than other brush heads and is wider.  </li>
            <li> I have tried 3 other versions of the Oral-B replacement brush heads.  </li>
            <li> and I have used it for the past several years.  </li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift to go into a men&#x27;s toiletry bag with other items and he loves them.  </li>
            <li> See my review for the other type of brush head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pointless having two cleaning surfaces if they can&#x27;t actually reach teeth.  </li>
            <li> They complement each other and I would recommend the combination.</li>
            <li> Due to their size, I don&#x27;t think they get into the nooks and crannies as well</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure why people complain that they are too big.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The bristles are too big and stiff making it hard to brush back molars.  </li>
            <li> I have had this particular brand of tooth brush for a long time and it&#x27;s always difficult to find replacement heads.</li>
            <li> After trying one of these Dual Clean Replacement Brushes for about 6 weeks, I was sorry!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to keep your mouth closed enough to keep all that drool inside.  </li>
            <li> Contrary to a few critical reviewers, I don&#x27;t experience any discomfort due to the size of the heads, nor do I have trouble reaching any parts of my mouth/teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, one of them already went bad.&lt;br /&gt;There are two moving parts on the head, one round and another on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom one just came loose and fell off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, provided you don&#x27;t brush too hard, the bristles last longer than the other heads.</li>
            <li> These replacements heads are hard to find locally.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time locating these specific replacement brushes in my home town.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find locally.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is the price fluctuating.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll never go back to the  small round brush head again.</li>
            <li> got these for my husband who does not like the regular small round brushes on electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> We must have at least refills into the middle of the year 2015, already.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> The complaint that one reviewer made about it being so big is not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> possibly because, due to the larger size, it&#x27;s a little awkward trying to reach some areas (the back teeth, for instance).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using them for around 2 years now and they&#x27;ve never let me down.</li>
            <li> It also cuts down on the number of times you floss.</li>
            <li> This brush does seem to run the battery down a bit faster, but this is no problem because I have 3 Oral B handles I rotate.</li>
            <li> I run my brushes down and then charge.</li>
            <li> The price beats the locals hands down.  </li>
            <li> I will order these again and would recommend anyone who is extremely hygiene focused like me!</li>
            <li> I prefer these to the single small rotating head.  </li>
            <li> (It cuts battery life roughly in half, and also seems to run slower, you can hear it slowing down oscillations.  </li>
            <li> From what I can tell, there are a few other reviews that mention this issue.</li>
            <li> That is why I initially bought a triumph, being a perfectionist I was brushing too hard and destroying gum tissue.</li>
            <li> The head is bigger, but the round part can reach hard spots.</li>
            <li> When I bought them, Amazon&#x27;s prices for brush heads was much less than the price at CVS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the handiest person in the world, but I read a review that they didn&#x27;t have instructions, but seriously they&#x27;re not necessary.  </li>
            <li> Less time in the chair and the dentist saying &amp;#34;whatever you are doing, keep it up&amp;#34</li>
            <li> My dentist likes how it leaves him less work when he cleans my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Takes the black tea stains of my teeth in moments.</li>
            <li> I must have gotten the wrong ones as the brush part was not soft as I ordered or they have changed as I&#x27;ve been using the same power part for 5 or 6 years.</li>
            <li> and I always felt that they could not adequately clean my front teeth.</li>
            <li> The size of the brush head doesn&#x27;t bother me, though it is a little messier to use.  </li>
            <li> They are a little pricey but seem to stand up well for even longer than their rated performance.</li>
            <li> I found them here for less than half that!</li>
            <li> May feel a little bulky compared to the originals though.</li>
            <li> However, after having received it, I&#x27;m a little dissappointed.  </li>
            <li> You get twice the amount of cleaning so you can brush a little shorter.  </li>
            <li> While it isn&#x27;t difficult to find normal toothbrushes with slightly narrower heads, this is also by no means anything out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li> this is the same product i usually buy at target or Bed bath and beyond, but about $10 less!!!</li>
            <li> I find it uncomfortable and the size makes it harder to get into the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I plan on getting these again in a few months.</li>
            <li> I have had a few which the bottom brush stopped moving</li>
            <li> It also says, &amp;#34;Each brush head fits all Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush handles.&amp;#34; I have an Oral-B CrossAction brush and these heads do not fit.  </li>
            <li> Waste of time.</li>
            <li> About a month ago I realized that the replacement brush heads in the near stores are way expensive</li>
            <li> but I will be returning to round style again for a while.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable to use because it&#x27;s too bulky.</li>
            <li> but I was a bit apprehensive that they might not fit my toothbrush however</li>
            <li> they fell apart after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> It turns out that it does not fit the Pulsonic.  </li>
            <li> and I would hate not to have it available.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble finding the replacement heads for my battery operated brush.</li>
            <li> I have used one for a few weeks</li>
            <li> but I think I prefer just the round replacement head</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t fit my base eventhough</li>
            <li> Just know it may or may not fit.</li>
            <li> Give my gf some trouble when we switch brush heads.</li>
            <li> I was using the round, whitening brush head for a while, but my oral care always felt a bit incomplete with those.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend these as your everyday head, and the whitening ones for periodic use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few generic versions of these replacement heads and was not happy with them at all.  </li>
            <li> but these have a second moving brush behind the front round brush.</li>
            <li> The heads of our Oral-B toothbrushes were worn; my husband&#x27;s had stopped rotating, and mine was pretty pathetic, and he had gone to the extent of buying a new one for himself.  </li>
            <li> Seriously though, the head of this is quite large and it feels uncomfortable while brushing.  </li>
            <li> Like a previous reviewer, I too have a small mouth.</li>
            <li> I am tough on regular tooth brushes and usually would have to change every two weeks.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are comparable to a stiff tooth brush head.  </li>
            <li> I replace them each time buying it here in amazon because they are not easy to find in the supermarket.</li>
            <li> They are not easily found in stores.</li>
            <li> If my Oral B had a flaw, it was that the brush head was a little on the small side.  </li>
            <li> I was not able to use them and feel like i wasted $16 for just ONE working brush head</li>
            <li> not sure the bottom brush works as well as the round one</li>
            <li> Seems to work as well as the small round brushes i have used for 25 years</li>
            <li> I find the brushes are a little hard and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems using these the past months</li>
            <li> Since EB17s usually run about $5 per head in 3-,</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of price, as usual, you cannot beat Amazon (with the Subscribe &amp; Save).</li>
            <li> was unable to find these replacements at my local bed bath and beyond so tried amazon..</li>
            <li> However with the lower portion this one feels like it works just as well if not better.</li>
            <li> There is still the small, rotating brush head that gives the \\&quot;dentist inspired\\&quot; tooth-by-tooth cleaning.</li>
            <li> Tried purchasing on line elsewhere and was not satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li> Like both, and was not sure which one to buy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used your replacement heads in the past with no problem.  </li>
            <li> I found it uncomfortable, too big.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure if these heads had something to do with it, or if my electric toothbrush is defective.</li>
            <li> but well work the small cost.  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m not sure if these were defective or if it&#x27;s a problem with the brush design.  </li>
            <li> I have never had any problems or complaints with them until the past year.</li>
            <li> However, I did not want to break the bank with an expensive one especially if it turned out that I did not like it.</li>
            <li> Not sure what that says about me??</li>
            <li> I was skeptical after reading some reviews about fake brush heads, but what I received, works very well.</li>
            <li> The store brand always became loose and useless after a month.  </li>
            <li> The triumph has a monitor that warns you when you are pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding them in any stores so this solves that problem.</li>
            <li> I find them too hard on my gums and would not purchase again</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are hard to find in the store.</li>
            <li> THE REFILLS ARE HARD TO FIND</li>
            <li> These are hard to find in stores #1</li>
            <li> I also have grooves worn on a couple of teeth from brushing too hard with a manual brush</li>
            <li> they are perfect, too bad my base fizzled out as soon as they arrived, my bad luck</li>
            <li> Well, at least they&#x27;re made in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; the least amount of work I&#x27;ve had to do&amp;#34; speaks well for the brush.</li>
            <li> the deal Amazon had on these was the cheapest I have seen even with using coupons as I am a coupon fanatic.</li>
            <li> I found it awkward to use, too big making it miss tighter places</li>
            <li> i think I actually save money using this over the disposable toothbrushes that are poor in quality and expensive.</li>
            <li> Just glide it slowly along your teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> Not very happy with these heads....</li>
            <li> NO MORE PLAQUE IN PORTLAND, OREGON!</li>
            <li> Other than that you really can&#x27;t go wrong regardless of which</li>
            <li> My mouth is very small</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to get to the very back of my mouth with these brush heads.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find these replacement heads in my local drugstores.  </li>
            <li> I hate the little, tiny circle brush heads!</li>
            <li> I received a fake set of replacement brushes, pretty disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Much less expensive than the comparable drugstore price for the replacement brush heads.q</li>
            <li> If you are serious about your teeth</li>
            <li> It is impossible too get these brushes in our local stores now.  </li>
            <li> I like the convenience of the subscriptions and still wish that this product was less expensive.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s terrific and not too bad.</li>
            <li> A little difficult to maneuver into the corners of mouth and behind the molar teeth.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> The base of the neck is usually too wide and falls off even during brushing.</li>
            <li> And Like usual;  Amazon Prime Rocks!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put my cynical ways behind me after trying these for a few months.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate these brushed</li>
            <li> Decreased amount of plaque buildup on my teeth between dental visits.  </li>
            <li> so we do not get them confused.</li>
            <li> Never found one as poor quality as this.  </li>
            <li> Awkward to brush with and the size/design creates an excessive draw on the electric toothbrush battery.</li>
            <li> If you continue to use the brush it can catch your cheek and be a little painful.  </li>
            <li> These were less expensive and arrived quickly---will buy again from here!!</li>
            <li> They were sticking out the moment I took them out of the package and when I used them they were sticking to my teeth which made me think that they are fake</li>
            <li> Sorry, I didn&#x27;t discover and use it sooner.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but always fits and works.</li>
            <li> I bought both to do a head to head compairson, either way you can not go wrong.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads aren&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sorry that I did.  </li>
            <li> However, when after one week of using one of these replacement heads, my oral b vitality toothbrush began making weird whirring sounds.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  </li>
            <li> Wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as the really expensive electric tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> Close to $8 per brush head... seems expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that you really can&#x27;t go wrong regardless of which</li>
            <li> They are a necessary evil to use with our electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive, but I learned my lesson.</li>
            <li> I though it might be a flawed head</li>
            <li> these were the wrong item for my unit</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be so sad when it stops working</li>
            <li> As I hate to waste money, I decided to give this dual brush head a try before giving up altogether on my Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Was the wrong length type.</li>
            <li> but I was completely wrong.</li>
            <li> You will be sorry.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> This gets expensive to replace so often!</li>
            <li> For the member of our family with the bad teeth genes (we won&#x27;t say who they are), he went from having cavities</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad one?</li>
            <li> This is painful and has caused me to bleed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Considering each head is around $5, I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Now, when I travel, I hate to use a \\&quot;manual\\&quot; toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Generics are worthless.</li>
            <li> morons.</li>
            <li> I can feel it all the way to the base of each tooth.  </li>
            <li> I hate any brush that vibrates but</li>
            <li> This was very annoying.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> very happy with the purchase and delivery</li>
            <li> Truly awesome that this Oral-B Dual Clean product is in stock!!! It is by far the most difficult item to find in stores like Walmart, Target, Walgreen&#x27;s, CVS, grocery chains, etc;  Believe me, I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for a period of one month to no avail...it sells out before I can even step out of my door to purchase it!!  I love Dual Clean for the double brushes work magic and have proven most effective in my overall tooth/gum maintenance in between my dental visits.  I will definitely order more in the near future for I definitely do not want to be left out in the cold with the usage of my simple toothbrush ever again!!</li>
            <li> works great, I use this brand all the time , the prices really are not much different then at walmart it&#x27;s just convient</li>
            <li> this one is absolutely necesary if you want more people to use this brush it is costly to replace but definately pays back in dividends on your dentists bill</li>
            <li> This toothbrush head is larger than the norm, but I like the dual action and I really think using it has improved the health of my gums</li>
            <li> I love OralB produce for almost one year. This brush does work well and helps clean my teeth very thoroughly.</li>
            <li> The best type of head.</li>
            <li> My husband likes these.  I am okay with them, but prefer just the eound head one.</li>
            <li> Love how it seems that more of my teeth get brushed at the same time.  Yes it feels a little bigger in your mouth but I&#x27;ll definitely use these from now one.  Go for it....I think you&#x27;ll like them.</li>
            <li> This is the brush I like because is has many directions of motion for cleaning. I replace them each time buying it here in amazon because they are not easy to find in the supermarket.</li>
            <li> I really like the dual brush head compared to the single brush head, as it brushes in more than one way. One brush spins and the other vibrates. Plus it brushes a larger area at once. To me, the single head is fine for children.  I was using the single head until I tried the dual head and liked it much better.</li>
            <li> I have an oral b triumph and was using the circular sensitive toothbrush version until I got a sample pack and tried these. This brush does a very good job at cleaning teeth without tearing up the gums. That is why I initially bought a triumph, being a perfectionist I was brushing too hard and destroying gum tissue. The triumph has a monitor that warns you when you are pressing too hard. Anyways, best toothbrush I have found for my oral b triumph.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate these brushed but I am disapointed in the quality of the bristles. They were sticking out the moment I took them out of the package and when I used them they were sticking to my teeth which made me think that they are fake but they are marked &amp;#34;made in Germany&amp;#34; on the back of the package!</li>
            <li> I love this replacement brush for the Oral-B toothbrush!  The dual clean works well, and I would recommend it to other buyers.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Oral-B Dual Clean for about 6 months, it works great and inexpensive than the $80 systems. This is also better than the Crest Toothbrush operated by AA batteries as the batteries will lose power. Whereas this is constantly charged.</li>
            <li> Product is what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived promptly.&lt;br /&gt;Cost resonable.&lt;br /&gt;No problems to report.</li>
            <li> This is a really useful head for any of the toothbrushes it fits. I&#x27;ve tried a good portion of the other ones that Oral-B offers, but this is by far the best. I have noticed a significant difference in how clean my teeth are after brushing with this head and the others, this being far better. Also, provided you don&#x27;t brush too hard, the bristles last longer than the other heads.</li>
            <li> Excellent in every way.  Sorry, I didn&#x27;t discover and use it sooner.  And it&#x27;s priced affordably.  It should be included when you buy a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Very good set of parts of the toothbrush. As I mentioned in the analysis of the brush is very good. Therefore this is an ideal complement to the purchase of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads are perfect. They are slightly firmer, which is something I personally like. In my opinion they last longer. I plan on getting these again in a few months.</li>
            <li> The price is right!  Beats most places I&#x27;ve checked, and you know how expensive these can be!</li>
            <li> These are the real heads and work great.  I like the size, but my GF is not a fan.  She thinks the head is to large, so people with a small mouth please take that into account.</li>
            <li> This is the way to go for stuff like this. Saves me money with free shipping. Amazon has it together. Item arrives every six months automatically but can change delivery sooner very easy.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush head is larger than the norm, but I like the dual action and I really think using it has improved the health of my gums.  I feel it does a better job of cleaning my teeth.  I like having the advantage of getting 2 types of cleaning heads while using only one toothbrush.  The size of the brush head doesn&#x27;t bother me, though it is a little messier to use.  It&#x27;s hard to keep your mouth closed enough to keep all that drool inside.  I just make sure I brush over the sink.</li>
            <li> Great price for these</li>
            <li> Not very happy with these heads....they feel too big!  I think I like the smaller ones better.</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised.  fits my electric toothbrush perfectly.</li>
            <li> these work fine, but Oral-B keeps revising the toothbrush head line-up in ways that its hard to figure out what you&#x27;re buying, and how the new heads compare to the old ones I used to use.  I&#x27;m not convinced it really matters what heads you have, as long as you have an Oral-B toothbrush</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase of the Oral-B Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head.  Searched for this product for months at various stores but couldn&#x27;t find the \\&quot;Dual Clean\\&quot;.  Decided to give Amazon a try and sure enough there they were.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> This dual-head replacement brush is exactly what came with my initial powered tooth brush purchase. I have had no problems whatsoever. In fact this package contains three replacements at a price below what many other retailers are listing for just one. I prefer the dual head both for comfort and function when compared with single head brushes.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Price through Amazon is very competitive, even beating WalMart after taking into account shipping.  The product itself works great, Amazon has made it much more reasonable.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see a difference between using this and just the regular brush head replacement. Probably won&#x27;t be buying again... no need... will just be purchasing the regular brush head replacements.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0002KHU3I Oral-B Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)]]&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Tooth Brush unit from Walmart and their price turns out not to be any lower than most other stores selling the same item! but when it came to getting replacement brushes so I could share the brush with immediate family or just keep on brushing they want an arm and a leg for them - much more reasonable on AMAZON! the whole unit was very highly rated on Consumer Reports and nothing about it has been a disappointment. NO MORE PLAQUE IN PORTLAND, OREGON!</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are exactly what I was looking for but couldn&#x27;t find in my local stores.  Same replacement heads at a better price.</li>
            <li> I found a \\&quot;clearance priced\\&quot; electric toothbrush.  I&#x27;m guessing the low price was because nobody carries the replacement heads.  a very pleasant surprise to discover that Amazon had them.  The are the actual name-brand replacement parts, are reasonably priced and work wonderfully.  Now, when I travel, I hate to use a \\&quot;manual\\&quot; toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Since using product, I&#x27;ve had great dental checkups; no cavities</li>
            <li> AAAAA+++++Product was as advertised and arrived on time.  Thank you, Ron</li>
            <li> they are perfect, too bad my base fizzled out as soon as they arrived, my bad luck</li>
            <li> This brush head can cover a lot or real estate for a quick clean up as well as being a great regular tooth brush head. This brush head is also great if you like to brush other parts of your mouth, not just your teeth. When I first started using electric tooth brushes I was told that they are great for brushing tongue, roof of mouth, inside cheek, etc. Bacteria and many of the things that create bad breath hang out in these areas not just on the teeth. Using this large size brush head is great for cleaning all these areas and your mouth feels so fresh and clean when you&#x27;re done!</li>
            <li> I bought this first anticipating the Oral B Advancedpower 950TX would work,of which was writen about/reviewed.hopefully I can remedy the brush situation But have absolutly No problem with the replacements still in the package they came in. They Do sound like Winners to me.&lt;br /&gt;Hopeful</li>
            <li> I purchased this Oral - B Dual Clean, replacement 3 pack.  It is better than my original brush and works like a charm.  You can price these brushes all day long but, you won&#x27;t beat the Amazon price any place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Dual Clean brushes are great. They double the surface area being brushed over the standard brush (just  a rotating round brush)and all at no perceived power loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using them for around 2 years now and they&#x27;ve never let me down. I have had a few which the bottom brush stopped moving but by that point the bristles were already worn out and it was time for a replacement anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This head is a little larger than a conventional toothbrush but not so much as to become uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great brush for an excellent rechargeable toothbrush(my Braun/Oral-B 3-D action toothbrushes are both  5-8yrs old and still work great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the Oral B electric tooth brush.  These replacement brushes are the only ones available as far as I know.  They are a little pricey but seem to stand up well for even longer than their rated performance.</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing the Dual Clean brush heads I had only used the FlossAction and ProWhite brush heads.  The Dual Clean heads are by far my favorite.  I like that the head is larger and feels like it cleans more at once.  You will have to stand over the sink while using these, but that is not an issue for me.  If it is a problem for you, I&#x27;d definitely recommend the FlossAction over the ProWhite.  The Dual Clean heads don&#x27;t fit in the traveling case, so I still purchase the FlossAction for traveling and when my mouth was swollen and sore after getting some wisdom teeth pulled.  Other than that, I stick with the Dual Clean.</li>
            <li> The brushes are comparable to a stiff tooth brush head.  I like the dual clean because they seem to do a better job of cleaning your teeth and gums than the smaller single head solutions that I have tried.  It is also a good idea to have extras around to use in your travel bag and makes traveling with a toothbrush pretty simple.</li>
            <li> work as good as always</li>
            <li> I ordered these previously through Amazon as the dual-action re-fills are hard to find in stores and are more expensive. It&#x27;s an Oral-B product so there was no doubt the would fit.</li>
            <li> GOOD INSTRUMENT FOR CLEAN TEETH</li>
            <li> Wow, this will strip the paint off my house!.  My teeth are soo clean after using this brush...never again use the single brush head.  Wonderful, strong..but expensive.  Its worth it.</li>
            <li> Perfect. That&#x27;s what I needed.</li>
            <li> THE COST WAS HALF THE PRICE OF MANY STORES I HAVE LOOKED TO PURCHASE REPLACEMENT BRUSH, GOES TO SHOW YOU HOW MUCH THEY MARK UP PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> I had been looking to purchase replacement brushes for my electric toothbrush and couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere for my specific model.  Thanks to Amazon, I found the right fitting brush heads and I am a happy brusher once more.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  Arrived on time and works exactly as the one replaced.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed! Arrived in a very timely fashion.</li>
            <li> IT WAS AN OK TOOTH BRUSH BUT THE ORIGINAL SINGLE SPINNING HEAD CLEANER SEEMED TO DO A BETTER JOB.</li>
            <li> These brush heads clean each tooth twice as the brush passes over it. One brush cleans with a rotary action, the other with an up-and-down action. It feels like my teeth are getting a more thorough brushing, and I find the vibration of the brush to be a pleasant sensation. But these heads may be best for people with large mouths. My wife prefers the single action heads because she has trouble inserting and manipulating the brush head in her smaller mouth. When I bought them, Amazon&#x27;s prices for brush heads was much less than the price at CVS.</li>
            <li> I have had difficulty finding these. I thought it was great pricing, will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Oral-B says these are &amp;#34;Compatible with the entire lineup of Oral-B rechargeable handles,&amp;#34; including CrossAction.  It also says, &amp;#34;Each brush head fits all Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush handles.&amp;#34; I have an Oral-B CrossAction brush and these heads do not fit.  I had to return them.  Waste of time.</li>
            <li> Dual Clean brush heads provide the much needed extra clean teeth feeling that traditional hand tooth brush heads fail to provide. It also cuts down on the number of times you floss. Though there is not substitute for flossing this definitely will minimize your flossing frequency.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, these brushes are Oral-B made, they work well and were available at a very reasonable price. Service was fine; received them in relatively short time.</li>
            <li> The Oral B Dueal Clean Replacment Brush Heads fit my Oral-B Vitality Braum Brush Holder exactly.  It comes with color coded collars that slip over the stem of the brush to designate the brush head if others utilize the same brush holder.  The dual action of circular cleaning as well as the up and down movement does a through job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> Honestly these heads are great.  We love our electric toothbrushes.  I&#x27;ve had no problems using these the past months, I even subscribed to receive these around the time that we would need to change our brush heads.  My mouth is very small and I do not think the heads are too big to fit in my mouth at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the price fluctuating.  I originally subscribed to this product at a price around 8 dollars for three.  Since then the price has risen to almost 17 dollars for the three heads.  And while I love my electric toothbrush, this price is simply not worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dual headed brush from Oral-B for over two months and am very pleased. It seems to clean my teeth better than the single headed brush. I will know better after my six months dental checkup and will do a follow-up review at that time.</li>
            <li> I had to jam the head onto my toothbrush (An Oral B Pro-Health Dual Clean battery powered toothbrush) whereas the original was much easier. But, it works! And is much cheaper than $9 per head at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant to try this brush, but I thought because my teeth are a bit larger It may be worth a try. I am pleased with the Dual Brush. I feel like I am getting more cleaning done. This brush does seem to run the battery down a bit faster, but this is no problem because I have 3 Oral B handles I rotate. I should tell you that I do not keep my brush in the charger all the time. I run my brushes down and then charge. I think this maintains a longer life.</li>
            <li> This brush is about twice the size of the standard brush head. I feel like I can have a more efficient brush with these, when compared to the smaller heads. If you have a smaller mouth, you might want to just try the single pack first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It feels too big at first.&lt;br /&gt;  Its messier.</li>
            <li> These duel brushes really clean I have used duel brushes for 3 years</li>
            <li> The price was great on this 3 pack.  The brush is the perfect size to not be too large to reach into the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Brushes heads are excellent, They clean very well and the price can&#x27;t be beat.I will purchase this product again. I would purchase from this merchant again.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use these daily. We really like that they are a full head and agree our teeth feel cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;As a note, the product info says they don&#x27;t fit a Vitality, but we have used these type heads with our Vitality brushes for over a year and they&#x27;re great together!</li>
            <li> Expensive but always fits and works. Generics are worthless.</li>
            <li> Best brush i have used..</li>
            <li> I love Oral B products and these brushes especially that I can order in  quantity.  Will reorder today if I can get to the shopping menu</li>
            <li> Bought these for my Oral B toothbrush at an amazing price from amazon [with their $5 coupon]. They work extremely well. Was surprised to find that they are made in Germany [not China]!</li>
            <li> I bought Oral-B dual clean 3 month ago and now I brush my teeth for two minutes; their are cleaner and brushing is fun now! About a month ago I realized that the replacement brush heads in the near stores are way expensive that the ones I can buy here. All in all, that fits the tooth brush very well and you may need to change the head every month so its good to have three of them!</li>
            <li> I received a fake set of replacement brushes, pretty disappointed.  however, i did get my refund, But  I am lost as to how to get a good price on a genuine set of brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew it was fake because packaging seemed cheap, made in Germany, bristles looked different; like a regular tooth brush, genuine brush heads are more compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want genuine replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> Great product, but the price is a bummer.</li>
            <li> WHY PAY MORE IN THE STORE. THIS ITEM IS THE SAME. MY TEETH LOVE THE NEW STIFFNESS AND I AM A HAPPY BUYER. AGAIN, WHY PAY MORE AT THE STORE FOR THE SAME ITEM ;-)</li>
            <li> I bought these even though others had not given them so good of reviews. It is larger than the standard brush but not that much. I like the original better, but the quality for both of them are A+. I bought both to do a head to head compairson, either way you can not go wrong. Yes they are more expensive than the aftermarket, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I got one of these with my last Braun replacement, a 7850DLX set. At first, this veteran user of the EB17 Flexisoft head was a bit skeptical. But after a few days use, I have a new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dual-brush head is a bit bigger than the traditional round head. The EB17 is still great for getting in tight spots, particularly the  backs of the rearmost molars. But this head is great for quickie between meal cleaning, and as a bonus is pretty good at brushing off my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fits most of the current line of Braun brushes, but check your manual to be sure. Since EB17s usually run about $5 per head in 3-, 4-, and 6-packs, finding the EB417 about the same price is a relief. You really DO want to replace heads every few months, after the outer blue bristles fade half-way down.</li>
            <li> Leaves a good clean feeling. Does get some tooth paste stuck down deep the bristles however so it requires a solid wash under hot water at times to remove hardened tooth paste. All in all I&#x27;m content.</li>
            <li> Combination of two bristle heads gives you lots of coverage but still access to tight spaces in the back of the mouth.</li>
            <li> Have used oral b electric tooth brush &amp; the replacement heads are great with the &amp;#34;gum massage&amp;#34; pieces. Will never switch to any other.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I cannot think of anything in particular I&#x27;d want or need in an improved version of this toothbrush head. I&#x27;m no dentist, so I cannot attest to its stomatological prowess...but I&#x27;m sure it does a better job than the default, smaller [[ASIN:B00006ANDQ Oral-B Precision Brush Heads]] that came with my [[ASIN:B000GBICYE Oral-B Electric Toothbrush]]. This larger head seems to be the next step up, and in my opinion, it hits the sweet spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, three things really matter (in no particular order): size, price, and life expectancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen many complain about the size being too large. Personally, I feel its size is very comparable to any normal sized toothbrush (not including travel or cheap freebie brushes). Vertically, the distance from the topmost to the bottommost bristle is exactly an inch. This is definitely a standard height. Furthermore, the width of the head never exceeds .5 inches. While it isn&#x27;t difficult to find normal toothbrushes with slightly narrower heads, this is also by no means anything out of the ordinary. If anything, I&#x27;m surprised the default head that comes with most Vitality and other Oral-B Electric brands is the [[ASIN:B00006ANDQ Precision Brush Head]] mentioned earlier, which (if I remember correctly) consisted of a tiny round patch of bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of price, as usual, you cannot beat Amazon (with the Subscribe &amp; Save). With an average price of a touch over 4 dollars per head, it sure beats the jaw-dropping prices at Walgreens and other pharmacies (a pack of three for $30?? No thanks). Still, something in me wants to say that toothbrush heads (especially when you&#x27;ve already dropped &gt;25 dollars for the body) should be somewhere between 3 and 4 dollars, at most. Well, at least they&#x27;re made in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this is only my second round of replacements, but so far it seems the average lifespan is anywhere from 2.5 to 3 months (with total daily usage of ~5 minutes). Anymore than 3 months and you&#x27;ll see noticeable fading in the bristles, and chances are the inside and other nooks/crevices will start to discolor (I&#x27;ve noticed a color between pink and red). The bristles are hard enough to really give you a smooth tooth finish after brushing for 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, best electric brush heads I&#x27;ve used to date, and they definitely do the job.ading in the bristles, and chances are the inside and other nooks/crevices will start to discolor (I&#x27;ve noticed a color between pink and red).

All in all, best electric brush heads I&#x27;ve used to date, and they definitely do the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found these.&lt;br /&gt;The brush doesn&#x27;t feel big at all, it actually feels like using a normal toothbrush which is very comforting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft and it works really great.&lt;br /&gt;I feel my teeth are cleaner, faster and easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never go back to the  small round brush head again. ;)</li>
            <li> I bought one of those generic brush heads and I was desparate to find&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these. I was so excited to find them on Amazon, they&#x27;re not easy to find&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in the stores.  The dual action head provides better brushing and they fit the machine perfectly.</li>
            <li> These work really well without spreading toothpaste all over you.</li>
            <li> The double brush (dual clean) feels better than one in my opinion because it covers more area and feels closer to a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> These Dual Action brushes seem to clean better and more area than the regular circular brush.  However, the rectangular brush portion seems to break at about 4 months of twice a day use.</li>
            <li> For the price, this can&#x27;t be beat.  These are the deals I look for in the subscription shop and save.  If you can get this for a deal, its worth it!  The product is a standard tooth brush, but obviously does ALL of the work for you.  I prefer these to the single small rotating head.  Some prefer the smaller one because it moves to smaller areas.  Maybe not the best toothbrush for children, but I love it.</li>
            <li> So glad to find these as none of the stores carry this item.</li>
            <li> These brushes work very well, excellent price. Will continue ordering from Amazon.  They last a long time, and make my teeth feel very clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brush heads that can be used with my Oral-B electric toothbrush, including the [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral-B Floss Action]] and [[ASIN:B0002KHTG6 Oral-B Pro White]], and these are the best! The dual cleaning brushes really help achieve a fresh, super clean feeling after brushing. Contrary to a few critical reviewers, I don&#x27;t experience any discomfort due to the size of the heads, nor do I have trouble reaching any parts of my mouth/teeth. These toothbrush heads are no larger than those found on many manual brushes. Also, the indicator bristles are definitely helpful in determining when to move on to the next brush head. These are great!</li>
            <li> This product works, great, cleans teeth wonderfully. The main reason I purchased with Amazon was because it cost $25 at Wal-Mart for these 3 replacement heads! I found them here for less than half that! Amazing price difference. Quick shipping too!</li>
            <li> This wider brush is just as good as the single round brush. Initially it takes a bit getting used to since I have been using the single round head brush for 2 years.</li>
            <li> Amazon is the cheapest place I have found to get this Oral B replacement toothbrush head. You can find the smaller, single round brush in just about any store, but not the dual action. Maybe I like this brush better because I&#x27;m a guy and it actually feels like I have some toothbrush in my mouth. I tried the single brush and it just seems like it wasn&#x27;t covering enough teeth. Both do a great job! People with smaller mouths may want to try both brushes to see which is more comfortable for them. I have had the Oral B system for 4 years now and my dental check-ups seem to have steadily improved. Maybe it&#x27;s just because brushing seems so much easier that I do it more regularly.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these particular brushheads a number of timesn for use with the Oral-B Dual Clean rechargable toothbrush.  I have used this particular toothbrush for around 5 years and have stuck with it because of the great results the brush and heads yield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While others swear by higher-end brushes and/or sonic brushes, I have found that the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; I get from this brushing system is (so far) unsurpassed.  The only caveat is that the brush heads do need to be replaced once worn down; if used properly (2 minutes twice a day), they will make 3 months without issue, although some may wear them down slower/faster due to differing brush habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All orders for this product through amazon.com have been flawless; product is exactly as described and in perfect condition.  Buy with confidence!</li>
            <li> this is the 2nd oral B I have had.  the other one is still running after two years.  the brush lasted for 18 monthes.  I am tough on regular tooth brushes and usually would have to change every two weeks.  This is such a great &amp; durable product.</li>
            <li> When I found this head for about the same cost as regular-sized heads, I figured I should get it. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> this product is great, the only problem is the size It is kind of big</li>
            <li> Read all the awesome reviews and while it is great, it is harder to get to the inner side of the teeth due to it&#x27;s size.  While I did have nostalgia for this traditional style due to its effectiveness on the front teeth I also found slightly less agility on the inner side of the teeth.  Overall though it&#x27;s great to mix it up but I will be returning to round style again for a while.</li>
            <li> I (and my dentist and periodondist) love the way the Oral-B Dual Clean Brush Head cleans my teeth and all along the gum line.  I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and intend to continue with it forever.  Nothing beats this particular brush head.  The dental hygienists are always pleased with the excellent condition of my teeth and gums. I thank the Oral-B Dual Clean Brush Heads for that.</li>
            <li> Does a great job getting your teeth clean. Work well with my Oral-B. Like it better than the single action heads.</li>
            <li> Great buy.....excellent value &amp; perfect product for my use.....better value than at any local store....</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are meant to work with the oral b electric toothbrush. They effectively clean the teeth. They are great because they prevent one from brushing too hard as compared to using a manual toothbrush. These replacement heads aren&#x27;t expensive. Compare it to a maunual brush, which can wear out even at a faster pace. Great product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Health and Happiness,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patrick Leonardi</li>
            <li> These brushes heads are as expected for Oral-B Dual Clean Tooth brush. Delivery was fast makes me a happy customer. :)</li>
            <li> These are perfect for people that don&#x27;t like the small toothbrush head that comes on the precision brush.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d like the double brush design but after a week I&#x27;m now used to it and the regular heads seem tiny.  Glad I gave it a try and teeth feel great.  Just be sure to open wide as a few times I rattled the upper and lower teeth as it can contact both at the same time when held vertically if you aren&#x27;t paying attention and close your mouth.</li>
            <li> I find the brushes are a little hard and the brissles are sort of permenantly seperated. I did not see an expiration date nor whether the brush was hard or soft on the package. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t expire nor come in anything other than soft. However, delivery time was good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for many years.  My Dentist visits are great, I am in and out without any problems.  It appears that my cleaning time is cut by half, this brush really does its job.</li>
            <li> No problems w/ our replacement Oral B heads,&lt;br /&gt; bought 2 packs  have enough for next 2 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have not noticed any of the vibration issues others have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;So, keep smile&#x27;n</li>
            <li> This product is better than the toothbrush heads I buy in the store.  The store brand always became loose and useless after a month.  This product is stronger, more durable and lasting.  Will definitely order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> purchase couldn&#x27;t have been easier and seller sent what was advertised as stated and received purchase early.  A great pleasure doing business with this company.</li>
            <li> The replacement brush is not suitable for users who prefer soft to medium brush.</li>
            <li> Glad to find this particular brush. Site was easy to manipulate and the process and shipment was smooth and as promised.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the Oral B Vitality electric toothbrush.  It is priced reasonably and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I love brushing my teeth and was excited to find this product for this price. Quality has held up and I would recommend to all.</li>
            <li> Nice to change brush as needed to keep electric working well.</li>
            <li> this is a great item to pair my new brush now I can reach the more tough spot.</li>
            <li> This came with the exact heads that I needed - fit fine on my Oral B Braun Toothbrush.  I have no complaints and I thought the price was good.</li>
            <li> I was leery about this product given that it is double the size of the normal Oral B toothbrush head. I wouldn&#x27;t say I am a convert, but it has been a good experience so far. The brush is bigger but it&#x27;s no bigger than a normal toothbrush. If anything, the fact that you have a normal toothbrush going to town in your mouth, is a plus.</li>
            <li> Birthday gift for better half- he is happy- works great!</li>
            <li> Never wanted to pay this much for an eletric toothbrush, but after many of the $10 market ones I got this.  What&#x27;s the best is that almost all brush heads are interchangable on the Oral-B models.  This thing works GREAT.  For the price, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> i wore braces for 3 years and oral b has been my motorized brush of choice. it got in between my brackets and wires wonderfully. my braces were removed 2 weeks ago and both the orthodontist and my dentist were impressed with how clean my teeth and gums were.  i attribute it to these replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Good price, great product</li>
            <li> All is good. Cleans my teeth perfectly.</li>
            <li> This product works as good as the original and was sent in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> This is the tip that should be included with electric toothbrushes. It is good for people with big mouths (like me!). It covers much more area per second of brushing time, although it makes it more difficult to get behind the last teeth on each row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what these brushes are, they are very expensive, although Amazon&#x27;s price was pretty good.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush heads do not last long compare to the original heads years ago. Companies do not make products that last anymore.</li>
            <li> I like using these for my Oral B vitality a lot more than the regular dinky little circular ones - these give a better clean and are a good price</li>
            <li> These Oral-B replacement brushes are the best. Don&#x27;t bother with the generic, they aren&#x27;t near as good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Braun Oral-B rechargeable brush for over a year now.  My last dentist checkup (first in 3 yrs) went like this...  \\&quot;Your teeth are in perfect condition with no signs of any cavities, regular cleaning is all you need, have a nice day.\\&quot;  YES!!  Highly recommend this for everyone in the family, we have 4 of them now :)</li>
            <li> I had been very satisfied with the Oral B Floss Action Brush Heads until I tried the Oral-B DualAction Premium Power Toothbrush Head Refill.  I am convinced that my teeth look whiter, remain plaque free for a longer period of time and that my gums and tongue are cleaned more effectively.  I initially purchased a package of 3, however since I never want to be without one of these heads, I have decided to keep an additional 3 pak available at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been as satisfied with a toothbrush head as these and would gladly recommend them to friends, family and even strangers. I realize that this an over the top review but I love these toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of all the brush heads , can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.&lt;br /&gt;The best all round brush.</li>
            <li> Very happy. just wish basic shipping didn&#x27;t take so long.</li>
            <li> Great item but could be cheaper. I should&#x27;ve waited for these to go on sale before getting them otherwise it works as it should.</li>
            <li> Works great. Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> beware, the brush heads are rather large.  they work great, but will have to take extra care if you have any teeth that are not perfectly aligned.</li>
            <li> Is a nice electric toothbrush , the brush is simple wonderfull. soft. I&#x27;m definitily a happy brushing. I would recommend</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I had the best results as shown by our last cleanings.  Dental hygenist said to keep up the good work.  After many attempts to reduce tartar, we didn&#x27;t see results until we used this brush head type.  Would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both have used these replacement heads and haven&#x27;t had any problems with them.  Can&#x27;t beat the price locally and they shipped fast too with prime!</li>
            <li> I love this two-phase Braun toothbrush head.  It cleans amazingly well, and feels wonderful on gums, teeth, and tongue.  I highly recomend it!  Once you&#x27;ve tried this dual action brush, you will never go back to the single swirly Braun brush!  It is THAT good!</li>
            <li> was unable to find these replacements at my local bed bath and beyond so tried amazon..not only was the price less than bb&amp;b with a coupon but free shipping..arrived about a week earlier than expected..great brushes too:)</li>
            <li> Larger tooth brush heads versus the one that came with my electric brush. However with the lower portion this one feels like it works just as well if not better. It does take up more space in the mouth though for those withouth a lot of room.</li>
            <li> I enjoy having the choice of using the round brush and elongated.</li>
            <li> I brush twice a day for about 1.5min each time and the bottom brush head loosens off the main assembly within just 1 month of use. I have no complaints about the durability of the bristles. However, the lack of durability of the head mechanism is just not acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The loosened head is not just a cosmetic issue. During use, the loose head will constantly pinch and break skin inside of the mouth. Many of the broken skin/mucus-membranes will inevitably turn into canker sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has happened to me with about 4 to 5 of these same brush heads. The only reason I keep buying these is that there is no better alternative on the market. If there is a better and more durable alternative brush/brush-head, please let me know.</li>
            <li> I have had lots of problems finding replacement heads for our Oral B electric toothbrushes. They were either out of stock or way over priced. Amazon has made life much better by having these heads at an excellent price and the quick and correct shipping made this slightly stressful purchase very easy.</li>
            <li> They were the exact replacement for the ones I had been using.  The place I had been purchasing them from did not have them.  I was happy to get them.</li>
            <li> I love the price and how easy everything was, defenely will buy this product againg, the brush was in the original package and mint conditions.</li>
            <li> This product is very efficient. The dual action helps in cleaning the plaque and gingivitis.   I give a thumbs up for it.</li>
            <li> I have used this style brush for several years and get good dental checkups with minimal scraping by the hygienist.</li>
            <li> After trying all of the available Oral-B Brush heads, this is by far my favorite.  Cleans great and does not hurt my gums.  I have had my Oral B for eight years now. I almost purchased a Sonicare but toothbrush but then read reviews.  Figured i would give my Oral B one more chance.  This head saved the day and i continue to be happy with my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Like a previous reviewer, I too have a small mouth. When it&#x27;s time to take an impression, the dentist uses a tray that is meant for kids! Anyhow, yes, there is a lot more toothbrush there, but it&#x27;s covering twice the area and if you brush for the same amount of time as before it feels so much cleaner. I&#x27;ll never go back to the single head brush. It does not seem to put much more of a load on the motor. As far as using the battery faster... probably, but I wouldn&#x27;t know as I replace the motor unit into the charger after each use. For a couple of bucks more, I think it&#x27;s money well spent. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> These are high quality and do the job right.</li>
            <li> Love the surface area! It makes it feel more like a normal toothbrush instead of an electric one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t seem to last very long. I guess you get what you pay for?&lt;br /&gt;Eats AA batteries.</li>
            <li> In my experience this replacement head and electric toothbrush is the closest you can come to a professional cleaning.  You feel like you&#x27;ve been to the dentist every day.  I can feel the difference on my teeth compared to a standard non-electric or the new cheaper/smaller oral B electric that runs on a AAA battery.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have seen prices for 1 head, that were more than what I paid for these 3 heads.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable to use because it&#x27;s too bulky. The single heads are quite easy and comfortable to use.  I&#x27;ve used the regular circular one and the floss heads.</li>
            <li> It is so nice to fing replacement parts for something, rather than buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Great product and I stocked up on them when I bought my new electric tooth brush.  This &amp;#34;dual-clean&amp;#34; head is very thorough and will clean your teeth well.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used the Oral-B Professional Dual Clean brush for several years.  What can one say about a toothbrush?  These are long-lasting and very effective, much more so than the standard brush heads.  For some time I purchased these replacements locally, but when I found them on Amazon, I was astounded by the price difference!  I have them set to ship regularly, just so I don&#x27;t forget to order them (and to get even better pricing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like these brush heads better than any I&#x27;ve tried, but a toothbrush is a matter of personal choice.  I recommend these to Oral-B owners; try them and I think you&#x27;ll be happy with your choice.</li>
            <li> Could not find this in walmart where I first bought it and the toothbrush. Ordered it and it arrived fast. Does a good job!</li>
            <li> The bristles are too big and stiff making it hard to brush back molars.  I will revert back to the regular, round brushes next time.</li>
            <li> These work better than the ones that came with the brush.  It works great.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 4000 toothbrush and needed another brush head for it.  I was between the dual clean, the floss action, and the whitening one.  After reading the reviews, I decided on the dual clean and I&#x27;m sorry that I did.  While it cleaned well, the brush head was so large that I had trouble keeping it in my mouth and keeping my mouth closed, especially when trying to reach my back teeth.  In addition, the neck is shorter than other brush heads and is wider.  Overall, made brushing my teeth much more difficult.  I tried my husband&#x27;s floss action brush head this morning and found it much easier to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> First rate product.  I should have been using tooth brush heads like this one years ago. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> arrived quick and they were exactly what we needed for our Oral B toothbrushes. we are very happy with the purchase and will look to buy these again.</li>
            <li> Just kidding honey.  Seriously though, the head of this is quite large and it feels uncomfortable while brushing.  I&#x27;m been using this for a month now and still haven&#x27;t got used to the size.  When these wear out, I&#x27;m think I&#x27;ll switch back to the smaller brush.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for these tooth brush heads to replace the one that came with my unit for months now.  I finally figured I would just look at Amazon, and there they were.  So glad to finally have these again.  I are the only ones that seem to work right in my mouth and are soft enough, not to hurt.</li>
            <li> I chose this because it was the best deal available for replacement heads at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely works well and does the job.  The reason I went with 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is based on personal preference and not product quality. I prefer the single head version that came with the brush over the dual clean model.  I find it less comfortable when  brushing.  It certainly is not so bad that I won&#x27;t use them or felt a need to return them, but next time I need new heads I&#x27;ll go with the regular head.</li>
            <li> Although the performance is not what i expected( provides 40,000 pulsations per minutes), i like it</li>
            <li> I did a lot of price checking in local stores. Could not find the identical brush like I had originally purchased so went to amazon and found this. It works Great!</li>
            <li> Fit was accurate and they work well.  I love my electric toothbrush - the manual kind cannot compare.  These heads are especially good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found these on Amazon.  Although it seems like they are from Canada (or France) these replacement heads work very well with my Braun Oral - B Vitality electric toothbrush.  It&#x27;s very exciting to see something that works with what I have at a VERY good price.  I will buy again if available!</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush works very well. It holds its charge so that I can leave it off the charger for three days or so, and I still get solid power. The dual brush allows for getting at all areas in the mouth and covers a wide area when held sideways. The toothbrush is fairly lightweight, easy to use and hold. I&#x27;m not sure it always slows down accurately on its timer to encourage the brusher to move to another tooth area, but to me that doesn&#x27;t matter. I brush thoroughly, and this toothbrush makes thorough brushing much easier than a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is more than inexpensive for the quality - it&#x27;s downright super-affordable. I&#x27;ll see how long the brush head lasts, but for now, this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I like these dual heads for better teeth cleaning. The smaller heads just do not feel like they clean as well - would like to see a larger pack available.</li>
            <li> The brushes worked perfectly with my Oral B Triumph Toothbrush. The brushes were sealed in original packaging. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I llike Oral-B Dual Clean brush head has 2 heads which make me brush my teeth easier and clean. This 3-ct package cost only $13.xx good price. But I don&#x27;t expect the 3 cts are not in 1 box, they are individual packed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this upon seeing the relatively consistent number of 4/5 reviews. However, when after one week of using one of these replacement heads, my oral b vitality toothbrush began making weird whirring sounds. The part of the head which does the rotating had gotten loose! Considering each head is around $5, I am so disappointed. Hopefully, this is but a defect.</li>
            <li> I really like my electric tooth brush,  and these re-fills do the job, but I brush a lot, so I have to keep buying them, and I feel the cost is high.  Other then that very good.</li>
            <li> Kind of cumbersome, but it does the job. More so my mistake for trying something new. Not bad, but could be better. Came on time and was done the right way. Thanks!</li>
            <li> The three-pack of these brushes are a good buy.  Individually they cost considerably more.  Also, I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding them in any stores so this solves that problem.</li>
            <li> These brushes replacement brushes work great!! I change mine every three months. They are great for the gum line. I have been using the Oral B for  25 years, I can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li> It is an excellent attachment to my Oral B toothbrush.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  Minimizes the trips to the dentist to get my teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li> This is my mom&#x27;s preferred brush head.  I purchased Oral B 3000 for her last year and she likes the electric brush idea, however, out of all brush heads it came with, she would only use the Dual Clean one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said that she enjoys how this brush head makes her teeth feel very clean, so I am happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought aftermarket Dual Clean heads and they worked well, but when Amazon had a sale on the original ones, I bought them too.</li>
            <li> The main reason I order this from Amazon is for convenience.  When I started using a power toothbrush, I visited several retailers and could not find these or they were out of stock.  Very frustrating.  Also, the 3-pak option is very convenient and saves money.</li>
            <li> I tried this as a normal replacement head and found I enjoyed using my OralB toothbrush again.  Would recommend the Power Toothbrush Head for anyone who wants a robust tooth cleaning experience.</li>
            <li> These refills were relatively simple to find but I was a bit apprehensive that they might not fit my toothbrush however, they turned out to be a perfect match.  It took a little more time to be delivered than was the norm but they did finally arrive a few weeks later.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Be sure to order replacement heads from Amazon with FREE shipping. Keep several brush heads in stock to replace every 3 months or when color begins to fade from brush. Fewer cavities, reduced tartar and plaque, healthier gums, fresher breath! Great system.</li>
            <li> Brushes are larger than expected but work well</li>
            <li> Items didn&#x27;t fit my product.  Some problems with return/refund. Merchant finally made things right.  Bottom Line- Buy stuff like this in a physical store.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush after doing quite a bit of research. Several other people in my family had and loved it. Best brush for the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> New Oral Toothbrush arrived pormptly and works perfectly. I get great values from Amazon and hardly ever have to pay shipping fees. Thanks Amazon DBM</li>
            <li> all you need for a replacement</li>
            <li> Original replacement brushes and just what I needed. Seller shipped promptly and&lt;br /&gt;would recommend.</li>
            <li> Good quality and purchased for a good price. The price went up so I bought some generic ones that are ok but not of the same quality.</li>
            <li> I was ordering replacement heads for my oral b and I tried these. I find them too hard on my gums and would not purchase again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using oral B electric toothbrush for 2 years, and I am very pleased with the results during my dentist visits.</li>
            <li> replacements for oral B electric tooth brushes.&lt;br /&gt;excellent. stay away from generic replacements.</li>
            <li> Good brush heads. Wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> as described&lt;br /&gt;BRAUN &#x3D; ORAL B&lt;br /&gt;I did not know that</li>
            <li> will only use the name brand brushes after trying the generic and having my lip get pinched by the flimsy construction of the generic.</li>
            <li> What else can I say, besides I went to my dentist and she said, \\&quot;Wow, those are some clean teeth. Electric toothbrush?\\&quot; And I answered, \\&quot;Why yes, it&#x27;s the Oral B DualAction Premium Power Toothbrush Head that cleaned these babies!\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> If my Oral B had a flaw, it was that the brush head was a little on the small side.  This corrects that problem and really adds a lot of cleaning and gum massaging to the brush action.  Worth the little extra money, but do note that the brush is over twice as big with this addition...if you like the small size of the other head, this might be too much.</li>
            <li> THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR ORIGINAL ORAL B REPLACEMENT BRUSH HEADS. THEY SHAKE GREAT FOR A WONDERFUL CLEANING OF THE TEETH AND GUMS.</li>
            <li> oral-b dual clean tooth brushes for oral-b electric tooth brush[[ASIN:B000NRUYEC Oral-B Vitality Power Dual Clean Rechargeable Tooth Brush - 1 ea]]</li>
            <li> Been using this for several years.  Brush usually last me about 5 months.  Works better than a manual toothbrush</li>
            <li> What can you say.  These work, and they&#x27;re easy to change out.  I&#x27;m not the handiest person in the world, but I read a review that they didn&#x27;t have instructions, but seriously they&#x27;re not necessary.  Pants don&#x27;t have instructions either, but millions of people figure out how to put them on every day.</li>
            <li> I did love these brush heads at first, but after time, not so much.  Takes less time to brush my teeth but does not thoroughly clean, especially the back and in between.&lt;br /&gt;Price is rather steep too...would be nice if the \\&quot;razor blade theory\\&quot; company would stop raping consumers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good cleanings since I started using the oral b.  Won&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> I have tried 3 other versions of the Oral-B replacement brush heads.  I really like the standard brushes and even the whitening/polishing version so I was hesitant to try this one especially after reading that others thought this was too big and bulky to for their mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, this is the same size as a typical brush head and it is awesome!  This is not intended to be brushed with like a normal toothbrush, however.  Just glide it slowly along your teeth and gums.  My teeth have never felt this clean.</li>
            <li> Love using it, I used this dual head cleaning for years, and I stopped using it because I couldn&#x27;t find it no more.  Later on, I found this one from Amazon again, and I ordered it.</li>
            <li> We have been using these for several years now.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and help keep teeth tar free with gentle dual action cleaning.</li>
            <li> These are a great replacement for the original brush heads that came with my oral-b professional brush handle. May feel a little bulky compared to the originals though. They also seem to break-in pretty fast which may be good for some people and bad for others. It didn&#x27;t take long before it felt the brush head that I just replaced. I wish they made them at a more reasonable price even though it still does its job pretty well.</li>
            <li> We purchased these brushes along with the Triumph station. These brushes are great (which along with the Triumph electric handle make a great tooth brushing experience). We will probably buy these over and over until something new comes up and our dentist recommends it.</li>
            <li> My oral-B toothbrush has been around for years and is still going strong.  The problem has become finding the correct replacement brushes since new generations have come along; problem solved!</li>
            <li> What can I say? They work</li>
            <li> these items fit my toothbrush and work quite well.  They do a great job and my dentist recommends it.  I&#x27;m sure I&lt;br /&gt;will be ordering them again.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, but my fault for not looking at the picture.  Usable, so they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> I love my Oral-B toothbrush and I loved it even more once I found these refills for it!  While I had gotten used to just the small, round head (and my regular dental check-ups have been better since I began using it!), I think that this head does an even better job.  It still has the spinning round head, but next to it is a head that makes it more standard toothbrush shape and size that moves back and forth.  I feel like I&#x27;m getting twice the cleaning every time I brush.</li>
            <li> This particular toothbrush head fits the old Braun electric toothbrush that I own.  The head&#x27;s last a long time and the dual action is just what I need to clean and help remove plaque.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush heads clean well and last at least if not more than 3 months. The pack of 3 is great.</li>
            <li> Great product and makes my teeth feel clean and refreshed after brushing. Just wish the price point was better and with in even, not odd count.</li>
            <li> Love the multirush action.</li>
            <li> These heads clean my teeth wonderfully, they easily reach the back of my mouth without being too bulky. These make my teeth feel cleaner than the regular heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my oral b vitality toothbrush for years now and replace the heads every 2 months.  These heads do a great job at getting down between teeth and into the gumline, and with regular flossing my mouth is always fresh and clean.  I&#x27;ve tried a few generic versions of these replacement heads and was not happy with them at all.  They constantly had bristles coming out while brushing leaving them stuck between my teeth.  This was very annoying.  Thankfully I&#x27;ve never had this problem with this brand.  Definitely a recommended buy from me</li>
            <li> Great product. 5 stars for this. You can buy it with out any worries. Than you. Great product. 5 stars for this. You can buy it with out any worries. Than you. I purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush refills at reasonable price.  Get toothbrushes for a year for $30.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery is fast and the product is not a knock off of the original product.</li>
            <li> This was jus the brush head we were looking for.  The stores kept being out of it. I&#x27;m glad we were able to find it here.</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected but works really well.</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads are great--much better than the one with only one head.  I can&#x27;t but believe that they get your teeth considerably cleaner and in less time.</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this product any higher.  It&#x27;s a life changer.  I used the single headed brush Oral B and I have used other electric toothbrushes.  They worked okay.  This toothbrush leaves my teeth like I just left the dentist every day.  My dentists visits are shorter than ever and there is practically nothing for them to remove.  My gums are in better shape, it really is the best toothbrush.  My fiance also started using it instead of her old electric brush and she hasn&#x27;t switched back.  She admits this is superior.  I think this is the best toothbrush out there based on my experience using electrics over the last 20 years or so.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and the price incentive was an added feature.  I will also shop here for replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying the same replacement heads I already had but these have a second moving brush behind the front round brush. I liked my original brush head because it had multiple types and density of bristles within the one head. The front head of this one is smooth cylinder head. Each replacement brush is different but both are WONDERFUL AND BOTH DESERVE 5+ STARS. I could never go back to a manual brush or even a electric brush that simply has one smooth round brush. These brushes do a fantastic job!</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement brush. No complaints at all. I love the dual actiona plus the timer on my brush. It saved me money as well!</li>
            <li> I could not find these in any local store.  I really like the toothbrush these go with.  I am extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> i love these bestter than the softer ones these are perfect thestiffnessnot too soft not too stiffperfect dtiffness to me</li>
            <li> timely delivery of an excellent product</li>
            <li> I have oral b electronic toothbrush and need to buy refills every once a while. These refills are good deals on Amazon and do good job cleaning my teeth!</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes a long time.  It is great for my gums.</li>
            <li> Bought these by mistake.  Did not mean to get the Dual heads.  At first, they seemed really big in my mouth.  Now I have gotten used to the size (and the bottom head does vibrate), but I will still get the single head next time.</li>
            <li> I was leery of the shape at first, but after one brushing, I&#x27;m hooked!  The teeth are much slicker compared to the standard round head after brushing.  The head is bigger, but the round part can reach hard spots.</li>
            <li> 2 out of the 3 replacement brush heads were damaged, the plastic was crushed and broke. I was not able to use them and feel like i wasted $16 for just ONE working brush head</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s funny to leave a review for a toothbrush replacement head, but this one is really great. I bought an assortment pack with a half dozen heads and didn&#x27;t get to the dual action brush for a while. Then, when I finally tried the dual action head it slowed the toothbrush down so much that I thought it burned it out. Turned out the battery needed a charge and the dual brush was simply too much. After a recharge I was really impressed. Now my only complaint is that I have a half dozen new single head brushes around that weren&#x27;t cheap. And I can&#x27;t see going back.</li>
            <li> its a &amp;#34; BIG &amp;#34; brush head , only got this because of the price and was curious.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure the bottom brush works as well as the round one</li>
            <li> Simply the very best tooth brush available.</li>
            <li> Good product. Hope my mom love it.</li>
            <li> So these are exactly what they say they are--replacement heads. They fit my Oral B electric toothbrush (which I love) just fine and work just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Dual Clean Brush for years and am quite partial to it over single head brushes.  The dual action cleans your teeth and massages gums with just the right amount of pressure.</li>
            <li> I love the dual heads on these brushs. It works for me.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe that I&#x27;d find exactly the replacements I wanted at a price I wanted. How to rate the product? Well, if I didn&#x27;t love the Oral B I wouldn&#x27;t have been in hot pursuit of replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> A very good price on a great product, and by using Amazon&#x27;s subscription service I never run out. These are clearly superior to the heads provided with the brush as purchased.</li>
            <li> Original quality Oral-B, not a cheap generic.  Well made and holds up for the tradional three months-plus before needing to change.  Still a bit pricey but still one of the best prices around for a 3-pack.</li>
            <li> I like the up and down action on these, along with the circular action of the tip.  Fits my Oral B Precision Clean Battery toothbrush, too.</li>
            <li> Such a great price for these.  I didn&#x27;t see any store who could meet or beat their price.</li>
            <li> These replacements heads are hard to find locally.  This product fits our Oral B electric tooth brush vitality version.&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
            <li> Very thorough cleaning brush, it&#x27;s very effective but it didn&#x27;t fit the head I was originally shopping for. I did a search for a different style but I am very happy that this brush came up, it was a huge step up from the old Ora brush!</li>
            <li> My dentist often ask if I whiten my teeth.  To which I reply no, I just use my Oral-B brush twice a day.  This is a great brush head and I have used it for the past several years.  Delivery was on time and I will order this product again.</li>
            <li> My teeth are as clean as they have ever been thanks to Oral-B</li>
            <li> Good price, works well.</li>
            <li> too big for normal mouth!</li>
            <li> The price is right, and they work great. Much less expensive than the comparable drugstore price for the replacement brush heads.q</li>
            <li> ive tried several of the different heads for my brush but this one, the dualaction, is my favorite. it is a little bigger than the regular one, but i think it cleans my teeth a little bitter. it took a few days to get used to it, but its worth it ive been using them for almost a year now.</li>
            <li> My wife and I bought this 3 pack to replace the aging brush heads on our rechargeable Oral-B toothbrushes.  I like the replacement brush, but my wife does not.  I think that the larger brush head and rigid bristles are great for me, but my wife prefers the gentler bristle brush heads that originally came with the tooth brush.</li>
            <li> This brush head cleans very well.  I have purchased this item before and liked it.  However, it is hard to find any more in stores.  I was happy to find it on line and at a very good price.</li>
            <li> These, like all of Oral-B&#x27;s replacement heads, are very nice and reasonably-priced. I bought them to replace my Deep Sweep heads, and they have worked quite well so far (they cover slightly more area overall, and certainly with more focus on dents).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally like the Deep Sweep heads better, for they allow you a bit more control. These Dual Clean ones, being quite a bit larger, clean marginally better but give you less room to clean spots you think are necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good build quality, good functionality, and overall very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> fits our electric toothbrush like a glove...</li>
            <li> Love these new brushes.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are super. They fit exactly on my hand piece. I am so happy they are interchangeable. I think this is the second set I bought from this company. Stay around I will be looking for a replacement to my electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> These Oral-B Professional Dual Clean replacement heads work very well as expected and have a relatively long and useful service life.</li>
            <li> Super brushes! But what else you&#x27;d expect from Oral-B.</li>
            <li> It works fine with 5000 series.&lt;br /&gt;However, one of them already went bad.&lt;br /&gt;There are two moving parts on the head, one round and another on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom one just came loose and fell off.&lt;br /&gt;The original head was slightly different and never had any issue except getting old and brushes needed replacement.</li>
            <li> These are a steal compared to the retail cost in stores.  These are really great and not compromised at all.  I bought these as a gift to go into a men&#x27;s toiletry bag with other items and he loves them.  Been using them for a month and no trouble whatsoever!  I was thrilled to get such a bargain.  Thanks!  :)</li>
            <li> My hubby loves these things.He doesn&#x27;t use anything else. This is the only toothbrush and toothbrush head for him,period.</li>
            <li> The Oral B replacement heads fit my toothbrush. I like the way my teeth and gums feel as the brush heads clean and floss my teeth They are soft enough that they don&#x27;t hurt my gums and firm enough to reach the places where food likes to hide and remove it.</li>
            <li> We love these and the toothbrush. My husband used to have an expensive sonicare and found this to get his teeth more clean. I&#x27;ve been using for 10 years and have always received praise from my dentist over how clean my teeth are.</li>
            <li> Original parts original performance. This is the original one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others reviewers I tried the cheap aftermarket copies. Which just do not work.&lt;br /&gt;Avoid cheap knock off.</li>
            <li> My toothbrush is a Brain. When I requested Braun irak-B kept popping up. I didn&#x27;t realize it was the same. It works perfectly!</li>
            <li> The yellow bristles help to give a bit more firmness to the bristles on these brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;They work exactly as how I would imagine Oral B products to be.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are reasonably priced and they do not fall apart!</li>
            <li> I always though electric toohbrushes were for suckers with too much money. How could a gizmo really make brushing my teeth a significantly better experience?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I&#x27;ve put my cynical ways behind me after trying these for a few months. They really really do work as advertised! My mouth feels cleaner and I&#x27;m not putting nearly as much stress on my gums as I do with a normal toothbrush. And as I&#x27;ve recently learned, heavy brushing with a conventional toothbrush can wear down the gums and expose a part of the tooth that&#x27;s not supposed to be exposed, causing issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These vibrating spinny brushes get your mouth clean without being so harsh on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a cheapskate, I never thought I&#x27;d like the idea of paying more for toothbrushes. But they are absolutely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> See my review for the other type of brush head. Both work fine on my porcelain implant bridges. I would order these again when these wear out.</li>
            <li> Great ,it look good and beautiful</li>
            <li> After getting my first electric toothbrush, my only qualm was that the brush head was so small. Being a notoriously hard brusher, the tiny round default brush just didn&#x27;t seem like enough clean. Enter, the dual clean brush head. It feels much more substantial, and although it may not offer more cleaning power, it does offer peace of mind. Another added advantage is that it is much better for brushing your tongue.</li>
            <li> I love my oral b electric tooth brush. It works just as well as the really expensive electric tooth brushes. Always buy my replacement tooth brush heads here on Amazon. They arrive as expected and time. Pleased with the order each time</li>
            <li> My local big chain store no longer carries this product and I wasn&#x27;t sure if the heads would fit my model of Oral-B electric toothbrush but, hooray, they do.</li>
            <li> Have been using these for years.  Love em.  No complaints from dentists either.</li>
            <li> Good price. I always found the name brand replacements heads to be much better quality than the generic ones.</li>
            <li> Factory oral b replacement brush head. I have had my triumph for going on 6 years, so it is top notch.</li>
            <li> Perfect price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> These do what they are meant to do. If you like this review, hit the button</li>
            <li> My kids prefer these brushes over some others they have used.  They feel it gets their teeth cleaner and use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for my Braun Oral B with 2 minute timerAA batteries. Seems the replacement heads at my grocery store are about as much as the entire device. Comparatively, this was a good price for three heads. I&#x27;ve been visiting the same dentist for over 15 years, and to have two hygienists note &amp;#34;your gums are beautiful and healthy&amp;#34;.. and...  6 months later &amp;#34; the least amount of work I&#x27;ve had to do&amp;#34; speaks well for the brush. Less time in the chair and the dentist saying &amp;#34;whatever you are doing, keep it up&amp;#34; is all I need to be convinced.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, these brush heads are a bit large, and so far on 2/2 of them the lower brush head has loosened providing a nice gap for my tongeue/cheek to get pinched in. I do like the dual head movement though.</li>
            <li> I think these brush heads are one of the best ways to keep your teeth clean on a daily basis . . . my dental hygienist said my teeth were in great shape. The brush heads last a good while as well.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this brush head was when we bought a refill pack that included 1 of these brush heads and a couple of the small round brush heads. As soon as I tried this shape, I was hooked! I hate the little, tiny circle brush heads! I have to do so much brushing to get my teeth clean. I feel like I am cleaning my teeth with a Q-tip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these brush heads are perfect. There is still the small, rotating brush head that gives the \\&quot;dentist inspired\\&quot; tooth-by-tooth cleaning. BUT, this brush also gives the extra cleaning power of the stationary brushes on the bottom. When you are moving the toothbrush back &amp; forth, you are always giving your teeth additional cleaning because of this brush design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We now order these heads because I will only use these. They are harder to find than the small round head replacements, but it is worth it to order them here! My teeth definitely are more clean after using this brush head!</li>
            <li> I tried the off brand replacement brush heads but they just are nothing like the original Oral B replacement brushes.  These are great and I will not try anthing else again.</li>
            <li> I have a larger mouth, so the size of these brush heads doesn&#x27;t bother me. They leave my teeth feeling cleaner than my traditional brush and I&#x27;m seeing an improvement in the amount of debris when I floss. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I ordered this once and its the EXACT same product that Oral B Sells. AND CHEAPER! I highly recommend! Dont go to the store, but it here!</li>
            <li> The replacement heads were received and are performing as I would expect them (it) to perform just like the original one performed. I will definitely re-order as the need arises.</li>
            <li> Currently it&#x27;s better pricing than you&#x27;ll find at Sam&#x27;s. The tooth brush heads are LARGE. I was suprised. I&#x27;m used the regular heads and thought &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34; when I saw these available. Well I won&#x27;t be buying them again because they are too large for my mouth, though the quality is just fine.</li>
            <li> These have a larger coverage area than the floss brush, but they don&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling as slick and clean as the floss heads do.. also, the first time I ordered them, I was sent a completely different type of brush head.. amazon re-shipped the correct type.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Dual clean brush head cleans my teeth really well. My mouth feels better after using it , and feels cleaner longer..</li>
            <li> These are good OEM replacement brush heads that fit perfectly in the toothbrush I have.  The bristles fade and change color to white when it&#x27;s time to replace them.  Using this toothbrush feels like its working much better than a manual brush and is easier too.  The heads do wear down a little quickly and I have seen generic heads available for cheaper but I&#x27;m unsure on their quality.  I am sticking with these OEM solid replacements.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, these are good quality replacement brush heads but they&#x27;re too big and bulky. Awkward to brush with and the size/design creates an excessive draw on the electric toothbrush battery. I will continue to use these until they need to be replaced, but I&#x27;ll definitely buy the standard size brush heads next time.</li>
            <li> very effective and do the job as well and better than most head types for this unit. Have already placed reord</li>
            <li> First of all, my product was authentic and I&#x27;m not disappointed in the quality. However, the brush head is huge and honestly designed for larger mouths. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone with a petite mouth use this as their primary toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> Although a bit more expensive, the Oral B replacements are well worth the money.  Previously I had bought the generic version, what a joke...they fell apart after a few weeks.  Go for the real deal! These last 10 times longer!</li>
            <li> I like Oral-B Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head very much. I enjoy it twice a day for about 2 years and never had any trouble Once, while traveling, I used it 14 days without recharge. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Great product,super fast shipping,AWESOME price.  To those who keep whining about the wrapper?  Pay retail; $22.00 and keep your precious, quality wrapper.  For me I&#x27;m happy to get a solid product and toss the wrapping.  morons.</li>
            <li> Received correct product in time stated.&lt;br /&gt;Much easier shopping on line, many stores did&lt;br /&gt;not have this product.  Buy enough 3 packs and&lt;br /&gt;shipping is free.&lt;br /&gt;A good deal</li>
            <li> This was  shipped in an envelope and one of the brush packages was crushed open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need to use something a little more substantial for shipping.</li>
            <li> Did not use the toothbrush heads from this shipment yet, but I bought the replacement heads b4 and they are great.</li>
            <li> The bigger the package of replacement brushes that you buy the better the price. The color code rings work well to keep his and hers identified.</li>
            <li> A good bargain and the right kind which I couldn&#x27;t find in a store.</li>
            <li> These and the FlossAction heads are my favorites.  These heads cover more brushing surface area and last longer than other heads.  In fact, they&#x27;ve been lasting twice longer than my other heads in my experience.  Therefore, I will keep buying these Dual heads.</li>
            <li> Love this brush head.  Didn&#x27;t even know this type was available.</li>
            <li> This is the only place I can find the brushes for my Oral-B.  My local stores do not carry the older brushes.</li>
            <li> I love these brush heads; i feel they reach all the corners in my mouth. I am always satisfied after brushing using this kind of brush head.</li>
            <li> These are great refills for a great toothbrush!</li>
            <li> If you have an electric toothbrush, you eventually need to replace the brushes.  I like the dual clean because they brush a wider area for the same amount of time and do a better job for those of us who need an electric toothbrush to get our teeth clean.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B electric tooth brush replacements arrived safely and are fine.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Use twice a day...good</li>
            <li> Eck.  These heads are huge . . . to large to use!  It&#x27;s pointless having two cleaning surfaces if they can&#x27;t actually reach teeth.  The ones that are &amp;#34;rotating&amp;#34; only, and the &amp;#34;Professional Deep Sweep are far better . . . the first is the most compact and cleans well, the 2nd is my preferred head for the Oral-B&#x27;s and the one I&#x27;ll buy consistently.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old small brush heads with these Dual Clean brushes and i love them. It feels like they clean twice as good as the old type.</li>
            <li> popped it on, brushed away!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for in life!  This product is what you want for replacement.  You teeth will be happy that you bought these.  Much cheaper than my local Walmart which was 2 for 19.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have these on a recurring order and love that they are sent just when you need to replace the old ones.  I really believe my teeth are in better shape because of using an electric toothbrush and Oral-B makes the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been liking the ease and speed of getting my teeth clean, and my dentist has been liking the results.</li>
            <li> Close to $8 per brush head... seems expensive. But if you like using electric toothbrush, then this one is one of the best for sure.</li>
            <li> I have pretty much tried all the replacements for the Oral-B professional, and I have to say that this product is mediocre. I would recommend the floss Action one!</li>
            <li> Love these replacement brushes. Was using the ones that came with the product. I love these.</li>
            <li> Everyone in the household had a dramatic drop in dental work at exactly the same time we started using electric tooth brushes and, in particular the dual clean brush heads.</li>
            <li> This brush head is actually too big and I don&#x27;t feel it get into the tight&lt;br /&gt;spots like the smaller heads.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;This will be the easiest cleaning you will ever have\\&quot;. Apparently using this brush and my oral pik my gums are in great condition. At my age it is good to hear good news. If you are serious about your teeth I highly recommend you buy these and brush for two minutes. Don&#x27;t cut corners it is much better having your own teeth.</li>
            <li> I love the dual action of this brush...round and back and forth. I think this gives the best &amp;#34;attention&amp;#34; to each tooth instead of just a swirl of the single head.</li>
            <li> If you have not used these double brushes it is time you give your teeth the rush. It is great having all directions working off the plaque. I like to switch with each brush change from this style to the original style.  The price was the same as Wallmart.</li>
            <li> This product met my expectations to the fullest.  It was exactly what I wanted and works perfectly!  I&#x27;d definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item because my dental hygenist recommended it....I am glad I took her advice...Really cleans well...Easy to keep charged...Price at Amazon is much lower then local stores...Only con is that replacement heads are expensive,,,but can be found at a reasonable price at various Amazon vendors....I think this item is much better manual brushing.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the Oral B brand.  I&#x27;ve been using the electric toothbrushes and brush heads for over 15 years.  Consistent use of these brushes does help to keep my dental bill low.  Thanks Oral B for making wonderful products for oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and the price was fabulous.  The item was shipped and arrived at my home in a timely manner.  Great service. Great toothbrush refills.</li>
            <li> A little difficult to maneuver into the corners of mouth and behind the molar teeth.&lt;br /&gt;But since larger area is covered, the whole \\&quot;brush your teeth\\&quot; takes less time than with Floss Action or Prowhite brush head refills.</li>
            <li> Smaller heads are better and easier to use. This is fine, but I wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
            <li> These fit perfectly and work like little champions!</li>
            <li> Love the dual clean brushes.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and half the price that CVS had it.</li>
            <li> Love the dual heads ~ teeth feel very clean.  No issues with this product and price was competitive.</li>
            <li> Perfect replace tooth brush, what else would you expected to buy from Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time.  Always good.</li>
            <li> Not as efficient as it suppose to. But work decent.</li>
            <li> Appear to be real, but not nearly as good as the smaller floss heads. The Dual heads just aren&#x27;t as powerful and make it more difficult to reach a lot of places. In my experience, your money is better spent on the floss brushes.</li>
            <li> A great compliment to the Oral-B Precision Black 7000 Rechargeable Unit and the brush head that I needed.</li>
            <li> I really like this little brush, but one needs to be careful in buying replacement heads as there are several kinds available that will not work. I bought the unit because it needs only a couple of AA batteries which are easily replaced, unlike most rechargeable units which are kaput when the batteries fail to hold a charge.</li>
            <li> The head-size of these is a little large, but they&#x27;re just right in terms of softness (closer to soft than medium, but still sturdy enough that my teeth feel smooth and clean after each brushing).  These fit my Oral-B electric toothbrush properly and I have been very satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The only kind I use.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. The replacements are easy to change. My teeth feel as clean as when I get out of the dentist&#x27;s office after a professional cleaning. The timer is a great function.</li>
            <li> got these for my husband who does not like the regular small round brushes on electric toothbrushes.  he wanted something shaped more like a regular toothbrush. found these at a much better price than any place locally.  after using these, he loves his electric toothbrush and will not use anything else.  he says they have even made a difference in his dentist visits.  i have not tried these myself, but he recommends them.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t disappoint us at all!</li>
            <li> After trying one of these Dual Clean Replacement Brushes for about 6 weeks, I was sorry!  My receding gums, caused by periodontal disease, had become more distressed.  Now that I am using the Gentle brush heads, prescribed by my periodontist, the receding has subsided.  There should be a warning label.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery and the correct product.</li>
            <li> Works as intended. Always go with electronic tooth brushes since they will reduce plaque better than regular tooth brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These heads are pretty hardy, one can last me for at least over 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> Works well with the sonic also. That&#x27;s what I have and they fit fine.</li>
            <li> Just what I need for replacement.</li>
            <li> They last a long time, do a thorought cleaning.</li>
            <li> Seems like these replacement head wear out sooner than the one&#x27;s that come with the brush. I did not time them exactly. just an approximation.. But other than that they work fine.</li>
            <li> I used to have a Sonicare, but switched over to Oral-B because Oral-B&#x27;s electric toothbrushes seemed just as good (and actually, I prefer Oral-B now), and the replacement toothbrush heads are considerably cheaper as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried just about every available replacement toothbrush for my Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 (yes, I know it&#x27;s a ridiculously long name, but hey, I didn&#x27;t come up with it). The Dual Clean, along w/ the Floss Action replacement heads, are my favorite. Whereas the regular Oral-B heads are kinda small, the Dual Clean heads are large enough to feel like you&#x27;re brushing your entire tooth (instead of section by section).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it&#x27;s an even better deal if you can catch on sale, or as part of Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;Subscribe &amp; Save\\&quot; program (if you REALLY like brushing your teeth).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if these are the original Oral-B brand or not but after a week of usage the bristle started to fall out as I&#x27;m brushing my teeth. Either that these were just defective.</li>
            <li> It is impossible too get these brushes in our local stores now.  These arenexactly lik eournoriginal ones.  We were pleased with the product and never have a problem with them fitting on our brush base.</li>
            <li> I love these brush heads. My teeth feel super clean afterward. I find that the small brush heads just don&#x27;t work as well as these dual clean brush heads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, but the head is larger than I expected.  If you need a compact toothbrush head, definitely not the product for you.</li>
            <li> I will keep using the Oral B replacements I have been using for several years. They have been practical and have made economic sense to me. I strongly recommend the system Oral B and these replacements</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no issues with these brush heads. I will repurchase. I have an Oral B Vitality electric toothbrush, and they snap on perfect.</li>
            <li> It works great, but the cost is too much. I wish it could be cheaper.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are hard to find in the store. These were a great price and fit my Oral B brush perfectly!</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes will last me 6 to 8 weeks for each brush, but, the package MUST say &amp;#34;Made in Germany by Braun&amp;#34;. If you buy the brushes made in China you might get 2 weeks usage from each brush.</li>
            <li> seems like they are little hard than the original one that I had. But works great</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and price.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed and was much cheaper than I could ever find in a store.</li>
            <li> Cleans twice as much surface area!</li>
            <li> We love these brush heads! They do such a through job on our teeth.</li>
            <li> What I can say? It was exactly what I was looking for. There is no otheer alternative to that pruduct</li>
            <li> This brush head seems to do a more thorough job at cleaning than the regular smaller ones. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Hss 2 brush heads and it works OK, but not as good as the Prowhite brush head.  I tried several heads and the Prowhite head is by far the best.</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads are exactly what my wife wanted and are a good value for the price compared to discount store prices</li>
            <li> I realize you don&#x27;t need to replace your brush head very often but it&#x27;s also had to accept paying nearly 4-5 times the value to get official heads over the knock-off. With that said they are of great quality and do last a long time, both in build and cleanliness.</li>
            <li> These work well with my electric toothbrush.  I prefer a full-size head and this provides what I need.  I only wish it cost less per unit.</li>
            <li> The heads arrived quickly and are just like what you will find in your local Walgreens or Costco but for a lot less. It is a three pack so each head should last 3 months. Its good value but if you want to save more go for the larger packages. I like how the dual head feels vs. the regular one. They run for almost the same price so it should be worth it. I will most likely re-order these when i finish.</li>
            <li> These are OK. I do find them a bit bulky for brushing. They probably do clean a little better, but I am not sure how much compared to the original brushes.</li>
            <li> I love the feel that my Oral-B toothbrush leaves my teeth and these brushes are the main reason. In my opinion they are well worth the cost. I am not sure how they are technically supposed to last but I am able to get a good two months out of each brush.</li>
            <li> when I bought this I thought the size was big for the size of my mouth , but it turned to an excellent size and very good performance</li>
            <li> Got to maintain those pearly whites and these replacement brushes are doning the trick. The larger size equates to better cleaning for our house.</li>
            <li> I prefer the original sized brush head. This one seems to be too much brush for me. I don&#x27;t feel I have as much control as I had with the smaller brush head.</li>
            <li> The heads did not fit my oral-B toothbrush although the ordering description inferred that it fit &#x27;most&#x27; units.  Unfortunatetly, the ordering match-up was not clear, so I will put the items in the &#x27;bak drawer&#x27;.</li>
            <li> What more can I say... great product at a much better price than even the discount stores.  Free shipping when you do the recuring purchase option too!</li>
            <li> Product was as advertised, shipped quickly, and was packaged nicely.  These heads are much better than the smaller ones and cheaper on Amazon than Walmart.</li>
            <li> I got the brush heads a couple days after I ordered it. Its a great product and I will order more brush heads from the seller.</li>
            <li> I had been using the floss action brush head which is very effective.  With the flossing action brush one can feel the slim rubber tabs getting in between your teeth.  Of course this does not eliminate actual flossing but the brush does clean well.  I bought the dual clean as the brush has dual heads and thus twice the brushing area.  It does an effective job for me and it is definitely better than a manual brush.  However, I don&#x27;t think it is quite as good as the flossing action brush which I give 5 stars thus the 4 star rating for the dual clean.</li>
            <li> Simply put, these brush heads are great! They have single-handedly decreased our dentist bill more than anything else we&#x27;ve done, even when you don&#x27;t brush for the entire two minutes (of course we do, but... well, you know... just in case you don&#x27;t...) *wink, wink* For the member of our family with the bad teeth genes (we won&#x27;t say who they are), he went from having cavities almost every visit to being commended by his dentist on how good his teeth looked. I highly recommend these to anyone that would rather not have a mouth full of silver (or those fancy white ones!).</li>
            <li> Good quality&lt;br /&gt;Good functions&lt;br /&gt;........ price... you know what I want to say...&lt;br /&gt;After all, it is not expensive when comparing to the one sold in supermarkets.</li>
            <li> Great item and received quickly.  I&#x27;ll order again in the future...</li>
            <li> This model brush more than met my expectations. I have a relatively old power handle, but these brushes fit it perfectly and perform as advertised. It feels much better in action than the old, single circular brush; I think it&#x27;s doing a better job of cleaning, too. I would recommend it to any Oral B users.</li>
            <li> Does the job great, and at a great discount. I got the three head to last me a while but its a perfect replacement. I have the Oral-B Vitality and it fits great.</li>
            <li> The heads of our Oral-B toothbrushes were worn; my husband&#x27;s had stopped rotating, and mine was pretty pathetic, and he had gone to the extent of buying a new one for himself.  Upon reading the instructions, we discovered that replacement heads were available.  Oh, happy day!  It solved all of my problems with my toothbrush, and we gave the new toothbrush handle and a new head to our youngest son.  Great item at a good price.</li>
            <li> I bought these because in the description is lists the types of brushes it fits, and one of them is the Pulsonic.  It turns out that it does not fit the Pulsonic.  I did not try to return because someone in our family has a toothbrush that it does fit, but we still need brush heads for our Pulsonics.</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads are great! Get my teeth really clean. Great price! I have used these before. The retail store price is higher than Amazon&#x27;s price. Great deal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; on these.&lt;br /&gt;They may clean better?  Can&#x27;t tell.  What I can tell is that it&#x27;s WAY bigger than the standard &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; round head, and I can tell no difference in layman&#x27;s use other than it eats up battery life twice as fast.&lt;br /&gt;Considering the flossing heads already took me to a level where my dentist thought I floss daily (I try to, but don&#x27;t.) I don&#x27;t see where this is an improvement in dental hygiene, and it definitely is a downgrade in performance of the battery/handle.  (It cuts battery life roughly in half, and also seems to run slower, you can hear it slowing down oscillations.  I tried using them on one brand-new handle, one that&#x27;s been used for a few months, and one that is my standard and I&#x27;ve been using for 7 years or so.)</li>
            <li> Great price with the auto reorder.  Delivered quickly.  Great product....works perfectly.  I&#x27;m a repeat buyer.  Tried purchasing on line elsewhere and was not satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li> The dual clean brush heads are my families favorite and the deal Amazon had on these was the cheapest I have seen even with using coupons as I am a coupon fanatic.</li>
            <li> these are perfect for my Braun and love the dual brush head.  Much better than the single head brush one.</li>
            <li> Some women might find that these toothbrush heads are too big for their mouth. They also didn&#x27;t seem to clean as well as the smaller, round heads...possibly because, due to the larger size, it&#x27;s a little awkward trying to reach some areas (the back teeth, for instance). These also had a tendency to try to slip off my toothbrush. I&#x27;ve tried a few different Oral-B heads, and so far the Prowhite heads are my favorite:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Oral-B-Professional-Prowhite-Replacement-Brush/dp/B0002KHTG6/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1420568867&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;oral-b+whitening+heads</li>
            <li> The head is long, so it is hard to get more than one of the two heads into flat contact with the teeth at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except to the molars, my jaw is curved, as I assume most are.  I had to develop an arm movement that would first put one of the heads against my teeth and then pivot the angle of my hand into my mouth to get the second head into contact with the same teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head closest to the hand can NOT be used on the back molars, at least not in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great idea, but needs to have the lower head (closest to the hand) kind of float.</li>
            <li> Good price.  Work great.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean. What else do you expect?</li>
            <li> Great checkups so brush must work well.</li>
            <li> Great price compared to Target.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat Amazon Subscribe and save. the 15% is better than any coupon I&#x27;d ever seen for my replacement heads.  So not only do I get my replacement heads conviently through the mail, but I also save more than getting them at, (dare I say it?), Walmart!</li>
            <li> No different than the original</li>
            <li> They cover more area than a single so it does a better job. It is amazing how nice your mouth feels and how your breath does not stink.</li>
            <li> Excellent as one would expect from Braun.  I&#x27;ve had the same Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush for years and just replace with new brush heads.  I absolutely love the dual clean over the standard single brush head style, which I have used for years.  I feel the dual clean gives me a more thorough clean with the 2 brushes working a larger area simultaneously.  I notice that when I floss after brushing with the dual clean there is scarcely any debris left between my teeth, if any at all.  Getting 3 for the price is also very economical.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels refreshed after using these.</li>
            <li> These are as advertised. No complaints about this product.</li>
            <li> After 1 month of normal use, the bottom part broke off and exposed a metal part. It cannot be popped back into place. I got stabbed twice with 2 different toothbrush head from the same pack. Yes there was blood. I know Oral-B is aware of this problem but I don&#x27;t understand why there&#x27;s no recall or any improvement with the design. So much for &#x27;quality&#x27; German product.</li>
            <li> They fit will and are easy to replace.</li>
            <li> These brush heads were a great price and fit my electric toothbrush perfectly.  I will definitely order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I really like these heads.  I love my electric toothbrush, but had been unable to find the dual brush heads.  Found them on Amazon and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!  I love these brush heads!  My mouth and teeth feel so clean!  The heads are bigger but I truly like the larger head as it seems to do so much more work than the smaller head. It feels good in my mouth as it massages my gums and I actually brush longer. I&#x27;m buying more to make sure I have a good supply in case Oral-B stops making them, buying some for my son too!</li>
            <li> and these heads clean it well. I like the size of them over the floss action heads and will keep using them. They are comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I like but 5 stars I love it is a wee bit too much!</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush for the price.  Bought one for the whole family and have had them for almost a year now.  No cavities!</li>
            <li> The best option. Not too big and does its job well.</li>
            <li> keeps my pearly whites simply shining</li>
            <li> Simple purchase and delivery, everything went as expected and advertised.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was described and a great brush head!</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than an new toothbrush. Best price around!</li>
            <li> I should have been using this product years ago it meets my expectations.</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads for our electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> These are great. Was looking for a head that was more regular toothbrush sized. This does it. Has the same small brush head action combined with the larger size I desired.</li>
            <li> I had both head separately from my 2-pack package.  Like both, and was not sure which one to buy.  Saw this, read good reviews, no brainer.  Happy, don&#x27;t feel big in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Way too big!! Bought these when we \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; to Oral-B from Sonicare and thought we would really like them since they are the same style of heads that we have been using for years. These are almost twice as big as the sonicare kind. We&#x27;re sticking to the original Oral-B ones.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  BEST quality for least $$.</li>
            <li> THE REFILLS ARE HARD TO FIND SO I WAS REALLY HAPPY TO SEE THAT YOU HAD THEM. I DIDN&#x27;T WANT TO HAVE TO CHANGE BRANDS.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper then retail!</li>
            <li> It does the job .&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it greatly to any one.</li>
            <li> Great product, the real thing for the right price, I&#x27;ll buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Quality is what I expect from Oral B.  I like buying these items on Amazon, as the price can&#x27;t be beat and I&#x27;m not stuck at a store wasting my time and buying a lot of things I don&#x27;t need.  Plus, it feels like Xmas to be opening a box, even if it&#x27;s just a toothbrush head refill.</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people complain about its big size and what not...but personally I didn&#x27;t face that problem at all -  - if anything, the big size is its biggest merit personally...I have this, the FlossAction and the Regular refill...yet I personally like this one the most&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for that is that its pretty much the closest to a traditional toothbrush considering its size...and since I&#x27;m \\&quot;extremely\\&quot; used to the regular toothbrushes, this serves as a good way to make the transition to the electric toothbrushes (besides I like the regular size toothbrushes anyways so this is automatically a better option for me than the others)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing which is very important for me is that since it has a bigger size, it allows more paste to be put onto it...this therefore, allows more paste to be used while brushing...frankly, the other size refills do a fairly good job as well, but I personally feel that I&#x27;m not using enough paste while brushing with them - this solves that problem since it uses almost double the amount&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then ofcourse we have the DualAction which one might consider the most important aspect of this refill...personally I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was actually making a difference as such - I simply use it as a normal toothbrush and the DualAction simply functions as a bonus - instead of something I genuinely care about...I do generate quite a bit of toothpaste goo...but I suppose that&#x27;s normal considering the continuous rotations of the toothbrush + the extra paste used in this refill compared to the other ones&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize the keypoints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;1) Large size makes for a traditional feel if you are making a transition from the regular toothbrushes to the electric ones&lt;br /&gt;2) Large size &#x3D; more paste being used&lt;br /&gt;3) Dualaction (could be considered an advantage for those who find it useful)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;1) More paste &#x3D; more goo&lt;br /&gt;2) The large size may not suit everyone as some might feel that the size is a little too big (I personally don&#x27;t...but I can imagine others feeling differently - it really depends on what size of toothbrushes you generally prefer I&#x27;d say - I  need a large size for example)&lt;br /&gt;3) Dualaction (i couldn&#x27;t really differentiate between the two functions while in use so I&#x27;m considering it a con - but it wasn&#x27;t something I genuinely cared about so it doesn&#x27;t affect my final rating)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that you really can&#x27;t go wrong regardless of which refill type you select - just as long you select an electric toothbrush in the first place (I could certainly tell a big difference between regular and electric toothbrushes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps! I&#x27;ll be sure to add more information if I find anything else worth consideringothers feeling differently - it really depends on what size of toothbrushes you generally prefer I&#x27;d say - I  need a large size for example)  3) Dualaction (i couldn&#x27;t really differentiate between the two functions while in use so I&#x27;m considering it a con - but it wasn&#x27;t something I genuinely cared about so it doesn&#x27;t affect my final rating)    Other than that you really can&#x27;t go wrong regardless of which refill type you select - just as long you select an electric toothbrush in the first place (I could certainly tell a big difference between regular and electric toothbrushes)    Hope this helps!

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for my oral-b vitality for years.  The color changes when it&#x27;s time to change the brush head and it spins in different directions. Leaves my teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement head for an Oral B electrical toothbrush, and I like these larger toothbrush heads since they clean the teeth better, well they work for me. This brush head vibrates and rotates to whisk away plaque.</li>
            <li> Works great, holds up well.  Decreased amount of plaque buildup on my teeth between dental visits.  Makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting a mouth massage.</li>
            <li> This brush is a little too big to feel comfortable, yet it works well, and I guess the point is to save time, and brush more teeth surface at once, assuming that is the purpose of the small section of bristles on the bottom. My husband seemed to really liked them, but next time I will buy the smaller brushes for myself.</li>
            <li> They are coming way too frequently.  We must have at least refills into the middle of the year 2015, already.&lt;br /&gt;Like Stone Soup.</li>
            <li> They are toothbrush heads, and they function exactly as a toothbrush should.</li>
            <li> They are a necessary evil to use with our electric toothbrush.  I tried a knockoff generic brand and the head kept falling off the brush so back to the real deal.  I don&#x27;t like the price, but I do like the brush.</li>
            <li> I have tried all of the different Oral-B brush heads, this is my least favorite. I prefer the Floss Action over all others. The dual clean head just feels too big and bulky. I find it uncomfortable and the size makes it harder to get into the back of my mouth. That being said, my wife prefers this model over the floss action type. I guess it  is just preference. Amazon is the lowest price that I have found for this brush head and all the orders have been genuine Oral-B products.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush with its dependable replacement have made a big difference in my life.</li>
            <li> This replacement brush set is even better than the original brushes that came with my toothbrush. Unlike the original set you receive this one both vibrates at the bottom and oscillates at the top.  These give a much more thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> Just what we wanted as shown.</li>
            <li> This brush is supposed to be like a brush and flosses too.  Did not like it as it was too rough.  Have gone back to regular brush so would not order again but would order regular brushes again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used your replacement heads in the past with no problem.  But 1 of the replacement heads broke in only the second week I used it.  Normally these are fairly reliable so I am not sure if  it is the supplier or the product in general.  I still like to order my supplies from your source but if this continues, I may have to stop ordering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it before and it really works on keeping my teeth clean. I love to drink teas and teas can stain very easily.  My dentist likes how it leaves him less work when he cleans my teeth.  And I haven&#x27;t had any cavities in years since I&#x27;ve used this product.  The dual brush does the job.</li>
            <li> Just as the old ones. Very good quality and fit and it seems genuine. I had read that it might not be, but I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. And the value is pretty good. Finally was able to find these. They are not easily found in stores.</li>
            <li> i used the small head before, now this dual head works better I think, and also because it is not some knockoff one i guess :D</li>
            <li> I like the Oral B electric tooth brush and these heads are very good when they are new.  However, and I hope that someone from Braun reads this, the design needs improvement.  The smaller of the two brushes separates from the back long before the brush is worn out.  If you continue to use the brush it can catch your cheek and be a little painful.  This could be a purposeful design as it means you have to replace the brush before it is actually worn out.</li>
            <li> LIKE THE 3 PACK THEY ARE WAY OVER PRICED, BUT THAT IS NORMAL BUT THEY ARE GOOD ALL BRUSES ARE OVER PRICED</li>
            <li> Oral-B got it right with these replacement brush heads.  Good solid product.  No problems with these whatsoever.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I co0uld have gotten these at the supermarket for a much higher price, but I saved a bundle. I can&#x27;t recommend the product per se; you&#x27;ll know if you need them for your tooth brush, but it&#x27;s a case of waiting for delivery versus going to the store. I was very happy with the money saved.</li>
            <li> Love it and received product quickly.  Couldn&#x27;t have asked for better service. Would definitely recommend and reorder for sure !!</li>
            <li> Bought these replacement heads along with the Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care and must say that even though it is the only replacement brush head I have been using it will probably be the only one along with the floss action replacement head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the head consists of two sets of brushes, both a rotating cup and a squared layer, this in itself is the only setback with the head since it can be seen as a little large compared to the other Oral-B heads which have only a round cup. But this should not be a reason to take away from the cleaning power of the brush and the freshness and clean feeling of your gums and teeth after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few persons posted reviews of having received fake brush heads and to eliminate this I would suggest if you&#x27;re looking to buy these heads make sure the supplier is Amazon where I have bought mine from without this setback and it is much better to buy the value pack (3 ct.) than the single heads. I would also recommend that these heads be used in conjunction with the Braun EB25-3 Oral-B Triumph FlossAction brush heads and a good whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I thought they would be more effective than the smaller heads. They&#x27;re a lot thicker than the smaller heads, so when I&#x27;m trying to brush my back teeth, there&#x27;s not enough room for it to oscillate, making it less effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great product for people with more room in their mouths, but that&#x27;s not me.</li>
            <li> It was a little uncomfortable at first since it is larger than the brush head I had been using before.  I love how my teeth feel after brushing!</li>
            <li> Love these replacement heads.  Good price.</li>
            <li> Our Dentist asked why our teeth look so good after 60+ years. I told him that I floss two or three times a day and brush once a day with the Oral-B tooth brush. He seemed to think we (me and the missus) were doing something right. I think it is the electric rotary brush. It keeps the plaque at bay while doing a decent job of cleaning your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;We go in for a check up annually.</li>
            <li> This product is rigth for my electrical brushes and good for use day by day.&lt;br /&gt;For me this product is better than manual brushes</li>
            <li> Great brush heads for a great price and they were shipped so fast to me. I would tell anyone try them you will see a big change in you teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> great price for exactly what I needed .</li>
            <li> Received my order quite quickly! I am very happy with this item. I believe it to be fairly priced, and absolutely love the results. Amazon and Oral-B have made it easy to replace my brush head through Prime ordering!</li>
            <li> I found it uncomfortable, too big.  I later found out that it&#x27;s better to get the advice of your dentist before selecting the brush for your electrical toothbrush that is appropriate for your specific needs.</li>
            <li> Works great! I have purchased several times, and I have no complaints. I will continue to use these as long as the brush holds up.</li>
            <li> I can only give this product 3 stars because one of the heads broke after only 2 weeks use, the one I&#x27;m using now seems to be doing better.  They do a good job when they work right.</li>
            <li> I do not prefer this style.  My favorite is the regular old heads</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have it on order on a regular basis.  Love the results that I get from using this spinbrush.</li>
            <li> Pro: Works as original in stores with way lower prices&lt;br /&gt;Con: nothing really&lt;br /&gt;Will surely buy more in the future</li>
            <li> These Oral B dual clean replacement brushes are really exceptional brushes. The way they are designed to clean every point around your gums and teeth are amazing. You get that just  professional cleaned feeling after each use. Highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> These worked out great and arrived very promptly.  I will purchase again because it is a way better deal than drugstore.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> My oral b tooth brush does a great job. I&#x27;ve used it exclusively for 4 years with the Dual action brushes because I get great coverage while brushing.  My whole mouth feels really clean and I get positive feedback from my dentist.</li>
            <li> I did not like this head from the moment I bought the replacements.  In fact I got so tired of how hard it felt on my gums that I took a screwdriver and popped off the lower head so that now I just have the circular head and am now happy.  I found it awkward to use, too big making it miss tighter places and now that I removed the bottom brush I can go back to getting a gentler better clean.</li>
            <li> Comes in a 3 pack, so this will last for a while. Good product.  Will be back in a few months for the next set. Love the matching toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I still have my old aging ORAL-B professional care system, one with just the oscillating head. This fits perfect, and gave it an upgrade to my old aging system.</li>
            <li> I love oral b toothbrushes been using for years. I dont feel like I have clean teeth if I use anything else</li>
            <li> The best investment I could make, for my personal health .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you should not require too many tips,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;V/r</li>
            <li> Item didn&#x27;t match description or work with ORAL-B Sonic Care Complete</li>
            <li> Excellent!  I saved $20 by purchasing the exact same product that I have always bought in discount stores.</li>
            <li> They are completely compatible with my Braun motor. The surface is bigger and I hope the cleaning is about twice more efficient.</li>
            <li> If you like getting clean teeth, this one works great.  Love it.  I&#x27;m a dentist and I would hate not to have it available.</li>
            <li> I got these on sale for 13.99 and will worth it. Cleans my teeth really good. Iv been using same Oral-B brush for years and just changing the heads</li>
            <li> Cannot stress the importance to look out for deals outside of Walgreens and CVS for items like these!!  Great Buy!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for these for awhile now and when I found them here did not expect them to be the right ones. Excuse the capitals.THESE ARE GREAT FITS MY BRUSH AND EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> These are a direct replacement for the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 series toothbrush, amongst others.  Not much more to say than they are exactly the same as the one that came with the toothbrush, so they are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is terrific for my needs; I have had long time peridontal disease. It keeps my gums clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> Found these at a reasonable price.  Pack of 3 brush heads.  Like the larger brush head over just the smaller round head.  Feel like it does a better job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> Great price for 3 heads. Shipped in time and no complaints.</li>
            <li> I must have gotten the wrong ones as the brush part was not soft as I ordered or they have changed as I&#x27;ve been using the same power part for 5 or 6 years.</li>
            <li> Can not find these brushes in a store!  I&#x27;ve look everywhere!  I am grateful that Amazon carries this product in stock.  The double heads tend to cover a bigger area while messaging around the gum.  I think they are reasonable in cost and toss them when they wear out.  Dentist always tells me my teeth look great.  How do people keep their teeth clean with just a straight toothbrush?  Once you use these electric brushes, you will never go back.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly for oral-b4000, 7000 series, etc..</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine but I&#x27;ll have to wait to hear what my dentist says. That&#x27;s the final word.</li>
            <li> Good price and function</li>
            <li> I have to go with it&#x27;s own brand. The cheaper, generic versions seem to leak toothpaste/spit when i brush with them. Also, i like the dual clean because it feels more of a toothbrush than the small single heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I switched to a sonicare, and don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be looking back to this.</li>
            <li> Felt like a brand new toothbrush, just like the original.</li>
            <li> i like these toothbrush heads best. the others are too small, this one covers the whole tooth.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. I was excited to replace mine and these where better than the plain circle.</li>
            <li> Love this product. My dentist can not believe how clean it keeps my teeth. Fits on my Braun unit I change the head every three months when I visit the dentist.</li>
            <li> Its a brush head that works like it a brush head :)&lt;br /&gt;That said, DON&#x27;T buy unless its \\&quot;SOLD\\&quot; \\&quot;AND\\&quot; \\&quot;FULFILLED\\&quot; by Amazon, there are many reports about cheap counterfeits here (even those fulfilled by Amazon).</li>
            <li> Excellent dental quality brushes. I will gladly purchase again from this seller. Priced just right also. Thanks Vnetta</li>
            <li> I had a hard time locating these specific replacement brushes in my home town.  The only place that carried them was Target and they were around 40 bucks for about 5 heads.  Anyway, I found them on here for a cheaper price and they are perfect.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have tried the other types of Oral-B brush heads that go with their handle, but this one cleans the best.  The top brush spins while the bottom one moves up and down so it cleans 2 ways. I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth feel cleaner and look whiter than before I switched to this brush head.</li>
            <li> I have been using an Oral-B Vitality brush for a long time- I purchased these replacement heads since I always seem to run out and forget to buy more. Thankfully, the Subscribe and Save program will make sure that doesn&#x27;t happen again!</li>
            <li> I love that I can get these much less expensive that at the local stores and they are good quality.</li>
            <li> Great product, glad I bought it.  Cleans teeth very well, even better than the stock brush head I received when I first bought the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are great and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive, but I learned my lesson. The cheap knock-offs fall apart after a few uses. The bristles get too soft to really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I hate paying the price, it&#x27;s worth my dental health to pay the extra for a real deal. You end up using a greater number of the knock-offs, so the final trade off in price actually ends up being a lot less than it first appears&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your time (and, ironically probably your money) and buy the real Oral B. Your teeth (and dentist) will thank you.</li>
            <li> its oral  and its great. Nothing much needs to be said about this product besides it being good.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Product is a known leader in the quality of teeth cleaning brushes. Replacements are many times hard to find but I always know that Amazon.com will have them and get them to me in a correct and timely fashion and at a below competitive prices.With regular uses the brushes perform well for 3 months so one package will last 9 months. Dentist alwasy comments on how well my teeth look when I go for my semi annual check up. These brush heads do the trick.</li>
            <li> I prefer the bigger/double brush head with the electric toothbrush. It makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting a better brush.</li>
            <li> I get these as part of a subscription, so they help insure that I use a replacement brush more frequently that would otherwise happen.</li>
            <li> These are the best toothbrush heads, in my opinion, by far. I was able to fix an issue I was having with my back molars. I will order these again and would recommend anyone who is extremely hygiene focused like me!</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> It works really good I have no problems with them so far</li>
            <li> Like this brush.  It cleans very well.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. It was easy to assemble, if fit my toothbrush perfectly and it works great. I purchased the oral B toothbrush and it came with one head that only had a single brush, this is great as a three pack for me and my boyfriend, WITH different color rings so we do not get them confused. The price was also exceptional. Will buy again when I need a replacement.</li>
            <li> I love my toothbrush and these are the replacements for the original heads that came with my toothbrush. Perfect size, and they provide color coded rings so you can identify your brush head if you share the automatic toothbrush (I don&#x27;t, but I imagine what they are used for...)</li>
            <li> I have used these on my Braum Triumph Professional Care 9000 electric toothbrush for years, Amazon offers absolute best price I have ever found, I love this type of brush because I get great reports from my dentist keeping cost low on my checkups twice a year.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads work great. It is a vast improvement over the smaller standard head. I would recommend switching to these ones as they seem to brush a lot more efficiently.</li>
            <li> I will reorder as needed. This product is as good as you can buy from what I know about it. We have used this type of electric brush for about 10 years. Love it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the dual brushes for his Braun electric toothbrushe. These were exactly what he wanted and was a great buy!</li>
            <li> These are the only brush heads I will use until Oral-B does not make them anymore... which I hope will be never.  The dual brushing makes the job of brushing teeth a lot easier.  I love that the second brush serves almost like a floss.  I have been using these for years and love them.</li>
            <li> I had bought the basic electric toothbrush from Oral-B that comes with the single, circular brush head. That head worked very well, so I decided to try the dual clean ones. Unfortunately, I ordered the 3-pack, when I should&#x27;ve gotten a single one and try it out first. These head brushes get stuck ALL THE TIME. Basic pressure will impair the movement of the bottom brush, hence obstructing the rotation of the upper circular brush. So 70% of my tooth-brushing time I am stuck with a brush that does not move. I though it might be a flawed head, so then I tried another one from the package and it&#x27;s the exact same thing. There is a severe design flaw in these heads.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people gave great reviews on the product, so I bought it. I would highly recommend getting one head first, and then deciding whether it works for you or not. It definitely did not for me and am now stuck with 3 useless heads that I will be using as normal toothbushes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: It seems the issue is with the electric toothbrush itself. It is the vibrating metallic part which inserts into the heads that is getting stuck and consequently the heads. So I&#x27;m not sure if these heads had something to do with it, or if my electric toothbrush is defective.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find one dual brush head  yet three in a pack is rare .I love them they are perfect for me. They last a long time and they  get  my teeth  clean and white. Thankyou  Amazon</li>
            <li> these were the wrong item for my unit no comment</li>
            <li> The same as the oral-B brushes you can buy at your local store, but with a slightly better price. Only bought them on-line because I did not feel like driving to a couple of store to find the toothbrushes I wanted. Would do it again rather than playing hit and miss at the local stores.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews about this bigger head, and I thought cool, twice the brushing power in the same amount of time!  However, after having received it, I&#x27;m a little dissappointed.  It doesn&#x27;t appear as though it&#x27;s that big, but it feels very large in mouth.  It felt like I was trying to brush my teeth with my thumb.  I had trouble getting the brush into the far reaches of my mouth whereas before with the smaller head I had no problems.  I&#x27;m not a small person either, I&#x27;m 6&#x27;1\\&quot; and 190lbs, with an average size mouth.  It&#x27;s really not that different than the standard head, it&#x27;s just bigger.  I think what bothered me most about the bigger head is that the angles at which you approach your teeth are now more limited because of the increased brush size.  Because of this, getting the brush into every nook and cranny is now more difficult.  Also, because it is bigger, it&#x27;s harder to close your mouth around the wand, which means you get more toothpaste goo running down the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I bought the economical 3-pack.  I should have bought the single one just to try it out, but I was certain I&#x27;d love the bigger one.  Oh well...</li>
            <li> One of these brush heads came with my Oral B 980TX power toothbrush.  I liked it so much more than the regular FlexiSoft head that I immediately ordered the 3-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra bristles with their side-to-side oscillation add more oomph to the Oral B&#x27;s tingle-inducing cleaning action.  I can feel it all the way to the base of each tooth.  When I rinse, I see more loosened debris swirling down the drain.  I finish my morning brushing with a hydrogen peroxide rinse, and, man oh man, does it get foamy, an indication of freshly cleaned dental and gum surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is already a bargain but with additional available discounts like Free Super Saver Shipping, it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li> This is most thorough cleaning brush on the market! I tried others but my teeth doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it does with the Dual Clean Brush Heads.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Oral B toothbrush but I really wanted this bigger toothbrush head instead of the one that comes with it.  With an \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; toothbrush, I always looked for the most bristles I could find so I was surprised to discover I actually prefer the smaller Oral B toothbrush head to this one!!  The simple reason is that with the smaller head (with just the cicle of bristles), I feel like I have more control and can really get around my back teeth.  This will really boil down to preference for anyone.  I&#x27;m sure both are great at getting your teeth clean.  But for me, I am going to stick with the standard head that comes with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Using this in conjunction with the Professional Deep Sweep gives a great cleaning. They complement each other and I would recommend the combination.</li>
            <li> Low power, doesn&#x27;t hold charge. Was hoping for so much more. Bought all the extra heads too. Maybe I got a bad one?</li>
            <li> I love the Oral-B electric toothbrush and this head (compared to the smaller one). My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist after every brushing. These heads really get food bits (I know, sound icky) out from between your teeth. If you can afford it I highly recommend getting Oral-B. There is a huge difference between manual, battery operated and the Oral-B electric brushes. Sometimes K-hls has a sale on the actual unit.</li>
            <li> good deal good deal almost 40 percent off retail price.  it is what it is. dude.  just buy it. oky</li>
            <li> These fit into the professional Oral-B toothbrushes and you are not forced to use the tiny circle heads - with the subscribe and save program, they will arrive each 6 months (change every three) and your teeth will thank you!</li>
            <li> You get twice the amount of cleaning so you can brush a little shorter.  I alternate between two and they seem to last longer.</li>
            <li> I have had this particular brand of tooth brush for a long time and it&#x27;s always difficult to find replacement heads. I was glad to see that Amazon had them and even had an option to get regular shipments of them sent out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles arrived quickly and were exactly as advertised... no complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for years and I&#x27;ll be so sad when it stops working or I can&#x27;t get replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble finding the replacement heads for my battery operated brush. So I am glad I was able to get proper replacements.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these in any store, even those that sell Oral B electric toothbrushes.  These are the same as those included when I first purchased the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush and brush heads for several years now.  I love it.  My dental hygienist always says at my cleanings that my teeth look like they have been recently cleaned.</li>
            <li> This set of replacement brushes is the real thing for the right Oral-B handle.  Just didn&#x27;t realize that these attach differently than the heads that fit our handles.  Actually gave these to my son, who uses the right kind of Oral-B handle.  Disappointing that Oral-B doesn&#x27;t make the model head to brush more obvious.  Took us a while to find the correct heads.</li>
            <li> Loves it soon much. The beat affordable home use ones unless you can afford the 100$ ones. My mini dental cleaning heads love ya</li>
            <li> Excellent! I have been using these for a long time and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> These are the only mechanical toothbrush heads that I will use. I went through lots of toothbrushes and heads before I landed on these. They are some of the only ones have found that are stiff-hard vs soft. The only pitfall is, if you are a seriously hard brusher (like myself), each head will only last about two weeks. They come three to a pack and are much cheaper to buy via Amazon than in the drugstore (you can&#x27;t find them at Wal-Mart). I have them on auto-order so that I receive a set of heads each month.</li>
            <li> The brushes came on time as promised. I am using one of these brushes and it works fine.The brushes are dual heads and provide better brushing.</li>
            <li> I replace my heads frequently.  Amazon has the best price.  Easy shopping.  Will buy again.  Keeps me out of stores and away from the sweets.</li>
            <li> Good price.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I tried the knock offs and they didn&#x27;t work.  I don&#x27;t like the price on these, but continue to buy them.</li>
            <li> Not so good, bristles already falling out after a months use.</li>
            <li> If you prefer the feel of a regular toothbrush to the smaller brush heads that come standard with Oral-B electric toothbrushes, then these are for you. They feel like brushing with a regular, non electric toothbrush. Due to their size, I don&#x27;t think they get into the nooks and crannies as well but they cover more area so that brushing is less strenuous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have all of my wisdom teeth because I have very straight teeth. It is very difficult to get to the very back of my mouth with these brush heads. They are as good of quality as the original but they seem to use more battery life than the original brush heads where they are dual action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that these are too large and bulky for me so I will use these three and then go back to the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to whether you will like them, do you miss the feel of regular toothbrushes? If so, you&#x27;ll like these. If you have a smaller mouth or  all your wisdom teeth, stick to the original because it is difficult to get the back teeth.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting for :)</li>
            <li> braun great brush give many optional  brushes so u can pick and choose which one you love&lt;br /&gt;also great price  for family pack</li>
            <li> I have tried to be cheap and buy the store brand version of these toothbrush heads that claim they&#x27;ll fit my toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve found that they don&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling nearly as clean as this kind.  I don&#x27;t know if the bristles are a different material or what, but I&#x27;ll never buy the store brand again!</li>
            <li> Works great. Would recommend them to any that use the Oral-B electric tooth brush. I have used these for several years and would not want to use any other.</li>
            <li> Fits the brush, good quality, real replacement - not a rip-off, good price</li>
            <li> love them...fit my toothbrush perfectly, just what I wanted, good price, and fast ship</li>
            <li> recommended by my dentist and the coverage is gentle and great.  Good for the gums as well as the teeth.</li>
            <li> Was given a  gift. She loves it.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done. The dual cleaning makes plaque and left over food removal more effective and longer lasting. It cleans my teeth better than Floss Action head. I am happy I purchased this because the brush heads are reminiscent to a regular toothbrush&#x27;s head except it is more powerful and worth the price.</li>
            <li> These work great, they&#x27;re not breaking or anything, but I&#x27;m on the first head and I&#x27;ve already gotten a couple of bristles falling out. I didn&#x27;t get that at all when I bought the heads in the store, but it&#x27;s not continual so I&#x27;ll probably get these again.</li>
            <li> i love my brush , unfortunately these are now hard to find .</li>
            <li> Received quickly, and, for me, this company makes the best</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Dual Clean brush head works very well and it was moderately priced. I have used one for a few weeks and I did notice that it cleans better than the brush head I had used previously(which came in the original set). The complaint that one reviewer made about it being so big is not a problem for me. It is about the same size as a regular small toothbrush. If one becomes used to the small head on most electric tooth brushes,it might seem large in comparison.I find it very comfortable and it covers more of my teeth in less time. I highly recommend this replacement head.</li>
            <li> Great product and it is authentic! Works very well with my Triumph toothbrush and it does the job very well!!</li>
            <li> Great brush heads, unfortunately my Oral-B toothbrush finally gave out on me and now I need to replace that, oh well, I guess it&#x27;s Murphy&#x27;s Law in effect.</li>
            <li> Just what it said it was! And works fine&lt;br /&gt;Good&lt;br /&gt;Better&lt;br /&gt;Best&lt;br /&gt;One of each&lt;br /&gt;What more can one say</li>
            <li> This brush head does a better job than the round head units that come with the toothbrush.t&lt;br /&gt;Considering the cost of dental care, the Oral B system is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I went back to the normal brush head.&lt;br /&gt;This design was gagging me.Too much going on and not needed in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was able to buy just 3 replacement heads for my toothbrush . My local super market wanted me to buy 6 heads.</li>
            <li> Previously I ordered the generic brand and they lasted a very short period of time.  You pay a little more for these but well work the small cost.  I highly recommend this product and supplier.  Thanks for asking...</li>
            <li> I bought this - and it&#x27;s better than the original brush I had on the Oral B.  Glad I can choose from different brushes.</li>
            <li> pack of three that go strong! I wish they were cheaper though. Sometimes seems better to buy a whole new device than replacements.</li>
            <li> These brush heads do the job, but they only last about 6 weeks for me before the bottom brush starts pointing outward.  This gets expensive to replace so often!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical after reading some reviews about fake brush heads, but what I received, works very well. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and still going strong, also I read the ORAL B mark will scratch off fakes, which it does not with these. I recommend saving some money and ordering these refill heads.</li>
            <li> Based on the many other positive reviews, I picked these up. I like the feel of the bigger brush head personally as it feels more the size of a regular toothbrush. The heads were a great price with Prime shipping, and an even better deal with subscribe and save. Quality is excellent and they appear as genuine as can be.</li>
            <li> I can order and have it right a way.  Know when it is coming and I never run out, and always get the right one.</li>
            <li> I have an old Braun electric tooth brush that had just the round part as a brush head, i bought this hoping it would fit and work, and it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it a few times now, and it is still working perfect with no issues.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the replacement heads and will order them again as I need them. Also like all items i ordered.</li>
            <li> Much quicker than just the original circular head since it covers more area while still getting into hard to reach places.  I like the multiple directions of the brushes.  Awesome price and quality.  At retail these can be pricey and store brand generics don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have used Oral B electric toothbrushes for years.  Loved them.  Never found one as poor quality as this.  Would not reorder this item.  Would just go to local retailer and purchase in future.</li>
            <li> Hubby likes these heads.  He originally had the smaller head that came with the Braun unit (only the round part on top) and he thinks this bigger head gets his teeth cleaner.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for years. It is gentle on my teeth and also on my gums. I will continue to purchase this product until they discontinue it.</li>
            <li> These brush heads arguably clean better than the other Oral-B brush options.  They felt large at first, but I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only purchased these once, but all three \\&quot;Dual Clean\\&quot; brush heads in the pack fell apart after about 3-weeks of use.  The lower part of the brush becomes loose and \\&quot;catches\\&quot; on your gum/tongue while brushing.  This is painful and has caused me to bleed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these from Amazon and they look legit.  So, I&#x27;m not sure if these were defective or if it&#x27;s a problem with the brush design.  From what I can tell, there are a few other reviews that mention this issue.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads fit my Brawn electric tooth brush and work ok but I think I prefer just the round replacement head - they seem to clean more thoroughly. Maybe that&#x27;s because these larger heads feel softer than the original round heads.</li>
            <li> This particular replacement brush head contains more bristles than the brush head that came with the toothbrush.  I really think it does a better job of brushing my teeth.  However, because it is bigger, it uses more power from the toothbrush.  So it is necessary to recharge it about every five days rather than 7 days.  I don&#x27;t find that to be a problem, though.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for this product. I found it on Amazon and it was exactly what I needed. The price was great. 3 brush heads for the price of one at Walmart. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These brushes definitely give my teeth a clean feeling. I was using the smaller brush heads before and I always felt that they could not adequately clean my front teeth. With this replacement brush head, my teeth feel clean all around my mouth!</li>
            <li> double head cleans awesome.  definitely my favorite replacement head compared to the single head.</li>
            <li> I was looking fro these at a lower price than in-store.  These were less expensive and arrived quickly---will buy again from here!!</li>
            <li> i used to use the traditional oral b replacement heads but since i tried these i wont go back.  they cover more surface and move in two directions leaving my teeth feeling even cleaner</li>
            <li> this cleans excellently.  I have never used another toothbrush that cleans as well. I have used this Oral-B product for several years.</li>
            <li> Ever since using the Oral-B spin brush, I have not encountered any new dental issues, and my dentist says my gums are healthier too!</li>
            <li> I like the convenience of the subscriptions and still wish that this product was less expensive.  Which, of course, has nothing to do with Amazon and this is the best buy I&#x27;ve been able to find.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years and don&#x27;t even look at ordering anything else.  They feel great on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I wanted a brush that was bigger than the Sonicare brushes, and I found these.  Then I started looking at the Oral-B electrics, and decided to go for it, and bought these just to have, in case.. .and I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li> These are great for those of us that have mouths big enough to use them.  Dual action probly has twice the amount of bristles at werq and feels more like a real toothbrush than the funky little ones that these brushes come with.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it said it was.</li>
            <li> Fit on my toothbrush. My teeth are sparkly clean!</li>
            <li> This the Best price I have found for this product. The brush heads are oral-B as described. Overall I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my Oral-B 4000 Electric Toothbrush and unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t fit. Instead i use the product with my Oral-B 3000 Electric Toothbrush. It really gives you an extra clean.</li>
            <li> Been using the Oral B tooth brush for years..Love the heads, one rotates and one is stationary.</li>
            <li> SO much reasonably priced compared to the store and EXACTLY the same! will buy again when these wear out</li>
            <li> This product does a much better job of cleaning below the gum line than an regular toothbrush.  Teeth feel cleaner and more polished.</li>
            <li> I read reviews and this got great ones. I prefer this brush to the one that came with the 3000.</li>
            <li> This product is the best because it helped my in so many deferent ways, and I can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li> I like to replace my brush heads every three months, this little pack was perfect. And it comes with individually colored heads so if you have two or more in the household, everyone knows which one is yours!</li>
            <li> I love the way this brush cleans my teeth, it&#x27;s a double action going on in my mouth.  After I&#x27;m done brushing my mouth feels fresh and clean.. :D</li>
            <li> I used serveral brush heads before, including the one packaged with the Oral B 5000 and the ultra sensitive head. So far, I like the ultra soft and sensitive one the best. My gum is not hurting when using them. This one however, although claims to help you clean by having two parts, does not work that well. Especially in the back teeth. It is just too big to go in.</li>
            <li> There were no brush covers for the new brush heads.  How does one keep the bristles sanitary, especially when traveling?</li>
            <li> Seems to work as well as the small round brushes i have used for 25 years but it is a bit big for my mouth which results in a messier brushing experience.</li>
            <li> Nice price for replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> I have years using it, I recommend it, for me are excellent product, Greetings</li>
            <li> I have been needing replacements now for a while. These are superb and exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> So pleased to find these replacement brushes online. Exactly what I wanted and fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Just like anything else, there are &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; spin brush heads out there that do not stand up to the true thing.  These are becoming hard to find in local stores for an affordable price.  Could not pass up this deal on Amazon.  This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve purchased this item from here.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush heads are good; I give this 4 stars instead of 5 because they seem to wear out on the earlier side</li>
            <li> I love these dual head brushes!  You get a bit of extra brushing action when focusing on the top brush as if it were the regular single head.  I never can find these in stores, so great to get through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I think these are some of the best brush heads out there.  They do an awesome job cleaning our teeth and I&#x27;m not sure why people complain that they are too big.  I don&#x27;t brush with a child&#x27;s size toothbrush, do you?  These are no bigger than a regular non electric toothbrush so what&#x27;s there to complain about?  The best part is that they do what they are supposed to do, clean your teeth and they do it well.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Works well with my electronic toothbrush. I only wish these are a little cheaper... Other than that, I have no complains.</li>
            <li> they were what i expected.</li>
            <li> The dual rotating brushes on this Oral-B product make me a fan. I feel like I&#x27;m really getting my teeth clean--in the right way. It&#x27;s large, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a kid or someone with a really small mouth. I&#x27;d certainly buy them again.</li>
            <li> I got this on a deal and it fits to my Profesnl 1000 Oral-B brush and this 2, works perfect and i tried this. Also my friend bought this and tried, it did work very good,,, Trying to get a rebate on this,</li>
            <li> Good to have extras when you need to replace the brush head.  I love this toothbrush.  I actually enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Feels like I just had a polishing at the dentist. I do not find the brush head to be too large.</li>
            <li> These lasts for quite awhile.  i think I actually save money using this over the disposable toothbrushes that are poor in quality and expensive.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, it really clean the teeth and  help the teeth maintain white. I recommend this product to any body.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find these replacement heads in my local drugstores.  I have had to do with inferior replacements until my son had an Oral B System on his Christmas list. I went to Amazon.com and found the exact system wanted and purchased it and then decided to search for these replacement heads.  And, voila!  Amazon had exactly the correct Oral B replacement heads, 3 to a package, for a very reasonable price.  I of course purchase the replacements at one.  Amazon.com came through for me again.  I might add that a lot of my Christmas shopping was done online with Amazon.com.  They seem to be what the normal consumer who cannot shop the malls really needs.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product. I was first afraid it would not fit my brush, but it fit properly. The model was correct.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t fit my base eventhough they said they would. Just know it may or may not fit. Be ready to see if you can return. I just tossed mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oral-B tooth brushes for years. Getting the 3 heads at a time seems to save money. I like the configuration of these heads for overall coverage of my teeth. Good product.</li>
            <li> This price is a very good price. Even knock-offs of these are more. I will probably continue to get all my Oral B supplies on line.</li>
            <li> This makes a good toothbrush into a great monster plaque ripper toothbrush. Takes the black tea stains of my teeth in moments. When I turn it on and use it, the light on the charger starts dancing letting me the vibes are going though my eyeballs. This is as close to a dentist rotary style cleaner as I have ever used. Makes the sonicare feel like a kids toy.</li>
            <li> The heads arrived a day before the projected arrival date. They are the original Oral-B heads that I regularly use, not the knock-offs that lose bristles with each use.&lt;br /&gt;These are well worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I always research the price and quality of any item I want to buy.  I bought this product from the vendor after my research because the vendor&#x27;s price was much cheaper than any other I checked, including Wal-Mart, Kohl&#x27;s, etc.  Also, I received the product on time.</li>
            <li> Very nice, great purchase</li>
            <li> Love the improved brush design.</li>
            <li> Received it 2nd day, just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different heads, including the floss action, dual clean and precision clean heads. The floss action is my favorite. My teath and gums feel like I just came from the dentist. The dual action is my second favorite.</li>
            <li> best electric toothbrush heads, hands down. dentist clean.</li>
            <li> The price was great for these.  I couldn&#x27;t buy these at Walmart for this price.  They worked great on my toothbrush holder.</li>
            <li> With this brush you can both brush a tooth and stimulate the gum beneath at the same time.  Since using this brush, I have had much better evaluations by dental professionals than in the past.  However, one stil should use floss and proxy brushes as well for a complete cleanup.  Unfortunately this replacement brush is often unavailable in stores so I am grateful to Amazon for making it available.</li>
            <li> I have always liked an electric toothbrush.  Then, they designed a NEW type of brush.  It lasts quite awhile before replacement.</li>
            <li> Dental pros tell me Oral-B is the best. Apparently it cleans so much better than my manual toothbrush, and a little better than Sonic Care. However, I wish I&#x27;d just started out with the rotary Oral-B brushes that came with the toothbrush initially, because it&#x27;s such a high powered tool in my mouth it overwhelms me, as a beginner. Maybe using it once a week will be better for my enamel? I need to ask a pro.</li>
            <li> My grill looks clean!</li>
            <li> These are hard to find in stores #1 and then when you do they are very expensive, to find them at this price and to know I can easily just order them makes my life simple! I love how they clean my teeth, I have not stepped up to the Sonic, have other things I need to spend my money on, but these keep my teeth and gums very clean and do a super job!</li>
            <li> Great price and worked just as advertised</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush and these replacement heads I bought here were the most cost effective I could I found.</li>
            <li> the service was very fast and the item worked great and was a better price than I could find locally.</li>
            <li> Meeting my expectations</li>
            <li> Purchased to go on a Pro 4000. They do a GREAT job! Have not tried the smaller headed brushes, but these do not seem too large.</li>
            <li> These work very well.  I was concerned as to whether they would fit an older Oral-B tooth brush - but no problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so big! (Insert: \\&quot;That&#x27;s what she said.\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joking aside that is what I thought when I stuck this into my mouth for the first time. This brush head does it&#x27;s job, which is to clean your pearly whites. I can attest that my teeth feel clean after using it. That being said, this brush head has a pro and a con. The larger size allows you to brush a larger area of teeth at once, which is good if you&#x27;re used to the feel and size of a manual brush. The larger size also means that it feels less precise, which is bad if you enjoyed the feeling of precision the other smaller brush heads offer. I just wanted to try this one out. You will have to adjust how you maneuver it around in your mouth if you&#x27;re used to the smaller heads. Overall I like the soft bristles, and it cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li> When I purchased my Oral-B electric toothbrush, I thought that I would be the only one using it but, after my wife saw it, she wanted to use it also.  So, I located this 3-pack and decided to buy it for her and extras for me.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of this brush on my teeth and gums.  It cleans very well.  I have used these for years and don&#x27;t plan to make any changes in the near future.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush head gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend as does my dentist the dual head brush vs single.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, and everything in order. Purchased 2 packs of 3 heads. price is good and very happy with product.</li>
            <li> this is the same product i usually buy at target or Bed bath and beyond, but about $10 less!!! I will definitely keep buying it here :)</li>
            <li> When I first bought my Oral-B brush, I immediately regretted not buying a Sonicare. My brush came with just the single oscillating brush head. My teeth just never felt clean even though I was brushing for 6 minutes. I was about to give in and get the Sonicare, when I found these. As I hate to waste money, I decided to give this dual brush head a try before giving up altogether on my Oral-B. The first time I used this brush head, I could tell that it was much more effective than the original. My teeth felt much cleaner, which was confirmed a few months later by my dentist. I only need to brush for 2 minutes with this brush head and it is much more thorough. I&#x27;m so glad I found these because they saved me so much money!</li>
            <li> You must buy this.&lt;br /&gt;It is user friendly.&lt;br /&gt;Great for teeth.&lt;br /&gt;So many levels you can use.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this power toothbrush for years.  I buy my &amp;#34;replacement brush heads&amp;#34; on-line and Amazon usually has the best price.  I highly recommend this Oral-B toothbrush unit and these dual action replacement brush heads (rotary and back &amp; forth).</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time finding out what Oral-B brush model that the heads would fit.  I could not find a clear definition of the model numbers so I took the chance anyway.  The heads fit my brush model and I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.  I could not find them in any local pharmacy or even Walmart.  Great buy as this double action brush is the best, using my teeth cleaning at the dentist with making this statement.  Leon</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended the Oral-B electric toothbrush several years ago and I will never go back to regular toothbrush.  Having a subscription of toothbrush head refills makes it convenient because you know when the refills arrive, it&#x27;s time to replace the existing toothbrush heads.  And the price on Amazon can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Every use is like a trip to the dentist with dual heads that really leave you feeling clean and refreshed. The extra action doubles the brush work and pays off in a more thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing these refills for 5 years now. I have never had any problems or complaints with them until the past year. Every new package that I buy now (and I buy quite a few throughout the year), I have problems with the bristles falling out while I am brushing my teeth. Yuck. They get stuck in my teeth or in my mouth somewhere and I have to stop brushing to find them. I was hoping it was a fluke thing, but it has happened for awhile now. I will be throwing the rest of the refills away and looking for another alternative. Boo. Hiss.</li>
            <li> I like what I like and when it really good stuff it&#x27;s terrific and not too bad. I will by this again when I need it.</li>
            <li> The brush head does exactly what it is advertised to do , looks just like advertised, arrived exactly as anticipated - no complaints at all. I think I prefer the smaller brush head though (preference) but after using this brush head my dentist did comment \\&quot;your brushing is absolutely top-notch\\&quot;, so it&#x27;s definitely a great brush head.</li>
            <li> Great stock-up price and they arrived quickly.  Going back in for a second one for the back of the house.</li>
            <li> They fit, they were on sale, and they came with their little gasket. I have a Braun/Oral B Triumph Professional Care.</li>
            <li> However your schedule is set up for teeth cleaning; having the hygienist repeatedly tell you to floss more; given every size shape or color tooth brush; then I purchase the electric tooth brush with the dual clean BRUSH HEAD. Have always religiously brushed, flossed, and rinsed with mouth wash,... now without changing my routine or habits my oral hygiene is complimented.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!  It really cleans your teeth.</li>
            <li> It does a great job cleaning teeth, you can really feel the difference using this as compared to a regular brush, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product met and exceeded my expectations. Bristles were long lasting and durable. I am using the second one from the pack of 3 at the time of writing this.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!</li>
            <li> Works really well. Recommend</li>
            <li> These are original Oral-B heads same as the one in the toothbrush so no surprises here. Great price for sure.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally.  The price beats the locals hands down.  A great replacement head.  Get that &amp;#34;just left the dentist feel every time you brush!</li>
            <li> work fine, just like new</li>
            <li> Great item. Thank you</li>
            <li> Works fine and was about 1/3 the cost Walgreens wanted, It is always great to find lower costs when online shopping.</li>
            <li> I like this product because they are easy to use and make sure that the brush does its job every day.</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes used with the cordless toothbrush always clean teeth well and my dental hygienist always complements me on how well I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> My husband and I changed from manual toothbrushes when the dentist expressed concern that we were not doing such a good job along the gum line of our teeth. I also have grooves worn on a couple of teeth from brushing too hard with a manual brush so I thought I would try an electric toothbrush.  However, I did not want to break the bank with an expensive one especially if it turned out that I did not like it. Using the Oral B dual head cleaning brush was terrific! Our dentist saw the difference in our teeth and especially the increased health of our gums! These replaceable toothbrush heads are perfect! Relatively inexpensive and easy to change! Love them!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, good price, and works wonderfully.  Don&#x27;t know what else to say about this product.  We&#x27;ll definitely be reordering.</li>
            <li> GREAT for brushing your teeth! So far, I haven&#x27;t brushed any other surfaces with them so I&#x27;ll update when I do.</li>
            <li> After a trip to a local store came home empty handed. Found it on Amazon. Great product for the whole family! Fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time. It&#x27;s a good funtion one. The most important part is I got this tooth brush head cheaper than in Walgreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my Oral-B Professional toothbrush for over a year now. After my 6 month cleaning, my dentist suggested I use the replacement head with the most bristles. (My teeth hold stains.) It&#x27;s two weeks later, and my teeth aren&#x27;t showing stains yet.</li>
            <li> At my last dental check-up, my dentist noted that, on top of the usual good news, my teeth didn&#x27;t have the tea-stains that he was used to seeing.  I noted that I&#x27;d begun regularly using an Oral-B spin brush, as opposed to a manual brush, and he reacted as if that, indeed, was the probable explanation.  My girlfriend, likewise, has an Oral-B spin brush (having switched from a Sonicare), and is quite pleased with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist did warn that, with these spin brushes, one needs to resist the urge to manually add to the brush action (as opposed to just generally guiding the brush); otherwise, a spin brush tends to promote gum recession.</li>
            <li> These are well worth the price. The heads last about 3 months. It&#x27;s harder to clean the back side of your front teeth though. The shipping is fast.</li>
            <li> they are very good for the price.</li>
            <li> oral b saves me money at the dentist.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for my toothbrush....</li>
            <li> Was the wrong length type. I could not view because the packaging hid the view and opened the pack then couldn&#x27;t return</li>
            <li> Nice to have the dual action head.</li>
            <li> Brush works great and has amazing results. Almost feels like leaving the dentist. Maybe because my brush is a few years old, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find a good replacement on Amazon. The base of the neck is usually too wide and falls off even during brushing. However in this case, it&#x27;s really really snug. Give my gf some trouble when we switch brush heads. Would still buy it again though.</li>
            <li> Last time I bought the knock off brand and they fell apart. Missed out on coupon, some how it did not transfer over.</li>
            <li> This oral b is amazing when you&#x27;ve finishing brushing your teeth feels so clean I. Love it , I bought it in England an I didn&#x27;t regret it I will definitely recommended it to my friends</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads seem to be fine.&lt;br /&gt;Not to rough and not to soft.&lt;br /&gt;My wife thinks they take the enamel off the teeth. I think they are fine.</li>
            <li> Good product received on time, no problem at all.</li>
            <li> good price...difficult to find elsewhere</li>
            <li> received with no problems</li>
            <li> I thought I could not be any happier when I switched from a traditional tooth brush to using an Oral-B Smart Series electric tooth brush. Like others have said it truly left my mouth feeling cleaner than it ever has after a brushing. BUT THEN I decided to try these dual head brushes and WOW this has to be the all-time best clean feeling. I too was a little nervous getting these brushes when they look fairly large. But you immediately get use to it after the first couple brushes and in all reality its no bigger than your normal tooth brush. I feel like I am still able to reach all the crevasses of my teeth and I feel like it does a better job brushing my gums. My teeth love this brush and my dentist does too!  I have been using these heads now for over 2 years and would recommend this tooth brush head to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the floss action so I can compare both. I though this one might be better but I was completely wrong. Due to its size/weight, it loses much of its spinning/oscillating power. It felt bulkier than the floss action too even though I have large teeth. Based from my experience the floss action is a better brush.</li>
            <li> Love them.  They fit perfectly with the vitality electric brush.  Initially I was worried that it would not fit.  So far so good will reorder when I run out of the three.</li>
            <li> As described and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Works very well as expected.</li>
            <li> Oral b is the only toothbrush I have used for the last 20 years and I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Used them for years with great results.</li>
            <li> Work great. Fit brush. Just what I was looking for. (Though I wish they came in &#x27;soft&#x27;. Still, would repurchase.)</li>
            <li> I forgot about this product.  No need to worry, it would come in handy later on.</li>
            <li> Love these, price is awesome!</li>
            <li> Oral-B DualAction Premium Power Toothbrush Head Refill&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are by far My Favorite Brushes:&lt;br /&gt;* They Cover alot more area&lt;br /&gt;* They are less likely to wear your Gums down prematurely&lt;br /&gt;* I hate the Single head but really love these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot; Your Time is Gonna Come...\\&quot; :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, And Like usual;  Amazon Prime Rocks!!</li>
            <li> The larger brush gets loose quickly and can pinch my lip is I am not careful to keep lips curled out of the way.  Useful life is about 3 months.  My dentist complimented me on the health of both my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> bristles a bit stiffer than I expected</li>
            <li> The dual clean brush head is larger than the ones I&#x27;ve been using; they are more similar in size to a regular toothbrush. You will get used to the larger size. I bought the 3-pack. Good product.</li>
            <li> I rated this product with 5 stars since is a unique product able to keep my mouth clean, fresh and healthy.  I don&#x27;t hesitate to brush my teeth with this brush since I know for sure that it will keep my mouth  safe.  I would recommend it to everybody.</li>
            <li> For the 2 other people throughout history who glance at this review and are also 6&#x27;7\\&quot; and have reasonably proportioned body parts: this brush head isn&#x27;t that big. It&#x27;s not overwhelming, nor (assuming you do a reasonable, dentist-sanctioned brush job normally in life) is it going to overwhelm you with bristling action. It does feel nice. It doesn&#x27;t feel big or bulky. Imagine it this way (assuming you&#x27;re using the regular Oral-B brush heads currently, the similar ones with just the top circular component): it&#x27;s like the same motion, with the form factor of a regular (non-mechanical) manual toothbrush. Voila, that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s like. Good product, but nothing revolutionary or invasively large about it like part of me was kind of expecting after reading the reviews here.</li>
            <li> These are great i needed to replace my old heads and these do great and so much cheaper than the brick  and motor stores.</li>
            <li> Been using for quite some time because they are the correct brush heads for my unit.  What else can one say about them since I&#x27;m not a new user and these are not a new product.</li>
            <li> Got a bunch of these at Target for three bucks each. Saves me some time over the regular brush heads due to the size of these. Mouth feels cleaner too.</li>
            <li> I cannot rate this as I gave it to my Mom, she is using them so i guess all is well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Oral-B and Sonicare.  Sonicare is way overrated and wimpy to me.  while the ordinary Oral-B head is superior to Sonicare, this head is really powerful.</li>
            <li> I hate any brush that vibrates but that being said, we&#x27;re stuck now with only the sonic or vibrating styles now anyway so this worked the best out of all of those kinds.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what they say they are.  Go on easily and clean your teeth well.  I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> This product is terrific and arrived within 2-3 days. Would order again this way. No need to buy at drug store.</li>
            <li> Do not buy the knock offs. You will be sorry.They fit my Braun Oral b electric toothbrush and last at least 3 months.</li>
            <li> This thing goes for a good $30 at a pharmacy store. Excellent product. Recommend replacing every 4-6 months. Good scrubbing!</li>
            <li> item works great but was significantly late in arriving</li>
            <li> I like this brush head but hubby does not. He thinks it&#x27;s way to big for his mouth. Not sure what that says about me?? LOL</li>
            <li> Of course your teeth are your life, it is like using a new tooth brush and the digital read out tell you when you have to replace the brush.</li>
            <li> I was using the round, whitening brush head for a while, but my oral care always felt a bit incomplete with those.  After switching to this head, I really feel a big difference in the degree of cleanliness of my teeth.  It may feel HUGE if you&#x27;re switching from the round heads, but you will quickly adjust!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these as your everyday head, and the whitening ones for periodic use.</li>
