            <li>Excellent price.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and works well!</li>
            <li>This item is great because you dont have to use trays with it and it still does the trick with whitening</li>
            <li>Works great used to be britesmile, we did the research, my husband needed the maintenance pens</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT....</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>What more can I say!</li>
            <li>The Zoom pens are just as good, if not even better.</li>
            <li>Not bad for a temporary fix and good price.</li>
            <li>It is Ok, nothing real special.  </li>
            <li>I love the zoom whitening pen.  </li>
            <li>Purchased these pens after using Bright smile pens for years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Bright Smile pens for years.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for better whitening.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for a fast clean look and feel.</li>
            <li>It is easily to use.</li>
            <li>The taste is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product and really like the way it works!!</li>
            <li>According to most experts in the field, the only truely effective whitening agent is the professional treatment that you get in your dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>Over the counter agents only remove surface staining and some people won&#x27;t even get a good result with the professional treatment.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and does lighten stained teeth a bit, but don&#x27;t expect them to turn white if your natural color is more ivory.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product but after one month of  use I don&#x27;t see any whitening to my teeth.</li>
            <li>zoom did not take, so if you&#x27;re very young, go ahead and try this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used others before and this was my least favorite.</li>
            <li>I did not see a difference and there was barely any product in the tube to use.  </li>

            <li> Not bad for a temporary fix and good price.</li>
            <li> expires within I month of receiving order</li>
            <li> I love the zoom whitening pen.  It&#x27;s great for a fast clean look and feel. This is my second set.  I will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;G. B</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Bright Smile pens for years. The Zoom pens are just as good, if not even better. I&#x27;ll reorder them again.</li>
            <li> The best whitening pen out there. It is easily to use. I travel with it! The taste is not unpleasant. Zoom is the brand they use in the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Gave them only 4 stars because it&#x27;s a little bit of a pain to use.  Hard to keep on for the required time and keep from drooling all over yourself.  Does seem to whiten the teeth, though.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and does lighten stained teeth a bit, but don&#x27;t expect them to turn white if your natural color is more ivory.</li>
            <li> Excellent price. Half the price of my dentist&#x27;s office.  Excellent product and works well!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product but after one month of  use I don&#x27;t see any whitening to my teeth. In all fairness, I have tried whitening toothpastes, rinses and Smileactives pens which are similar to these. Unfortunately, none of them have worked for me. According to most experts in the field, the only truely effective whitening agent is the professional treatment that you get in your dentist&#x27;s office. Over the counter agents only remove surface staining and some people won&#x27;t even get a good result with the professional treatment.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me these might work as in office zoom did not take, so if you&#x27;re very young, go ahead and try this.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT....ZOOM ALWAYS WORKS--JUST A CHEAPER WAY TO BUY&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT...&lt;br /&gt;I AM LOOKING, NOW, FOR 4 MORE---WE R ABOUT OUT OF IT ALREADY!</li>
            <li> I did not see a difference and there was barely any product in the tube to use.  I&#x27;ve used others before and this was my least favorite.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine how this product can work when it comes off of your teeth immediately after you close your mouth once applied.</li>
            <li> Because it dose nothing to my teeth. it&#x27;s just like a paste, i have finish the two nothing happened. i&#x27;m not happy.</li>
            <li> It is Ok, nothing real special.  I was hoping for better whitening.</li>
            <li> Works great. Whitens teeth! What more can I say! I will buy it again. I will recommend it to friends.</li>
