            <li>Second time ordering, this stuff is awesome</li>
            <li>It lathers very nicely and it leaves my beard very soft.  </li>
            <li>Keeps your beard soft for the day but makes it smell Great.  </li>
            <li>Hubby loves this and his beard smells so good and is much softer.  </li>
            <li>First time I have used a beard shampoo, but decided to give it a try along with Honest Amish Beard Balm to grow in my winter beard.  </li>
            <li>Washes beard fine but not something I would purchase again.</li>
            <li>The scent of the shampoo is great, not too strong but just enough.</li>
            <li>I used to just use regular shampoo in my beard, but this keeps it softer and smells great.</li>
            <li>Me being cheap</li>
            <li>but if your beard dosnt agree font be cheap like me.</li>
            <li>This is better than the first.  </li>
            <li>The smell is unique.</li>
            <li>Suds up well but didn&#x27;t experience or note any significant improvement in the texture of my beard.</li>
            <li>It did help keep the beard refreshed and clean though</li>
            <li>Using the two products I experienced no beard itch, dander, and my normally rough curly beard is noticeably softer.</li>
            <li>Leaves my beard soft and smelling nice.</li>
            <li>Not the manliest of scents, but not bad either.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my beard clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t review often, but I thought I&#x27;d write a quick one.</li>
            <li>I met up with a friend this past weekend, who also happens to own his own salon and cuts my hair, and he commented that it looked like I was using something in my beard</li>
            <li>Smells great leaves beard a little tacky</li>
            <li>In the past I used other products that appear to be more popular, but this is the best beard shampoo I&#x27;ve found thus far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try folks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone to more natural options like Dr Bronners.</li>
            <li>The price might turn you off but nothing tickles my fancy more than a soft beard....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still fun to have along with the beard.</li>
            <li>The lather on this wash alone makes it worth trying</li>
            <li>Ultra Beard makes a Wild Berry that might smell better.</li>
            <li>Some people may like it, but I honestly can&#x27;t stand the smell even after several weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Buy this right here.</li>
            <li>It smells ok and it foams up really nice with just a small amount.</li>
            <li>a drop the size of a nickel is more than enough for a full beard.</li>
            <li>It smells okay, but he would rather it be more woodsy, less fruity.</li>
            <li>This not only fixed that problem and also made it smell good and made it softer.</li>
            <li>This stuff left my facial hair feeling great.</li>
            <li>(Very light scent after rinsing actually).  </li>
            <li>and it was very gentle on my beard.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the aroma of the cantaloupe and other exotic flavor</li>
            <li>Wish it conditioned and softened my beard more, but I have only been using it for five days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>This is my first review.</li>
            <li>I love the cantaloupe smell and if some of it gets in my mouth (like it inevitably does)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Bluebeard extra conditioning shampoo which seemed to work better for me.</li>
            <li>The Bluebeard&#x27;s Original Extra Conditioning beard wash is maybe a little better at softening my beard and has a nicer scent, but this is much better priced.  </li>
            <li>It leaves his beard clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Judging by the many positive reviews I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s just due to my hair type.</li>
            <li>But really, if a soap has Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine or Lauramidopropyl Betaine you shouldn&#x27;t be using it on your face.</li>
            <li>Oh, and just the smallest amount really foams up.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>It lathers up very well.</li>
            <li>dont like the smell much</li>
            <li>My husband can&#x27;t stop talking about how much he loves this.</li>
            <li>only used the two beard washes by Bluebeard&#x27;s Original before; the original and the Extra Conditioning.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff makes my beard soft and it goes a long way</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d just use the whole bottle before I bought a new brand.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It seems to do a fine job washing my beard, but the smell is not very pleasing.  </li>
            <li>Looking for something to stop your wife or significant other from complaining that your beard is &amp;#34;nappy&amp;#34; and hurts their face?</li>
            <li>just wow!</li>
            <li>I have a large Goatee &amp; it only takes a dime size of shampoo to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Also very economical: it takes only a tiny amount to get my full-face though not very long beard fully foamed up.</li>
            <li>and it has become wild and untamed.  </li>
            <li>By using this shampoo it leaves it soft and gives me the ability to comb through and set it the way I want it to.  </li>
            <li>It will leave your beard soft.</li>
            <li>He loves how soft it makes his beard</li>
            <li>It smells like 2 week old Cantaloupe.  </li>
            <li>If I could do back I would have spent more money on a different wash.</li>
            <li>Within two times of trying this, My medium length beard was soft and my skim condition cleared up almost completely.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s completely gone.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice an aroma of any kind, but it doesn&#x27;t taste bad if you get a little in your mouth :)  </li>
            <li>The sweet taste of the shampoo was a little off putting</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use a lot of products in general and thought beard shampoo might just be a &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; to sell products.</li>
            <li>Kind of a weird smell.  </li>
            <li>Only barely does the job.</li>

            <li> , it&#x27;s completely gone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice an aroma of any kind, but it doesn&#x27;t taste bad if you get a little in your mouth :)  </li>
            <li> The sweet taste of the shampoo was a little off putting</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot of products in general and thought beard shampoo might just be a &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; to sell products.</li>
            <li> Kind of a weird smell.  </li>
            <li> Only barely does the job.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;ll dry out your beard.</li>
            <li> and you notice your beard starts feeling dry just stop using it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and the bottle last a long time.</li>
            <li> but it just left my beard dry and a little itchy but</li>

            <li> I was excited to try this product but ultimately was disappointed and wished I could have tried another one of their products.</li>
            <li> Not worth the smell</li>
            <li> I do not use it everyday so it never completely cleared it up, however, I have a feeling if I did use it everyday</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is great product, I&#x27;ve been growing my beard since Dec 1st and it has become wild and untamed.  By using this shampoo it leaves it soft and gives me the ability to comb through and set it the way I want it to.  It sits there for the remainder of the day.  It&#x27;s worth a try folks.</li>
            <li> I bought this because regular shampoo was making me break out. This not only fixed that problem and also made it smell good and made it softer.</li>
            <li> First time I have used a beard shampoo, but decided to give it a try along with Honest Amish Beard Balm to grow in my winter beard.  Using the two products I experienced no beard itch, dander, and my normally rough curly beard is noticeably softer.</li>
            <li> Smells awefull. Washes beard fine but not something I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for someone as a gift.  He said it smelled terrible and had to throw it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll dry out your beard. Maybe if you use beard oil it will help... maybe. But really, if a soap has Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine or Lauramidopropyl Betaine you shouldn&#x27;t be using it on your face. This one has one of the Betaines in it. I have a bottle with 80% of the contents, if you find me you can have it. I&#x27;ve gone to more natural options like Dr Bronners.</li>
            <li> Looking for something to stop your wife or significant other from complaining that your beard is &amp;#34;nappy&amp;#34; and hurts their face? Buy this right here. The price might turn you off but nothing tickles my fancy more than a soft beard....well my own beard that is, I don&#x27;t feel others beards.....that often. You&#x27;re gonna feel like Santa when you lather that bad boy up in the shower a drop the size of a nickel is more than enough for a full beard. This product has lasted me almost two months with daily use. Just thought I&#x27;d write an honest review while I&#x27;m re ordering it.</li>
            <li> I did notice a change once I started using this shampoo. Beard feels alot smoother. Not the biggest fan of the smell however not a deal breaker considering it does its job and I use the Beardsley conditioner which covers up the smell.</li>
            <li> Love it makes my Beard softer love the smell! Use to use the shampoo i used for my scalp but it just left my beard dry and a little itchy but with this just wow! I will for sure buy it again once I&#x27;m out. :)</li>
            <li> I love it, my girlfriend loves it, my beard loves it!</li>
            <li> This product was not as advertised.</li>
            <li> One of the better bead shampoos I have tried since growing a beard.  Prior to this I was using Billy Jealousy&#x27;s beard was and in my opinion, this product blew that away.  This also had a great cantaloupe scent.  This stuff left my facial hair feeling great.</li>
            <li> smells great... like fresh melon... it lathets up very nicely and leaves your beard very clean. i enjoyed it greatly</li>
            <li> It leaves my beard clean and fresh. Nice product! I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Dude Sweeiit!! Smells great, works great. I would recommend to anyone with a man mane! Number one in my books!!</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Just a drop lathers up nicely.  Thicker than other beard washes I&#x27;ve used.  Not the manliest of scents, but not bad either.  (Very light scent after rinsing actually).  Wish it conditioned and softened my beard more, but I have only been using it for five days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have only used the two beard washes by Bluebeard&#x27;s Original before; the original and the Extra Conditioning.  This is better than the first.  The Bluebeard&#x27;s Original Extra Conditioning beard wash is maybe a little better at softening my beard and has a nicer scent, but this is much better priced.  And it is &amp;#34;flavored&amp;#34; with the cantaloupe...which I don&#x27;t care about one iota until I accidentally got some in my mouth.  My reaction wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;YUMMY&amp;#34;!, but I didn&#x27;t have to immediately have a over-reactive spit take in the shower either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would likely buy again, even though I plan on trying others out.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. It will leave your beard soft. It doesn&#x27;t, however, taste like cantaloupe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if it hits the corners of your mouth it doesn&#x27;t taste like shampoo either.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I used to just use regular shampoo in my beard, but this keeps it softer and smells great.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff makes my beard soft and it goes a long way been using it for years.  Will not leave a bad taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Makes my beard softer and more manageable</li>
            <li> Only moderately improved my beard, and smelled awful while doing so. Whoever named this shampoo has clearly never seen, smelled, or tasted cantaloupe. Overpriced, not very effective, and jarring to the senses? Yeah, pass on this one.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. He loves how soft it makes his beard and he is no longer complaining about having dry skin like when he was using regular shampoo. The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star review is the smell. It smells okay, but he would rather it be more woodsy, less fruity.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves this and his beard smells so good and is much softer.  He said that it even tastes good when it accidentally gets in his mouth.  Can&#x27;t wait to try the other flavors.</li>
            <li> Works like it should, but doesn&#x27;t smell like cantaloupe!</li>
            <li> The smell is unique. A tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is the only beard shampoo I buy. It smells great and really stops my beard from flaking. Great product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t review often, but I thought I&#x27;d write a quick one. I was skeptical about this - I don&#x27;t use a lot of products in general and thought beard shampoo might just be a &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; to sell products. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks, on my beard which is about 7 inches long that I&#x27;ve had for year or so. I met up with a friend this past weekend, who also happens to own his own salon and cuts my hair, and he commented that it looked like I was using something in my beard recently and that it looked a lot less frizzy and crazy, and I would agree!</li>
            <li> arrived on time and the product arrived as expected. Smells delicious and leaves my beard feeling fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo. It leaves his beard clean and soft. Great gift for any occasion. Plus it lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells &#x27;interesting&#x27; (but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger, so no problem if you happen not to like it – although I do). Also very economical: it takes only a tiny amount to get my full-face though not very long beard fully foamed up. I assume the formulation is different from head shampoo, but who cares? It&#x27;s still fun to have along with the beard.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. He uses it for his beard. Love the way it smells and feels after use. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It smells ok and it foams up really nice with just a small amount. I tried Bluebeard&#x27;s before and it worked, but not as well, and I had to use more of it. Plus it never foamed up like this does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in combination with Nivea For Men lotion and jojoba oil. Only thing that stops my beard dandruff.</li>
            <li> It seems to do a fine job washing my beard, but the smell is not very pleasing.  It smells like 2 week old Cantaloupe.  If I could do back I would have spent more money on a different wash.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing shampoo. Softens, cleans, and smells terrific.  A little goes a long way and the bottle last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product! Smells great and it was very gentle on my beard.</li>
            <li> Smells great leaves beard a little tacky</li>
            <li> This is my first review. This wash has the best lather of any beard wash I&#x27;ve tried and a pleasant smell. However it dried out my beard very badly. Split ends like crazy!!! Judging by the many positive reviews I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s just due to my hair type. All I can say if you do try this and you notice your beard starts feeling dry just stop using it. Me being cheap I figured I&#x27;d just use the whole bottle before I bought a new brand. I was about 2/3 finished when I decided just to trim my beard and start over with another beard wash. The lather on this wash alone makes it worth trying but if your beard dosnt agree font be cheap like me. Just stop using it.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for my beard</li>
            <li> This stuff it great, really washes my beard and smells like banana and cream, no joke. I would buy this again. Oh, and just the smallest amount really foams up.</li>
            <li> It smells AWFUL. Don&#x27;t buy into the hype about the taste either. Only barely does the job. Not worth the smell</li>
            <li> Absolutely a great product. I had sebhorric dermatitis and I kept trying different lotions and home remedies that worked for everyone but me. Within two times of trying this, My medium length beard was soft and my skim condition cleared up almost completely. I kept debating on shaving my beard because of my skin condition but this shampoo cleared my skin and boosted my confidence. I do not use it everyday so it never completely cleared it up, however, I have a feeling if I did use it everyday it would. I just started talking biotin 5000 mcg a day and working hand in hand with this shampoo, it&#x27;s completely gone. The scent of the shampoo is great, not too strong but just enough. Thank you so much and I will be ordering again in a couple of months!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have a large Goatee &amp; it only takes a dime size of shampoo to get the job done. It lathers up very well. The smell is just so so. Ultra Beard makes a Wild Berry that might smell better.</li>
            <li> this product is awesome for people w long beards does just what you want it to do plus it smells great and not a bad taste since you use it around you mouth no worry about the ugly soap taste.</li>
            <li> dont like the smell much</li>
            <li> Good Product......smells good and leaves beard feeling soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li> Keeps your beard soft for the day but makes it smell Great.  The lady do love it and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday since I bought it. great smell and my beard looks shiny and manageable. I highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Nice shampo for the beard</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard soft and smelling nice. I like the product and will use it again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the product irritated my skin. Used twice and my skin surrounding my beard became red. Suds up well but didn&#x27;t experience or note any significant improvement in the texture of my beard.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit of this beard shampoo is sufficient.  Leaves my goatee softer and more manageable.  I don&#x27;t really notice an aroma of any kind, but it doesn&#x27;t taste bad if you get a little in your mouth :)  Exceptional value for the price.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The ultra beard shampoo is great stuff for sure. I could tell a difference after one wash. My face pubes have never felt softer.. The sweet taste of the shampoo was a little off putting but I try to avoid getting it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> My husband can&#x27;t stop talking about how much he loves this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I love the cantaloupe smell and if some of it gets in my mouth (like it inevitably does) it doesn&#x27;t make me choke.  I started using this product about four months ago, and I wish I&#x27;d found it years ago.  It lathers very nicely and it leaves my beard very soft.  In the past I used other products that appear to be more popular, but this is the best beard shampoo I&#x27;ve found thus far.  I&#x27;ve worn a beard on and off for about ten years, so I&#x27;ve got some experience.</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff. Been using it for about 2 months. It makes my bear smell and look great. I actually get a lot of complements on my bear and how shiny it is.  I use this this and the Beard Oil that I found on amazon works really great in combination.</li>
            <li> Kind of a weird smell.  It is not that bad.  I would buy it again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;ve used Bluebeard extra conditioning shampoo which seemed to work better for me. I do have dry skin occasionally and my beard is very thick and curly. The Bluebeard tended to help moisturize and soften while cleaning the excess oil, but this shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem to help with the softness of my hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I didn&#x27;t realize how much I hated the smell of cantaloupe. Some people may like it, but I honestly can&#x27;t stand the smell even after several weeks of use. I was excited to try this product but ultimately was disappointed and wished I could have tried another one of their products.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell, so I didn&#x27;t use it long. It did help keep the beard refreshed and clean though</li>
            <li> Smells so good! And does wonders to my beard.</li>
            <li> Smells great, does the job! The shampoo lathers up excellently. I really enjoy the aroma of the cantaloupe and other exotic flavor s.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. smells good and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Second time ordering, this stuff is awesome</li>
