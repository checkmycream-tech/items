            <li>Recommended by my primary care physician and great for keratosis treatment.</li>

            <li>still have some kilatosis pilaris but mostly has resolved.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s literally no treatment that has made it better; including this.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad there is a way to get rid of them.</li>
            <li>I was so sure I was gonna love this stuff</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an OK moisturizing lotion.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin ash free all day!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s mildly smelly, but I can handle it!</li>
            <li>It works great as an all over lotion and my skin looks smoother and feels super soft.</li>
            <li>I had read somewhere that it would help with a certain kind of skin rash, and that it didn&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks my arms are completely smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money for sure</li>
            <li>This was recommended by our doctor, could not find locally, fortunately Amazon came through again with just&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lotion is too light for someone with skin problems like mine.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil works the next best, but is very temporary.  </li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super excited about it.  </li>
            <li>This is great for rough feet also.</li>
            <li>I only apply this at night after a good face wash and sleep with this on</li>
            <li>Great moisture for very dry skin!  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t oily.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, but nice enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING and this is the first thing to get rid of them!</li>
            <li>Yes, it is a lotion, but not any better than the many many lotions I&#x27;ve tried and certainly not better than the ones I make</li>
            <li>Very effective with repeated use, for making keratosis look less noticeable.</li>
            <li>More gentle than straight lactic or glycolic acid.</li>
            <li>but ultimately worth it</li>
            <li>It is a good lotion.&lt;br /&gt;The mediocre:  as stated, this a good lotion, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price tag.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel right, the packaging looks off as well.  </li>
            <li>just know what&#x27;s right for your skin guys</li>
            <li>Better price at Amazon then local drug stores plus fast, easy shipping.</li>
            <li>Extremely effective for dry skin condition</li>
            <li>My husband, however, liked for some very dry patches on his arms.</li>
            <li>It also burns when I first put it on, but that goes away in a couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li>I felt that my keratosis pilaris would be better in a short time using that item.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>my skin was so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>but sure does work well for areas that need deep penetrating moisture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very thick lotion and moisturizes great.</li>
            <li>Not  The same as original formulation (  lactic acid</li>
            <li>Great night moisturizer leaves skin smooth by morning,  not good with makeup because it is a little greasy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other things, but this is the only one that softens my hands eczema.  </li>
            <li>nothing else has worked as good as this stuff thus far but not perfect.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, comparable to far more expensive, high fallutin brands sold at expensive stores.  </li>
            <li>I use it almost everyday and my skin is improved significantly.</li>
            <li>I first found it at cvs for my husbands rough patches on is arms.</li>
            <li>It smells a tad odd at first, but the smell immediately goes away and my skin is soft, supple and it even halted post sunburn peeling.</li>
            <li>I have a feeling that they switched out the real stuff and added some other lotion.  </li>
            <li>The rash was handled properly with a prescription lotion, and I still use this for general use.  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin and have at time developed eczema, but I bought this lotion in hopes of improving the KP, keratosis pilaris, on my arms.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s terribly thick and stays super greasy for hours and hours.</li>

            <li> It does stink but not for long.  </li>
            <li> I doubt they have done studies to show the long term effects of using products like these that contain parabens and whether it disrupts the hormonal system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten other name brand lotions such as Eucerin and they</li>
            <li> But it must be a very minor KP or not KP at all.</li>
            <li> you just be careful guys and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all extremely black and dry</li>
            <li> then I was reading reviews on this other amlactin lotion that had 12% alpha hydroxy in it</li>
            <li> My fault for not catching the size difference, but shady to show the picture of the large bottle when you&#x27;re selling the small one.</li>
            <li> I think we all need to demand healthier products with less preservatives.</li>
            <li> A longer shelf life is not worth a shorter life for us!</li>
            <li> I woke up crying my eyes out guys</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stop crying</li>
            <li> Logic tells me that it&#x27;s not a good idea to use this lotion for very long.</li>
            <li> Thank the lord because it was getting pretty ugly looking untreated...</li>
            <li> their a faint smell, that dissipates quickly (not at all a problem), and while it&#x27;s heavy, I have found it absorbs well without being sticky (even in the midst of a humid summer).  </li>
            <li> me and my dumb butt was got so hyped about the reviews</li>
            <li> I tried prescription stuff and exfoliating (which made it worse).</li>
            <li> Not happy.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m addicted to the this lotion forever.</li>
            <li> btw my skin isn&#x27;t even that sensitive and now I have to start all over again :&#x27;(  this the second time I did something stupid like this</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have any noticeable effect on my KP, and it&#x27;s unlikely I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> It kinda stinks though</li>
            <li> Made me feel very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have had those annoying bumps for years</li>
            <li> This seems to help with bumps on the skin, but I&#x27;m very disappointed by the ingredients in this lotion.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great moisture for very dry skin!  Not greasy.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of acne treatments, and I stumbled upon this.  I use it at night, and I&#x27;ve had the best improvement in my skin yet!  I&#x27;m super excited about it.  Works great on my hands, too!  yeah it&#x27;s mildly smelly, but I can handle it!</li>
            <li> This lotion is great! It absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t oily. The only thing i would change would be the smell - its unscented which is great for those with an allergy to fragrance, but i would love to have a light scent.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with KP all my life. The back of my arms were always bumpy and I was so embarrassed. I tried prescription stuff and exfoliating (which made it worse). Nothing helped.&lt;br /&gt;  I read the reviews on this product and I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. Boy am I glad I did!!  After a couple of weeks my arms are completely smooth. All I need is one pump 2x a day and that&#x27;s enough. You don&#x27;t need wipes or anything but this product. It&#x27;s worth the money for sure</li>
            <li> I have tried many other things, but this is the only one that softens my hands eczema.  It does stink but not for long.  It also burns when I first put it on, but that goes away in a couple of minutes.  Cetaphil works the next best, but is very temporary.  Amlactin is what I will be using from now on.  It now comes in a 14oz. bottle also.</li>
            <li> Just got this, but I have used this same lotion for 10 years</li>
            <li> This seems to help with bumps on the skin, but I&#x27;m very disappointed by the ingredients in this lotion.  It&#x27;s made by a pharmaceutical company so it doesn&#x27;t surprise me that there are a bunch of preservatives/chemicals in it...including multiple parabens, a preservative that has been shown in studies to mimic estrogen in the body. I doubt they have done studies to show the long term effects of using products like these that contain parabens and whether it disrupts the hormonal system. Logic tells me that it&#x27;s not a good idea to use this lotion for very long. Since I&#x27;m breastfeeding, I&#x27;m stopping it immediately.  I think we all need to demand healthier products with less preservatives. A longer shelf life is not worth a shorter life for us!</li>
            <li> Very effective with repeated use, for making keratosis look less noticeable. Smaller, lighter in color, softer feeling.They are almost invisible with regular use. This was a very good investment in skin care!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my dermatologist to help get rid of bumps on the back of my upper arms. I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING and this is the first thing to get rid of them! It works great as an all over lotion and my skin looks smoother and feels super soft.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face at night. I first found it at cvs for my husbands rough patches on is arms. It worked great. Now I use it for exfoliating my skin. My skin has always responded well to lactic acid. This is great for rough feet also. Use post facial roller. More gentle than straight lactic or glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer my skin feels baby soft I love this product and will continue buying for years and years to come.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with kp for 30 years!!. U name it I have used it, or mixed it up. This product is amazing in jus 2 days 35% of the KP on my arms was gone. I would buy this product in gallon size if they make it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s terribly thick and stays super greasy for hours and hours. Made me feel very uncomfortable. My husband, however, liked for some very dry patches on his arms.</li>
            <li> Not a cure for keritosis pilaris. You will still need dedicated exfoliation in your shower every day</li>
            <li> helping my KP. so far so good. It kinda stinks though but ultimately worth it</li>
            <li> I have kp on my face and this seems to have cleared them up I only apply this at night after a good face wash and sleep with this on and it seems to be working. Will buy this again (:</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the actual product.  It doesn&#x27;t feel right, the packaging looks off as well.  I have a feeling that they switched out the real stuff and added some other lotion.  Not happy.  Will not buy from this sell again.</li>
            <li> Lac Hydrin is the best ever.  But the bottle I received is not the one pictured.  8 oz!  It&#x27;s dinky.  My fault for not catching the size difference, but shady to show the picture of the large bottle when you&#x27;re selling the small one.</li>
            <li> A must for winter weather!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people are griping about the smell.  This is a great product, comparable to far more expensive, high fallutin brands sold at expensive stores.  I will buy it again.  It smells a tad odd at first, but the smell immediately goes away and my skin is soft, supple and it even halted post sunburn peeling.</li>
            <li> Extremely effective for dry skin condition</li>
            <li> still have some kilatosis pilaris but mostly has resolved. nothing else has worked as good as this stuff thus far but not perfect.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by our doctor, could not find locally, fortunately Amazon came through again with just&lt;br /&gt;what we needed at a good price.</li>
            <li> Oily &amp; it smells like sulfur and baby puke.</li>
            <li> I use lotion every day, after every shower during all 4 seasons.  I have dry skin and have at time developed eczema, but I bought this lotion in hopes of improving the KP, keratosis pilaris, on my arms.  After 1.5 months of daily use, I have seen no improvement in my KP.  Yes, it is a lotion, but not any better than the many many lotions I&#x27;ve tried and certainly not better than the ones I make myself.&lt;br /&gt;The good: their a faint smell, that dissipates quickly (not at all a problem), and while it&#x27;s heavy, I have found it absorbs well without being sticky (even in the midst of a humid summer).  It is a good lotion.&lt;br /&gt;The mediocre:  as stated, this a good lotion, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price tag.  It didn&#x27;t have any noticeable effect on my KP, and it&#x27;s unlikely I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> But it must be a very minor KP or not KP at all. I have had KP for a while and there&#x27;s literally no treatment that has made it better; including this. I&#x27;m not about to try a 60 dollar bottle either to come with the same result.</li>
            <li> I got this pilaris kitaris and it works great. It also works for eczema when nothing else would. It doesn&#x27;t smell very good but I just spray on a lightweight good smelling moisturizer after I apply this. It&#x27;s a very thick lotion and moisturizes great. I&#x27;ve gotten other name brand lotions such as Eucerin and they just don&#x27;t moisturize like this does. I&#x27;m going to try it on my heels next.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and was told by my doctor to use this cream, but I have not seen any difference.  The lotion is too light for someone with skin problems like mine.</li>
            <li> One day I saw the video clip that advertise that item. I felt that my keratosis pilaris would be better in a short time using that item.&lt;br /&gt;Yes it worked..but that&#x27;s not magician..just lotion that makes my Kp lesser.</li>
            <li> I applied this once a day for about 3 weeks and the &amp;#34;Keratosis pilaris&amp;#34; on my upper arms went away. When I stopped using the product they started to come back, so I guess I have to keep it up, but this bottle will probably last a year so it&#x27;s totally worth it. I have had those annoying bumps for years and I&#x27;m so glad there is a way to get rid of them. A friend saw this product on my counter and mentioned it cured the acne on his back too!</li>
            <li> I always take care of my skin I had the most beautiful flawless skin ever I was using the amlactin in the blue n white bottle with ambi cream every day an my skin was so gorgeous then I was reading reviews on this other amlactin lotion that had 12% alpha hydroxy in it me and my dumb butt was got so hyped about the reviews so I got it at rite aid in two days my skin was so soft and smooth I was so sure I was gonna love this stuff I was even gonna stock up on it smdh! Day 5 ! I woke up crying my eyes out guys my skin was ruined by this stuff I noticed I was starting to itch then it was red the next day I woke up it look like I had burned marks on my body on the side of my face my iner arms my neck it&#x27;s all extremely black and dry I couldn&#x27;t stop crying never go by the good reviews you read this can end up being you just be careful guys and btw my skin isn&#x27;t even that sensitive and now I have to start all over again :&#x27;(  this the second time I did something stupid like this just know what&#x27;s right for your skin guys</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK moisturizing lotion.  I had read somewhere that it would help with a certain kind of skin rash, and that it didn&#x27;t do.  The rash was handled properly with a prescription lotion, and I still use this for general use.  Nothing special, but nice enough.</li>
            <li> Not  The same as original formulation (  lactic acid only  ) its a different formula not the same .</li>
            <li> Pricey for a body lotion but sure does work well for areas that need deep penetrating moisture. My arms and face like it a lot and have used it for over 2 years. Better price at Amazon then local drug stores plus fast, easy shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week or so seems to help with the eczema on the back of my arms.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin ash free all day!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my primary care physician and great for keratosis treatment. I use it almost everyday and my skin is improved significantly. Thank the lord because it was getting pretty ugly looking untreated...</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever! I was already seeing awesome results since The first application. My skin looks and feels great. Now I&#x27;m addicted to the this lotion forever.</li>
            <li> Great night moisturizer leaves skin smooth by morning,  not good with makeup because it is a little greasy.</li>
