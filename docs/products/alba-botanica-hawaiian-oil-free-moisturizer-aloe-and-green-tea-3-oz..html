            <li>/&gt;This is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but you know that your face, neck, etc. are getting a great moisurizer -</li>
            <li>Its great since there are no oils, but it&#x27;s a lot of fragrance.</li>
            <li>Great price on amazon</li>
            <li>so it goes great under make-up.</li>
            <li>It feels great</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling great</li>

            <li>I am thrilled!</li>
            <li>I love this product and this is a great price for it!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pleasant smell if you like fruity.  </li>
            <li>I find this light moisturizer to be the perfect product and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>I found that this product is actually good.</li>
            <li>The reviews were good, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it and it smells really good</li>
            <li>You do have to use good amount to get your face moisturized.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>It smells good and my foundation just glides on to perfection.</li>
            <li>Is a good post shaving moisturizer that does not leave your face looking oily.</li>
            <li>It is ideal to use during the day, and then apply SPF cream on top of it.</li>
            <li>So light and refreshing!!!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this lotion!!!  </li>
            <li>My luck with Alba products has mostly been great with one exception.  </li>
            <li>Great to be able to get this on Amazon because I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else.</li>
            <li>acne continued to break out, even more! :</li>
            <li>I have pretty oily skin, which breaks out a lot, and this is probably the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I am SO pleased with this beauty item!</li>
            <li>... let me say this product is fantastic!!  </li>
            <li>This is a phenomenal moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I tried this moisturizer, it is amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing as well!&lt;br</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF IS AMAZING</li>
            <li>I have searched for many years for a good quality post beard shaving moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Now I know some of you oily-skinned people are gonna wonder how it works with your own shiny dermis.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>I like this moisturizer because it&#x27;s lightweight and absorbs into my skin nicely.</li>
            <li>and it smells nice, will reccomend and buy again.</li>
            <li>Smells so nice</li>
            <li>This is a nice moisturizer, I do wish it had SPF protection.</li>
            <li>This does not make me break out at all, and it dries with a nice matte feeling and look instead of being shiny.</li>
            <li>The beauty of this Alba lotion is that you can use more of it in the winter without looking greasy, it smells so good</li>
            <li>Good product but the smell is kinda strong</li>
            <li>Pleasant light scent</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to return it!</li>
            <li>nice thing about this moisterizer is it was extremely refreshing after applying.  </li>
            <li>My first application wasn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
            <li>I thought it was too good to be true</li>
            <li>Very light, and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Love this product..</li>
            <li>It probably wouldn&#x27;t bother most people at all</li>
            <li>This created more oil.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of it too.  </li>
            <li>product doesn&#x27;t sink into your skin but rather stays on top and leaves your skin feeling oily and</li>
            <li>my skin feel softer :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used, and I forsee this lasting me practically forever.</li>
            <li>Love the way it feels on.</li>
            <li>I will say the product works great and really helps with the dryness when you cannot use a moisturizer with oil in it.  </li>
            <li>It has a light pleasant clean scent.  </li>
            <li>I remembered how well it worked and ordered it to give it a try once more.</li>
            <li>My skin was looking just much better over all.</li>
            <li>I wear it more at night rather than during the day though, but it does well under makeup.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Here is why I love it:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It feels nice and light and has a nice, light scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite fave cream.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this product does the best thing possible for combination skin--</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so lightweight, silky, and smooth!</li>
            <li>The scent is so refreshing</li>
            <li>I recommend to anyone! :)</li>
            <li>Love all Alba products .</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It sat on top of my skin creating a &#x27;slippery&#x27; greasy layer.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>love the smell of the lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>love  </li>
            <li>I am in love with how this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Great price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to use face cream too often because the oils in them would make me break out.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find a better product for my skin/natural product needs.</li>
            <li>Nice light and dewy.</li>
            <li>Will for sure continue to  use these products.</li>
            <li>The SPF I use on top is from RiteAid, it is the 85 proof.</li>
            <li>This would be such a perfect oil-free every day lotion if it did not smell so strong.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been interested in an Alba product with good reviews before.</li>
            <li>light, gentle to skin and a great everday moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is a very light, oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love the light feel and fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This is ideal because sudden absorption on skin can cause clogged pores.</li>
            <li>I love this cream, it is light but yet moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Love this product, its light and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>Great product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and this product works great on my oily, acne-prone, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on a hunt to find a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; oil free moisturizer and its been quite the process</li>
            <li>This seems to be a good all-around moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I happen to think it smells fantastic and has a very clean feel to it upon application.  </li>
            <li>It stung a bit, and had a really strong scent.  </li>
            <li>My exceptions are the strong scent and sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>I have tried every face moisturizer under the sun from high end to drug store and this is by far the BEST!  </li>
            <li>Till now product seems to be working fine for me.</li>
            <li>I am 25 and noticed fine lines forming around my eyes - crow&#x27;s feet and fine lines below.</li>
            <li>these products are super good - so gentle</li>
            <li>I have combination skin prone to light break outs.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Feels light on the skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate.  </li>
            <li>-free</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Oil Free-</li>
            <li>This one is a gel cream that is oil free and has no SPF because I have an SPF built into my foundation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Keeps your skin moisturized and feeling smooth without any oiliness.</li>
            <li>I needed something light to put on before my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Rite-Aid was having a sale on these (buy one get one free, worked out to just under $10 a pop)</li>
            <li>but it actually soaks in well and stays great under makeup.</li>
            <li>Feels light on my skin.</li>
            <li>Even stuff that was oil free.</li>
            <li>and I do feel it wasn&#x27;t a good match with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell and it&#x27;s not that strong</li>
            <li>Love this light feeling moisturizer, it really works!</li>
            <li>I originally tried this product because the \\&quot;oil-free\\&quot; caught my eye.&lt;br /&gt;Having an acne prone skin, I thought this moisturizer would be perfect!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much, words can&#x27;t quite describe it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only did it feel nice and silky on my face, and it soaked in, but it just cleared my face up!</li>
            <li>felt both were too significant to rant the product 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Its worth the money!</li>
            <li>But what I love the most about it, is that it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest, they should label it Alba New York.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s super cheap.</li>
            <li>I have tried many oil free moisturizers because I have a very oily T zone.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make me break out at all, it felt really light and natural on my skin and sank in really nicely.</li>
            <li>and I believe it far better than most any skin oil because it moisturizes...</li>
            <li>I love the natural face creams available for us now, instead of all those chemicals!</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely, clean feeling, not greasy, doesn&#x27;t take a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>The face lotion is light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin this is great.</li>
            <li>I am more of a fruity girl and the flowers were just too much.</li>
            <li>I just feel nice and soft and my skin feels like nothing at all</li>
            <li>I REALLY wanted to love this -</li>
            <li>moisturizer is best comparable to thick water.</li>
            <li>I am 54 and was skeptical that an oil free moisturizer would be OK for my face, but this works great!</li>
            <li>This moisturizer has a light fresh fragrance, and leaves my skin soft and smooth, plus I trust Alba Botanica to use safe ingredients.</li>
            <li>This is a great skin cream, just like all of the other Alba products I use.</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling super soft and smooth, and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>It absorbs into my skin quickly, with no greasy feel at all.</li>
            <li>Tropical smell dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>I use this moisterizer with the Pineapple Enzyme (same brand/ line) facial cleanser every day and night- its the perfect combo!  </li>
            <li>The scent is mild.</li>
            <li>The smell was FANTASTIC, really melon-y and fresh!</li>
            <li>Overall very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>small good!</li>
            <li>The fragrance irritates my sensitive skin as well as my dog nose! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love Alba&#x27;s natural products!</li>
            <li>Just lightly, and quickly tap your finger onto the surface of the moisturizer and that&#x27;s all you&#x27;ll really</li>
            <li>I have had good results with it and it never needs to be reapplied even when my skin is very dry.</li>
            <li>The fragrance isn&#x27;t too strong, and I love that its oil free, because I have extremely oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product from an ethical, cruelty-free company.</li>
            <li>and it also has helped a lot with my undereye puffiness (I believe it&#x27;s because of the green tea that is in it, which is great).</li>
            <li>I love it so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no spf in this, which is actually better for the skin since spf isn&#x27;t really something you want absorbing into your skin.</li>
            <li>Nice moisturizer for time when I was prohibited from using external oil</li>
            <li>and I love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try more of Alba&#x27;s products in the future!  </li>
            <li>It is much richer and it&#x27;s a bit too rich for my skin.</li>
            <li>The cream goes right into my skin and leaves no residue at all.  </li>
            <li>No moisturizer will work without the right prepping routine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 18 and purchased this moisturizer right along with the pineapple enzyme cleanser</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to scent and this one is more than I would like.  </li>
            <li>As someone with extremely oily skin, I&#x27;ve long given up on some \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; product that will leave my skin perfectly matte and plump-- frankly, I think anyone expecting that is delusional.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts (which is easy to do with my sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>It soaks in and then your skin is bone dry again, and when it mixes with my own skin oils it makes my skin 10x greasier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s for sure not runny or watery, it has a nice, thick consistency.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for gentle, oil-free moisture, this is your golden ticket.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy again! :)</li>
            <li>It may work for you, but for someone who tends to have many blocked pores, it&#x27;s definitely not recommended.</li>
            <li>As far as fragrance goes, I believe it&#x27;s pretty light because I can&#x27;t smell it after I put it on.</li>
            <li>My first Alba Botanica was the pineapple enzyme face wash.</li>
            <li>Also one thing most people don&#x27;t know is that you only have about 20 seconds to start prepping your face after you wash your face.</li>
            <li>I will buy it again after finish first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judy</li>
            <li>If you need spf during the day, invest in an actual sunblcok to go on top of your moisturizer, or makeup with spf in it</li>
            <li>and this is the BEST lotion , and I have tried expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I tried to like this product after hearing so many good things about it, and while I really liked the smell, I hate the moisturizer itself.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried at first because the cream has kind of a tropical scent, but the scent goes away right away</li>
            <li>My skin is healthier and my fine lines aren&#x27;t as apparent as they were before.</li>
            <li>Has all natural ingredients and great for dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It is light and offers as much moisturizing as I want.  </li>
            <li>I also love the soft scent and that it is made with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>At first the smell of it was really intoxicating</li>
            <li>To preface: This is my first Alba product ever, and I have combination skin with a very oily t-zone and dehydrated cheeks and mouth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s oil free, so even after a long day my nose doesn&#x27;t feel slick, and it&#x27;s nice and light</li>
            <li>I am a guy, and very particular about what I put on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have oily, mild acne prone, sensitive, combo skin.</li>
            <li>I wish these came in a large jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>The low price and great results this cream is like a hidden gem.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well,does not have greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;  -Very</li>
            <li>She really likes this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I actually ended up buying this from walmart because I was in need of an oil free moisturizer for my face...BADLY and didn&#x27;t want to way 4-5 days for my order to process on here.</li>
            <li>So all in all I really like it.</li>
            <li>this giant seller which makes food snacks, is taking business away from genuine, made-in-Hawaii products by Hawaiians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t control my oil all that much either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also so affordable that I sometimes smother my whole body with it after shower.</li>
            <li>Which is literally what really happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Also, the smell is reminiscent of grocery store branded, cheap hand lotion.</li>
            <li>so you are not going to run out of it too fast.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t use is the eye gel, which is a bit too light for the eye area.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I also really like the light/sweet smell it has.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin and it works really well under makeup.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I bought this because of that fact that oil in most other moisturizers clogs my pores (non-comodegenic or not) and makes me skin break out.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than as shiny as my face would get with other stuff.</li>
            <li>I am very lazy about product reviews when the stuff is good but GUYS.</li>
            <li>Always hard for me to find natural, effective products that are cruelty free and do not destroy my acne prone skin!</li>
            <li>I have had acne since high school and have tried many products, spent lots of money and have never gotten results like this.</li>
            <li>It is super light and is it really silky when you put it on and does not feel heavy at all on your skin.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li>but you might want to be aware if you have allergies or are really sensitive to smells.  </li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s oil free, it moisturizes my dry spots</li>
            <li>I wish it had less fruit and more Tea Tree Oil to the scent.  </li>
            <li>You want the absorbing to be nice and slow.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product every single morning and night.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My skin is very weather sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and also sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, &amp; this is really gentle &amp; soothing.  </li>
            <li>and I love the way green tea makes my skin feel so refreshed.</li>
            <li>I have used this Aloe &amp; Green Tea for almost a year - still love it.</li>
            <li>I used it a few times as a body lotion as well; until I found something more practical.</li>
            <li>i love the green tea moisturizer from PROACTIV</li>
            <li>Normally retails for about $20.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it, I can&#x27; live without it.</li>
            <li>It seems to be very rich, but not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>It sinks in well and leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for sensitive skin and even oily skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about every product out there because I am easily swayed by advertisements for new organic facial products, but I always come back to this line.</li>
            <li>Scent is mild and doesn&#x27;t stay long.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is really silky and nice, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am on the hunt for a new moisterizer, as I probably won&#x27;t continue to use this.  </li>
            <li>As I am ALWAYS looking for new product because I can never seem to find one that works with my skin.</li>
            <li>I ordered from Amazon and my order was fulfilled timely and in new condition as promised.</li>
            <li>I use it in the summer and in the winter- light enough in the heat yet moisturizing enough in the winter</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and am sensitive to scent as well, this has such a mild scent that goes away after you put it on and</li>
            <li>Most oil-control products do not moisturize the dry parts of combination skin (since a lot them contain alcohol), and most moisturizing products make the t-zone worse.</li>
            <li>but this product brought MORE excessive oil onto my face even in areas where I normally don&#x27;t get oily.</li>
            <li>and it has kept my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The first time I used it at night, I used it before going to bed and when I woke up the next morning, my face was noticeably clearer.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before in the past and everything was okay.</li>
            <li>It really regulates my breakouts, I barely get them</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Which is great because I absolutely despised anything in my face because it always felt clumpy heavy and thick on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with Bare Minerals powder foundation and really like it.</li>
            <li>and maybe it happened to be one of those days that my skin decided to clear uyp on</li>
            <li>It is silky, absorbs well, and leaves my skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and not oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy at all and just leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just testing the waters with natural oil-free moisturizers and I read the reviews for this and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t really make my face feel moisturized enough.  </li>
            <li>I was so surprised.</li>
            <li>All natural is a plus</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin soft and moisturized, but it absorbs in without leaving any greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>Aloe and Green tea oil free moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin completely STOPPED getting oily one day.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin to begin with, so I was a bit hesitant when I noticed it was &amp;#34;oil-free&amp;#34; as I wanted SOME moisture, and I always assumed you had to have some natural oils</li>
            <li>I was fighting to find a natural moisturizer and this one did the trick.  </li>
            <li>and I looked for something that would be mostly natural, oil-free, moisturizing, and wouldn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>That regiment keeps me clear, soft, and smelling like the tropics.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also sensitive to everything.</li>
            <li>So far I like it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on the skin and the only face cream that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>Leaves your face soft</li>
            <li>Very light and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The cream is pretty thick yet goes on easily and really, just a small amount on my fingertip is plenty for my whole face.  </li>
            <li>I have tried seriously almost every natural acne product and most natural moisturizer - this was purchased to keep my skin hydrated but it ended up doing the opposite.</li>
            <li>have normal skin with no acne or scaring, and it&#x27;s not very sensitive, so I can&#x27;t speak to how it will do for the sensitive folks out there.</li>
            <li>probably has not gave enough time for their skin to response to new chemical agent.  </li>
            <li>I have a very oily t-zone while the rest of my face is dry to the point of flakey.  </li>
            <li>I feel both are more personal to me than a negative for the product but</li>
            <li>So I purchased it (and I cringed at the thought of spending 15 bucks on a small container of moisturizer), and applied it to my clean face in the morning and before bed.</li>
            <li>I continued using the moisturizer twice a day for a week and my face just stayed clear for the entire week.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need it because I am releasing my natural oil to combat the outside element&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tilted the jar to the side to see what it was like, and it barely moves.</li>
            <li>I had been using it for so long and couldnt believe I wouldnt need to switch it up like normal and</li>
            <li>but when I&#x27;m done with this one ill definitely buy some more!</li>
            <li>I love the smell and texture but even though it says wont clog pores it does have a little heavy feeling/oily feeling to it.</li>
            <li>All natural- has an overall 4.9 rating on the goodguide.com, low concern for toxic chemicals&lt;</li>
            <li>Alba Botanica Aloe Green Tea moisterizer does not leave a oily residue and is absorbed into the facial skin</li>
            <li>My skin soaks it right in but you only need a little bit of it.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes pretty well, but formula is a bit tacky and takes a little time to fully absorb.</li>
            <li>I usually wait until the Alba lotion is 90% absorbed in skin before putting the additional SPF on.</li>
            <li>face is very sensitive, dry and oily at the same time</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think 3oz of this stuff would be enough to last me very long but a little really goes a long way.</li>
            <li>After trying lots of other high end products on my skin but with no results I decided to give a try to Alba Botnica.</li>
            <li>The subtle and clean scent is refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it hydrates the dry parts, and HELPS with the oil in the oil parts, even though it doesn&#x27;t eliminate it completely.</li>
            <li>Talk about combo skin - I have acne prone, sensitive and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>If anything, breakouts are less common, definitely not breaking out more.</li>
            <li>Also it has a nice subtle scent which diminishes after a few moments !</li>
            <li>It might be a little heavy for those with acne-prone skin, even though it is oil free.</li>
            <li>stuff is definitely worth the money, and it WILL last you quite a long time since a little DOES go a long way.</li>

            <li> acne continued to break out, even more! :</li>
            <li> I have pretty oily skin, which breaks out a lot, and this is probably the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff!</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I tried this moisturizer, it is amazing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing as well!&lt;br</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING</li>
            <li> I have searched for many years for a good quality post beard shaving moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Now I know some of you oily-skinned people are gonna wonder how it works with your own shiny dermis.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer because it&#x27;s lightweight and absorbs into my skin nicely.</li>
            <li> and it smells nice, will reccomend and buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells so nice</li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizer, I do wish it had SPF protection.</li>
            <li> This does not make me break out at all, and it dries with a nice matte feeling and look instead of being shiny.</li>
            <li> The beauty of this Alba lotion is that you can use more of it in the winter without looking greasy, it smells so good</li>
            <li> Good product but the smell is kinda strong</li>
            <li> Pleasant light scent</li>
            <li> Glad I was able to return it!</li>
            <li> nice thing about this moisterizer is it was extremely refreshing after applying.  </li>
            <li> My first application wasn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
            <li> I thought it was too good to be true</li>
            <li> Very light, and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Love this product..</li>
            <li> It probably wouldn&#x27;t bother most people at all</li>
            <li> This created more oil.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of it too.  </li>
            <li> product doesn&#x27;t sink into your skin but rather stays on top and leaves your skin feeling oily and</li>
            <li> my skin feel softer :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used, and I forsee this lasting me practically forever.</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels on.</li>
            <li> I will say the product works great and really helps with the dryness when you cannot use a moisturizer with oil in it.  </li>
            <li> It has a light pleasant clean scent.  </li>
            <li> I remembered how well it worked and ordered it to give it a try once more.</li>
            <li> My skin was looking just much better over all.</li>
            <li> I wear it more at night rather than during the day though, but it does well under makeup.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Here is why I love it:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It feels nice and light and has a nice, light scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite fave cream.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this product does the best thing possible for combination skin--</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so lightweight, silky, and smooth!</li>
            <li> The scent is so refreshing</li>
            <li> I recommend to anyone! :)</li>
            <li> Love all Alba products .</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It sat on top of my skin creating a &#x27;slippery&#x27; greasy layer.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> love the smell of the lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li> love  </li>
            <li> I am in love with how this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use face cream too often because the oils in them would make me break out.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find a better product for my skin/natural product needs.</li>
            <li> Nice light and dewy.</li>
            <li> Will for sure continue to  use these products.</li>
            <li> The SPF I use on top is from RiteAid, it is the 85 proof.</li>
            <li> This would be such a perfect oil-free every day lotion if it did not smell so strong.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been interested in an Alba product with good reviews before.</li>
            <li> light, gentle to skin and a great everday moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is a very light, oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love the light feel and fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This is ideal because sudden absorption on skin can cause clogged pores.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, it is light but yet moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Love this product, its light and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> Great product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and this product works great on my oily, acne-prone, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a hunt to find a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; oil free moisturizer and its been quite the process</li>
            <li> This seems to be a good all-around moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I happen to think it smells fantastic and has a very clean feel to it upon application.  </li>
            <li> It stung a bit, and had a really strong scent.  </li>
            <li> My exceptions are the strong scent and sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every face moisturizer under the sun from high end to drug store and this is by far the BEST!  </li>
            <li> Till now product seems to be working fine for me.</li>
            <li> I am 25 and noticed fine lines forming around my eyes - crow&#x27;s feet and fine lines below.</li>
            <li> these products are super good - so gentle</li>
            <li> I have combination skin prone to light break outs.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Feels light on the skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate.  </li>
            <li> -free</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Oil Free-</li>
            <li> This one is a gel cream that is oil free and has no SPF because I have an SPF built into my foundation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Keeps your skin moisturized and feeling smooth without any oiliness.</li>
            <li> I needed something light to put on before my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Rite-Aid was having a sale on these (buy one get one free, worked out to just under $10 a pop)</li>
            <li> but it actually soaks in well and stays great under makeup.</li>
            <li> Feels light on my skin.</li>
            <li> Even stuff that was oil free.</li>
            <li> and I do feel it wasn&#x27;t a good match with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell and it&#x27;s not that strong</li>
            <li> Love this light feeling moisturizer, it really works!</li>
            <li> I originally tried this product because the \\&quot;oil-free\\&quot; caught my eye.&lt;br /&gt;Having an acne prone skin, I thought this moisturizer would be perfect!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much, words can&#x27;t quite describe it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only did it feel nice and silky on my face, and it soaked in, but it just cleared my face up!</li>
            <li> felt both were too significant to rant the product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Its worth the money!</li>
            <li> But what I love the most about it, is that it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest, they should label it Alba New York.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s super cheap.</li>
            <li> I have tried many oil free moisturizers because I have a very oily T zone.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make me break out at all, it felt really light and natural on my skin and sank in really nicely.</li>
            <li> and I believe it far better than most any skin oil because it moisturizes...</li>
            <li> I love the natural face creams available for us now, instead of all those chemicals!</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely, clean feeling, not greasy, doesn&#x27;t take a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> The face lotion is light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin this is great.</li>
            <li> I am more of a fruity girl and the flowers were just too much.</li>
            <li> I just feel nice and soft and my skin feels like nothing at all</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to love this -</li>
            <li> moisturizer is best comparable to thick water.</li>
            <li> I am 54 and was skeptical that an oil free moisturizer would be OK for my face, but this works great!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has a light fresh fragrance, and leaves my skin soft and smooth, plus I trust Alba Botanica to use safe ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is a great skin cream, just like all of the other Alba products I use.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling super soft and smooth, and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> It absorbs into my skin quickly, with no greasy feel at all.</li>
            <li> Tropical smell dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li> I use this moisterizer with the Pineapple Enzyme (same brand/ line) facial cleanser every day and night- its the perfect combo!  </li>
            <li> The scent is mild.</li>
            <li> The smell was FANTASTIC, really melon-y and fresh!</li>
            <li> Overall very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> small good!</li>
            <li> The fragrance irritates my sensitive skin as well as my dog nose! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love Alba&#x27;s natural products!</li>
            <li> Just lightly, and quickly tap your finger onto the surface of the moisturizer and that&#x27;s all you&#x27;ll really</li>
            <li> I have had good results with it and it never needs to be reapplied even when my skin is very dry.</li>
            <li> The fragrance isn&#x27;t too strong, and I love that its oil free, because I have extremely oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product from an ethical, cruelty-free company.</li>
            <li> and it also has helped a lot with my undereye puffiness (I believe it&#x27;s because of the green tea that is in it, which is great).</li>
            <li> I love it so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no spf in this, which is actually better for the skin since spf isn&#x27;t really something you want absorbing into your skin.</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer for time when I was prohibited from using external oil</li>
            <li> and I love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to try more of Alba&#x27;s products in the future!  </li>
            <li> It is much richer and it&#x27;s a bit too rich for my skin.</li>
            <li> The cream goes right into my skin and leaves no residue at all.  </li>
            <li> No moisturizer will work without the right prepping routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 18 and purchased this moisturizer right along with the pineapple enzyme cleanser</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to scent and this one is more than I would like.  </li>
            <li> As someone with extremely oily skin, I&#x27;ve long given up on some \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; product that will leave my skin perfectly matte and plump-- frankly, I think anyone expecting that is delusional.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts (which is easy to do with my sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li> It soaks in and then your skin is bone dry again, and when it mixes with my own skin oils it makes my skin 10x greasier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for sure not runny or watery, it has a nice, thick consistency.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for gentle, oil-free moisture, this is your golden ticket.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again! :)</li>
            <li> It may work for you, but for someone who tends to have many blocked pores, it&#x27;s definitely not recommended.</li>
            <li> As far as fragrance goes, I believe it&#x27;s pretty light because I can&#x27;t smell it after I put it on.</li>
            <li> My first Alba Botanica was the pineapple enzyme face wash.</li>
            <li> Also one thing most people don&#x27;t know is that you only have about 20 seconds to start prepping your face after you wash your face.</li>
            <li> I will buy it again after finish first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judy</li>
            <li> If you need spf during the day, invest in an actual sunblcok to go on top of your moisturizer, or makeup with spf in it</li>
            <li> and this is the BEST lotion , and I have tried expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I tried to like this product after hearing so many good things about it, and while I really liked the smell, I hate the moisturizer itself.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried at first because the cream has kind of a tropical scent, but the scent goes away right away</li>
            <li> My skin is healthier and my fine lines aren&#x27;t as apparent as they were before.</li>
            <li> Has all natural ingredients and great for dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It is light and offers as much moisturizing as I want.  </li>
            <li> I also love the soft scent and that it is made with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> At first the smell of it was really intoxicating</li>
            <li> To preface: This is my first Alba product ever, and I have combination skin with a very oily t-zone and dehydrated cheeks and mouth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oil free, so even after a long day my nose doesn&#x27;t feel slick, and it&#x27;s nice and light</li>
            <li> I am a guy, and very particular about what I put on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have oily, mild acne prone, sensitive, combo skin.</li>
            <li> I wish these came in a large jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> The low price and great results this cream is like a hidden gem.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes very well,does not have greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;  -Very</li>
            <li> She really likes this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I actually ended up buying this from walmart because I was in need of an oil free moisturizer for my face...BADLY and didn&#x27;t want to way 4-5 days for my order to process on here.</li>
            <li> So all in all I really like it.</li>
            <li> this giant seller which makes food snacks, is taking business away from genuine, made-in-Hawaii products by Hawaiians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t control my oil all that much either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also so affordable that I sometimes smother my whole body with it after shower.</li>
            <li> Which is literally what really happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Also, the smell is reminiscent of grocery store branded, cheap hand lotion.</li>
            <li> so you are not going to run out of it too fast.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t use is the eye gel, which is a bit too light for the eye area.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> I also really like the light/sweet smell it has.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin and it works really well under makeup.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I bought this because of that fact that oil in most other moisturizers clogs my pores (non-comodegenic or not) and makes me skin break out.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better than as shiny as my face would get with other stuff.</li>
            <li> I am very lazy about product reviews when the stuff is good but GUYS.</li>
            <li> Always hard for me to find natural, effective products that are cruelty free and do not destroy my acne prone skin!</li>
            <li> I have had acne since high school and have tried many products, spent lots of money and have never gotten results like this.</li>
            <li> It is super light and is it really silky when you put it on and does not feel heavy at all on your skin.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li> but you might want to be aware if you have allergies or are really sensitive to smells.  </li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s oil free, it moisturizes my dry spots</li>
            <li> I wish it had less fruit and more Tea Tree Oil to the scent.  </li>
            <li> You want the absorbing to be nice and slow.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product every single morning and night.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My skin is very weather sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and also sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, &amp; this is really gentle &amp; soothing.  </li>
            <li> and I love the way green tea makes my skin feel so refreshed.</li>
            <li> I have used this Aloe &amp; Green Tea for almost a year - still love it.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times as a body lotion as well; until I found something more practical.</li>
            <li> i love the green tea moisturizer from PROACTIV</li>
            <li> Normally retails for about $20.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend it, I can&#x27; live without it.</li>
            <li> It seems to be very rich, but not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> It sinks in well and leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for sensitive skin and even oily skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every product out there because I am easily swayed by advertisements for new organic facial products, but I always come back to this line.</li>
            <li> Scent is mild and doesn&#x27;t stay long.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is really silky and nice, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am on the hunt for a new moisterizer, as I probably won&#x27;t continue to use this.  </li>
            <li> As I am ALWAYS looking for new product because I can never seem to find one that works with my skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered from Amazon and my order was fulfilled timely and in new condition as promised.</li>
            <li> I use it in the summer and in the winter- light enough in the heat yet moisturizing enough in the winter</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am sensitive to scent as well, this has such a mild scent that goes away after you put it on and</li>
            <li> Most oil-control products do not moisturize the dry parts of combination skin (since a lot them contain alcohol), and most moisturizing products make the t-zone worse.</li>
            <li> but this product brought MORE excessive oil onto my face even in areas where I normally don&#x27;t get oily.</li>
            <li> and it has kept my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The first time I used it at night, I used it before going to bed and when I woke up the next morning, my face was noticeably clearer.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before in the past and everything was okay.</li>
            <li> It really regulates my breakouts, I barely get them</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Which is great because I absolutely despised anything in my face because it always felt clumpy heavy and thick on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with Bare Minerals powder foundation and really like it.</li>
            <li> and maybe it happened to be one of those days that my skin decided to clear uyp on</li>
            <li> It is silky, absorbs well, and leaves my skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and not oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy at all and just leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just testing the waters with natural oil-free moisturizers and I read the reviews for this and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t really make my face feel moisturized enough.  </li>
            <li> I was so surprised.</li>
            <li> All natural is a plus</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin soft and moisturized, but it absorbs in without leaving any greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> Aloe and Green tea oil free moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin completely STOPPED getting oily one day.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin to begin with, so I was a bit hesitant when I noticed it was &amp;#34;oil-free&amp;#34; as I wanted SOME moisture, and I always assumed you had to have some natural oils</li>
            <li> I was fighting to find a natural moisturizer and this one did the trick.  </li>
            <li> and I looked for something that would be mostly natural, oil-free, moisturizing, and wouldn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> That regiment keeps me clear, soft, and smelling like the tropics.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s also sensitive to everything.</li>
            <li> So far I like it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on the skin and the only face cream that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face soft</li>
            <li> Very light and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The cream is pretty thick yet goes on easily and really, just a small amount on my fingertip is plenty for my whole face.  </li>
            <li> I have tried seriously almost every natural acne product and most natural moisturizer - this was purchased to keep my skin hydrated but it ended up doing the opposite.</li>
            <li> have normal skin with no acne or scaring, and it&#x27;s not very sensitive, so I can&#x27;t speak to how it will do for the sensitive folks out there.</li>
            <li> probably has not gave enough time for their skin to response to new chemical agent.  </li>
            <li> I have a very oily t-zone while the rest of my face is dry to the point of flakey.  </li>
            <li> I feel both are more personal to me than a negative for the product but</li>
            <li> So I purchased it (and I cringed at the thought of spending 15 bucks on a small container of moisturizer), and applied it to my clean face in the morning and before bed.</li>
            <li> I continued using the moisturizer twice a day for a week and my face just stayed clear for the entire week.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need it because I am releasing my natural oil to combat the outside element&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tilted the jar to the side to see what it was like, and it barely moves.</li>
            <li> I had been using it for so long and couldnt believe I wouldnt need to switch it up like normal and</li>
            <li> but when I&#x27;m done with this one ill definitely buy some more!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and texture but even though it says wont clog pores it does have a little heavy feeling/oily feeling to it.</li>
            <li> All natural- has an overall 4.9 rating on the goodguide.com, low concern for toxic chemicals&lt;</li>
            <li> Alba Botanica Aloe Green Tea moisterizer does not leave a oily residue and is absorbed into the facial skin</li>
            <li> My skin soaks it right in but you only need a little bit of it.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes pretty well, but formula is a bit tacky and takes a little time to fully absorb.</li>
            <li> I usually wait until the Alba lotion is 90% absorbed in skin before putting the additional SPF on.</li>
            <li> face is very sensitive, dry and oily at the same time</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think 3oz of this stuff would be enough to last me very long but a little really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> After trying lots of other high end products on my skin but with no results I decided to give a try to Alba Botnica.</li>
            <li> The subtle and clean scent is refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it hydrates the dry parts, and HELPS with the oil in the oil parts, even though it doesn&#x27;t eliminate it completely.</li>
            <li> Talk about combo skin - I have acne prone, sensitive and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> If anything, breakouts are less common, definitely not breaking out more.</li>
            <li> Also it has a nice subtle scent which diminishes after a few moments !</li>
            <li> It might be a little heavy for those with acne-prone skin, even though it is oil free.</li>
            <li> stuff is definitely worth the money, and it WILL last you quite a long time since a little DOES go a long way.</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic and a little jar goes a long way because you need so little of it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it, and love that it&#x27;s all natural, but it didn&#x27;t work for my sensitive and acne-prone skin. :(</li>
            <li> Whenever my skin is a little red, this product just calms it right down.  </li>
            <li> This used to be a fabulous product well worth the money, but not any longer. :(</li>
            <li> long lasting, don&#x27;t let the 3oz fool you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally I have to change my skin care routine up a few times a year</li>
            <li> Since I started using it, I&#x27;ve had no weird, dry patches on my face that often plagued my skin, and very, very few pimples.</li>
            <li> I grabbed this on a whim because my current moisturizer was leaving my cheeks dry to the point of flaking</li>
            <li> Not recommended for teenage skin unless it is extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I was initially hesitant to pay so much for it, but in comparison to other oil free moisturizers, this one is about the same cost, &amp; isn&#x27;t full of harsh chemicals, fillers, &amp; other crap that clogs your pores up.  </li>
            <li> It can make your face feel a little greasy throughout the day, but it is far less than any of the other natural items I have tried.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, at least for me, and it is very much worth the price.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time!</li>
            <li> The jar lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Other products make my checks so red after shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side but one jar lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> This product made me want to use it even when my skin didn&#x27;t feel dry.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, this will be your &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin is every dry and have freckles.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin with dry patches.</li>
            <li> This is a big plus for me because I do not enjoy putting any chemicals on my face, especially in my cleanser and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a week and no new breakouts.</li>
            <li> Alas, beggars can&#x27;t be choosers ;-)</li>
            <li> cream goes on a little heavy, but after a few minutes it absorbs completely, leaving my skin soft and hydrated and not at ALL greasy to the touch.</li>
            <li> I think I use less a dime-sized amount to cover my entire face.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry face</li>
            <li> I have very very dry skin and this combats that without leaving an oily feeling all over my face.</li>
            <li> You only need a little dab; if you over-apply your skin can feel sticky.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like a lot of other moisturizers</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is that it does not contain any sunscreen which is important year round</li>
            <li> I have started using this product for last few days</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to go to drastic measures (chemical peels, laser treatment, etc), and I noticed that when I used green tea moisturizer it definitely helped.</li>
            <li> You want to slab on the serum when toner is still wet.</li>
            <li> No itchiness or rough spots where it would wear off.</li>
            <li> Just remember that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little but goes a really long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have since switched to only applying it outside of my t-zone, and while I still discover oil the next morning, it isn&#x27;t near as bad as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It smelled like flowers and I couldn&#x27;t get past it enough to keep it once I smelled it.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s pretty expensive; I&#x27;m in college</li>
            <li> A small amount covers a lot, so don&#x27;t take a big scoop of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other lotions</li>
            <li> (I haven&#x27;t tried it with any other foundation products).  </li>
            <li> I exfoliate every other day &amp; apply this afterward, as well as after getting out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> After about 30 minutes, my skin was extremely oily, shiny &amp; greasy looking.</li>
            <li> but yet makes your skin extremely oily.</li>
            <li> A little does go a very long way.</li>
            <li> down fall is that little does NOT go long way.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin; it reacts poorly to almost everything (including hard water), it is dry in spots and oily in others, and it definitely sees a blemish from time to time.</li>
            <li> Especially those nights following a toner that can sometimes leave that sting behind.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin and have found that a lot of &amp;#34;combination&amp;#34; products are either too heavy for my t-zone or dry out my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I am trying to break away from using so many nasty ingredients on my skin, but I was also quite addicted to proactiv because I do have mild breakouts.</li>
            <li> This is a hard product to review because people&#x27;s needs, opinions, &amp; skin types are so different.  </li>
            <li> Just a small bit on the tip of your finger goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li> Unlike most products for &#x27;troubled&#x27; skin, which contain harsh salicycle acid, this product doesn&#x27;t make my break-outs worse at all.</li>
            <li> I had used previous moisturizers in the past like Clinique, but they were too oily and often made me break out instead of fixing my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Night cream typically has that ability to absorb at slower speed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ( Typically toner and serum).</li>
            <li> You want to put on toner when your face is slightly damp.</li>
            <li> As I wrote previously relating to the cleanser -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for over a month and not even half gone</li>
            <li> The jars were not boxed but instead arrived in Saran wrap; upon removing the wrap, I discovered that the jars had been previously opened.  </li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s you and you are wondering why your skin is a mess.</li>
            <li> but little watery.</li>
            <li> How little you ask?</li>
            <li> A little goes a longgggg way with this product.</li>
            <li> Little dab isn&#x27;t going to spread to well all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When serum gets little sticky then you put on a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> the little scent it has smells</li>
            <li> The Sea renewal cream was way too oily and harsh on my skin.  </li>
            <li> after using this product a few times I noticed a few things...</li>
            <li> Maybe my face needed a few days to acclimate</li>
            <li> The green tea &amp; aloe moisturizer leaves my skin supple and hydrated but not oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with green tea &amp; aloe.</li>
            <li> With Alba Botanica Aloe &amp; Green Tea oil</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for a couple of years and it does the job without being heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> I got this product a few days ago</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday twice a day</li>
            <li> My forehead, temples, nose and chin are a constant oil slick and my cheeks are always so dry I have to exfoliate four days a week for reduce peeling (ugh TMI, sorry)</li>
            <li> Summer time I am very oily and during winter time I start peeling like after a bad sun burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if there was a change in the ingredients, but I must say that I cannot use the product anymore.</li>
            <li> It was such a fail for me that I didn&#x27;t buy another Alba Botanica products after for awhile.</li>
            <li> One jar has lasted me months, and I use it every night (putting small dots on my face, in sections).</li>
            <li> The moisturizer was runny instead of its usual consistency.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a must have for those of us with complicated faces.</li>
            <li> I usually have oily skin but with this product my skin has smoothed out</li>
            <li> I usually have blocked pores with hard keratinized skin/oil blocking my pores.</li>
            <li> and I have a hard time finding products that do not leave my face feeling oily.</li>
            <li> or my skin seems dull</li>
            <li> (I am an unfortunate sufferer of that infamous adult acne around the mouth and chin area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even moisturize, at least not for me.</li>
            <li> I read the negative reviews and decided to try it</li>
            <li> I still have to blot my face mid-day to remove excess oil, but at least this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t add to the problem.</li>
            <li> Too late.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have combination/ oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Face wash is creamy leaving a thick film over your face.</li>
            <li> mean, I still break out</li>
            <li> I had used Hope in a Jar for years but decided to look around for something less expensive and tried this.  </li>
            <li> and I was ultimately let after being shocked with these negative results.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately there just aren&#x27;t a lot of moisterizers with green tea, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have a very hard time finding a moisterizer.  </li>
            <li> Granted, it didn&#x27;t appear to clog pores, nor make my acne worse</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t solve oily skin, but it doesn&#x27;t make it worse either.</li>
            <li> my skin got so much worse.  </li>
            <li> I have owned this approximately 2 hours.</li>
            <li> Not great at moisturizing either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now runny instead of thick, and the scent is unpleasant.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is useless after 1 hour.</li>
            <li> But no, I was wrong... and thank goodness.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> and I start getting worse blackheads and breakouts- not with this moisterizer!  </li>
            <li> I have tried switching just based on the mere fact</li>
            <li> but its too expensive</li>
            <li> I kept on using it because I hated the moisturizer I bought at a department store previously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see how my skin holds up in the cold Michigan weather.</li>
            <li> My skin has never every gotten so bad from a moisturizer before -</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyone who has given a bad rating</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s  ugly head.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t afford to buy it again. :(</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 years and never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed and threw both jars away, fearful that the contents might somehow have been tampered with.  </li>
            <li> SO disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was disgusted.  </li>
            <li> Terrible for acne prone skin like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even during my worst breakout, this product didn&#x27;t aggravate the acne at all.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product.. So light and refreshing!!!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin prone to light break outs. I find this light moisturizer to be the perfect product and have been using it for years. It is silky, absorbs well, and leaves my skin incredibly soft. Although I use it daily, a jar lasts forever since I only need a tiny amount. Fantastic product from an ethical, cruelty-free company.</li>
            <li> This product made me want to use it even when my skin didn&#x27;t feel dry. It smells amazing, and it is very moisturizing. I have oily skin and use this product at night, so I can&#x27;t say how it would be under makeup.</li>
            <li> Love the light feel and fragrance.  Leaves my skin soft and not oily.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin. The only thing about it that bothers me at all is the smell. It&#x27;s not a bad smell and it&#x27;s not that strong but I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to scents. It probably wouldn&#x27;t bother most people at all but you might want to be aware if you have allergies or are really sensitive to smells.  I only mention it because I suffer from migraines and scents can be a trigger for me. The product works wonderful for my skin and I love the way green tea makes my skin feel so refreshed.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a good all-around moisturizer.  I use it at night, as I like my day products to contain an spf.  It sinks in well and leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth.  It doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts (which is easy to do with my sensitive skin).  My luck with Alba products has mostly been great with one exception.  The Sea renewal cream was way too oily and harsh on my skin.  Other than that, I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.  If you are looking for gentle, oil-free moisture, this is your golden ticket.</li>
            <li> Good product but the smell is kinda strong</li>
            <li> I bought this at the health food store and the only reason I didn&#x27;t like it was because of the smell. It smelled like flowers and I couldn&#x27;t get past it enough to keep it once I smelled it. I am more of a fruity girl and the flowers were just too much.</li>
            <li> I have searched for many years for a good quality post beard shaving moisturizer.  This is the best that I have ever found and used.  It lasts all day, with zero skin irritation.  And, a second application before bedtime prepares my face for shaving in the morning.  I have used the product successfully for 3+ years.</li>
            <li> I had used Hope in a Jar for years but decided to look around for something less expensive and tried this.  I could not be happier with it.  The cream is pretty thick yet goes on easily and really, just a small amount on my fingertip is plenty for my whole face.  I was a little worried at first because the cream has kind of a tropical scent, but the scent goes away right away and you smell nothing at all during the day.  The cream goes right into my skin and leaves no residue at all.  I just feel nice and soft and my skin feels like nothing at all is on it.  This is a great skin cream, just like all of the other Alba products I use.</li>
            <li> After trying lots of other high end products on my skin but with no results I decided to give a try to Alba Botnica.I have started using this product for last few days I found that this product is actually good.It moisturizes very well,does not have greasy feeling.Till now product seems to be working fine for me.</li>
            <li> I have a very hard time finding a moisterizer.  I have a very oily t-zone while the rest of my face is dry to the point of flakey.  A word of caution if you already have oily prone skin... This created more oil.  I only used it at night and when I woke the next morning I was shoked at the sheen of oil covering my entire face.  I was disgusted.  Granted, it didn&#x27;t appear to clog pores, nor make my acne worse (I am an unfortunate sufferer of that infamous adult acne around the mouth and chin area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice thing about this moisterizer is it was extremely refreshing after applying.  Especially those nights following a toner that can sometimes leave that sting behind.  I love the smell of it too.  I have since switched to only applying it outside of my t-zone, and while I still discover oil the next morning, it isn&#x27;t near as bad as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on the hunt for a new moisterizer, as I probably won&#x27;t continue to use this.  Unfortunately there just aren&#x27;t a lot of moisterizers with green tea, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy I tried this moisturizer, it is amazing. At first I didn&#x27;t think 3oz of this stuff would be enough to last me very long but a little really goes a long way. My skin soaks it right in but you only need a little bit of it. I think I use less a dime-sized amount to cover my entire face. It&#x27;s not greasy at all and just leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft. The first time I used it at night, I used it before going to bed and when I woke up the next morning, my face was noticeably clearer. It even helped diminish my pimples.</li>
            <li> I am 25 and noticed fine lines forming around my eyes - crow&#x27;s feet and fine lines below. I wanted them reduced. I didn&#x27;t want to go to drastic measures (chemical peels, laser treatment, etc), and I noticed that when I used green tea moisturizer it definitely helped. Well, I only had a teeny sample size and it was running out. I searched for similar products and found this one. The reviews were good, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this. I&#x27;ve had it for 3 weeks now and it&#x27;s made a difference. My skin is healthier and my fine lines aren&#x27;t as apparent as they were before. Now I know some of you oily-skinned people are gonna wonder how it works with your own shiny dermis. I&#x27;m here to tell you that I am one of you. I&#x27;ve battled oily skin and acne since I was 13, and neither has let up. This product doesn&#x27;t solve oily skin, but it doesn&#x27;t make it worse either. It also doesn&#x27;t clog pores so it won&#x27;t make you break out. Just remember that a little goes a long way. Cheers and good luck!</li>
            <li> small good! but little watery.</li>
            <li> I originally tried this product because the \\&quot;oil-free\\&quot; caught my eye.&lt;br /&gt;Having an acne prone skin, I thought this moisturizer would be perfect!&lt;br /&gt;But after using this product a few times I noticed a few things...&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;  -This product doesn&#x27;t sink into your skin but rather stays on top and leaves your skin feeling oily and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;  -My acne continued to break out, even more! :(&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;  -Made my skin feel softer :)&lt;br /&gt;  -Very long lasting, don&#x27;t let the 3oz fool you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: I stopped using this product after using about 1/4 of it. But hey, everyone has a different type of skin.&lt;br /&gt;  If you feel that this moisturizer might be the one for you, go on and try it!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once but I can already see the difference! I have a very dry face and I have a hard time finding products that do not leave my face feeling oily. This was perfect! Will definitely buy again! :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a Christmas present for my daughter... per her request!  She really likes this moisturizer.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This would be such a perfect oil-free every day lotion if it did not smell so strong. The fragrance irritates my sensitive skin as well as my dog nose! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much, words can&#x27;t quite describe it! It&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used, and I forsee this lasting me practically forever. A little but goes a really long way. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Very light, and not greasy.  Love the way it feels on. Wish it had sunscreen protection, then I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to love this - it sounds perfect, however there are a lot of things to beware of. I am writing this as a person who has combination skin. My forehead, temples, nose and chin are a constant oil slick and my cheeks are always so dry I have to exfoliate four days a week for reduce peeling (ugh TMI, sorry) Anyway, I bought this because of that fact that oil in most other moisturizers clogs my pores (non-comodegenic or not) and makes me skin break out. I&#x27;m just testing the waters with natural oil-free moisturizers and I read the reviews for this and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is best comparable to thick water. That&#x27;s the best way to describe it. It is super light and is it really silky when you put it on and does not feel heavy at all on your skin. It&#x27;s consistency is like regular yogurt (not greek) and the smell is definitely gender neutral. It smells like hair gel actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this moisturizer for people with combination skin, or acne prone skin at ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have tried seriously almost every natural acne product and most natural moisturizer - this was purchased to keep my skin hydrated but it ended up doing the opposite. This moisturizer is useless after 1 hour. It soaks in and then your skin is bone dry again, and when it mixes with my own skin oils it makes my skin 10x greasier. My skin has never every gotten so bad from a moisturizer before - I never get whiteheads and I never get blackheads and this caused all of that! It doesn&#x27;t even moisturize, at least not for me. I read the negative reviews and decided to try it and I was ultimately let after being shocked with these negative results. It it may be great for you but for me it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Always hard for me to find natural, effective products that are cruelty free and do not destroy my acne prone skin! I have been using this for a while and have no plans of stopping. It can make your face feel a little greasy throughout the day, but it is far less than any of the other natural items I have tried. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I returned this after one use.  It stung a bit, and had a really strong scent.  It also didn&#x27;t really make my face feel moisturized enough.  I wanted to like it, and love that it&#x27;s all natural, but it didn&#x27;t work for my sensitive and acne-prone skin. :(</li>
            <li> I actually ended up buying this from walmart because I was in need of an oil free moisturizer for my face...BADLY and didn&#x27;t want to way 4-5 days for my order to process on here. So I purchased it (and I cringed at the thought of spending 15 bucks on a small container of moisturizer), and applied it to my clean face in the morning and before bed. Let me tell you...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS THING ZAPPED MY PIMPLES LIKE NO TOMORROW!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did it feel nice and silky on my face, and it soaked in, but it just cleared my face up! I was so surprised. I thought it was too good to be true and maybe it happened to be one of those days that my skin decided to clear uyp on it&#x27;s own. But no, I was wrong... and thank goodness. I continued using the moisturizer twice a day for a week and my face just stayed clear for the entire week. I was so happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is definitely worth the money, and it WILL last you quite a long time since a little DOES go a long way. How little you ask? Just lightly, and quickly tap your finger onto the surface of the moisturizer and that&#x27;s all you&#x27;ll really need!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars, baby. FIVE STARS!</li>
            <li> I bought it and it smells really good and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like a lot of other moisturizers do PLUS, it&#x27;s super cheap. So all in all I really like it.</li>
            <li> I will say the product works great and really helps with the dryness when you cannot use a moisturizer with oil in it.  My exceptions are the strong scent and sensitivity.  I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to scent and this one is more than I would like.  I&#x27;d prefer an unscented to this (maybe they have it and I just missed that part).  It was suggested for face use too and I do feel it wasn&#x27;t a good match with my sensitive skin.  Maybe my face needed a few days to acclimate but it seemed irritated the next day after using some on my face--not to mention the scent bothered me being so close to my nose.  I feel both are more personal to me than a negative for the product but felt both were too significant to rant the product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin. The green tea &amp; aloe moisturizer leaves my skin supple and hydrated but not oily. The subtle and clean scent is refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the jasmine and vitamin E moisturizer. It is much richer and it&#x27;s a bit too rich for my skin. The fragrance is also stronger. I&#x27;ll stick with green tea &amp; aloe.</li>
            <li> A little goes a longgggg way with this product. At first the smell of it was really intoxicating but i got used to it. Clears up acne scars(slowly dnt expect overnight results) and keeps skin moist without oily</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, and they have changed the formula. It&#x27;s now runny instead of thick, and the scent is unpleasant. I sent them an email asking about it, and Alba never answered back. This used to be a fabulous product well worth the money, but not any longer. :(</li>
            <li> moisturizes great without an oily greasy feeling. A little does go a very long way. All natural is a plus</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a million and this is the best.  It leaves your skin soft and moisturized, but it absorbs in without leaving any greasy residue.  It has a light pleasant clean scent.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before in the past and everything was okay. I remembered how well it worked and ordered it to give it a try once more. I usually have blocked pores with hard keratinized skin/oil blocking my pores. After using it I found that it increased the amount of blocked pores substantially! I&#x27;m not sure if there was a change in the ingredients, but I must say that I cannot use the product anymore. It may work for you, but for someone who tends to have many blocked pores, it&#x27;s definitely not recommended.</li>
            <li> Why is this called Hawaiian oil-free moisturizer, etc.? It is not made in Hawaii. None of the ingredients are \\&quot;Hawaiian.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why is that a problem?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this giant seller which makes food snacks, is taking business away from genuine, made-in-Hawaii products by Hawaiians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, they should label it Alba New York. Which is where this giant corporation, Hain Celestial Group, is based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop stealing our Hawaiian image, and taking business away from local Hawaiians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very misleading.</li>
            <li> I have tried many oil free moisturizers because I have a very oily T zone. They have all made my face greasy and didn&#x27;t help with oil control at all. I like this moisturizer because it&#x27;s lightweight and absorbs into my skin nicely. I still have to blot my face mid-day to remove excess oil, but at least this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t add to the problem. As far as fragrance goes, I believe it&#x27;s pretty light because I can&#x27;t smell it after I put it on.</li>
            <li> My first Alba Botanica was the pineapple enzyme face wash. It was such a fail for me that I didn&#x27;t buy another Alba Botanica products after for awhile. Face wash is creamy leaving a thick film over your face. It totally clogged my pores after one use. Terrible for acne prone skin like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, moving on to THIS product. Aloe and Green tea oil free moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I was at Target looking to buy another moisturizer to try out. As I am ALWAYS looking for new product because I can never seem to find one that works with my skin. My skin is very weather sensitive. Summer time I am very oily and during winter time I start peeling like after a bad sun burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this moisturizer during summer time. My first application wasn&#x27;t all that great. It made my skin dingy. Too matte that it looked like I didn&#x27;t wash my face. It didn&#x27;t control my oil all that much either. I kept on using it because I hated the moisturizer I bought at a department store previously. Since I didn&#x27;t break out I just kept using it. I think I gave it about a week or so. After awhile that my skin got use to the moisturizer I wasn&#x27;t seeing &amp;#34; matte&amp;#34; layer on my face. My skin completely STOPPED getting oily one day. My skin was looking just much better over all. I kept using it from middle of May to current ( January). I was worried I had to change my moisturizer again for winter months because I&#x27;ve always done it that way. But NOPE. I have not felt that tightness on my face at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, I still break out but I blame the monthly hormone roller coaster. This moisturizer is just simple but amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also so affordable that I sometimes smother my whole body with it after shower. I wish these came in a large jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only down fall is that little does NOT go long way. You do have to use good amount to get your face moisturized. Little dab isn&#x27;t going to spread to well all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI- I use serum. Vitamin C or Hyaluronic serum everytime before I apply moisturizer. Everyone over age of 20 should use serum. According to my dermatologist Serum gives barrier between the moisturizer which means that the moisturizer can take longer to absorb to your skin. This is ideal because sudden absorption on skin can cause clogged pores. You want the absorbing to be nice and slow. ( Same idea as why people have night cream. Night cream typically has that ability to absorb at slower speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who has given a bad rating probably has not gave enough time for their skin to response to new chemical agent.  Or they don&#x27;t prep their face before putting moisturizer. ( Typically toner and serum). No moisturizer will work without the right prepping routine. Also one thing most people don&#x27;t know is that you only have about 20 seconds to start prepping your face after you wash your face. You want to put on toner when your face is slightly damp. You want to slab on the serum when toner is still wet. Serum should be dabbed on your face. Not rubbed on. When serum gets little sticky then you put on a moisturizer. Take a shower and walk around the house and do your thang for 30 minutes and come back to put on moisturizer? If that&#x27;s you and you are wondering why your skin is a mess. Keep in mind. 20 seconds people. 20 seconds before your skin closes up and says &amp;#34; No. Too late. Don&#x27;t need it because I am releasing my natural oil to combat the outside element&amp;#34;. Which is literally what really happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> As I wrote previously relating to the cleanser - these products are super good - so gentle but you know that your face, neck, etc. are getting a great moisurizer - I have used this Aloe &amp; Green Tea for almost a year - still love it.</li>
            <li> It seems to be very rich, but not too heavy.  Feels light on the skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate.  I&#x27;ll see how my skin holds up in the cold Michigan weather.</li>
            <li> I have pretty oily skin, which breaks out a lot, and this is probably the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. It didn&#x27;t make me break out at all, it felt really light and natural on my skin and sank in really nicely. It wore well under makeup. The smell was FANTASTIC, really melon-y and fresh! I didn&#x27;t buy it again though, because I wanted a moisturizer with sunscreen in it. Also, it&#x27;s pretty expensive; I&#x27;m in college and I can&#x27;t afford to buy it again. :( But I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is the best face moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever bought. Its worth the money! One jar has lasted me months, and I use it every night (putting small dots on my face, in sections). A small amount covers a lot, so don&#x27;t take a big scoop of it. It makes my face feel velvety-soft. It absorbs into my skin quickly, with no greasy feel at all. I have sensitive/dry skin and there is little-to-no scent to this moisturizer, so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It&#x27;s for sure not runny or watery, it has a nice, thick consistency. I&#x27;ve tilted the jar to the side to see what it was like, and it barely moves. I wear it more at night rather than during the day though, but it does well under makeup. This moisturizer is &amp;#34;comfy&amp;#34; to sleep with it on too, which I like. No itchiness or rough spots where it would wear off. If you have dry skin, this will be your &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; moisturizer. Please don&#x27;t ever discontinue this product!!</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer!  A little goes a long way.  Never greasy.  Tropical smell dissipates quickly.  On my second jar.  Definitely staying with this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!!! It&#x27;s not greasy or leave the skin with an oily sheen. I have oily skin to begin with, so I was a bit hesitant when I noticed it was &amp;#34;oil-free&amp;#34; as I wanted SOME moisture, and I always assumed you had to have some natural oils/ingredients in the moisturizer to allow for moisture retention. I was wrong. This stuff is awesome! I am a guy, and very particular about what I put on my face.  :)</li>
            <li> With Alba Botanica Aloe &amp; Green Tea oil -free moisturizer is my way to feed my face. I ordered from Amazon and my order was fulfilled timely and in new condition as promised. Alba Botanica Aloe Green Tea moisterizer does not leave a oily residue and is absorbed into the facial skin and I believe it far better than most any skin oil because it moisturizes...I&#x27;ve used this product for three-plus years and plan to continue...</li>
            <li> I love this cream, it is light but yet moisturizing. i will honesty never buy another moisturizer again. It lasts for a long time! I&#x27;ve had it for over a month and not even half gone and i use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> Its great since there are no oils, but it&#x27;s a lot of fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is better than the expensive one. My skin is every dry and have freckles. I use it for day and night afterclean my face. The freckles seems lighter. I just use one month. I will keep trying. I love it so far. I will buy it again after finish first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judy</li>
            <li> Love this product, its light and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I use it both day and night and it has saved my skin in the summer heat.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to use during a weight loss program, to eliminate unnessary oils in my body. I am very happy with this alba oil-free moisturizer. At my age \\&quot;over 50\\&quot; I wondered how well a moisturizer without oil would work. Surprisingly well. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed. I used it a few times as a body lotion as well; until I found something more practical.</li>
            <li> I love Alba&#x27;s natural products! I have been using this moisturizer for a couple of years and it does the job without being heavy or greasy.  The jar lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Moisturizes pretty well, but formula is a bit tacky and takes a little time to fully absorb. Also, the smell is reminiscent of grocery store branded, cheap hand lotion.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have combination/ oily skin.  I have tried every face moisturizer under the sun from high end to drug store and this is by far the BEST!  Here is why I love it:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s Oil Free- a MUST for combo skin&lt;br /&gt;2. Even though it&#x27;s oil free, it moisturizes my dry spots&lt;br /&gt;3. It absorbs into my skin and does not leave any type residue&lt;br /&gt;4. I use it in the summer and in the winter- light enough in the heat yet moisturizing enough in the winter&lt;br /&gt;5. All natural- has an overall 4.9 rating on the goodguide.com, low concern for toxic chemicals&lt;br /&gt;6. I use this morning and night- the perfect moisturizer anytime&lt;br /&gt;7. I have sensitive skin and am sensitive to scent as well, this has such a mild scent that goes away after you put it on and the little scent it has smells good!&lt;br /&gt;8. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores- I have blackheads and this helps them-doesnt make them worse!&lt;br /&gt;9. I use this moisterizer with the Pineapple Enzyme (same brand/ line) facial cleanser every day and night- its the perfect combo!  I also use the Pineapple enzyme facial mask weekly- it&#x27;s amazing as well!&lt;br /&gt;10. Normally I have to change my skin care routine up a few times a year or my skin seems dull and I start getting worse blackheads and breakouts- not with this moisterizer!  I have tried switching just based on the mere fact I had been using it for so long and couldnt believe I wouldnt need to switch it up like normal and my skin got so much worse.  Went back to this moisturizer- all cleared up! Like I said, have been using for 3+ years and can&#x27;t go without it.&lt;br /&gt;11. It really regulates my breakouts, I barely get them anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have combo/ oily skin- this is the perfect moisturizer! I HIGHLY recommend it, I can&#x27; live without it.</li>
            <li> The jars were not boxed but instead arrived in Saran wrap; upon removing the wrap, I discovered that the jars had been previously opened.  The moisturizer was runny instead of its usual consistency.  I was quite disappointed and threw both jars away, fearful that the contents might somehow have been tampered with.  In the future, I will purchase the item in a local store.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Since I started using it, I&#x27;ve had no weird, dry patches on my face that often plagued my skin, and very, very few pimples. It feels nice and light and has a nice, light scent.</li>
            <li> light, gentle to skin and a great everday moisturizer. I also use on q-tips to remove mascara. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Ive been sing this after i cleanse my face, it does not feel greasy or oil and it smells nice, will reccomend and buy again.</li>
            <li> Product is very light and smells great!</li>
            <li> Smells so nice and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. My husband loves the smell to. It&#x27;s my favorite fave cream. Great price on amazon</li>
            <li> Wow! Like a smoothie for the face! I love the natural face creams available for us now, instead of all those chemicals! This one is a gel cream that is oil free and has no SPF because I have an SPF built into my foundation. It smells good and my foundation just glides on to perfection. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I grabbed this on a whim because my current moisturizer was leaving my cheeks dry to the point of flaking and I&#x27;ve been interested in an Alba product with good reviews before. To preface: This is my first Alba product ever, and I have combination skin with a very oily t-zone and dehydrated cheeks and mouth area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream goes on a little heavy, but after a few minutes it absorbs completely, leaving my skin soft and hydrated and not at ALL greasy to the touch. When I wake up in the morning, my t-zone is shiny but my cheeks are hydrated and plump. As someone with extremely oily skin, I&#x27;ve long given up on some \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; product that will leave my skin perfectly matte and plump-- frankly, I think anyone expecting that is delusional. In my opinion, this product does the best thing possible for combination skin-- it hydrates the dry parts, and HELPS with the oil in the oil parts, even though it doesn&#x27;t eliminate it completely. Most oil-control products do not moisturize the dry parts of combination skin (since a lot them contain alcohol), and most moisturizing products make the t-zone worse. This product is a very good balance between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no spf in this, which is actually better for the skin since spf isn&#x27;t really something you want absorbing into your skin. If you need spf during the day, invest in an actual sunblcok to go on top of your moisturizer, or makeup with spf in it (I use a bb cream with spf 50).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Shiseido&#x27;s Skincare Hydro-balancing softener/toner before this, day and night. Been using it for a week and no new breakouts. Overall very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Talk about combo skin - I have acne prone, sensitive and dry skin.  I was fighting to find a natural moisturizer and this one did the trick.  Even during my worst breakout, this product didn&#x27;t aggravate the acne at all.  Just a small bit on the tip of your finger goes a LONG way.  This jar will last for ages.  Whenever my skin is a little red, this product just calms it right down.  Definitely a must have for those of us with complicated faces.</li>
            <li> I ordered this particular moisturizer because I wanted to try something different from my typical regimen. I have oily, acne-prone skin and I looked for something that would be mostly natural, oil-free, moisturizing, and wouldn&#x27;t clog my pores. I am SO pleased with this beauty item! It&#x27;s so lightweight, silky, and smooth! The 3 oz. package has a lot of product inside of it so you are not going to run out of it too fast. Personally, I only need to a quarter amount of the moisturizer for my entire face and neck. The product also has lots of vegetarian and organic ingredients in it. This is a big plus for me because I do not enjoy putting any chemicals on my face, especially in my cleanser and moisturizer. I enjoy using this product every single morning and night. Therefore, I would recommend this item to anybody who is looking for a natural and fantastic moisturizer without the expensive price. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin; it reacts poorly to almost everything (including hard water), it is dry in spots and oily in others, and it definitely sees a blemish from time to time. I&#x27;ve tried just about every product out there because I am easily swayed by advertisements for new organic facial products, but I always come back to this line. Unlike most products for &#x27;troubled&#x27; skin, which contain harsh salicycle acid, this product doesn&#x27;t make my break-outs worse at all. It&#x27;s oil free, so even after a long day my nose doesn&#x27;t feel slick, and it&#x27;s nice and light so it goes great under make-up. The scent is fantastic and a little jar goes a long way because you need so little of it. If your skin is like mine, I recommend the pineapple enzyme cleanser, the habiscus toner, the papaya mask, and this moisturizer. That regiment keeps me clear, soft, and smelling like the tropics. The only thing I don&#x27;t use is the eye gel, which is a bit too light for the eye area.</li>
            <li> Works well. Is a good post shaving moisturizer that does not leave your face looking oily.</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer for time when I was prohibited from using external oil</li>
            <li> Great product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great Service!</li>
            <li> Excellent for guys too.</li>
            <li> Works great.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps your skin moisturized and feeling smooth without any oiliness. Which is great because I absolutely despised anything in my face because it always felt clumpy heavy and thick on my face.&lt;br /&gt;My face is very sensitive, dry and oily at the same time but this works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for anyone with oily skin or dry+oily.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it&#x27;s very effective and I have combo/Oily skin and it&#x27;s also sensitive to everything. I have had good results with it and it never needs to be reapplied even when my skin is very dry. I also really like the light/sweet smell it has.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 18 and purchased this moisturizer right along with the pineapple enzyme cleanser and it&#x27;s awesome! I have oily skin, and it doesn&#x27;t overly moisturize at all. The scent is so refreshing and it also has helped a lot with my undereye puffiness (I believe it&#x27;s because of the green tea that is in it, which is great). But what I love the most about it, is that it&#x27;s natural! I recommend to anyone! :)</li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizer, I do wish it had SPF protection. I only use it at night because I think every facial moisturizer should have some type of sun protection.</li>
            <li> Love all Alba products . Will continue to use this product and throw out my LAB moisturizer . Non greasy no shine to face to after using it. Also it has a nice subtle scent which diminishes after a few moments !</li>
            <li> I use this stuff each day for a face moisturizer. I have very oily skin and also sensitive. This stuff doesn&#x27;t cause any rash or break outs and wear well under make up. I&#x27;ve tried other lotions but I&#x27;ve always come back to this. I won&#x27;t stray anymore! Highly recommended for sensitive skin and even oily skin!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have sensitive skin, &amp; this is really gentle &amp; soothing.  I also try to avoid wearing foundation, but this moisturizer wears well under Physician&#x27;s Formula Organic Wear Foundation.  (I haven&#x27;t tried it with any other foundation products).  I exfoliate every other day &amp; apply this afterward, as well as after getting out of the shower.  The fragrance isn&#x27;t too strong, and I love that its oil free, because I have extremely oily skin.  (I obviously wash my face on a regular basis as well in addition to exfoliating.)  This is a hard product to review because people&#x27;s needs, opinions, &amp; skin types are so different.  I was initially hesitant to pay so much for it, but in comparison to other oil free moisturizers, this one is about the same cost, &amp; isn&#x27;t full of harsh chemicals, fillers, &amp; other crap that clogs your pores up.  Just my two cents.</li>
            <li> This is a very light, oil free moisturizer. It feels great and I have added it to my daily routine. I will probably keep ordering it. My only disappointment is that it does not contain any sunscreen which is important year round so I have to add separate spf protection.</li>
            <li> SO disappointed! I have oily, mild acne prone, sensitive, combo skin. This product DID NOT absorb into my skin AT ALL. It sat on top of my skin creating a &#x27;slippery&#x27; greasy layer. Eww. After about 30 minutes, my skin was extremely oily, shiny &amp; greasy looking. It looked and felt like baby oil on my face! I have oily skin but this product brought MORE excessive oil onto my face even in areas where I normally don&#x27;t get oily. I don&#x27;t understand how this is a oil-free moisturizer but yet makes your skin extremely oily. Glad I was able to return it!</li>
            <li> I am nearing 45 and this product works great on my oily, acne-prone, sensitive skin. Very light and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  Has all natural ingredients and great for dry and sensitive skin.  Leaves my face feeling great</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. I needed something light to put on before my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;And love the smell of the lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a hunt to find a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; oil free moisturizer and its been quite the process... let me say this product is fantastic!!  I have oily acne prone skin and have had zero issues with this product.  It&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side but one jar lasts a very long time.  I happen to think it smells fantastic and has a very clean feel to it upon application.  I&#x27;m excited to try more of Alba&#x27;s products in the future!  I just wish the moisturizer had sunscreen for summer months... Alas, beggars can&#x27;t be choosers ;-)</li>
            <li> This has been the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve been able to find for my combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my face feeling hydrated and not greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.  It is light and offers as much moisturizing as I want.  I just  don&#x27;t like the fruity smell.  It&#x27;s a pleasant smell if you like fruity.  I wish it had less fruit and more Tea Tree Oil to the scent.  I do like that it moisturizes without chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have owned this approximately 2 hours. Rite-Aid was having a sale on these (buy one get one free, worked out to just under $10 a pop) so I grabbed the last two. I put some on when I came home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot get over how incredible this smells. I practically want to eat the contents of the two containers. I am very lazy about product reviews when the stuff is good but GUYS. THIS STUFF IS AMAZING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal skin with no acne or scaring, and it&#x27;s not very sensitive, so I can&#x27;t speak to how it will do for the sensitive folks out there. For me just a tiny bit was plenty and my skin is not greasy at all and the smell is still here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy but like to take care of my skin, 38 look in my 20&#x27;s.  love  this stuff.  Goes on nicely, clean feeling, not greasy, doesn&#x27;t take a lot of it.  You get a lot for the cost.</li>
            <li> i love the green tea moisturizer from PROACTIV but its too expensive hence i bought this. This one is expensive too but it has more quantity. I love the smell and texture but even though it says wont clog pores it does have a little heavy feeling/oily feeling to it. but for oily people like me it still works great. will continue using it</li>
            <li> The face lotion is light and absorbs quickly. So far I like it, I have acne prone skin and it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother it.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes without leaving any residue. Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. Scent is mild and doesn&#x27;t stay long. Girlfriend uses with make up and loves the product.</li>
            <li> I am in love with how this makes my skin feel. I have very very dry skin and this combats that without leaving an oily feeling all over my face. I had used previous moisturizers in the past like Clinique, but they were too oily and often made me break out instead of fixing my dry skin. This does not make me break out at all, and it dries with a nice matte feeling and look instead of being shiny. It also smells amazing! A little goes a long way but when I&#x27;m done with this one ill definitely buy some more!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 years and never been disappointed. I have combination skin and it works really well under makeup.</li>
            <li> Great to be able to get this on Amazon because I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else. It&#x27;s gentle on the skin and the only face cream that doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Great price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This is a phenomenal moisturizer! I&#x27;ve never been able to use face cream too often because the oils in them would make me break out. However, not wanting to look 70 years when I&#x27;m in my 30s I knew I had to find something that worked for me or my face was going to look like a prune.  I got this product a few days ago and I&#x27;ve used it daily since then and haven&#x27;t had a breakout. I am thrilled!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this lotion!!!  Great fragrance and is not oily. Will continue to use!</li>
            <li> I am trying to break away from using so many nasty ingredients on my skin, but I was also quite addicted to proactiv because I do have mild breakouts. I have quit using the proactiv cleanser, have tried a healthier cleanser and use this alba lotion every day before concealer. It does make my face seem dewier but it actually soaks in well and stays great under makeup. A little goes a long way, at least for me, and it is very much worth the price. If anything, breakouts are less common, definitely not breaking out more. The scent is mild. Yea it doesn&#x27;t have SPF, but that&#x27;s what I wanted. I used to use SPF on my face every day, but now I only do if I know that I&#x27;m gonna be outside in the sun a while. Plus, I like to get plenty of Vitamin D.</li>
            <li> Smells like vomit. Yuck! Couldn&#x27;t use it. I wasted my money. Not great at moisturizing either. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this light feeling moisturizer, it really works!</li>
            <li> I have had acne since high school and have tried many products, spent lots of money and have never gotten results like this. I usually have oily skin but with this product my skin has smoothed out and I cant beleive the results after just a week of using. The low price and great results this cream is like a hidden gem.</li>
            <li> Zits, zits, zits, zits. I tried to like this product after hearing so many good things about it, and while I really liked the smell, I hate the moisturizer itself. Not recommended for teenage skin unless it is extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and have found that a lot of &amp;#34;combination&amp;#34; products are either too heavy for my t-zone or dry out my cheeks. This works great for me! Pleasant light scent and I love the natural ingredients. You only need a little dab; if you over-apply your skin can feel sticky. I can&#x27;t find a better product for my skin/natural product needs.</li>
            <li> I love it! If you have dry skin this is great. I use it everyday twice a day and it has kept my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Nice light and dewy. I have oily skin with dry patches. This moisturizer keeps it even in all areas. Feels light on my skin. I use it in combination with Bare Minerals powder foundation and really like it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and this is a great price for it!  Normally retails for about $20. Leaves your face feeling super soft and smooth, and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> Since I began using alba cleansing and moisturizer, my rocacia has  stopped rearing it&#x27;s  ugly head. Other products make my checks so red after shower. Not with this stuff. Will for sure continue to  use these products.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is really silky and nice, a little goes a long way. I also love the soft scent and that it is made with all natural ingredients. It might be a little heavy for those with acne-prone skin, even though it is oil free.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face soft</li>
            <li> This product is perfection for combination skin. It is ideal to use during the day, and then apply SPF cream on top of it. Use alone at night, of course. The SPF I use on top is from RiteAid, it is the 85 proof. It works so well with this face lotion, have been using it for years and no break outs. I usually wait until the Alba lotion is 90% absorbed in skin before putting the additional SPF on. The beauty of this Alba lotion is that you can use more of it in the winter without looking greasy, it smells so good and my skin loves it. p.s I have very sensitive skin and this is the BEST lotion , and I have tried expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I recently started an HCG diet which recommends not using any oils on the body. I am 54 and was skeptical that an oil free moisturizer would be OK for my face, but this works great! This moisturizer has a light fresh fragrance, and leaves my skin soft and smooth, plus I trust Alba Botanica to use safe ingredients.</li>
            <li> Lovvvvvvbvvvvbbvvvvbvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvve itttttttt. Perfect for me except I can&#x27;t control my face oil I as I want since I sweat at work but it&#x27;s better than as shiny as my face would get with other stuff. Even stuff that was oil free.</li>
