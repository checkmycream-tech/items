            <li>These are the best I have ever found!</li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>drops\\&quot;, we&#x27;d be really happy campers!</li>
            <li>works great.</li>
            <li>Great to have around,</li>
            <li>The reviews were good</li>
            <li>Nice taste to them.</li>
            <li>These throat discs used to be the ones I kept at all times as the most seriously effective for soothing</li>
            <li>This is as good as the original &amp;#34;Throat Discs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Not so fast!\\&quot; say most of the females in my wife&#x27;s family.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are no longer available at most brick and mortar stores, so to save the day for all these gals, I&#x27;ve searched around for the best price online, and this was it at the time (note prices often fluctuate wildly on Amazon).</li>
            <li>We have used these throat discs for many years but they are no longer sold at the stores in our area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I keep peoples attention better</li>
            <li>These are great for a clear voice----</li>
            <li>Many years ago I used this product and it helped me tremendously, then I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores.</li>
            <li>These little discs do an excellent job at relieving sore throats.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I know many shoppers don&#x27;t read comments on reviews (I rarely do myself)</li>
            <li>I was happy to finally find it at Drugstore.com</li>
            <li>and the losenges we received, again according to my wife and her mom, are still the original formula.</li>
            <li>The original throat discs</li>
            <li>It is not right or good to do these things!</li>
            <li>the cool inhale that Parke Davis discs used to pack, capsicum and menthol maybe.</li>
            <li>BUT OK THEY WORK WILL BUY AGAIN THANKS</li>
            <li>It was fun putting a smile on her face!</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t as many interruptions when your able to be clear and concise about what your saying without any RASP in your voice.</li>
            <li>worth the buy</li>
            <li>were strong and would clear my throat quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another reviewer felt compelled to comment on my review and tell me that these aren&#x27;t the original Parke Davis Throat Discs and that \\&quot;There&#x27;s a new owner</li>
            <li>Exactly as I remembered.  </li>
            <li>Try them, seems better than just a regular cough drop.</li>
            <li>am really really praying and hoping that these people who are posting these lies and who might be paid to do it should STOP!</li>
            <li>and it gives me a bold clear voice</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are now much cheaper elsewhere if you know where look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really helped my throat</li>
            <li>It is tastey and it really works.  </li>
            <li>Soothing and it really works for my wife.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Karen</li>
            <li>My review is of the product I ordered and received on December 16, 2012, and according to both my wife and her mother, the shape was different (thicker), but the lozenge tasted and worked just like the original.</li>
            <li>The other two and there is one more here that I cannot remember its name - that does not work either.</li>
            <li>raw irritated throat nicely.  </li>
            <li>These are OK as cough drops when the cough is caused by irritation, and boy, do they sooth down n</li>
            <li>For a sore throat????&lt;br /&gt;There is such a burning, spicy edge to them that they not only make my throat HURT MORE, they even irritate my tongue and roof of my mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they are all under the impression that should they ever run out of these little throat discs, they will surely asphyxiate from a swollen, tickly or sore throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You must like black licorice to enjoy this product, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This item is only sweet as honey and sugar mixed as one ingredient but nothing else!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re giving a positive review to a product that is not what Amazon is currently selling.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to sing a little after using these but not total help though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She was so surprised and ecstatic with the product.  </li>
            <li>They are really helpful when you have a minor sore throat.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them for minor discomfort from coughing or sinus drainage.</li>

            <li> Anyone wishing to get these must prepare for a long time before they arrive.</li>
            <li> the only one I got a little relief from -</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with these is they are missing the principle Parke Davis burn that worked so well for getting  rid of the tickle.  </li>
            <li> or we somehow lucked out twice (over the course of a year and two different sellers) and got boxes from before the formula change you allege.and her mother even longer (back when they were Parke Davis Medicated Throat Discs and looked like Necco Wafers), and that they both are adamant that these appear to be the same formula to them, I&#x27;m gonna have to say that maybe you got a bad batch...</li>
            <li> Now use them for any time I have a scratchy throat and to help when singing other times.</li>
            <li> throat discs provide relief from &#x27;throat tickle&#x27; where the other throat lozenges do not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a singer, so I have used similar products in the past to help my voice.</li>
            <li> The ones I bought this time were obviously watered down, not much more than sugar pills.</li>
            <li> Being that my wife has been using these for close to fifty years, and her mother even longer (back when they were Parke Davis Medicated Throat Discs and looked like Necco Wafers), and that they both are adamant that these appear to be the same formula to them, I&#x27;m gonna have to say that maybe you got a bad batch...</li>
            <li> but it helps a little.</li>
            <li> NOT TRUE!</li>
            <li> and I speak a little clearer !</li>
            <li> bought four packages, thinking I&#x27;d stock up because they&#x27;ve been hard to find lately.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find though.</li>
            <li> At least we bought one pkg to find out.</li>
            <li> I mean, they&#x27;re basically just cough drops, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does the trick if you lost your voice due to a cold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vocalzone tastes really really horrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Many years ago I used this product and it helped me tremendously, then I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores. Finally, years later, I searched the product online and found it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These lozengers help with sore throats, laryngitis and post nasal drip!  These are the best I have ever found!</li>
            <li> Used these for years when I sang in a choir. Now use them for any time I have a scratchy throat and to help when singing other times.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with these is they are missing the principle Parke Davis burn that worked so well for getting  rid of the tickle.  These are OK as cough drops when the cough is caused by irritation, and boy, do they sooth down n raw irritated throat nicely.  I do miss the burn and the cool inhale that Parke Davis discs used to pack, capsicum and menthol maybe.</li>
            <li> These little discs do an excellent job at relieving sore throats. I have been using them sporadically for decades. I highly recommend them for minor discomfort from coughing or sinus drainage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried these and can take them or leave them. I mean, they&#x27;re basically just cough drops, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Not so fast!\\&quot; say most of the females in my wife&#x27;s family. Maybe it&#x27;s a French thing, I don&#x27;t know, but they are all under the impression that should they ever run out of these little throat discs, they will surely asphyxiate from a swollen, tickly or sore throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are no longer available at most brick and mortar stores, so to save the day for all these gals, I&#x27;ve searched around for the best price online, and this was it at the time (note prices often fluctuate wildly on Amazon). I order these by the dozens so that the wife, her mother and her aunt can all have a bountiful supply whenever they \\&quot;get a tickle\\&quot; in the back of their throats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******************** UPDATE ********************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are now much cheaper elsewhere if you know where look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer felt compelled to comment on my review and tell me that these aren&#x27;t the original Parke Davis Throat Discs and that \\&quot;There&#x27;s a new owner so you might want to modify your review. You&#x27;re giving a positive review to a product that is not what Amazon is currently selling.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I know many shoppers don&#x27;t read comments on reviews (I rarely do myself), I think it might be helpful to the discussion if I add my response to the comment here in my review where it might be seen by prospective buyers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t change my review simply because you&#x27;re telling me the formula changed. My review is of the product I ordered and received on December 16, 2012, and according to both my wife and her mother, the shape was different (thicker), but the lozenge tasted and worked just like the original. Three weeks ago, I ordered 24 boxes from Walgreens.com ($3.79 a box and a $5 coupon!) and the losenges we received, again according to my wife and her mom, are still the original formula. Being that my wife has been using these for close to fifty years, and her mother even longer (back when they were Parke Davis Medicated Throat Discs and looked like Necco Wafers), and that they both are adamant that these appear to be the same formula to them, I&#x27;m gonna have to say that maybe you got a bad batch... that or we somehow lucked out twice (over the course of a year and two different sellers) and got boxes from before the formula change you allege.and her mother even longer (back when they were Parke Davis Medicated Throat Discs and looked like Necco Wafers), and that they both are adamant that these appear to be the same formula to them, I&#x27;m gonna have to say that maybe you got a bad batch... that or we somehow lucked out twice (over the course of a year and two different sellers) and got boxes from before the formula change you allege.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I remembered.  I&#x27;ve been looking for these for years.  They are really helpful when you have a minor sore throat.</li>
            <li> Really helped my throat and I speak a little clearer !</li>
            <li> works great. helps with sore thoat/hoaseness.  Great to have around, worth the buy, you want regret the purchase.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Does the trick if you lost your voice due to a cold. Nice taste to them. Try them, seems better than just a regular cough drop.</li>
            <li> I searched the internet to find a type of cough drops that my friend kept talking about.  She kept wanting to find the type she always had when she was younger.  This was the closest thing to Park and Davis that I could find.  She was so surprised and ecstatic with the product.  It was fun putting a smile on her face!</li>
            <li> The original throat discs I bought years ago were strong and would clear my throat quickly. The ones I bought this time were obviously watered down, not much more than sugar pills.</li>
            <li> These throat discs used to be the ones I kept at all times as the most seriously effective for soothing soreness.&lt;br /&gt;I guess now they&#x27;ve been sold to another company that changed the formula and, when I opened them because of a raging sore throat, I was shocked.&lt;br /&gt;These things HURT my throat now.&lt;br /&gt;PEPPER??? For a sore throat????&lt;br /&gt;There is such a burning, spicy edge to them that they not only make my throat HURT MORE, they even irritate my tongue and roof of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;TERRIBLE!&lt;br /&gt;I bought four packages, thinking I&#x27;d stock up because they&#x27;ve been hard to find lately.&lt;br /&gt;Now I feel RIPPED OFF!</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness... if there is anything I regret is THIS PURCHASE! This item is only sweet as honey and sugar mixed as one ingredient but nothing else! SIMPLY PUT... IT DOES NOT WORK! I did such extensive research and read only the Amazon Verified since everyone said read only those reviews since the others might be paid to lie. The reviews were good but IT&#x27;S ALL A LIE! NOT TRUE! Throat Discs DOES NOT WORK AND SINGERS SAVING GRACE DOES NOT WORK EITHER... the only one I got a little relief from - and I said a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; is vocalzone. I think  these are only made in Europe since the two times I purchased, they were shipped from there. I was able to sing a little after using these but not total help though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vocalzone tastes really really horrible but it helps a little. Anyone wishing to get these must prepare for a long time before they arrive. Mine came in from Europe each times I purchased. The other two and there is one more here that I cannot remember its name - that does not work either. I will try to find it and post the name. Consumers must know the truth and then decide whether they still want to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really really praying and hoping that these people who are posting these lies and who might be paid to do it should STOP! It is not right or good to do these things! A lie is a lie and a SIN!!</li>
            <li> We have used these throat discs for many years but they are no longer sold at the stores in our area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The throat discs provide relief from &#x27;throat tickle&#x27; where the other throat lozenges do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if we could only find a source for the Finish \\&quot;P &amp; P\\&quot; cough Drops or the same formulation that used to be used for those \\&quot;Smith Bros. Licorice cough drops\\&quot;, we&#x27;d be really happy campers!</li>
            <li> It is tastey and it really works.  This product is hard to find though. I was happy to finally find it at Drugstore.com</li>
            <li> YES THEY WORK I DON&#x27;T THINK THEY ARE THE SAME AS GRANDMA BUT OK THEY WORK WILL BUY AGAIN THANKS</li>
            <li> This is as good as the original &amp;#34;Throat Discs. from Park-Davis. Soothing and it really works for my wife.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a singer, so I have used similar products in the past to help my voice. These discs are somewhat like the discs I used to get that were made by Parke-Davis I believe, only these are a bit thicker. They are helpful to stimulate moisture for the mouth and throat.</li>
            <li> These are great for a clear voice---- I take these so I can talk on the phone to clients and it gives me a bold clear voice and I keep peoples attention better because they listen---- There aren&#x27;t as many interruptions when your able to be clear and concise about what your saying without any RASP in your voice.</li>
            <li> These were not what we had hoped for.  My husband used to get Parke Davis Throat Lozenges, and we hoped these were it, but they are not.  At least we bought one pkg to find out. Thanks, Karen</li>
            <li> This is a soothing discs for the throat for those who speak or sing. You must like black licorice to enjoy this product, in my opinion.</li>
