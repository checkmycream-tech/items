            <li>I love OPI and have a huge collection</li>
            <li>Quality is good- normal OPI quality.</li>
            <li>is true that is a litter bit darker that it shows in the picture</li>

            <li> After Dark, and this really hit the mark.</li>
            <li> and then I tried a thicker one coat and no top coat just to see if it would lighten- same dark, almost black result.</li>
            <li> But it goes on looking black.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a purplish black</li>
            <li> It looks almost black indoors but out in the sunlight</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a darker shade that works well for both formal occasions and everyday use.  </li>
            <li> a dress- not almost black!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I ever want to buy OPI again after this shopping experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always afraid I&#x27;ll receive a watered down color, half empty bottle, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame, but it is SO frustrating.  </li>

            <li> Quality is good- normal OPI quality. But it goes on looking black. Then in sunlight it looks like a deep plum. Even in bright light it doesn&#x27;t get as \\&quot;light\\&quot; as the purple shown in the photo. It is still a very autumn season color, but I wanted the exact color or a little darker in the photo to go with a dress- not almost black! I only put on two coats and then a top coat and then I tried a thicker one coat and no top coat just to see if it would lighten- same dark, almost black result.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured. Great quality and FAST delivery!</li>
            <li> Buying nail polish online always makes me nervous.  I&#x27;m always afraid I&#x27;ll receive a watered down color, half empty bottle, etc. This purchase was perfect. Brand new bottles of beautiful polish. I will shop again.</li>
            <li> is true that is a litter bit darker that it shows in the picture but anyway is really nice,that was the color that i was looking for,fast shipping too thanks</li>
            <li> The color is okay..Its alot darker in person then in the photo..Still pretty i guess but i prefer brighter colors..It comes out really nice though..Shipping was awesome(:</li>
            <li> love the color, but it definitely looks streaky until you apply &amp;#62;1 coat (this is not what i expect from an OPI product..) overall tho, this is a color i will wear again and again</li>
            <li> I got this color of nail polish for a friend of mine for her birthday.  Purple is her favorite color and I wanted to get her purple nail polish.  It&#x27;s a darker shade that works well for both formal occasions and everyday use.  I haven&#x27;t talked to my friend in awhile but I can&#x27;t wait to hear what she thinks of the nail polish.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color! It&#x27;s a purplish black and I get so many compliments on it! Very happy with my choice!</li>
            <li> OPI honk if you love opi is a beautiful dark purple with a red undertone. its a darker version of OPI boris &amp; natasha. you need 2 or 3 coats for it to be true to color...over all beautiful color! oooh yea this picture doesn&#x27;t do this color justice its much darker even with flash.</li>
            <li> I would love to buy some OPI Nail Polish, but these listings DON&#x27;T WORK.  There are no images for most of the colors or you don&#x27;t know which color you&#x27;re buying.  It&#x27;s a shame, but it is SO frustrating.  I&#x27;m not sure I ever want to buy OPI again after this shopping experience.</li>
            <li> Love this color.  I use it constatnly during the fall/winter.  It&#x27;s perfectly dark purple which was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love OPI and have a huge collection but this one isn&#x27;t a stand out. It is just okay. It&#x27;s not really black or purple. It&#x27;s just meh.</li>
            <li> Got this color for myself however granddaughter saw it, loved it, and laid claim to it! Haven&#x27;t seen it since but it was just as described and perfect color.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a color similar to OPI&#x27;s Lincoln Park After Dark, and this really hit the mark. It&#x27;s a great quality product, and the color is pretty true to the photo.</li>
            <li> Great color....love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great color. It&#x27;s purple though. You definitely need more than one coat to get the full effect and deep (not so purple) color.</li>
            <li> Very pleased….went on easily….nice consistency….color is great….dried quickly...</li>
            <li> Love this color.  Perfect color for fall and winter.  Deep, deep purple.</li>
            <li> I love this opi color! It looks almost black indoors but out in the sunlight it&#x27;s a gorgeous dark purple! I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it! Try it!</li>
            <li> Great color…great packaging!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a present and my friend absolutely loved it! We got the &amp;#34;Honk if you love OPI&amp;#34; color. It is definitely a deep, deep purple, but will be great for the fall and winter months! She already tried it out and the outcome looked wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love this color and the transaction of me getting the product was very professional and accomodating..Yes! I would use this venue again as well as spread the word</li>
            <li> I now have a new favorite color in my large nail color collection. I am wearing this color today and I&#x27;m sure it will hold up because its OPI and they have great staying power. I will order again.</li>
