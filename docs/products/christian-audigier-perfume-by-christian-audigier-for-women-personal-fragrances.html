            <li>THe bottle is a beautiful red and the shape and design is so classy.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it!!</li>
            <li>I rarely stay with a fragrance before I have used it all.  </li>
            <li>I loved the pink Ed Hardy for women.</li>
            <li>Lovely, classy scent that I keep smelling on my wrist throughout the evening.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t charge $120 for this item, when it&#x27;s worth $27, like you had it for sale before...</li>
            <li>and it definitely is worth the money.</li>
            <li>It smells elegant and feminine but not super flowery like most.</li>
            <li>and nobody wants to pay full price.</li>
            <li>Its a sweet sensual fragrance,sexy, mature and really unique.</li>
            <li>BUT I LOVE THIS CHRISTIAN AUDIGIER SCENT!</li>
            <li>So glad that Amazon has it in stock...and different sizes!</li>
            <li>It smells sophisticated and sensual at the same time.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love,love,love this perfume!</li>
            <li>This is my first perfume ever</li>
            <li>and I saw this one had a lot of positive reviews</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually an all-fruity smells kind of girl, but this has just the right balance.</li>
            <li>Its like I&#x27;m spraying myself with straight alcohol.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s the real deal</li>
            <li>Thanks again Amazon, you nailed it.</li>
            <li>I love getting Amazon cards for Christmas because I&#x27;ll take a chance and buy something I typically wouldn&#x27;t treat myself to.</li>
            <li>I received my CHRISTIAN AUDIGIER fragrance as a gift and totally fell in love with</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and beautiful, however I am disappointed in the length of time that it lasts.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth it, I decided to buy the larger bottle.</li>
            <li>Brand new box.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new fragrance</li>
            <li>Not only did I find my perfume in stock, brand new un-opened, at a fraction of the original cost and received free shipping (due to super-saver) which quoted about a 10 day delivery I actually received in a couple days.  </li>
            <li>The lasting power is not fantastic but it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li>I felt lucky to find it at a perfume store recently, and bought two bottles, still at twice the cost that I found it here, and much smaller bottles.  </li>
            <li>: My husband noticed that from the time I applied this perfume (early in the morning) and by the time I go to bed (10pm) the potency of the perfume was still there...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it is not in the store that I frequent for perfumes and colgnes, anymore.</li>
            <li>Boy, was I surprised.  </li>
            <li>No spice and nothing old about it.</li>
            <li>I really like it and it does last</li>
            <li>but it also has that sophisticated characteristic setting it above other fruity fragrances.  </li>
            <li>THE TOP NOTE IS DEFINITELY ALCOHOL, then maybe a little of the other top notes, but very little.  </li>
            <li>I was presently surprised that this was an entire gift set and not just the perfume.  </li>
            <li>This is my second bottle of this perfume--I just love the subtle smell of this perfume!</li>

            <li> This is my second bottle of this perfume--I just love the subtle smell of this perfume!</li>
            <li> I ordered a bottle of this perfume and much to my delight, I received an entire gift set including a small bottle for my purse as well as body lotion and shower gel.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last that long on me.</li>
            <li> On my skin, the lasting power is not that long</li>
            <li> It does not last long.</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical on whether this perfume was going to be fake or not because the price is very affordable</li>
            <li> However, I am most disappointed when I received the gift set of the Christian Audigier for Women,....</li>
            <li> And most the times it is like they go bad before I finish the bottle.  </li>
            <li> BUT perhaps I should consider NOT recommending this perfume so much lest they run out of this hidden jewel since has become difficult for me to obtain.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very fresh, and I never get sick of it.</li>
            <li> It seems to dissipate within a half hour.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type to usually avoid sales people in department stores, but one snagged me on Black Friday to hand me a test card with this fragrance on it.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I did not need to pay the retail price, as I would be very disappointed in the amount of time that this lasts.</li>
            <li> this - one bottle usually lasts me about 1-2 years.</li>
            <li> This scent is hard to describe</li>
            <li> The perfume is subtle.</li>
            <li> A definite hit you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this fragrant, and with Amazon for even selling a very \\&quot;watered-down\\&quot; perfume.  </li>
            <li> I hated the white Ed Hardy (nope, I don&#x27;t know the names of the scents.</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think is a fake.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed when they \\&quot;discontined\\&quot;</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s crap!</li>
            <li> When that ran out I needed another and thought I&#x27;d save myself a trip and order online again, but this time it was horrible.</li>

            <li> I rarely stay with a fragrance before I have used it all.  And most the times it is like they go bad before I finish the bottle.  Not with this one.  This will be my second bottle and it took me almost a year to use it all.  It never lost it&#x27;s freshness.  I am so glad that one day I was strolling thru Macy&#x27;s and found this one.  It was one of those hey here try this type situations.  And to find it here for such a reasonable price is brilliant.  It is light and never overbearing and I absolutely love it.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this scent.  It is seductive and playful.  I get complimented on it all day/nite that I wear it.  So what I am saying is sometimes even when you think the scent is no longer there it is.  I can still smell it on my clothes the next day/nite.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites and now discontinued! Sad. Happy to have found it on Amazon. Realperfume had it to me two days after I ordered it. Brand new box. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> The comment another reviewer made re the non lasting aroma, my experience is thus: My husband noticed that from the time I applied this perfume (early in the morning) and by the time I go to bed (10pm) the potency of the perfume was still there...how&#x27;s that for lasting aroma?  This scent is hard to describe but I get stopped often and asked what I&#x27;m wearing...I tell them.  BUT perhaps I should consider NOT recommending this perfume so much lest they run out of this hidden jewel since has become difficult for me to obtain.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and I can&#x27;t find it anywhere except department stores and nobody wants to pay full price. The perfume is subtle. So if you&#x27;re the type to not want to overwhelm people with smells then this a great product.</li>
            <li> I loved the pink Ed Hardy for women. I hated the white Ed Hardy (nope, I don&#x27;t know the names of the scents. lol). BUT I LOVE THIS CHRISTIAN AUDIGIER SCENT! It kinda reminds me of a quality, good smelling cigar. It makes me think romantic, smoky, sensual, sort of mysterious b/c its not over powering. I&#x27;ve found that it is not in the store that I frequent for perfumes and colgnes, anymore. So glad that Amazon has it in stock...and different sizes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type to usually avoid sales people in department stores, but one snagged me on Black Friday to hand me a test card with this fragrance on it. This frangrance is wonderful--the perfect mix of fruity and savory. I&#x27;m usually an all-fruity smells kind of girl, but this has just the right balance. I couldn&#x27;t keep my nose out of it. It just gets better over time. I&#x27;m hoping that my husband will get it for me for Christmas!!</li>
            <li> Loved it when my sis first came around me in it. She let me wear hers and I just had to get my own. And I love it</li>
            <li> to me this product was just okay,the scent does not last at all!!.  i thought the scent would last longer than 20 minutes!!.    i would not recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a lasting scent..</li>
            <li> I received my CHRISTIAN AUDIGIER fragrance as a gift and totally fell in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is beautiful with it&#x27;s red and gold colors.  The scent is fresh and sweet with its fruity notes (tangerine, blackberry and pomegranate) which are perfectly blended together. This also has magnolia and orchid as floral notes but I do not smell them, I guess all the notes just meld well togeher. The dry down is wonderful with that hint of amber, which smells so good on the skin.  It&#x27;s such a gorgeous scent that is never overpowering ... it may be sweet but it also has that sophisticated characteristic setting it above other fruity fragrances.  On my skin, the lasting power is not that long but I can spray it on me over and over without overwhelming my sense of smell.&lt;br /&gt;Such a great fragrance!</li>
            <li> This perfume just went discontinued.  So sad, because I love it.  I used to buy it at Macy&#x27;s or Dillards for twice what this cost.  I felt lucky to find it at a perfume store recently, and bought two bottles, still at twice the cost that I found it here, and much smaller bottles.  I have stocked up now, so it should last me a couple of years. I guess after that, I&#x27;ll have to find a new favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I knew as a last minute christmas gift; was I going to be able to find, afford and get my gift in time....well I was amazed!!! Not only did I find my perfume in stock, brand new un-opened, at a fraction of the original cost and received free shipping (due to super-saver) which quoted about a 10 day delivery I actually received in a couple days.  I would recommend to anyone to shop amazon...I&#x27;m a believer!!!</li>
            <li> I been wanting this perfume ever since I tried the sample from Macy&#x27;s. The scent is just amazing. It&#x27;s not too fruity or too floral. It smells sophisticated and sensual at the same time. I was kind of skeptical on whether this perfume was going to be fake or not because the price is very affordable and I had seen this perfume on Target for $120.But it does smell just like the sample from Macy&#x27;s so I don&#x27;t think is a fake.I Love it!</li>
            <li> I thought because of the low price, it would be low quality. Boy, was I surprised.  Lovely, classy scent that I keep smelling on my wrist throughout the evening.  THe bottle is a beautiful red and the shape and design is so classy.  So glad I took a chance and bought this beautiful parfum.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love,love,love this perfume! My mother-in-law was purchasing last minute fathers day gifts for my husband and brother-n-law and at the last minute encouraged me to select a fragrance for myself.I have several favorites and I like to think that I am a fragrance connoisseur  I went out on the limb and picked this one based of the reviews n the description of the scent.And needless to say I was utterly pleased!!!!I LOVE it,my husband loves it, my mother-n-law even thought it was the bomb.A definite hit you wont be disappointed.Its a sweet sensual fragrance,sexy, mature and really unique.Just right for a speacial kind of lady.No spice and nothing old about it.Trust me you will enjoy this one.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t charge $120 for this item, when it&#x27;s worth $27, like you had it for sale before...just because the designer is deceased. That&#x27;s crap!</li>
            <li> I love the perfume. This is my first perfume ever and I cannot keep away from using it. It smells elegant and feminine but not super flowery like most. I received countless compliments.</li>
            <li> i always look on amazon to purchase things for a better price and i always find it. smells authentic and its one of my faves</li>
            <li> I really like it and it does last I put it on last night before bed and it is still on.A great new discovery will be using it again happy to see I can get it at amazon for a nice price.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new fragrance and I saw this one had a lot of positive reviews so I went for. It&#x27;s a sweet scent but it&#x27;s also floral but definitely not overpowering. The lasting power is not fantastic but it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this same bottle of perfume at Macy when they actually carried his fragrances and I love this signature scent so when I ran out I needed it replaced so I ordered it from amazon and it was great! When that ran out I needed another and thought I&#x27;d save myself a trip and order online again, but this time it was horrible. Its like I&#x27;m spraying myself with straight alcohol. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume smells so good week with a little musk love the cute bottle has a crown as a top ...</li>
            <li> Arrived to my house in perfect condition no breaks or cracks in bottle and smells as I remembered,  beautifully.</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  Need to buy a case of it before it&#x27;s gone forever!</li>
            <li> Great price could not find this perfume and was so happy to have it !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume on May 2, 2011. It is now June 6th and I still have not received my perfume. They took the money and everything out of my account but did not give me the product!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I buy this perfume and I really like it!! The only thing is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last that long on me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this fragrance! I first discovered it in a magazine and bought a small trial size.  It&#x27;s so worth it, I decided to buy the larger bottle.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely elated this perfume is so cheap on here! It has been a favorite of mine for years. Yes, it&#x27;s the real deal and it definitely is worth the money. It&#x27;s a lighter scent, but I always get tons of compliments on it and it lasts for quite a while (others can still smell it even when I think it is gone). I wear lots of scarves and the scent lasts on those for days. I would definitely purchase this - one bottle usually lasts me about 1-2 years. What a steal!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this fragrant from Dillard&#x27;s back in 2010 and LOVED IT!!! Of course I bought a set that came with the 3.4 eau de parfum, body lotion and shower gel. I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  Was very disappointed when they \\&quot;discontined\\&quot; this fantastic, one of a kind scent.  I went online to discovered I can get it on Amazon.com for a fraction of the cost.  However, I am most disappointed when I received the gift set of the Christian Audigier for Women,.... the first thing I smelled when I sprayed it on was ALCOHOL!!!! This \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; does NOT LAST MORE THAN 2 HOURS!!!!!!!! THE TOP NOTE IS DEFINITELY ALCOHOL, then maybe a little of the other top notes, but very little.  I am very disappointed with this fragrant, and with Amazon for even selling a very \\&quot;watered-down\\&quot; perfume.  Money is no object to me when it comes to perfumes.  I didn&#x27;t mind spending $90 at Dillard&#x27;s for the gift set, so I hope you stop selling this perfume as it doesn&#x27;t lasT at all....</li>
            <li> Love it can&#x27;t beat the price if they keep the price in which I got it as might purchase any for my sister</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and beautiful, however I am disappointed in the length of time that it lasts. It does not last long. The packaging is beautiful as well. I am glad that I did not need to pay the retail price, as I would be very disappointed in the amount of time that this lasts. It seems to dissipate within a half hour.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great! I have received great compliments every time I use it. I don&#x27;t know why they took it off the market.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this perfume--I just love the subtle smell of this perfume! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I could no longer find this fragrance in stores, but found it here. Love it. O ordered 2 for myself &amp; 1 for my daughter.</li>
            <li> My header says it all. I STILL have it and I use it often! I love the smell and the bottle is gorg! I will cont. buying this perfume.</li>
            <li> It was a pleasant surprise when the item showed up and it was in a gift pack. My wife was extremely thrilled and has wanted this for over a year.</li>
            <li> I was presently surprised that this was an entire gift set and not just the perfume.  I love it and it was very much to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I ordered a bottle of this perfume and much to my delight, I received an entire gift set including a small bottle for my purse as well as body lotion and shower gel. The scent is fantastic and I&#x27;m so happy with my choice!! I love getting Amazon cards for Christmas because I&#x27;ll take a chance and buy something I typically wouldn&#x27;t treat myself to. Great find, great bonus, and great transaction. Thanks again Amazon, you nailed it.</li>
            <li> I was given this perfume as a gift, and ever since continue to order it. People ask to come up and smell me... it&#x27;s very fresh, and I never get sick of it.</li>
            <li> An amazing fragrance. I love it!!  Always get compliments on what a refreshing smell and that it smells desirable on me.</li>
            <li> It came in the mail faster than what it est. time was.  About the 3rd of the time.  And it smells awesome.  Just like how &#x27;I bought it at the store but 1/2 the price</li>
            <li> Exactly as described smells great!</li>
            <li> I am 24 and i get so many compliments on this stuff. its a very sexy distinct smell. My absolute favorite :)</li>
