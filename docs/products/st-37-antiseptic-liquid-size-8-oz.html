            <li> It is a great substitute for alcohol at injection sites preventing dry skin and itching.  Our cat, Dillon, had diabetes and had to have insulin twice daily.  The alcohol pad prep made her skin dry and flake at the injection sites.  This prepped the skin and fur at the injection site and did not irritate her skin.  Made it much easier for her.  We took her ST 37 with us on vet visits to both her regular vet and her specialist.</li>
            <li> very good for small burn.  Have used it for years.  I am a retired physician and pains for burns are usually gone by the end of the office visit.  I love it for sunburns</li>
            <li> This is the greatest antiseptic you can use.  We used to be able to get this in any drug store when I was a kid and now I haven&#x27;t seen it in a store for 25 years.  I&#x27;m delighted to find it on Amazon.  My mother always used this with us and we never got an infection as long as we used it.  It doesn&#x27;t hurts either.  I&#x27;m one of those unfortunate people who have had the &amp;#34;Shingles&amp;#34; now for over a year.  I have found the S.T.37 gives me some relief from the pain.  Not a cure for the Shingles but some relief.  Anyway, I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years to treat burns after a pharmacist recommended it to treat a severe sunburn. Extremely effective in drawing the heat out and reducing the healing time. It is a staple item in my medicine chest.</li>
            <li> This is magical medication!  It does not sting or burn and heals quickly!  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!  Everyone should be using it!</li>
            <li> Never heard of this product before but am so glad I tried it! I have always had problems with my tonsils but I gargled with this one time and the next morning most of the soreness is gone. I love it. Please don&#x27;t rely on only this if you suspect you might have strep with fever,etc. But for a plain sore throat it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> Good old fashioned product that works well for a sore throat or mouth irritations.&lt;br /&gt;Bought it for my mom.  Hard to find locally, and her &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; wanted to sell&lt;br /&gt;her a bottle of it for $14 AND the expiration date was 2 months away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy to have found it here. Good price and very good expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;personally speaking the very, very sweet taste gags me, but have to admit it does&lt;br /&gt;help soothe a sore throat  fran</li>
            <li> Great transaction!  I&#x27;m so glad that I can get ST 37 through Amazon now!  It&#x27;s so hard to find it in stores.  My family has used it for generations!</li>
            <li> I remembered this antiseptic from my childhood.  Used to use it for mouth sores and other cuts and scrapes since it is safe for just about any area of the body.  It is the best stuff because it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn, it just cleans out an injury or the like and if it gets near the mouth or nose it is safe.  I was looking for it to clean out my dog&#x27;s ears to keep her from getting an infection.  Seems to have worked. It is gentle yet hard working.  Sometimes the old time stiff is the best stuff.</li>
            <li> Once in a while my ear lobs will become infected from wearing earrings.  This is the only product that will heal them in a hurry!</li>
            <li> Grew up with this magical solution in the 70s and it worked every time without burning scrapes, mouth sores and whatever else ailed me.</li>
            <li> I have loved this antiseptic since I was a child.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt when applied like iodine or Merthiolate does!  Amazon price is reasonable for this size bottle.</li>
            <li> This product works great for cuts and scraps since I am a diabetic  they heal much quicker&lt;br /&gt;I would recommed this to anyone for cuts and scraps.</li>
            <li> This is the best antiseptic on the market. It can be used externally and it can use used as an oral antiseptic as long as you don&#x27;t swallow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Good for sore throats as well as cuts and scrapes.&lt;br /&gt;Does not sting. Everyone should have it in their medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly good stuff</li>
            <li> I have used St 37 for at least 75 years and always found it excellent for its purpose. I can no longwer find it in my home town, but was successful in finding it on Amazon. It came promptly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great to gargle for sore throat, gum irratations.. knocks it out.. used as a kid by my Granddaddy whenever I felt like I was getting strap throat used it excellent product not sure why the drug stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore..  Thank you great product</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Use for example for sore throats and other irritations</li>
