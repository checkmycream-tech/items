            <li>This is an excellent hand lotion.  </li>
            <li>This one is awesome.</li>
            <li>The delivery was as usually perfect!</li>
            <li>It is very good.</li>
            <li>It smells great</li>
            <li>Moroccanoil products are wonderful, and we all love the fragrance they are so known for, but save your money</li>
            <li>Rich hand creme, however, does not have the wonderful scent I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>The lotion is nice</li>
            <li>I liked the smell and texture.</li>
            <li>It does not smell like the moroccan hair oil but has its own very light almost indiscernible scent.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very fast and makes my hands and feet feel great and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I LOVE the smell of Moroccan oil shampoo and conditioner, this doesn&#x27;t smell like them.</li>
            <li>Great seller; love the product; quick ship; highly recommend product &amp; seller.</li>
            <li>This is a good hand cream but the price point is just way too high for a hand cream.</li>
            <li>I have received a free sample of this cream when I bought a hair mask and shampoo by Maroccanoil.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li>It was love at first touch.</li>
            <li>This hand cream is light and creamy and has a fresh light scent.</li>
            <li>Most hand creams out there really bother me.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for the wonderful fragrance usually found in Morrocan Oil products, KEEP LOOKING!  </li>
            <li>I am super picky about textures and lotions and smells.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different hand moisturizers and nothing comes close.  </li>
            <li>it was also very liquidy/thin.  </li>
            <li>It does not smell like the MO products but it is very moisturizing for your hands.</li>
            <li>but so do other hand lotions that smell better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hands down my favorite.  </li>
            <li>and she said the lotion makes her hands very soft.</li>
            <li>Even when I put on a thick coat of this moisturizer, it is absorbed so quickly and my skin feels so soft and soothed.</li>
            <li>She applies this lotion frequently when she is not working</li>

            <li> not at all what i expected.</li>
            <li> It smells nothing like the other products.</li>
            <li> it did not have the typical moroccanoil smell that i expected.  </li>
            <li> I overlooked this product doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the other Moroccan oil products - it has a citrus smell blended in...too bad because I love the Moroccan oil smell - but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all, and it makes your hands feel like silk without being oily.</li>
            <li> I was very disapointed in the smell...:(</li>
            <li> I Bought this assuming ( and only) for trade mark sent and it does not AT ALL :-(.</li>
            <li> This was a very disappointing purchase, not the seller&#x27;s fault, but truly disappointing.  </li>
            <li> This hand lotion stinks!  </li>

            <li> Nothing else works as well.  I have tried so many different hand moisturizers and nothing comes close.  Even when I put on a thick coat of this moisturizer, it is absorbed so quickly and my skin feels so soft and soothed.</li>
            <li> disappoined of the smell</li>
            <li> it did not have the typical moroccanoil smell that i expected.  it was also very liquidy/thin.  not at all what i expected.</li>
            <li> Great seller; love the product; quick ship; highly recommend product &amp; seller. Five Stars!!!!! A+++++!</li>
            <li> The lotion is nice but I wish it smelled like the oil. It doesn&#x27;t so don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did.</li>
            <li> Rich hand creme, however, does not have the wonderful scent I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I LOVE the smell of Moroccan oil shampoo and conditioner, this doesn&#x27;t smell like them. They moisturize well but so do other hand lotions that smell better. I was very disapointed in the smell...:(</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hand lotion.  It does not smell like the MO products but it is very moisturizing for your hands.</li>
            <li> I am super picky about textures and lotions and smells. Most hand creams out there really bother me.  This one is awesome. It&#x27;s hands down my favorite.  It does not smell like the moroccan hair oil but has its own very light almost indiscernible scent. If I had to put it in a category, I would pick citrus over flowery or perfumey.  It absorbs very fast and makes my hands and feet feel great and not greasy at all.  I buy 2 at a time.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the wonderful fragrance usually found in Morrocan Oil products, KEEP LOOKING!  This hand lotion stinks!  It smells nothing like the other products.</li>
            <li> This was a very disappointing purchase, not the seller&#x27;s fault, but truly disappointing.  Moroccanoil products are wonderful, and we all love the fragrance they are so known for, but save your money it&#x27;s not in this product at all.  I wonder why?</li>
            <li> Wish I had read reviews. I Bought this assuming ( and only) for trade mark sent and it does not AT ALL :-(.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion for my aunt. She loves it. It smells great and she said the lotion makes her hands very soft. My aunt works in health care and she washed hers hands alot. She applies this lotion frequently when she is not working and it eliminates the potential dryness even during the winter months. Pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li> I have received a free sample of this cream when I bought a hair mask and shampoo by Maroccanoil. I liked the smell and texture. It is very good. It was love at first touch. So I immediately ordered a big tube on Amazon. The delivery was as usually perfect!</li>
            <li> This is a good hand cream but the price point is just way too high for a hand cream.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is light and creamy and has a fresh light scent. It was suggested on the Dr OZ show.</li>
