            <li>but a good idea i got from a mouth hygiene book called Oil Pulling Therapy by Bruce Fife is to dissolve xylitol crystals in water and use it as a mouth rinse for those people who don&#x27;t want to swallow it</li>

            <li>Will purchase more.</li>
            <li>I love my Sea Bckthorn oil.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li>it will come off on clothing, but does wash out easily.  </li>
            <li>Sea Buckthorn has helped with a range of skin difficulties from roseacea, irritation, acne and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Also, it helps acne marks go through their cycle and heal more quickly, in my experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent product and from other Sea Blackthorn oils products that I got, its a true quality product.</li>
            <li>and I feel fantastic.</li>
            <li>And the Seller&#x27;s service is above and beyond great.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this oil as it makes my skin glow, looks youthful and smooth .  </li>
            <li>This time I got an excellent product and intend to use this particular brand in future.</li>
            <li>was excited to try this in a face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Product is a rich oil that I hope works wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li>I originally started using it for my stomach problems.</li>
            <li>If someone else has more expert experience with this oil, I&#x27;d be interested in an opinion as to purity.  </li>
            <li>It smells great to me and leaves my skin looking a little \\&quot;tan\\&quot; with a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>did you know that toothpaste can be used to clean (polish) car headlights?  </li>
            <li>what it says, but the oil feels viscous enough to be good</li>
            <li>I think it is a terrific product and people should buy more often, many uses.</li>
            <li>this stuff is the real deal and fabulous, use it for your skin, hair and TEETH, I love this stuff and fast shipping</li>
            <li>I have used this product for the last 8 months and have had amazing results.</li>
            <li>However, unlike what those reviewers said, the colors fade when the oil is absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li>There is a notable firmness to my cheeks and my skin tone has evened considerably.</li>
            <li>After it&#x27;s absorbed, you can immediately feel a difference in your skin texture.</li>
            <li>No other oil can claim to consist of so many critical vitamins like Omega 3, 6, and 9.It also has large quantities of Vitamin A and E both extremely good for the skin.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, very fresh oil.</li>
            <li>I read online that this oil in particular is only good for a year.</li>
            <li>yes, you read that right, about 30 years.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m genetically lucky that I don&#x27;t have cellulite or stretch marks, but I know that this summer several of my close friends asked me what I do to keep my legs in particular looking so nice.</li>
            <li>have super pale skin, so this come out a bright orange-yellow on my skin, and it stays that way, but</li>
            <li>i had almost two ounces of sea buckthorn oil left after adding it to a skincare recipe, and since i had read that it was also great for teeth and gums, also that it whitened teeth, i mixed it with y.s. super-enriched honey that has bee pollen, propolis, and royal jelly added.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure how often I will be using this product, but it is supposed to be very effective.</li>
            <li>Love the product, the only thing was the box</li>
            <li>I think it smells pretty.</li>
            <li>My skin soaked it all up very quickly and left me glowing.  </li>
            <li>I use it mostly for allergic rashes and dry skin</li>
            <li>Unlike the serums that you can buy that have additives, this is pure.</li>
            <li>Like some of the reviewers said, it DOES cause your face to turn orange if you use a large portion.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, a little medicinal (think Ricola herbal cough</li>
            <li>She also has pretty high standards for health care.  </li>
            <li>However, I decided to take it straight from the tap, no gimmicks, no added vitamins.</li>
            <li>Yes it is very orange when you slather it on</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li>This product is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything under the sun spending so much money.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really seen much change in the sun damage.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil.</li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it topically for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have had no experience with Buckthorn Oil - so will have to try another brand to really know if this stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I searched through many other products before finding this one.</li>
            <li>It has been a tremendous help with her daily pain level.  </li>
            <li>Main ingredient is Olive oil carrier.  </li>
            <li>My acupunture  practioner reccomended this highly</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>my teeth have become healthier and whiter using only sea buckthorn oil to clean them, and gentle waterpik-ing occasionally, well, and oil pulling with coconut oil in spurts.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out in the December air as quickly anymore.</li>
            <li>Just a side note that my grandmother is very old school and does not buy into a lot of hype.  </li>
            <li>Brings childhood memories back ;-)</li>
            <li>I ordered it knowing it was all natural.</li>
            <li>I got this oil and applied it directly to my arms and face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it on scars, cuts, acne, stretch marks etc., and I think it has made a difference and generally improved the quality of my skin.</li>
            <li>My arms are now nearly like there were years ago after only one week.  </li>
            <li>only complaint is that it&#x27;s more than doubled in price since I last bought it.</li>
            <li>the dentist told me this last week, and i really think the sea buckthorn oil has the potential to absorb into and release every every bit of even that most resistant and difficult to remove plaque.  </li>
            <li>The smell can be a little off putting at first</li>
            <li>For those who doesn&#x27;t know Russian: there are no other oils added in a bottle.</li>
            <li>However, I have used and am using other highly beneficial oils such as organic Argan and organic pumpkin seed.</li>

            <li> I know they say nothing works for stretch marks and everything people will sell you is hype, but I have some on my bust, and I really, really think this made them less pink and smaller.</li>
            <li> I used oil long time ago at Russia (~30years) for skin and internal use.</li>
            <li> When I received the oil, I was a &#x27;little&#x27; surprised that the product box (including instructions) were in RUSSIAN!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy this because it was listed alongside other Sea Buckthorn oils that are more branded for cosmetics.</li>
            <li> i dont give it a low review just because i didnt not try harder to make the product work.</li>
            <li> This is a very concdentrated, thick oil.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve searched for this item, you know that there are serums, pills, and other topical forms of SB oil.</li>
            <li> Warning...allow to dry or</li>
            <li> The capsules only contain less of what you need and the drinks contain trace amounts.  </li>
            <li> there was previously, except there is still some on the inside of the bottom four front teeth as mentioned above.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my hair sometimes since that is very dry too.</li>
            <li> When recently I thought an oil at US, I found only blended mixtures, which were not effective as advertised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update a few months later, maybe 6 months (today is august 10, 2013):&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was checking this oil out due to a specialist on Dr. Oz because my skin is damaged from allergies, animals, and have become very dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It also blends easily with other base creams to give a fortified facial skin cream</li>
            <li> The other surprise was that the oil itself is &#x27;orange&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Within a two weeks of using it I noticed other effects I did not expect.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> Not sure about this ..... have used it several times, leaves an orange tint to the skin which diminishes in about twenty minutes.  </li>
            <li> I do mix with other oils like argon oil etc.</li>
            <li> yes even my stomach problems have gone down.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on other drinks and capsules.</li>
            <li> It does leave a slight orange color</li>
            <li> My friend went crazy over this oil after her first use.  </li>
            <li> The price here is now nearly twice what my other two suppliers charge for the uncut version.</li>
            <li> the thought of coating my face in oil still scares me a little.</li>
            <li> I went through a little phase this summer where I was buying all kinds of oils (hemp, evening primrose, tamanu, emu, on and on and on) and giving them a go on my skin.</li>
            <li> I gave a little bit to my friend and she also loves it.  </li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> but you are going to wait a few minutes - 20 minutes and wipe it off.</li>
            <li> few odds and ends:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t know, though, because i&#x27;m getting my teeth cleaned in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> for the past few days, maybe a week, i have been brushing my teeth with this mixture every day.  </li>
            <li> there was a small amount of plaque on my teeth, having not had them cleaned at the dentist since 1984.  </li>
            <li> these past ~6 months have seen the removal of almost every speck of whatever plaque</li>
            <li> Hardly a reason to take off stars for if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You need at least 2 tsp 2x a day.</li>
            <li> And she is very hard to impress.  </li>
            <li> I guess the secret&#x27;s out.</li>
            <li> I was wrong, however.</li>
            <li> Not great and make ur skin and clothes orange !??</li>
            <li> Product used in lotion so its effectiveness is difficult to gauge.</li>
            <li> You can use Google to translate it if your that desperate for the reading.</li>
            <li> it smelled bad.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in product.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what Sea Buckthorn Oil should smell like - but this stuff smelled awful.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered the product 2 times now, both came with an expiration of 1/12/15 (packed on 1/12/14). I read online that this oil in particular is only good for a year. Bummed that I had to go through the hassle of ordering twice, and currently trying to deal with returning this one.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try this in a face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice warm glow like a bronzer, smell is pleasant I will order it again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy this because it was listed alongside other Sea Buckthorn oils that are more branded for cosmetics. I was wrong, however. If you&#x27;ve searched for this item, you know that there are serums, pills, and other topical forms of SB oil. However, I decided to take it straight from the tap, no gimmicks, no added vitamins. Just SB at it&#x27;s best. My golly has it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 100% SB oil. Unlike the serums that you can buy that have additives, this is pure. The smell can be a little off putting at first but it dissipates after about 30 seconds or so. Like some of the reviewers said, it DOES cause your face to turn orange if you use a large portion. However, unlike what those reviewers said, the colors fade when the oil is absorbed into your skin. Hardly a reason to take off stars for if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beauty of this product is its beneficial properties to the skin. No other oil can claim to consist of so many critical vitamins like Omega 3, 6, and 9.It also has large quantities of Vitamin A and E both extremely good for the skin. BASICALLY, what you get in this bottle is a value of over $500 for name brand serums, juices, lotions, and scrubs. PLUS it has the added benefit of being all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you how my skin has been since using this for five days. The moisture in my skin has become resilient. It doesn&#x27;t dry out in the December air as quickly anymore. There is a notable firmness to my cheeks and my skin tone has evened considerably. It has even helped some of my scars to go a couple shades lighter. I mix this with my night time moisturizer so that it can be applied evenly--the thought of coating my face in oil still scares me a little. After it&#x27;s absorbed, you can immediately feel a difference in your skin texture.</li>
            <li> When I received the oil, I was a &#x27;little&#x27; surprised that the product box (including instructions) were in RUSSIAN!  I did not have a clue as to how to administer.  The other surprise was that the oil itself is &#x27;orange&#x27;.  Very disappointed in product.  I did apply it at night but did not see any result.  Would not recommend.  I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Yes it is very orange when you slather it on but you are going to wait a few minutes - 20 minutes and wipe it off. When you do the color does not stay on your skin, and better yet excess &amp;#34;critters&amp;#34; demodex mites have been wiped away as well while your skin has been nourished. For healthy glow add just a drop to your day cream. You can drink it, you can brush your teeth with it. So many healthy ways to use it.</li>
            <li> I found this to be the cheapest price.  Love the product, the only thing was the box was all in Russian.</li>
            <li> Not great and make ur skin and clothes orange !??</li>
            <li> Product is a rich oil that I hope works wonders for my skin. only time will tell.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last 8 months and have had amazing results. I have not had a sign of eczema since I started. I originally started using it for my stomach problems. Within a two weeks of using it I noticed other effects I did not expect. My arthritis began to go away  and after a month I was Pain free! I did tons of research to corroborate my experience and what I found was amazing. This stuff really does work. I searched through many other products before finding this one. It is the best bang for the buck. I take 2 tsp per day and I feel fantastic. NO ECZEMA out breaks, NO arthritis pains and yes even my stomach problems have gone down.  Make no mistake. This is a supplement not a cure but its the best thing out there if you ask me.  TRY IT...yes it is in Russian..Get over it. You can use Google to translate it if your that desperate for the reading. This product is the real deal. Don&#x27;t waste your money on other drinks and capsules. The capsules only contain less of what you need and the drinks contain trace amounts.  You need at least 2 tsp 2x a day.</li>
            <li> I was checking this oil out due to a specialist on Dr. Oz because my skin is damaged from allergies, animals, and have become very dry and itchy. It&#x27;s at the point of embarrassment.  I refused to use chemical creams so  I ordered it knowing it was all natural. I have tried everything under the sun spending so much money.  I got this oil and applied it directly to my arms and face.  My skin soaked it all up very quickly and left me glowing.  My arms are now nearly like there were years ago after only one week.  I am telling everyone about this miracle oil.  It also tastes great!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for me, my mother, and my gramma.  My grandmother had told us about it after watching a Dr. Oz segment about it helping with arthritis.  So after taking it for 2 weeks, my gramma&#x27;s quote was that she has felt better in the past week than what she has felt over the past 5 years.  It has been a tremendous help with her daily pain level.  My mother and I got it for potential weight loss and skincare benefits but neither of us has begun using it daily yet.  Just a side note that my grandmother is very old school and does not buy into a lot of hype.  She also has pretty high standards for health care.  And she is very hard to impress.  So if it has made her feel this good - I&#x27;m in.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I&#x27;ve always known the healing power of the Sea Buckthorn, so it does not surprise me at all. The quality is wonderful! And the Seller&#x27;s service is above and beyond great. A+ product and A+++ Seller!</li>
            <li> This stuff is good for everything, skin, hair, cooking, etc.</li>
            <li> My acupunture  practioner reccomended this highly I hope it does all it says it does it seems to have helped</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks now, and I really do think it works. I&#x27;ve been using it on scars, cuts, acne, stretch marks etc., and I think it has made a difference and generally improved the quality of my skin. I know they say nothing works for stretch marks and everything people will sell you is hype, but I have some on my bust, and I really, really think this made them less pink and smaller. Also, it helps acne marks go through their cycle and heal more quickly, in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few odds and ends:&lt;br /&gt;I have super pale skin, so this come out a bright orange-yellow on my skin, and it stays that way, but I put this on before bed, and it has always faded by the morning, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about being stained orange forever.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle on this is adorable, it looks cute and old-fashioned and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is all in Russian, so I have no idea what it says, but the oil feels viscous enough to be good quality.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice...like nothing I&#x27;ve ever smelled before, but nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I would recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for something to improve your skin!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, very fresh oil.</li>
            <li> This is a very concdentrated, thick oil.  I mix it with either body or face lotion...a little goes a long way!  It smells great to me and leaves my skin looking a little \\&quot;tan\\&quot; with a healthy glow.  Warning...allow to dry or it will come off on clothing, but does wash out easily.  Sea Buckthorn has helped with a range of skin difficulties from roseacea, irritation, acne and fine lines.  Highly recommended.  Amazon, as always for me, is a preferred seller seller of all things.</li>
            <li> Not sure about this ..... have used it several times, leaves an orange tint to the skin which diminishes in about twenty minutes.  Haven&#x27;t really seen much change in the sun damage.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. I have been using it for quite a while now and I will continue to use it. I use it mostly for allergic rashes and dry skin and it works very well. I also use it on my hair sometimes since that is very dry too. I think you will like it if you try it.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this. I went through a little phase this summer where I was buying all kinds of oils (hemp, evening primrose, tamanu, emu, on and on and on) and giving them a go on my skin. The winners for me/the only things I&#x27;d go out of my way to repurchase were this and neem oil. I mix it with whatever else I have on hand, like coconut or sesame oil, and go to town massaging it all over after I have dry-brushed and before I shower. I think I&#x27;m genetically lucky that I don&#x27;t have cellulite or stretch marks, but I know that this summer several of my close friends asked me what I do to keep my legs in particular looking so nice. I&#x27;ve always done the self-massage routine (in ayurveda, called abhyenga) in addition to eating well and doing yoga, but I think this oil was what was knocking it out of the park. It absorbs very nicely and gives an even, golden &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to your skin. It smells nice, a little medicinal (think Ricola herbal cough drops).&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it&#x27;s more than doubled in price since I last bought it. I guess the secret&#x27;s out.</li>
            <li> Go to this website and put it in Google translate for more information about this amazing product - http://altay-organic.ru/internet-magazin/product/5758021 And for people that think the product is expired it&#x27;s not in Russia they write day / month / year for expiration details.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I enjoy using it topically for my skin.  It does leave a slight orange color but it dissipates.  It also blends easily with other base creams to give a fortified facial skin cream</li>
            <li> I used oil long time ago at Russia (~30years) for skin and internal use. When recently I thought an oil at US, I found only blended mixtures, which were not effective as advertised. This time I got an excellent product and intend to use this particular brand in future.</li>
            <li> Great product with good expiration date</li>
            <li> It gets all over my clothes and stains them.</li>
            <li> I loooove love love this oil. I gave a little bit to my friend and she also loves it.  I will continue to use this oil as it makes my skin glow, looks youthful and smooth .  My friend went crazy over this oil after her first use.  I use it at night on my face instead of night cream and my skin is not orange or oily.  A little bit goes a long way.  Price is great too, delivery was quick and prompt.</li>
            <li> i had almost two ounces of sea buckthorn oil left after adding it to a skincare recipe, and since i had read that it was also great for teeth and gums, also that it whitened teeth, i mixed it with y.s. super-enriched honey that has bee pollen, propolis, and royal jelly added.  for the past few days, maybe a week, i have been brushing my teeth with this mixture every day.  my teeth are whiter than they were a week ago.  as a note, i have added a third product to the mix, xylitol crystals, for its tooth healing properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update a few months later, maybe 6 months (today is august 10, 2013):&lt;br /&gt;sometime shortly after writing the above review, i began brushing with sea buckthorn oil by itself.  there was a small amount of plaque on my teeth, having not had them cleaned at the dentist since 1984.  yes, you read that right, about 30 years.  there has never been a lot of plaque on my teeth, but there was some, and quite a bit of plaque on the inside of the four bottom front teeth.  these past ~6 months have seen the removal of almost every speck of whatever plaque there was previously, except there is still some on the inside of the bottom four front teeth as mentioned above.  the dentist told me this last week, and i really think the sea buckthorn oil has the potential to absorb into and release every every bit of even that most resistant and difficult to remove plaque.  won&#x27;t know, though, because i&#x27;m getting my teeth cleaned in a few weeks.  i stopped using toothpaste entirely, as it is an abrasive.  did you know that toothpaste can be used to clean (polish) car headlights?  it is abrasive even when used with water.  my teeth have become healthier and whiter using only sea buckthorn oil to clean them, and gentle waterpik-ing occasionally, well, and oil pulling with coconut oil in spurts.  i plan to stay with the sea buckthorn oil regimen.  other oils might do just as good of a job, but i&#x27;m happy with this, although changing oils out might be good, too.  my teeth always look as though they have just been cleaned by the hygienist.  as an aside, i never did keep up with the xylitol.  but a good idea i got from a mouth hygiene book called Oil Pulling Therapy by Bruce Fife is to dissolve xylitol crystals in water and use it as a mouth rinse for those people who don&#x27;t want to swallow it (because xylitol&#x27;s one big drawback seems to be that it CAN flourish an undesirable clostridium bacteria in the bowel, usually no big deal).teeth always look as though they have just been cleaned by the hygienist.  as an aside, i never did keep up with the xylitol.  but a good idea i got from a mouth hygiene book called Oil Pulling Therapy by Bruce Fife is to dissolve xylitol crystals in water and use it as a mouth rinse for those people who don&#x27;t want to swallow it (because xylitol&#x27;s one big drawback seems to be that it CAN flourish an undesirable clostridium bacteria in the bowel, usually no big deal).</li>
            <li> Excellent product and from other Sea Blackthorn oils products that I got, its a true quality product. Very much satisfied, excellent results from internal/external application! Recommend to anyone! Bought another two bottles just now!</li>
            <li> Ended up using it for skincare! On my off days, I just sit with this on my face, reapplying every time my skin soaks it up, for a couple hours. It leaves my skin looking so healthy, helps even my complexion and nourishes me with all its antioxidant powers. I think it smells pretty. I know some people add this to their drinks for weight loss but I couldn&#x27;t stand the taste. I&#x27;ll stick to the jump rope! And as an Esthetician, I like to facial myself a ton... would recommend!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a noticeable difference in my skin tone and clarity. I use it morning and night and I have not noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> Very good for skin and gums.  I think it is a terrific product and people should buy more often, many uses.</li>
            <li> I did not like this oil it smelled bad. i dont give it a low review just because i didnt not try harder to make the product work.</li>
            <li> As of now I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference it has made in my health. Probably will not buy anymore since it has not relieved my RA in any way.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how often I will be using this product, but it is supposed to be very effective. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Yes, this oil is nice. Specifically it smells nice, very sweet. However, I have used and am using other highly beneficial oils such as organic Argan and organic pumpkin seed. I do not feel that the recent steep price increase on this oil is warranted, especially since it is not organic. I have another bottle from another source and it smells a bit similar to neem seed (pungent) in addition to the sweetness. If someone else has more expert experience with this oil, I&#x27;d be interested in an opinion as to purity.  The price here is now nearly twice what my other two suppliers charge for the uncut version.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what Sea Buckthorn Oil should smell like - but this stuff smelled awful.  I have tried to use it in my lotion making - but essential oils did not mask the odor, guess I have to use more.  I have had no experience with Buckthorn Oil - so will have to try another brand to really know if this stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use on my face and it makes my complexion glow. I do mix with other oils like argon oil etc. A little goes a long way. Will purchase more.</li>
            <li> Good quality oil, rich in flavor. Brings childhood memories back ;-) For those who doesn&#x27;t know Russian: there are no other oils added in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Main ingredient is Olive oil carrier.  Product used in lotion so its effectiveness is difficult to gauge.</li>
            <li> this stuff is the real deal and fabulous, use it for your skin, hair and TEETH, I love this stuff and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I used this bottle in my last batch of soap. I love the way it turned out! I got tired of spending 5-7$ a bar on those available in stores and online. I will be an regular customer from this company. Super fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li> I love my Sea Bckthorn oil. Shipment was great fast and packed very safe. Was pleasure doing business with you</li>
