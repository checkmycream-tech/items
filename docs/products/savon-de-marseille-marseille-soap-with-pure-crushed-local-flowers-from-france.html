            <li>The smell is very strong when you get it</li>

            <li>I look forward to taking a shower knowing I&#x27;ll be covered in this lovely soap.  </li>
            <li>The product smells great, and is the real deal.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m glad i found this soap.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I came across it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also glad to know that there are still quality handmade products on the market still nowadays.</li>
            <li>After this short, 2 minute process, my sponges are perfect.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I can only use this soap on the parts of my skin that are healthy, which I did and this soap provided excellent moisturization.</li>
            <li>It filled the kitchen, hallway and the living room with its amazing fragrance after I opened it.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>This soap has lovely scent, creamy foam</li>
            <li>This soap is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I used this soap with no problem and love love love the natural rose scent that was used in the making of this soap!  </li>
            <li>Quality is great and all natural.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t believe the reviews could be so good on this one</li>
            <li>This is to love, feel this deep cleaning and that great after shower smell.</li>
            <li>not too strong nor too light.</li>
            <li>It looks like a HUGE block of marble.</li>
            <li>Great soap, will last sometime too.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact is gives my entire bathroom nice, rose flavor, smell.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>but eventually my face is squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>This soap has to be the most unique and unusual bar of soap that I have ever seen.</li>
            <li>I worked in a rose garden one summer, and the scent of this soap reminds me of the old fashioned roses in that garden...</li>
            <li>Great gift or for yourself, very well made, lasts pretty long as well, I may buy more as gifts.</li>
            <li>Cleans them great, though does leave kind of a dry sticky feeling to them (like my sponges have been sucked of moisture and glycerine has been added to them somehow), but what I&#x27;ve found is if I rinse afterward with Purity face cleanser by Philosophy, the sponge is replenished with enough moisture to keep it from ripping.</li>
            <li>I love to take shower but even more simply because of this soap.</li>
            <li>I prefer the lavender over the rose, but thought I would try something different.</li>
            <li>The soap is made of products that are healthy for your skin and natural.</li>
            <li>It is worth all the $$$.</li>
            <li>Pretty much just regular bar soap that smells really good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t get all my makeup off right away</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>pretty.</li>
            <li>It made my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>but wow is everyone right!  </li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t overly strong, and while mild will last all day long, keeping you smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>it really does what it says it does.</li>
            <li>I would do business with this company again especially when they offer free shipping.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping to hawaii,</li>
            <li>the sponge needs to be rejuvenated without adding too much and eventually causing your skin to break out from an excess of oil).  </li>
            <li>The fragrance scents the whole house.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It has the sweetest smell of roses, and as an additional bonus, it doubles as an air freshener, because the whole bathroom has that smell just because the soap is in my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never smelled anything like this soap, except on real roses, up close.  </li>
            <li>This soap keeps my skin moisture better than other soaps.</li>
            <li>This soap is very gentle on the soap; the skin feels moistureized and soft after using it.</li>
            <li>One thing I really noticed about it is that it rinsed completely off the skin.  </li>
            <li>I have wild roses near the house and this soap smells exactly like my flowers</li>
            <li>Rose smell is subtle but there.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feels so good, not only to touch but also the delicate scent it has.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>First thing to realize, this comes in a big, unwieldy block which you will have to chisel to a bathing usable size.</li>
            <li>and it is worth the money for how long it lasts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No more allergic dermatitis :)</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;very natural and softly lasting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was worried it would smell like an old lady&#x27;s sachet, but it doesn&#x27;t - it smells like roses.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel really soft and it cleans quite well.</li>
            <li>Also, I like the natural smell.</li>
            <li>It smells like old rubber tires.</li>
            <li>It lasted forever and the lather is silky soft.  </li>
            <li>but it probably will last a long time which would make it economically feasible.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found this soap does dry my hands out a little, but not as much as most of the soaps I have used.  </li>
            <li>At first I was a little put off by the big square shape of it but the amazingly intense and natural aroma of the roses won me and my Husband over.  </li>
            <li>It stands about three normal bars of soap tall/wide and lasts about as long.</li>
            <li>The scent is not too strong or weak,  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> block shape is interesting and a little difficult to hold, but I&#x27;m used to it now</li>
            <li> The bar lasts forever, if it is allowed to dry between uses.</li>
            <li> During the winter months my skin gets very very dry</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Me personally I cut off just a piece for my everyday use and save the rest.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful about the products that I use on these areas.</li>
            <li> so consequently I have to be careful about what soap I use.</li>
            <li> I intend to try each of the other flowered soaps.  </li>
            <li> Scent will not last past 7 minutes out of the shower though.</li>
            <li> I also test the PH level, it shows between 7~8; not easy to find other soap like this one.</li>
            <li> though the purchase price is expensive, the long use has actually proven it</li>
            <li> yourself a little.</li>
            <li> The bar was a little pricey</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not overwhelming at all.  </li>
            <li> The only disappointment was that the soap arrived crudely wrapped in rough, brown paper that did not do the soap any justice but did not affect the quality of the soap itself.  </li>
            <li> I only use Savon de Marseille soaps and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> Currently, I am having some serious issues with a horrible yeast infection on both legs and one arm</li>
            <li> It looks like the soap would be difficult to hold onto when bathing because it is quite chunky.  </li>
            <li> Nothing is wrong with this soap!</li>
            <li> I HATE THE ORANGE FLOWER SOAP.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Feels like I&#x27;m in France when I use this soap.&lt;br /&gt;The rose petals embedded work as a light exfoliant and I find the smell&lt;br /&gt;very natural and softly lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The block shape is interesting and a little difficult to hold, but I&#x27;m used to it now&lt;br /&gt;and have been very impressed how well it has held up.  I think it will last me for months&lt;br /&gt;and though the purchase price is expensive, the long use has actually proven it a very good value.&lt;br /&gt;Spoil yourself a little.</li>
            <li> This soap is pretty good.  It lathers well for a good cleaning and keeps the skin moisturized.  One thing I really noticed about it is that it rinsed completely off the skin.  Some soaps can leave the skin itchy feeling.  This soap did not do this at all.</li>
            <li> This soap is perfect.  I was worried it would smell like an old lady&#x27;s sachet, but it doesn&#x27;t - it smells like roses.  This soap feels great and never dries out the skin.  I love it, love it and never want to be without it.  I intend to try each of the other flowered soaps.  I look forward to taking a shower knowing I&#x27;ll be covered in this lovely soap.  Thank you Amazon and thank you Savon de Marseille.</li>
            <li> First thing to realize, this comes in a big, unwieldy block which you will have to chisel to a bathing usable size. Rose smell is subtle but there. Scent will not last past 7 minutes out of the shower though. I do like the exfoliating aspect to this soap. However, for the price charged, there are way better alternatives out the to Rose soap.</li>
            <li> The product smells great, and is the real deal. It stands about three normal bars of soap tall/wide and lasts about as long. The scent isn&#x27;t overly strong, and while mild will last all day long, keeping you smelling fresh. The best way to describe it is just that, a fresh, non-cologne, light rose smell. Will definitely continue to buy from this same seller French Soaps as they are proven quality.</li>
            <li> omg. i&#x27;m glad i found this soap. it really does what it says it does. i feel a difference in my skin after using it. i&#x27;m never going back to store brand beauty bars. i ordered the rose scented one. the smell is perfect for me. not too strong nor too light.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! My whole house has a beautiful  rose scent from the soap. During the winter months my skin gets very very dry and I go through massive amounts of lotion. 4 days with this soap and I no longer need to use lotion! While they are definitely girly scents I would recommend for anyone!</li>
            <li> The rose smell is wonderful, and the soap leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> the soap smells really nice.  As a matter of fact is gives my entire bathroom nice, rose flavor, smell. I would by the next one as soon this one will end.  love it.</li>
            <li> The soap smells heavenly!  The cube shape of the soap is not something that we see often in the USA.  It looks like the soap would be difficult to hold onto when bathing because it is quite chunky.  For the aroma alone, I would purchase the product to place in my lingerie drawer. However, I purchased the soaps with a view to giving them out as stocking stuffers.  The company (not Amazon) sent out the products promptly and they arrived in excellent condition despite the fact that they were packed higgledy piggledy in the carton.  The only disappointment was that the soap arrived crudely wrapped in rough, brown paper that did not do the soap any justice but did not affect the quality of the soap itself.  I would do business with this company again especially when they offer free shipping.</li>
            <li> This soap will be my only soap from now on! I love it! It makes my skin feel really soft and it cleans quite well. It also has this wonderful rose fragrance that doubles as a washroom air freshener. Which saves me money in that department. Handling the square bar can be kinda cumbersome at times but I plan to purchase a sea sponge to use with it. I hope they continue to manufacture this bar for years to come. I&#x27;m glad I came across it. I&#x27;m also glad to know that there are still quality handmade products on the market still nowadays.</li>
            <li> This is to love, feel this deep cleaning and that great after shower smell. Omg this is what showering should be. Fast shipping to hawaii, and they are big soap mine is the lavender. Me personally I cut off just a piece for my everyday use and save the rest. Great soap, will last sometime too. No complaints buy it</li>
            <li> Pretty much just regular bar soap that smells really good.</li>
            <li> This soap is very gentle on the soap; the skin feels moistureized and soft after using it. Its smells great too!</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent! I worked in a rose garden one summer, and the scent of this soap reminds me of the old fashioned roses in that garden... and I didn&#x27;t have to face the thorns or mosquitoes! This soap moisturizes well, doesn&#x27;t aggravate my eczema, and lathers well. I keep it on a wooden soap dish to dry between uses.</li>
            <li> Good rose smell. I prefer the lavender over the rose, but thought I would try something different. Quality is great and all natural.</li>
            <li> Smells so, so beautiful.  I have the rose.  It&#x27;s been lasting forever and I&#x27;ve been using it for months now--the writing is still not worn off, and the square still maintains it&#x27;s stature after washing my hands with this soap multiple times per day.  I have very dry hands and I&#x27;ve found this soap does dry my hands out a little, but not as much as most of the soaps I have used.  The lather on this is also very good.  I adore this.  I will repurchase.  It feels so luxurious to use and it is worth the money for how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another use for this I&#x27;ve found is washing my makeup sponges.  Cleans them great, though does leave kind of a dry sticky feeling to them (like my sponges have been sucked of moisture and glycerine has been added to them somehow), but what I&#x27;ve found is if I rinse afterward with Purity face cleanser by Philosophy, the sponge is replenished with enough moisture to keep it from ripping. (The purity would not be enough to cleanse the sponge--the soap does the cleansing, the purity does the conditioning, and the purity replenishes just enough moisture the sponge needs to be rejuvenated without adding too much and eventually causing your skin to break out from an excess of oil).  After this short, 2 minute process, my sponges are perfect.</li>
            <li> This soap has to be the most unique and unusual bar of soap that I have ever seen. It is sooooo...... pretty. It looks like a HUGE block of marble. When I first used it I thought that I would have a hard time handling it in the shower. However, it lather up very nicely and smells heavenly. Currently, I am having some serious issues with a horrible yeast infection on both legs and one arm so I have to be careful about the products that I use on these areas. Therefore, I can only use this soap on the parts of my skin that are healthy, which I did and this soap provided excellent moisturization. The bar was a little pricey but it probably will last a long time which would make it economically feasible. The soap is made of products that are healthy for your skin and natural. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin so consequently I have to be careful about what soap I use. I used this soap with no problem and love love love the natural rose scent that was used in the making of this soap!  I have wild roses near the house and this soap smells exactly like my flowers</li>
            <li> I could smell this soap even before I opened the package. It filled the kitchen, hallway and the living room with its amazing fragrance after I opened it. This soap is the best quality I have ever seen. It makes your skin feels so good, not only to touch but also the delicate scent it has. I just love it. I only use Savon de Marseille soaps and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed at all. It is worth all the $$$.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  The fragrance scents the whole house.  The bar lasts forever, if it is allowed to dry between uses.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t believe the reviews could be so good on this one but wow is everyone right!  The smell is very strong when you get it but once it is used in the shower it&#x27;s not overwhelming at all.  In fact, it&#x27;s wonderful!  I have never had softer skin and I even use it to wash my face.  No need for facial cleanser&#x27;s anymore, which justifies the cost.  I wish I could find it locally!  Oh well, it&#x27;s a soap I&#x27;m sticking with!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This soap has lovely scent, creamy foam and it moisturize my skin...  Nothing is wrong with this soap! I love to take shower but even more simply because of this soap.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because I have very dry skin. This soap keeps my skin moisture better than other soaps. I also test the PH level, it shows between 7~8; not easy to find other soap like this one. Also, I like the natural smell. it does not smell like the perfume from the laboratory.</li>
            <li> I bought it to use on my face. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t get all my makeup off right away but eventually my face is squeaky clean. The rose scent is amazing. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this rose scented soap! It has the sweetest smell of roses, and as an additional bonus, it doubles as an air freshener, because the whole bathroom has that smell just because the soap is in my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE: I HATE THE ORANGE FLOWER SOAP. It smells like old rubber tires. NOT anything like orange flowers at all! I would return it if I could, but it is a soap, and I used it thinking the smell would improve. IT DID NOT! Now I will throw it away...$15 in the trash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never smelled anything like this soap, except on real roses, up close.  These soaps smell amazing, and made a perfect gift for my bath soap junkie friend.  Arrived intact and well-packaged.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little put off by the big square shape of it but the amazingly intense and natural aroma of the roses won me and my Husband over.  It lasted forever and the lather is silky soft.  It made my skin soft and smooth.  It also makes the bathroom smell wonderful!</li>
            <li> Love these soaps! No more allergic dermatitis :)</li>
            <li> Great gift or for yourself, very well made, lasts pretty long as well, I may buy more as gifts. The scent is not too strong or weak,  just right.</li>
