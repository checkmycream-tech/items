            <li>It heats up in seconds too which is nice.</li>
            <li>It curled my hair beautifully and quickly.</li>
            <li>It also heats up super quick which is also a great plus!</li>
            <li>By far, one of the best beauty investments I have ever made!</li>
            <li>I read great reviews about this wand and it was totally worth every dollar.</li>
            <li>I am the kind of person that buys the latest gadget and uses it once.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many wands and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>It is so easy and makes nice curls.</li>
            <li>I love love love this wand.  </li>
            <li>The top of it (where the temperature setting is located) is literally lifting from the bottom.</li>
            <li>I recently got a chemical straightener on my hair and was told that this is the best tool for curling hair.</li>
            <li>I love this iron.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it..</li>
            <li>Plus I got it so cheap!</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>and I can confidently say that this is my favorite hair styling tool.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this product is lovely, but I have to return it as the serial number/warranty decal has been scratched off.</li>
            <li>If the product is not purchased from an authorized dealer, T3 Micro cannot and will not guarantee that the product is authentic or warrant the product against defects, inadequate build quality and/or improper performance.</li>
            <li>T3 Micro may not be able to verify the authenticity of these products and cannot provide any warranty on the products sold by unauthorized dealers.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, I have managed to achieve success!</li>
            <li>LOVED this wand when I first got it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re willing to invest in a pricey styling tool, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>My daily routine for fixing my hair involves brushing it (on a good day)!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy and looks as if I walked out of a salon!</li>
            <li>This wand is so easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>For the first time my curls look amazing, beachy curls never been easier.</li>
            <li>For people with thicker hair with some body, this product would probably be just fine.</li>
            <li>It would light up when I plugged it in, but it about 2 out of 3 times it wouldn&#x27;t heat.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, it&#x27;s light....</li>
            <li>I use this to straighten and smooth my hair believe it or not.  </li>
            <li>It did take me a few times to perfect my technique..</li>
            <li>This was amazing for about 6 months, absolute perfection.</li>
            <li>and she woke up the next morning with a great looking wave in her hair.  </li>
            <li>But the glove itself is cheaply made and I keep snagging the material on my comb.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>No need for any special products</li>
            <li>six weeks - seller did not issue a full refund.  </li>
            <li>On my stick straight, somewhat over processed hair , this wand does fantastic things!  </li>
            <li>love this thing so much I gave them as gifts</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty easy</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly</li>
            <li>My iron worked great for a year and a half</li>
            <li>I suggest you watch the YouTube video to learn how to make your experience with this wand fast and easy.</li>
            <li>Very versatile and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I have fine color treated stick straight hair that would never ever hold a curl.  </li>
            <li>This wand is amazing for large loopy curls which last for days!  </li>
            <li>I used to use a flat iron to curl my hair, because my hair straightens very easily and the curls will come out within an hour with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>My hair goes from a frizzy mess to wavy silky gorgeous hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to achieve all different degrees of curls as well.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- higher probability of burning yourself, even using the glove</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this specific seller is selling counterfeit or damaged products, but I would expect Amazon to run better verification on sellers and their products.</li>
            <li>Will undoubtedly give higher reviews when I get used to using a wand with no clip.  </li>
            <li>If you are on the fence about it, don&#x27;t be, buy it, it is well worth the price and much cheaper on Amazon then on their site.</li>
            <li>It was my first time using this style.</li>
            <li>It creates really pretty waves.</li>
            <li>I bought this product and the top of the curler has already melted and the digital plate collects water condensation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a shame because for the price, you would think it would be a better quality.</li>
            <li>So now I basically will have spent more than full price for this thing.  </li>
            <li>It curls great but the curls do not last long.</li>
            <li>Works great on my thick hair.  </li>
            <li>thanks!  .</li>
            <li>This is exactly what my daughter wanted</li>
            <li>recently varied up my hairstyle and added some ombre highlights, which look much better on women who have beachy waves, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>High heat allows for quick curling/ease in styling.  </li>
            <li>I have long, layered hair and a lot of it, but it&#x27;s very fine and has does not hold a curl.  </li>
            <li>The SinglePass Whirl T3 is so much easier to use than any curling iron, and it&#x27;s twice as fast!</li>
            <li>Makes really nice natural curls, tight curls or soft waves quickly easily.</li>
            <li>Amazing for tight curly hair</li>
            <li>The glove is an absolute must.</li>
            <li>time, however, I really have to warn anyone considering this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would not be out that much money.  </li>
            <li>I really did.</li>
            <li>I then contacted Amazon and they didn&#x27;t really seem to care and have done nothing to resolve this matter.  </li>
            <li>I can see where people love it, but if you are inexperienced at curling hair, I don&#x27;t think you are going to like it.</li>
            <li>Much easier in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a putz with curling my hair, which frankly is why i didn&#x27;t do it very often.</li>
            <li>I use this on my daughters straight, medium thickness blond hair.  </li>
            <li>I also used a friends conair wand in her hair and it held very well.</li>
            <li>Also use a thermal protection product on your hair as this iron gets very hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It heats super fast, curls soft pretty waves and makes my hair look wavy and natural.</li>
            <li>Curling my hair is SO easy, trust me this is coming from someone who is super low maintenance and anything that takes over 5-10 minutes happens only on holidays.</li>
            <li>Due to the popularity of our products, unauthorized dealers have sold and continue to sell, products which they contend are authentic T3 Micro Products.</li>
            <li>It took a little getting used to at first, and I am still perfecting my technique and trying to do a better job with curling the back of my hair, but I think that&#x27;s more of an issue with me than the actual curler itself.</li>
            <li>Just letting you know that even if you pay full price (I did at $130) and go to Sephora or a salon, you&#x27;ll still end up with the same problems.</li>
            <li>I adore this wand, so much so that when mine just broke, I am going through the hassle of getting a new one through the t3 company replacement program.  </li>
            <li>My hair actually looks better as the day/night goes on - even the next morning</li>
            <li>I have never had such amazing results with any other product.</li>
            <li>The only downside is how hot i gets, if you do not wear the glove it will certainly burn you.</li>
            <li>I contacted t3 and after reading all the bar codes they confirmed that this product was not real.</li>
            <li>so I exchanged it for a new one.</li>
            <li>Just be careful, gets very very hot.  </li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m lucky compared to other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>Steer clear</li>
            <li>I ended up buying it from Sephora - which did cost more but at least now I am covered if something does happen, even a year from now...</li>
            <li>I may see if I can order another one (or just bust out a set of old winter gloves...come to think of it</li>
            <li>I have straight hair past the shoulders and this iron makes curls really quickly, 5-10 minutes max.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find this product on Amazon for less than half of what it retails for at Sephora and Nordstrom.</li>
            <li>Had I purchased through an authorized vendor like Sephora, it would only cost me $10 shipping fee to get a new one!  </li>
            <li>The results that I got from the product were wonderful, but I am really disappointed with the quality ESPECIALLY considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron and I have been using it on a daily basis for the past 8 months.  </li>
            <li>no regrets!!</li>
            <li>This curling iron works as expected to make pretty beachy curls/waves.  </li>
            <li>A few minutes later I was able to turn it on and has been working properly ever since.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has thin straight hair and would probably be better off using a smaller barrel to make tighter curls.  </li>
            <li>This wand is easy to use (takes me about 10 minutes to curl all of my hair) and the curls last until I wash it again, usually about three days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read several reviews on here stating people received curling wands that stopped heating up, and wished they&#x27;d bought theirs from an authorized retailer so they could get the problem fixed by T3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although naturally wavy, my hair does not hold curl well with a basic curling iron and this tool changes that!</li>
            <li>Once the entire head is done, I let it set for a few minutes, and then flip my head over and give my hair a quick tousle with my fingers.  </li>
            <li>I have medium length, baby-fine hair that I usually wear straight, because on those rare occasions when I actually manage to operate a curling iron properly, the curls don&#x27;t last and fall apart before I even finish styling one side of my head.</li>
            <li>I bought my first one a few years ago and after awhile I noticed that something happened with the wire.</li>
            <li>I bought an expensive flat iron because a stylist told me that it could also create nice curls.</li>
            <li>It worked like a dream for a few weeks - I could curl my stick straight hair in about 10 minutes (other curling irons take me 20-30) and really held the curl all</li>
    </ol>

            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- higher probability of burning yourself, even using the glove</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this specific seller is selling counterfeit or damaged products, but I would expect Amazon to run better verification on sellers and their products.</li>
            <li> Will undoubtedly give higher reviews when I get used to using a wand with no clip.  </li>
            <li> If you are on the fence about it, don&#x27;t be, buy it, it is well worth the price and much cheaper on Amazon then on their site.</li>
            <li> It was my first time using this style.</li>
            <li> It creates really pretty waves.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and the top of the curler has already melted and the digital plate collects water condensation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a shame because for the price, you would think it would be a better quality.</li>
            <li> So now I basically will have spent more than full price for this thing.  </li>
            <li> It curls great but the curls do not last long.</li>
            <li> Works great on my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> thanks!  .</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my daughter wanted</li>
            <li> recently varied up my hairstyle and added some ombre highlights, which look much better on women who have beachy waves, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> High heat allows for quick curling/ease in styling.  </li>
            <li> I have long, layered hair and a lot of it, but it&#x27;s very fine and has does not hold a curl.  </li>
            <li> The SinglePass Whirl T3 is so much easier to use than any curling iron, and it&#x27;s twice as fast!</li>
            <li> Makes really nice natural curls, tight curls or soft waves quickly easily.</li>
            <li> Amazing for tight curly hair</li>
            <li> The glove is an absolute must.</li>
            <li> time, however, I really have to warn anyone considering this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would not be out that much money.  </li>
            <li> I really did.</li>
            <li> I then contacted Amazon and they didn&#x27;t really seem to care and have done nothing to resolve this matter.  </li>
            <li> I can see where people love it, but if you are inexperienced at curling hair, I don&#x27;t think you are going to like it.</li>
            <li> Much easier in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a putz with curling my hair, which frankly is why i didn&#x27;t do it very often.</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughters straight, medium thickness blond hair.  </li>
            <li> I also used a friends conair wand in her hair and it held very well.</li>
            <li> Also use a thermal protection product on your hair as this iron gets very hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It heats super fast, curls soft pretty waves and makes my hair look wavy and natural.</li>
            <li> Curling my hair is SO easy, trust me this is coming from someone who is super low maintenance and anything that takes over 5-10 minutes happens only on holidays.</li>
            <li> Due to the popularity of our products, unauthorized dealers have sold and continue to sell, products which they contend are authentic T3 Micro Products.</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to at first, and I am still perfecting my technique and trying to do a better job with curling the back of my hair, but I think that&#x27;s more of an issue with me than the actual curler itself.</li>
            <li> Just letting you know that even if you pay full price (I did at $130) and go to Sephora or a salon, you&#x27;ll still end up with the same problems.</li>
            <li> I adore this wand, so much so that when mine just broke, I am going through the hassle of getting a new one through the t3 company replacement program.  </li>
            <li> My hair actually looks better as the day/night goes on - even the next morning</li>
            <li> I have never had such amazing results with any other product.</li>
            <li> The only downside is how hot i gets, if you do not wear the glove it will certainly burn you.</li>
            <li> I contacted t3 and after reading all the bar codes they confirmed that this product was not real.</li>
            <li> so I exchanged it for a new one.</li>
            <li> Just be careful, gets very very hot.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m lucky compared to other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> Steer clear</li>
            <li> I ended up buying it from Sephora - which did cost more but at least now I am covered if something does happen, even a year from now...</li>
            <li> I may see if I can order another one (or just bust out a set of old winter gloves...come to think of it</li>
            <li> I have straight hair past the shoulders and this iron makes curls really quickly, 5-10 minutes max.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find this product on Amazon for less than half of what it retails for at Sephora and Nordstrom.</li>
            <li> Had I purchased through an authorized vendor like Sephora, it would only cost me $10 shipping fee to get a new one!  </li>
            <li> The results that I got from the product were wonderful, but I am really disappointed with the quality ESPECIALLY considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron and I have been using it on a daily basis for the past 8 months.  </li>
            <li> no regrets!!</li>
            <li> This curling iron works as expected to make pretty beachy curls/waves.  </li>
            <li> A few minutes later I was able to turn it on and has been working properly ever since.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has thin straight hair and would probably be better off using a smaller barrel to make tighter curls.  </li>
            <li> This wand is easy to use (takes me about 10 minutes to curl all of my hair) and the curls last until I wash it again, usually about three days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read several reviews on here stating people received curling wands that stopped heating up, and wished they&#x27;d bought theirs from an authorized retailer so they could get the problem fixed by T3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although naturally wavy, my hair does not hold curl well with a basic curling iron and this tool changes that!</li>
            <li> Once the entire head is done, I let it set for a few minutes, and then flip my head over and give my hair a quick tousle with my fingers.  </li>
            <li> I have medium length, baby-fine hair that I usually wear straight, because on those rare occasions when I actually manage to operate a curling iron properly, the curls don&#x27;t last and fall apart before I even finish styling one side of my head.</li>
            <li> I bought my first one a few years ago and after awhile I noticed that something happened with the wire.</li>
            <li> I bought an expensive flat iron because a stylist told me that it could also create nice curls.</li>
            <li> It worked like a dream for a few weeks - I could curl my stick straight hair in about 10 minutes (other curling irons take me 20-30) and really held the curl all</li>
            <li> Perhaps two years is outside a warranty anyway, but as long as you take care of it, I still think a curling iron should last for several years.</li>
            <li> I literally have 20 different styling wands and flat irons that sit collecting dust in my bathroom</li>
            <li> I consider this a higher end curling iron (at least based on the cost).</li>
            <li> First off, I have to say that I never before have taken the time to write a negative review.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still a good chunk of money that I have now thrown away. :(</li>
            <li> Her curls don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> Its well made , will last a long long time..</li>
            <li> I curl my hair all the time now, even on casual days, just because it&#x27;s so easy</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I think it is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of $50 + shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty horrible at that kind of stuff</li>
            <li> I ordered an extra glove so I wouldn&#x27;t have to switch the glove to my other hand as I moved around my head.</li>
            <li> So I got on line and odered this one because its price was in the middle of the other two.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the iron for a week and already the glove is a tattered mess.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle for someone like me whose hair is usually flat and limp 10 minutes after styling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to return it or something, but I have other irons</li>
            <li> I have extremely frizzy, kinky hair</li>
            <li> I still have waves by the end of the day, which is unheard of with any other styling iron.</li>
            <li> usually curl my hair with a flat iron</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> week (less thank two months after purchasing), the curler broke.</li>
            <li> This is like half off the price of what stuck up Sephora sells this for..</li>
            <li> and I got it from the merchant for $50 less than they are selling it at Sephora&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- high heat for difficult to curl hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a loyal Amazon customer but am extremely disappointed and will seriously consider ever purchasing another product from them again - especially one that has any risk of breaking under warranty.</li>
            <li> I will not be using this product in fear it will burn my house down!</li>
            <li> Instant Victoria&#x27;s Secret Angel quality waves.  </li>
            <li> the one i bought from Amazon (sold by IShopHappy) was a counterfeit according to the people at T3; I contacted them after it just stopped heating up one day after just a few months of use.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even waste your money.</li>
            <li> and I literally just hold the want for a few seconds</li>
            <li> would normally chalk this up to bad luck, but now that I&#x27;m reading the other negative reviews on here, I&#x27;m seeing that I&#x27;m not alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I contacted the manufacturer and they told me IShopHappy is NOT an authorized retailer so they are not able to replace this product.  </li>
            <li> I curled it this past weekend for a dance recital and the alot of the curls had fallen out before the recital had begun.</li>
            <li> and now my entire family is obsessed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never needed to turn the heat up past the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> I found it awkward to separate my hair into sections while wearing the glove but learned that burning my hand was a far worse experience.  </li>
            <li> Also, when I read negative reviews, I tend to ignore them if the majority of the reviews are positive.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> biggest complaint is the protective glove that comes with the iron.</li>
            <li> - I just wash my hair (with Wen cleansing conditioner - I haven&#x27;t used shampoo in 10 years), blow dry, and haphazardly wrap sections of hair around the wand.  </li>
            <li> Further to this please be informed that we will take care of the item if in case it has any problems in the mere future.&amp;#34; Yes, mere future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Annoyed, but</li>
            <li> After a few months, the base of the curling iron started to pull apart.</li>
            <li> They are selling products with fake serial numbers.  </li>
            <li> I ended up using the flat-iron like 3 times for curling my hair as it was just to difficult.</li>
            <li> I bought this iron to add wavy and volume to my hair, but It failed.</li>
            <li> NONE ever gave me even mediocre results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stays completely cold.</li>
            <li> Lame!</li>
            <li> I am really bad at styling my hair.</li>
            <li> We are talking REALLY bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m equally disappointed with the response from Amazon Customer Service.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed Amazon would allow products that have been tampered with or may be counterfeit to be sold through their site.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> (And I don&#x27;t have to use an insane amount of hairspray, either.)</li>

            <li> It took a bit of practice to get used to this style of curling iron. You need to manually wrap your hair around the barrel and hold it with your fingers until the curl has set. The glove is an absolute must. I found it awkward to separate my hair into sections while wearing the glove but learned that burning my hand was a far worse experience.  I gave this product two stars because after six weeks it quit heating regularly. It would light up when I plugged it in, but it about 2 out of 3 times it wouldn&#x27;t heat. I returned the product, but was charged a $11 restocking fee despite it being a defective item. I consider this a higher end curling iron (at least based on the cost). I have cheaper Revlon curling irons that have lasted me 5 years or longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- creates nice spiral curls&lt;br /&gt;- high heat for difficult to curl hair&lt;br /&gt;- sleek looking product&lt;br /&gt;- comes with insulated glove (a must)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- takes practice to master using if you&#x27;re used to traditional curling irons with a clamp mechanism to hold hair&lt;br /&gt;- higher probability of burning yourself, even using the glove&lt;br /&gt;- Two to three times the cost of a traditional curling iron&lt;br /&gt;- **Defective product - quit heating regularly after six weeks - seller did not issue a full refund.  I would not buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> DO NOT purchase this product unless from an authorized seller. I was thrilled to find this product on Amazon for less than half of what it retails for at Sephora and Nordstrom. It worked like a dream for a few weeks - I could curl my stick straight hair in about 10 minutes (other curling irons take me 20-30) and really held the curl all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week (less thank two months after purchasing), the curler broke. It will not heat up at all. I&#x27;ve had $20 irons that lasted for two years and this one didn&#x27;t even make it two months. T3 will not honor the warranty and replace or repair the product because Amazon is not an authorized seller. I don&#x27;t know if this specific seller is selling counterfeit or damaged products, but I would expect Amazon to run better verification on sellers and their products. I&#x27;m a loyal Amazon customer but am extremely disappointed and will seriously consider ever purchasing another product from them again - especially one that has any risk of breaking under warranty. Complete waste of $50 + shipping.</li>
            <li> My daily routine for fixing my hair involves brushing it (on a good day)!  I used to use a flat iron to curl my hair, because my hair straightens very easily and the curls will come out within an hour with a curling iron.  I love this curling wand!  So easy to use, even for the laziest person, and the curls stay, even overnight, and still look good in the morning!  Comes with a heat glove too.  Can even get on YouTube to watch T3&#x27;s styling videos for ideas!  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> First off, I have to say that I never before have taken the time to write a negative review. Also, when I read negative reviews, I tend to ignore them if the majority of the reviews are positive.&lt;br /&gt;This time, however, I really have to warn anyone considering this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVED this wand when I first got it. It heats up quickly, it&#x27;s light....tons of compliments on my hair. And you can&#x27;t beat the price!&lt;br /&gt;Five months later, it will not heat up....at all. I turn it on, the digital screen lights up, it starts blinking and that&#x27;s it. It just never heats up. It stays completely cold. I&#x27;ve tried different outlets, I&#x27;ve checked the cord, nothing helps. I have taken very good care of this wand and it just decided to stop working.&lt;br /&gt;I would normally chalk this up to bad luck, but now that I&#x27;m reading the other negative reviews on here, I&#x27;m seeing that I&#x27;m not alone.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s a good price...but it&#x27;s still a good chunk of money that I have now thrown away. :(</li>
            <li> Works SO well!! High heat allows for quick curling/ease in styling.  I bought one for travel since we travel and one that I keep on my vanity at home.</li>
            <li> For the first time my curls look amazing, beachy curls never been easier. I suggest you watch the YouTube video to learn how to make your experience with this wand fast and easy.</li>
            <li> I have long, layered hair and a lot of it, but it&#x27;s very fine and has does not hold a curl.  This wand saves me!  No need for any special products - I just wash my hair (with Wen cleansing conditioner - I haven&#x27;t used shampoo in 10 years), blow dry, and haphazardly wrap sections of hair around the wand.  Once the entire head is done, I let it set for a few minutes, and then flip my head over and give my hair a quick tousle with my fingers.  Voila!  Instant Victoria&#x27;s Secret Angel quality waves.  My hair actually looks better as the day/night goes on - even the next morning I wake up with some left over volume and bed headed sexiness.  By far, one of the best beauty investments I have ever made!</li>
            <li> Terrible product. Within months it stopped heating. I&#x27;ve been meaning to return it or something, but I have other irons so it for away from me. Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> curler is excellent but do not buy from here unless the seller is an authorized T3 dealer...  the one i bought from Amazon (sold by IShopHappy) was a counterfeit according to the people at T3; I contacted them after it just stopped heating up one day after just a few months of use.  they said iShopHappy was not an authorized T3 dealer so the warranty wasn&#x27;t valid.  I ended up buying it from Sephora - which did cost more but at least now I am covered if something does happen, even a year from now...</li>
            <li> This wand is amazing for large loopy curls which last for days!  Yes, I said days.  On my stick straight, somewhat over processed hair , this wand does fantastic things!  Must use that heat protective glove!  Will undoubtedly give higher reviews when I get used to using a wand with no clip.  It is quite an adjustment!</li>
            <li> I love love love this wand.  My friend had one and tried it out on my hair and I knew I had to buy one.  This wand is so easy to use and you will get the best curls ever!  If you are on the fence about it, don&#x27;t be, buy it, it is well worth the price and much cheaper on Amazon then on their site.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read several reviews on here stating people received curling wands that stopped heating up, and wished they&#x27;d bought theirs from an authorized retailer so they could get the problem fixed by T3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my wand from a salon that was an authorized seller of T3 products and the same thing happened to mine after a couple months. It was still covered under the in-store warranty so I exchanged it for a new one. A couple weeks later, the same thing happened again - the wand would turn on but wouldn&#x27;t heat up whatsoever! The results that I got from the product were wonderful, but I am really disappointed with the quality ESPECIALLY considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately it is a problem with the design of the heating element in the device. Just letting you know that even if you pay full price (I did at $130) and go to Sephora or a salon, you&#x27;ll still end up with the same problems.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron and I have been using it on a daily basis for the past 8 months.  I read the reviews and the warning that this was not under warranty but decided to take the risk since if it broke I would not be out that much money.  This curling iron works as expected to make pretty beachy curls/waves.  I only had one scare after a took it traveling, the iron would not turn on.  A few minutes later I was able to turn it on and has been working properly ever since.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This tool has been a lifesaver when it comes to doing my hair. It&#x27;s quick, easy and looks as if I walked out of a salon! Love it!</li>
            <li> A piece of junk! Company also would not honor the warranty!  Steer clear</li>
            <li> This curling iron does a great job. It was my first time using this style. It creates really pretty waves. The price is great too.</li>
            <li> Although naturally wavy, my hair does not hold curl well with a basic curling iron and this tool changes that! The only downside is how hot i gets, if you do not wear the glove it will certainly burn you. I recommend ordering two gloves, one for each hand so that you don&#x27;t have to switch over as you move the wand around your head. LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> I bought this product and the top of the curler has already melted and the digital plate collects water condensation. I will not be using this product in fear it will burn my house down! I contacted t3 and after reading all the bar codes they confirmed that this product was not real. For the price I figured it wasn&#x27;t let&#x27;s be honest. But I wouldn&#x27;t risk my safety using it. Don&#x27;t even waste your money. Save up and go to Sephora for piece I mind.</li>
            <li> Luv it! Works fir all types of hair. Very versatile and easy to use.  U recommend for stylists and non stylists. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I LOVED this product. I really did. It curled my hair beautifully and quickly. I bought my first one a few years ago and after awhile I noticed that something happened with the wire. I chalked it up to overuse and blamed myself for it and ordered a second one. After a few months, the base of the curling iron started to pull apart. The top of it (where the temperature setting is located) is literally lifting from the bottom. I haven&#x27;t done anything that would cause this to happen. Unfortunately I think it is cheaply made. It&#x27;s such a shame because for the price, you would think it would be a better quality.</li>
            <li> Worked great for almost two years, so I guess I&#x27;m lucky compared to other reviewers.  But last week it stopped heating up.  Still turns on, but no heat.  I purchased from iShopHappy, which I now I read is not an authorized seller.  Perhaps two years is outside a warranty anyway, but as long as you take care of it, I still think a curling iron should last for several years.</li>
            <li> I adore this wand, so much so that when mine just broke, I am going through the hassle of getting a new one through the t3 company replacement program.  My iron worked great for a year and a half and then all the sudden just stopped heating.  Out of the blue!  I didn&#x27;t drop it or anything. I see this has happened to others, which is a bummer.  Buyers of this curling iron on amazon should beware that purchasing through amazon of this item voids warranty.  Because of that T3 will only replace mine for me for $75 and that will then be warrantied for 2 years. Had I purchased through an authorized vendor like Sephora, it would only cost me $10 shipping fee to get a new one!  So now I basically will have spent more than full price for this thing.  Annoyed, but like I said when it works, it is great. It heats super fast, curls soft pretty waves and makes my hair look wavy and natural.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product 9 months ago and have only used it about 20 times.  It has stopped heating up.  I contacted the manufacturer and they told me IShopHappy is NOT an authorized retailer so they are not able to replace this product.  They are selling products with fake serial numbers.  I then contacted Amazon and they didn&#x27;t really seem to care and have done nothing to resolve this matter.  Lesson learned, you get what you pay for and DO NOT SHOP WITH AMAZON!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> If you are semi-new to the hair curling world, this is going to take a LOT of practice. I recently got a chemical straightener on my hair and was told that this is the best tool for curling hair. I can see where people love it, but if you are inexperienced at curling hair, I don&#x27;t think you are going to like it. I&#x27;ll stick to the curling irons with clamps. Much easier in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I use this to straighten and smooth my hair believe it or not.  I have extremely frizzy, kinky hair and this thing is a GODSEND.  It smoothes my hair like nothing else.  I love this iron.  The best purchase I ever made.  My hair goes from a frizzy mess to wavy silky gorgeous hair. I have never had such amazing results with any other product.</li>
            <li> This is like half off the price of what stuck up Sephora sells this for..It curls beautifully..After I use this on my hair it looks like one of the best hair models your ever seen.. I absolutely love it..It did take me a few times to perfect my technique.. Its well made , will last a long long time..I would buy again..</li>
            <li> I bought an expensive flat iron because a stylist told me that it could also create nice curls. And it does... if you&#x27;re not style- challenged like me. I ended up using the flat-iron like 3 times for curling my hair as it was just to difficult. Enters the T3 Singlepass Whirl. It is so easy and makes nice curls. It comes with a heat-proof glove which is a must because you will burn yourself. Just follow the instructions on how to position the wand and you will do alright. I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a putz with curling my hair, which frankly is why i didn&#x27;t do it very often. I read great reviews about this wand and it was totally worth every dollar. Curling my hair is SO easy, trust me this is coming from someone who is super low maintenance and anything that takes over 5-10 minutes happens only on holidays. I curl my hair all the time now, even on casual days, just because it&#x27;s so easy and it looks great! It&#x27;s super easy to achieve all different degrees of curls as well. It also heats up super quick which is also a great plus!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I ordered an extra glove so I wouldn&#x27;t have to switch the glove to my other hand as I moved around my head. I am so happy I bought this!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this! I have tried so many wands and this one is by far the best. Heats up quickly and I literally just hold the want for a few seconds and I have perfect curls. Plus I got it so cheap! $55.00!</li>
            <li> Not working after a month</li>
            <li> This was amazing for about 6 months, absolute perfection. And then, for no reason at all (not misuse, not dropping it, nothing), it dies. Of course there&#x27;s no warranty and of course I can&#x27;t return. Lame!</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughters straight, medium thickness blond hair.  We had borrowed a friends Liv wand and it worked great on my daughters hair.  It held a curl through softbal practice, dance pictures and she woke up the next morning with a great looking wave in her hair.  I also used a friends conair wand in her hair and it held very well. So I got on line and odered this one because its price was in the middle of the other two.  I figured it would do as well as they had done.  It curls great but the curls do not last long. I curled it this past weekend for a dance recital and the alot of the curls had fallen out before the recital had begun.</li>
            <li> I have a shoulder length hair.  I bought this iron to add wavy and volume to my hair, but It failed.</li>
            <li> Works great on my thick hair.  My daughter keep stealing it from me.  Just be careful, gets very very hot.  I scorched my hand.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thin straight hair and would probably be better off using a smaller barrel to make tighter curls.  Her curls don&#x27;t last very long.  Also the on/off button never worked so I have to plug it in and then unplug it when I&#x27;m done.  For people with thicker hair with some body, this product would probably be just fine.</li>
            <li> This product was just what my girl was looking for. Its a great gift. Shes happy, im happy! thanks!  .</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this wand!!! I have the thickest hair ever and I couldn&#x27;t use a curling iron to save my life. This is so easy to use and my curls stay for days!! It heats up in seconds too which is nice. If you are on the fence I say definitely buy this product.. no regrets!!</li>
            <li> usually curl my hair with a flat iron but I decided to try this and I am so glad I did! I have straight hair past the shoulders and this iron makes curls really quickly, 5-10 minutes max. Took me a while to get used to but it&#x27;s pretty easy and I&#x27;m not a hair expert I&#x27;m pretty horrible at that kind of stuff but despite that I managed to make some great curls with this wand.</li>
            <li> Amazing for tight curly hair</li>
            <li> I am the kind of person that buys the latest gadget and uses it once.  I literally have 20 different styling wands and flat irons that sit collecting dust in my bathroom NONE ever gave me even mediocre results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this based on the reviews and I can confidently say that this is my favorite hair styling tool.  I have fine color treated stick straight hair that would never ever hold a curl.  This wand is easy to use (takes me about 10 minutes to curl all of my hair) and the curls last until I wash it again, usually about three days.  This is a miracle for someone like me whose hair is usually flat and limp 10 minutes after styling.  Watch the instructional youtube video.  Also use a thermal protection product on your hair as this iron gets very hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this thing so much I gave them as gifts and now my entire family is obsessed.  If you use it correctly it will give you red carpet hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product is lovely, but I have to return it as the serial number/warranty decal has been scratched off. The product says, on the box, that the warranty is not valid without that decal. I contacted Amazon customer service immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon customer service said &amp;#34;However I&#x27;d like to inform you that your &amp;#34;T3 SinglePass Whirl&amp;#34; still has the warranty. Further to this please be informed that we will take care of the item if in case it has any problems in the mere future.&amp;#34; Yes, mere future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still suspicious, I contacted the manufacturer. Their reply:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Amazon.com is not an authorized dealer. We suggest you return it for a refund immediately. If the product is not purchased from an authorized dealer, T3 Micro cannot and will not guarantee that the product is authentic or warrant the product against defects, inadequate build quality and/or improper performance. Due to the popularity of our products, unauthorized dealers have sold and continue to sell, products which they contend are authentic T3 Micro Products. T3 Micro may not be able to verify the authenticity of these products and cannot provide any warranty on the products sold by unauthorized dealers.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning mine shortly and purchasing it elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed Amazon would allow products that have been tampered with or may be counterfeit to be sold through their site. I&#x27;m equally disappointed with the response from Amazon Customer Service.</li>
            <li> Makes really nice natural curls, tight curls or soft waves quickly easily. I&#x27;ve never needed to turn the heat up past the lowest setting. This is something I use several times a week.</li>
            <li> The SinglePass Whirl T3 is so much easier to use than any curling iron, and it&#x27;s twice as fast! I could not be happier with it!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my daughter wanted and I got it from the merchant for $50 less than they are selling it at Sephora&#x27;s. She loves it and is happy with her girly curls, and I&#x27;m happy to have saved money.</li>
            <li> LOVE it! Beautiful curls!</li>
            <li> I am really bad at styling my hair. We are talking REALLY bad. I have medium length, baby-fine hair that I usually wear straight, because on those rare occasions when I actually manage to operate a curling iron properly, the curls don&#x27;t last and fall apart before I even finish styling one side of my head. Not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently varied up my hairstyle and added some ombre highlights, which look much better on women who have beachy waves, in my opinion. I did a lot of research before I decided to purchase the T3 Singlepass Whirl. It had a lot of great reviews all over the place, and I watched all the online tutorial videos and was pleased with the results. Amazingly, I have managed to achieve success! It took a little getting used to at first, and I am still perfecting my technique and trying to do a better job with curling the back of my hair, but I think that&#x27;s more of an issue with me than the actual curler itself. I&#x27;m amazed with how well the curls holds up. I still have waves by the end of the day, which is unheard of with any other styling iron. (And I don&#x27;t have to use an insane amount of hairspray, either.) It&#x27;s been about a week and I am still practicing and improving, but I am going to stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is the protective glove that comes with the iron. It is ESSENTIAL that you wear the glove, otherwise you will burn your hands (which I somehow have managed to do even with the glove...sigh). But the glove itself is cheaply made and I keep snagging the material on my comb. I&#x27;ve only had the iron for a week and already the glove is a tattered mess. I may see if I can order another one (or just bust out a set of old winter gloves...come to think of it, that would probably be a lot easier than trying to remember to switch the glove to the opposite hand all the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re willing to invest in a pricey styling tool, this is a good choice. I am quite pleased with my purchase.</li>
