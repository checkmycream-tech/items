            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>Again it was great.</li>
            <li>This is a great hair-cutting system but cannot be used as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I was SO happy when my husband bought this.</li>
            <li>Great Machine...saving lots of money by not going to the barber</li>
            <li>and have a good looking hair cut..</li>
            <li>Figure this device is going to save me a good $50 this year alone, even after I deduct the cost of it.</li>
            <li>He sat there for a good 40 minutes trying to even it out</li>
            <li>It worked good.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say it was a good haircut</li>
            <li>You will wind up with a good haircut and save yourself some cash as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cut seems good, but you do end up with hair on your shoulders.</li>
            <li>Good for ain between visits to the barber</li>
            <li>It gives me a good close cut.  </li>
            <li>great for quick maintaining, great for travel...</li>
            <li>Works Fabulous.  Great for a trim up.</li>

            <li>nice item.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Surprisingly effective haircutter.</li>
            <li>I bought this a couple of years ago for my husband at Christmas thinking that it looked good and easy to use</li>
            <li>Lol Very fast express shipping from this company!</li>
            <li>okay value for what it is....</li>
            <li>it is not so great; I don&#x27;t like the 1 piece,  adjustable siiding length attatchment, and the 2-AA battery powered motor don&#x27;t do much justice for the blades....</li>
            <li>Make sure it&#x27;s charged and oiled before every use.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t start most of the Tim</li>
            <li>I figured each hair cut cost me about $16 or more.</li>
            <li>I went with the shortest setting and love the results.</li>
            <li>The circular piece is just ok</li>
            <li>Great and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>he is in love with it and he looks absolutely fabulous when he cuts his own hair with it.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works ok for some kinds of hair</li>
            <li>It is good to eliminate one rumor right up front:  </li>
            <li>Love it so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Works great for me so far.</li>
            <li>A good xmas gift thanks</li>
            <li>/&gt;Three stars for fast shipping, good idea, price....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been his reluctant barber for ages and loved the idea that now he could do this himself whenever he wanted, thanks to BaByliss.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy cut</li>
            <li>just follow the enclosed directions and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>which did a fine job in 1/4</li>
            <li>Extra trimmer is a great addition as it just takes 2 AA and can be used for touch ups.  </li>
            <li>I can cut my hair for Free Now!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this is great for those who have and like short hair.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions precisely-- including the BE</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fortunately, Amazon made the return easy and free, so it was worth trying.</li>
            <li>generally... good for those who wanna just get it cut.</li>
            <li>When I bought this product, I was so eager, so excited, and soooo would never have to buy another haircut again.</li>
            <li>my cons for this product are that it tends to not get the baby hairs and not the easiest to clean.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t require any special tool; all it requires is an electric barber clipper set that you can buy anywhere, including Amazon, for around $20.  </li>
            <li>Right now I look like I just got a buzz cut and that is fine for me.</li>
            <li>About a week later I came home from work to a tirade of abuse from my good wife ,who had found the item &amp; decided to give herself a &amp;#34;bikini line&amp;#34; trim.</li>
            <li>This device is good for very short hair just like the picture of the man on the box</li>
            <li>Quick &amp; Clean Haircut.</li>
            <li>This works good on short men&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Ask me again in 6 months and I&#x27;ll rate it in full.</li>
            <li>And if his head were a smooth, perfectly round basketball, it might have worked great.</li>
            <li>&amp; he is able to do the top &amp; sides by himself but the back he asks me to help!</li>
            <li>We were able to mostly clean it up by shaving everything off with his old clippers on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>my husband just loves it it saves so much money and so easy to use</li>
            <li>any product of this type, a battery with this kind of performance and service life is totally unacceptable.</li>
            <li>but it was far better than I could have otherwise done it.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li>Best for younger men with thick healthy hair.  </li>
            <li>My friends regularly tell me how nice my hair looks after doing so, asking me where I had it done.  </li>
            <li>Using such you can cut your own hair almost blindfolded:  </li>
            <li>My 15 year old son was brave enough to try this product.</li>
            <li>Would make a good cut for a military haircut, plus it seems it travels, well.</li>
            <li>I have cut my own for years using standard electric clippers and the right head attachments.  </li>
            <li>You will get a far better haircut, much more quickly than the BaByliss can possibly provide.  </li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>It comes in handy because his schedule is long &amp; by the time he gets home the haircutting place is close!</li>
            <li>The neg-raters were actually providing very accurate reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The neg-raters were actually providing very accurate reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We get this very fast, but go two.</li>
            <li>it does what it said it would, For those with a buzzed cut of the same length throughout head, quick, easy to use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard to get the hair into the blades without having to use your fingers which I&#x27;m not too happy about.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for an easier way to cut my own hair short.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it can do.</li>
            <li>Just used this for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a pretty picky guy, and he loves this</li>
            <li>Works really well!  </li>
            <li>I oiled the blades up like they suggested before my first use</li>
            <li>It worked OK for the first couple of charges, after which it wouldn&#x27;t hold any charge at all, so using it straight off the mains was the only option.</li>
            <li>SURE TO DO THIS AND USE IT THIS WAY instruction sheet they provide separately from the main instruction booklet (I guess they received a number of complaints and returns and felt they had to add an extra explanation sheet to explain exactly how it works).  </li>
            <li>This minor redeeming feature raises the 2-product combo to two stars rather than one.</li>
            <li>It is very well designed and does exactly what they say it will do.</li>
            <li>As I unboxed the Babyliss Pro BPEC1, I thought to myself &#x27;What a stylish awesome looking hair cutting tool&#x27; and plugged it in the wall to charge bursting with anticipation of the following evening for a haircut that would change my life.</li>
            <li>I rated this high, because it was exactly what I orderd!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really, it was like a joke.</li>
            <li>great concept, poor design.</li>
            <li>In principle the BaByliss concept is sound enough.  </li>
            <li>In principle the BaByliss concept is sound enough.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Which is why there is absolutely no need for the BaByliss \\&quot;easy cut\\</li>
            <li>to accomplish anything close to a decent buzz-cut job.  </li>
            <li>to accomplish anything close to a decent buzz-cut job.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend..</li>
            <li>But yet I held my head high and promised to show and tell the people what this product can do and how it has changed my life.</li>
            <li>Kind of Hard to cut hair</li>
            <li>The product is a great idea, but sadly didn&#x27;t work as described for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In a few weeks you will save more than the purchase price.</li>
            <li>He keeps his hair very short and one length all around, a lot like the guy on the box, so this seemed easy enough.</li>
            <li>But he&#x27;s got a normal, human head and any areas that are recessed were left long and any areas that are more prominent were shaved down to nothing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not talking 3 or 4, but 10, 20, 30 times over the exact same area... and  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not talking 3 or 4, but 10, 20, 30 times over the exact same area... and  </li>
            <li>I let the unit charge a full 16 hours, used a properly short attachment (#2 setting of 4), ran it repeatedly over my scalp again and again and again and again... and still wound up having to finish up the hack job with my standard hair clippers--</li>
            <li>just be a little bit be patient and it will work just fine</li>
            <li>only positive thing about this offering is the battery-operated trimmer included with the package.</li>
            <li>He tried the shaver once and was left with long spots that he couldn&#x27;t trim down no matter how many times he went over them, and most puzzlingly, he was left with one stripe up the back that was shorter than the setting indicated.  </li>
            <li>, why am I reviewing it now, well I&#x27;m having a clear out</li>
            <li>Saves me hair-cuts, controls my dandruff (I am old and turning to dirt already) and eliminates helmet-hair.</li>
            <li>but I really use the electric razor with the attachments that barbershops usually only have.</li>
            <li>works real well for short hair.</li>
            <li>the hole in the cutter far too large&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>the hole in the cutter far too large&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>My hair was all different lengths, uneven, and shot across everywhere on top of my head.</li>
            <li>since it takes much longer than my other clippers, that can do the whole thing.  :</li>
            <li>This runs off conventional AA batteries which last much longer than the (allegedly) rechargeable ones in the rotary clipper, and the trimmer in fact works OK.</li>
            <li>If the cutting hole was about half the size, the motor twice as fast and twice as powerful, this would probably do a good job of providing a non-tapered buzz cut.  </li>
            <li>If the cutting hole was about half the size, the motor twice as fast and twice as powerful, this would probably do a good job of providing a non-tapered buzz cut.  </li>
            <li>This is OK in theory, but not great in practice as you need to go over the area several times from different angles to get anything approaching a smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>#34;clean up&amp;#34; his hair with the electric trimmer we always use, the short stripe in the back was still evident.  </li>
            <li>Then after six months of using it from the mains once every three or four weeks, it packed up completely and wouldn&#x27;t work off the mains either, producing no more than a phut-phut sound of a motor barely receiving any power at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but hey, maybe it&#x27;s just my hair, thick, dense, and grows very quick......</li>
            <li>as the manual suggests, you have to go over an area several times to complete the trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>especially when its use is far from easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>only used it 3 times, could not rate it being so early</li>
            <li>That means having to use a different clipper to complete the job.  </li>
            <li>It proved to be a complete waste of money, my husband tried several times but it always left long hair at the back and regardless of how many times he went over it it remained, I even tried thinking would be easier since I could see what I was doing, but no.</li>
            <li>It is not at all difficult to buzz-cut your own hair.  </li>
            <li>I am hopeful that some day a worthy self short hair cutting tool will be available but the time has not yet come.</li>
            <li>I use the round with the 1 inch for the top of the hair with a back &amp; forth, front to back motion even cut, then I use the trimmer for the sides &amp; back of head to cut the military hair cut for my husband!</li>
            <li>left bare spots.  </li>
            <li>The little trimmer, works very well too.</li>
            <li>The design is smart and because it is round you don&#x27;t have to worry about places that are cut too close or the opposite.  </li>

            <li> my husband just loves it it saves so much money and so easy to use</li>
            <li> any product of this type, a battery with this kind of performance and service life is totally unacceptable.</li>
            <li> but it was far better than I could have otherwise done it.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> Best for younger men with thick healthy hair.  </li>
            <li> My friends regularly tell me how nice my hair looks after doing so, asking me where I had it done.  </li>
            <li> Using such you can cut your own hair almost blindfolded:  </li>
            <li> My 15 year old son was brave enough to try this product.</li>
            <li> Would make a good cut for a military haircut, plus it seems it travels, well.</li>
            <li> I have cut my own for years using standard electric clippers and the right head attachments.  </li>
            <li> You will get a far better haircut, much more quickly than the BaByliss can possibly provide.  </li>
            <li> Price is right.</li>
            <li> It comes in handy because his schedule is long &amp; by the time he gets home the haircutting place is close!</li>
            <li> The neg-raters were actually providing very accurate reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The neg-raters were actually providing very accurate reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We get this very fast, but go two.</li>
            <li> it does what it said it would, For those with a buzzed cut of the same length throughout head, quick, easy to use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to get the hair into the blades without having to use your fingers which I&#x27;m not too happy about.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for an easier way to cut my own hair short.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it can do.</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a pretty picky guy, and he loves this</li>
            <li> Works really well!  </li>
            <li> I oiled the blades up like they suggested before my first use</li>
            <li> It worked OK for the first couple of charges, after which it wouldn&#x27;t hold any charge at all, so using it straight off the mains was the only option.</li>
            <li> SURE TO DO THIS AND USE IT THIS WAY instruction sheet they provide separately from the main instruction booklet (I guess they received a number of complaints and returns and felt they had to add an extra explanation sheet to explain exactly how it works).  </li>
            <li> This minor redeeming feature raises the 2-product combo to two stars rather than one.</li>
            <li> It is very well designed and does exactly what they say it will do.</li>
            <li> As I unboxed the Babyliss Pro BPEC1, I thought to myself &#x27;What a stylish awesome looking hair cutting tool&#x27; and plugged it in the wall to charge bursting with anticipation of the following evening for a haircut that would change my life.</li>
            <li> I rated this high, because it was exactly what I orderd!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really, it was like a joke.</li>
            <li> great concept, poor design.</li>
            <li> In principle the BaByliss concept is sound enough.  </li>
            <li> In principle the BaByliss concept is sound enough.  </li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li> /&gt;Which is why there is absolutely no need for the BaByliss \\&quot;easy cut\\</li>
            <li> to accomplish anything close to a decent buzz-cut job.  </li>
            <li> to accomplish anything close to a decent buzz-cut job.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend..</li>
            <li> But yet I held my head high and promised to show and tell the people what this product can do and how it has changed my life.</li>
            <li> Kind of Hard to cut hair</li>
            <li> The product is a great idea, but sadly didn&#x27;t work as described for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In a few weeks you will save more than the purchase price.</li>
            <li> He keeps his hair very short and one length all around, a lot like the guy on the box, so this seemed easy enough.</li>
            <li> But he&#x27;s got a normal, human head and any areas that are recessed were left long and any areas that are more prominent were shaved down to nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking 3 or 4, but 10, 20, 30 times over the exact same area... and  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking 3 or 4, but 10, 20, 30 times over the exact same area... and  </li>
            <li> I let the unit charge a full 16 hours, used a properly short attachment (#2 setting of 4), ran it repeatedly over my scalp again and again and again and again... and still wound up having to finish up the hack job with my standard hair clippers--</li>
            <li> just be a little bit be patient and it will work just fine</li>
            <li> only positive thing about this offering is the battery-operated trimmer included with the package.</li>
            <li> He tried the shaver once and was left with long spots that he couldn&#x27;t trim down no matter how many times he went over them, and most puzzlingly, he was left with one stripe up the back that was shorter than the setting indicated.  </li>
            <li> , why am I reviewing it now, well I&#x27;m having a clear out</li>
            <li> Saves me hair-cuts, controls my dandruff (I am old and turning to dirt already) and eliminates helmet-hair.</li>
            <li> but I really use the electric razor with the attachments that barbershops usually only have.</li>
            <li> works real well for short hair.</li>
            <li> the hole in the cutter far too large&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> the hole in the cutter far too large&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> My hair was all different lengths, uneven, and shot across everywhere on top of my head.</li>
            <li> since it takes much longer than my other clippers, that can do the whole thing.  :</li>
            <li> This runs off conventional AA batteries which last much longer than the (allegedly) rechargeable ones in the rotary clipper, and the trimmer in fact works OK.</li>
            <li> If the cutting hole was about half the size, the motor twice as fast and twice as powerful, this would probably do a good job of providing a non-tapered buzz cut.  </li>
            <li> If the cutting hole was about half the size, the motor twice as fast and twice as powerful, this would probably do a good job of providing a non-tapered buzz cut.  </li>
            <li> This is OK in theory, but not great in practice as you need to go over the area several times from different angles to get anything approaching a smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> #34;clean up&amp;#34; his hair with the electric trimmer we always use, the short stripe in the back was still evident.  </li>
            <li> Then after six months of using it from the mains once every three or four weeks, it packed up completely and wouldn&#x27;t work off the mains either, producing no more than a phut-phut sound of a motor barely receiving any power at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but hey, maybe it&#x27;s just my hair, thick, dense, and grows very quick......</li>
            <li> as the manual suggests, you have to go over an area several times to complete the trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> especially when its use is far from easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> only used it 3 times, could not rate it being so early</li>
            <li> That means having to use a different clipper to complete the job.  </li>
            <li> It proved to be a complete waste of money, my husband tried several times but it always left long hair at the back and regardless of how many times he went over it it remained, I even tried thinking would be easier since I could see what I was doing, but no.</li>
            <li> It is not at all difficult to buzz-cut your own hair.  </li>
            <li> I am hopeful that some day a worthy self short hair cutting tool will be available but the time has not yet come.</li>
            <li> I use the round with the 1 inch for the top of the hair with a back &amp; forth, front to back motion even cut, then I use the trimmer for the sides &amp; back of head to cut the military hair cut for my husband!</li>
            <li> left bare spots.  </li>
            <li> The little trimmer, works very well too.</li>
            <li> The design is smart and because it is round you don&#x27;t have to worry about places that are cut too close or the opposite.  </li>
            <li> (the instructions warn that it will be uneven at first) but the short spots just kept getting shorter while the long stayed long.</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;combs\\&quot; of the unit are so huge they can&#x27;t possibly pull up the hair as they should, and the blades are far too powerless and slow to do any kind of a decent cutting job.  </li>

            <li> This product may be (barely) capable of daily maintenance on a close shave, but the motor is still very weak and the blades very sub par.</li>
            <li> I use it every 10 days or else my hair gets too long for the Bayliss to cut properly.</li>
            <li> THE INFORNMATUION WAS NOT CLEAR ENOUGH INDICATING THE TYPE OF CUT.</li>
            <li> Then you will be able to continue cutting while plugged in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;does not work well for long hair.</li>
            <li> Not very sharp, definite waste of money.</li>
            <li> The main clipper however, due to its appalling battery, deserves a big zero.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the second you feel it slowing down plug it in.</li>
            <li> It performs a very uneven, slow, ponderous job of semi-cutting and as it cuts it throws hair EVERYWHERE as there is nowhere for the hair to go but back onto your scalp and into the blades again, chopping it up into tiny pieces (wow,</li>

            <li> These clippers have an unusual round design with two different tough plastic comb guides, each with four settings to adjust the blade height.</li>
            <li> Not a very well made product at all.  </li>
            <li> Not quite what I had expected,</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However the major gripe has to be the internal \\&quot;re-chargeable\\&quot; battery, which is next to useless.</li>
            <li> short, BaByliss is not a good choice in personal hair care products.  </li>

            <li> A big waste of money!</li>
            <li> This thing takes at least 3 times as long to trim hair as regular clippers, makes a mess with hair all over the place</li>
            <li> Poor guy ended up with razor burn on the sides and a monk-style long fringe around the sideburns, over the ears and in the back.</li>

            <li> Was tired of frequent buzz cuts, so I purchased this to help reduce my visits to the barber.  </li>
            <li> Then if you want to taper just drop down to a #1 or #0 blade attachment and go around the ears and neckline.  </li>
            <li> would recamend This seller to other consumers also!</li>
            <li> My other boys have said, &amp;#34;no way&amp;#34; they are using this product!</li>

            <li> the comb \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; too large and bulky to pick up hair while cutting...</li>
            <li> The only use I found for this is to start cutting with this thing and then finish it off with the Remington short hair cutter.</li>
            <li> I plan to let it grow out a few weeks</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money this was.</li>
            <li> after a few minutes, he stopped and we looked.</li>
            <li> Does take a few passes through to get all hair cut.</li>
            <li> but it gives a really uneven cut</li>
            <li> Everything done in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I fallowed the directions and still had an uneven cut.  </li>
            <li> Works well, but no fine trim, but the trimmers are with this package as well.  </li>
            <li> the product itself is a waste of your hard earned cash.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions for how to use the tool as they show in the video for the product but it left patches of hair uncut.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it to taper the sides by using the different length cutting device.  </li>
            <li> Then there is no way to see what you are doing until it&#x27;s too late</li>

            <li> the motor is too slow and sluggish (even when plugged in)&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s now useless, and has to be abandoned and replaced.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the Babybliss has been resigned to the trash.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve never noticed that there&#x27;s anything wrong with it</li>
            <li> This thing does a poor job of evenly cutting the hair though.</li>
            <li> but it was almost useless with mine.</li>
            <li> Works well - but it does take some confidence to use!&lt;br /&gt;Essentially you are cutting blind - but the design provides a uniform cut - though,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Truthfully the BayByliss is a very poor hair cutting system.  </li>
            <li> I judged them wrongly; this is plainly a bad product that does not work.  </li>
            <li> I judged them wrongly; this is plainly a bad product that does not work.  </li>
            <li> I was cutting and cutting and cutting for what seemed like forever (30 min or so).</li>
            <li> just \\&quot;feel\\&quot; where the shaver goes and keep cutting until you hear it no longer cutting.  </li>
            <li> When you can no longer hear it cutting, the haircut is done.  </li>
            <li> go buy the cheapest Wahl hair cutting kit you can find, and for a close buzz cut use the #2 (purple) blade attachment, and just run it over your head.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a buzz cutting system... which is what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> It was so bad that we were dying laughing.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say it was bad either.</li>

            <li> Will update review as time goes, but don&#x27;t see anything bad at this time, to say about it.</li>
            <li> terrible product...cuts poorly.</li>
            <li> Then my fiancee walked into the room and gasped followed by hysterical laughter.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> generally... good for those who wanna just get it cut. it does what it said it would, For those with a buzzed cut of the same length throughout head, quick, easy to use. great for quick maintaining, great for travel... okay value for what it is....my cons for this product are that it tends to not get the baby hairs and not the easiest to clean. even when fully charged, it still works beter plugged in. the lube supply is tiny, and the cordless trimmer that comes with it is not so great; I don&#x27;t like the 1 piece,  adjustable siiding length attatchment, and the 2-AA battery powered motor don&#x27;t do much justice for the blades.... but hey, maybe it&#x27;s just my hair, thick, dense, and grows very quick......</li>
            <li> These clippers have an unusual round design with two different tough plastic comb guides, each with four settings to adjust the blade height.

It&#x27;s now useless, and has to be abandoned and replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only positive thing about this offering is the battery-operated trimmer included with the package. This runs off conventional AA batteries which last much longer than the (allegedly) rechargeable ones in the rotary clipper, and the trimmer in fact works OK. This minor redeeming feature raises the 2-product combo to two stars rather than one. The main clipper however, due to its appalling battery, deserves a big zero.</li>
            <li> terrible product...cuts poorly.</li>
            <li> Saves me hair-cuts, controls my dandruff (I am old and turning to dirt already) and eliminates helmet-hair.</li>
            <li> A good xmas gift thanks</li>
            <li> Works great for me so far. Price is right. Nice looking Buzz Cut. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> my husband just loves it it saves so much money and so easy to use</li>
            <li> nice clippers used it all the time...</li>
            <li> The lowest setting does not cut short enough.  I am going to buy another remington hair shaver like i had before.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend..In a few weeks you will save more than the purchase price. and have a good looking hair cut..</li>
            <li> Great. It does exactly what it says it can do. Make sure it&#x27;s charged and oiled before every use. If the batter drains all the way from using it, it will not work properly plugged in. You would just have to wait until it charges again. I would recommend the second you feel it slowing down plug it in. Then you will be able to continue cutting while plugged in. Extra trimmer is a great addition as it just takes 2 AA and can be used for touch ups.  Again it was great.</li>
            <li> I rated this high, because it was exactly what I orderd!&lt;br /&gt;It is a Great product! I can cut my hair for Free Now!&lt;br /&gt;I would recamend This seller to other consumers also!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair-cutting system but cannot be used as I had hoped. I wanted to use it to taper the sides by using the different length cutting device.  That did not work well.  I gave it to my son-in-law who keeps a very short haircut.  He loves it. The cutter does a very specific length all over.  It can be adjusted and used to shorten the sides.  The shears do the rest.  If I kept my hair short all over, I would have kept it.  It is very well designed and does exactly what they say it will do.</li>
            <li> Not a very well made product at all.  Didnt cut hair very good or even.</li>
            <li> I needed this for a family member who is I bedridden.  We used to use a flowbee  to cut his hair but  it&#x27;s broke so thought I would try this.  Even with short hair it&#x27;s hard to get the hair into the blades without having to use your fingers which I&#x27;m not too happy about.  Then there is no way to see what you are doing until it&#x27;s too late and you&#x27;ve scalped them.  Also, the hair gets balled up in the middle of the cutter and your constantly stopping to take it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer that comes with it is a problem too.  It doesn&#x27;t start most of the Tim and I have to bang it over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I didn&#x27;t throw the box out ... I would have returned it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three stars for fast shipping, good idea, price.... Other than that it&#x27;s a bust.</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time this morning. My barber now charges about $12 and then the tip plus gas I figured each hair cut cost me about $16 or more. I went with the shortest setting and love the results. I plan to let it grow out a few weeks then try the next setting up and see. Like others have said...this is great for those who have and like short hair. Right now I look like I just got a buzz cut and that is fine for me. Figure this device is going to save me a good $50 this year alone, even after I deduct the cost of it.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday. The circular piece is just ok but I really use the electric razor with the attachments that barbershops usually only have. Haven&#x27;t paid for a haircut in months!</li>
            <li> Works well - but it does take some confidence to use!&lt;br /&gt;Essentially you are cutting blind - but the design provides a uniform cut - though, as the manual suggests, you have to go over an area several times to complete the trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only gripe was having to wait the 16 hours for the initial charge.</li>
            <li> Note, this product is for same length all over buzz cuts, as stated in the instructions.  For that, it works perfectly, and very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was SO happy when my husband bought this. I&#x27;ve been his reluctant barber for ages and loved the idea that now he could do this himself whenever he wanted, thanks to BaByliss. He keeps his hair very short and one length all around, a lot like the guy on the box, so this seemed easy enough. And if his head were a smooth, perfectly round basketball, it might have worked great. But he&#x27;s got a normal, human head and any areas that are recessed were left long and any areas that are more prominent were shaved down to nothing. He sat there for a good 40 minutes trying to even it out (the instructions warn that it will be uneven at first) but the short spots just kept getting shorter while the long stayed long. Poor guy ended up with razor burn on the sides and a monk-style long fringe around the sideburns, over the ears and in the back. It was so bad that we were dying laughing. I just couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. Really, it was like a joke. We were able to mostly clean it up by shaving everything off with his old clippers on the lowest setting. I&#x27;ve never jumped on amazon to review a product quicker than this. I just don&#x27;t know who this could work well for.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, had to buzz my head with clippers before using or it would just tug on my hair. Not very sharp, definite waste of money.</li>
            <li> It worked good.  I won&#x27;t say it was a good haircut but it was far better than I could have otherwise done it.  I won&#x27;t say it was bad either.</li>
            <li> Piece of garbage! great concept, poor design. does not cut even or barley at all. DO NOT BUY!!</li>
            <li> THE INFORNMATUION WAS NOT CLEAR ENOUGH INDICATING THE TYPE OF CUT. NOT THE TYPE OF CUT I INTENDED TO RECEIVE!</li>
            <li> When I bought this product, I was so eager, so excited, and soooo would never have to buy another haircut again. As I unboxed the Babyliss Pro BPEC1, I thought to myself &#x27;What a stylish awesome looking hair cutting tool&#x27; and plugged it in the wall to charge bursting with anticipation of the following evening for a haircut that would change my life. After carefully reading the instructions, I began cutting my hair on it&#x27;s maximum size (4). I was cutting and cutting and cutting for what seemed like forever (30 min or so). Watching my progress, I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. My hair was all different lengths, uneven, and shot across everywhere on top of my head. Then my fiancee walked into the room and gasped followed by hysterical laughter. It had been the worst haircut I have ever had in my life. But yet I held my head high and promised to show and tell the people what this product can do and how it has changed my life.</li>
            <li> The design is smart and because it is round you don&#x27;t have to worry about places that are cut too close or the opposite.  Well worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on the spur of the moment. When it arrived I just put it away in the bathroom closet. About a week later I came home from work to a tirade of abuse from my good wife ,who had found the item &amp; decided to give herself a &amp;#34;bikini line&amp;#34; trim. It went out of control when switched on &amp; tore hair out by the roots.  Needless to say, the Babybliss has been resigned to the trash.</li>
            <li> The box says it had a size 6 comb setting, that I could not find.  And all the shorter settings were too short.  I finally tried the #4, my longest setting, and it was too short.  It&#x27;s been two weeks, and I still don&#x27;t have any hair.  Best for younger men with thick healthy hair.  Other comments on battery life are correct.  You get 12 minutes to cut your hair, and the battery dies for another 16 hour charge.</li>
            <li> just follow the enclosed directions and you will be fine. just be a little bit be patient and it will work just fine</li>
            <li> I ordered this haircut device cuz I used it before from a relative. This device is good for very short hair just like the picture of the man on the box it came in! You get used to using it after a while! I use the round with the 1 inch for the top of the hair with a back &amp; forth, front to back motion even cut, then I use the trimmer for the sides &amp; back of head to cut the military hair cut for my husband! It comes in handy because his schedule is long &amp; by the time he gets home the haircutting place is close! This comes in handy in between barbers or salons he goes to &amp; he is able to do the top &amp; sides by himself but the back he asks me to help! Lol Very fast express shipping from this company!</li>
            <li> Great Machine...saving lots of money by not going to the barber</li>
            <li> Works Fabulous.  Great for a trim up.</li>
            <li> This product may be (barely) capable of daily maintenance on a close shave, but the motor is still very weak and the blades very sub par. To use this for hair even a tiny bit longer than in the picture, it&#x27;s absolutely impossible. What a waste of money this was.</li>
            <li> This thing takes at least 3 times as long to trim hair as regular clippers, makes a mess with hair all over the place and you cant get close enough around the ears to get the hair trimed. A big waste of money!</li>
            <li> left bare spots.  Possibly my head shape is not like the models.</li>
            <li> No stars if it would let me</li>
            <li> It cuts either too tall or too short, there&#x27;s no in-between. I&#x27;m gonna have to wear a cap now for a month.</li>
            <li> works real well for short hair. easy to use. shipped promptly. well packed. nice item.&lt;br /&gt;does not work well for long hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best, use it once a week just set and forget it.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift to my son in law for Christmas, I know, I can never give a gift on Christmas, always before!  Plus, he needed a haircut.  He loves it, buzzes his head once a week and thinks its the greatest thing ever.  In fact, he&#x27;s called all of his brothers and told them that  they have to go buy this.  He&#x27;s a pretty picky guy, and he loves this so I would recommend it.  Now, I just have to think about what to get him to open up on Christmas</li>
            <li> Although sold here for less than half of the store retail the product itself is a waste of your hard earned cash. Buy a traditional clipper rather than this gimmick.</li>
            <li> Quick &amp; Clean Haircut.</li>
            <li> Kind of Hard to cut hair</li>
            <li> It is good to eliminate one rumor right up front:  It is not at all difficult to buzz-cut your own hair.  I have cut my own for years using standard electric clippers and the right head attachments.  My friends regularly tell me how nice my hair looks after doing so, asking me where I had it done.  It doesn&#x27;t require any special tool; all it requires is an electric barber clipper set that you can buy anywhere, including Amazon, for around $20.  Using such you can cut your own hair almost blindfolded:  just \\&quot;feel\\&quot; where the shaver goes and keep cutting until you hear it no longer cutting.  When you can no longer hear it cutting, the haircut is done.  It couldn&#x27;t be simpler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is why there is absolutely no need for the BaByliss \\&quot;easy cut\\&quot; system-- especially when its use is far from easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself some time and money on this one:  go buy the cheapest Wahl hair cutting kit you can find, and for a close buzz cut use the #2 (purple) blade attachment, and just run it over your head.  You will get a far better haircut, much more quickly than the BaByliss can possibly provide.  Then if you want to taper just drop down to a #1 or #0 blade attachment and go around the ears and neckline.  You will wind up with a good haircut and save yourself some cash as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truthfully the BayByliss is a very poor hair cutting system.  I followed the instructions precisely-- including the BE SURE TO DO THIS AND USE IT THIS WAY instruction sheet they provide separately from the main instruction booklet (I guess they received a number of complaints and returns and felt they had to add an extra explanation sheet to explain exactly how it works).  I let the unit charge a full 16 hours, used a properly short attachment (#2 setting of 4), ran it repeatedly over my scalp again and again and again and again... and still wound up having to finish up the hack job with my standard hair clippers-- which did a fine job in 1/4 the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a buzz cutting system... which is what I was looking for.  In principle the BaByliss concept is sound enough.  The problem is:&lt;br /&gt;1) The battery is too weak&lt;br /&gt;2) the motor is too slow and sluggish (even when plugged in)&lt;br /&gt;3) the hole in the cutter far too large&lt;br /&gt;4) the comb \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; too large and bulky to pick up hair while cutting...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... to accomplish anything close to a decent buzz-cut job.  If the cutting hole was about half the size, the motor twice as fast and twice as powerful, this would probably do a good job of providing a non-tapered buzz cut.  But as it is this unit can actually HURT as it cuts (even moving slowly it can pull hair) and requires going over the same area time and again.  I&#x27;m not talking 3 or 4, but 10, 20, 30 times over the exact same area... and  even then it still leaves hair uncut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I didn&#x27;t get a bad unit.  If we read the number of negative reviews they all report the same things.  When I bought it I thought those reviewers likely didn&#x27;t bother to read the instructions.  I judged them wrongly; this is plainly a bad product that does not work.  The neg-raters were actually providing very accurate reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, BaByliss is not a good choice in personal hair care products.  There is no air flow to pick up the hair toward the blades, the \\&quot;combs\\&quot; of the unit are so huge they can&#x27;t possibly pull up the hair as they should, and the blades are far too powerless and slow to do any kind of a decent cutting job.  It performs a very uneven, slow, ponderous job of semi-cutting and as it cuts it throws hair EVERYWHERE as there is nowhere for the hair to go but back onto your scalp and into the blades again, chopping it up into tiny pieces (wow, the cleanup job afterward was a mess)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Danger Will Robinson!

            <li> Was tired of frequent buzz cuts, so I purchased this to help reduce my visits to the barber.  Works well, but no fine trim, but the trimmers are with this package as well.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother...I have my hair just like the guy not the box...but this just doesn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> Not quite what I had expected,</li>
            <li> Works really well. Great and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> We get this very fast, but go two. They don&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li> Excellent. Will buy from again!</li>
            <li> My 15 year old son was brave enough to try this product. He went all out! after a few minutes, he stopped and we looked. The shaver, though set at 4, had shaved his scalp so close in the front, that it was at his scalp! I had to rush him to the barber who had to clip his entire head to the same close length. My other boys have said, &amp;#34;no way&amp;#34; they are using this product!</li>
            <li> Works as stated. Perfect for between haircuts and touch ups will save money almost immediately. Delivered on time, product is as advertised.</li>
            <li> This works good on short men&#x27;s hair. Does take a few passes through to get all hair cut. I use it every 10 days or else my hair gets too long for the Bayliss to cut properly.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple of years ago for my husband at Christmas thinking that it looked good and easy to use, why am I reviewing it now, well I&#x27;m having a clear out and I&#x27;ve just come across it in the back of the bathroom cabinet. It proved to be a complete waste of money, my husband tried several times but it always left long hair at the back and regardless of how many times he went over it it remained, I even tried thinking would be easier since I could see what I was doing, but no. Now maybe it&#x27;s the actual shape of his head, I&#x27;ve never noticed that there&#x27;s anything wrong with it but it gives a really uneven cut so maybe the surface is to blame!&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer which came with it is a different story, this gets used all the time.</li>
            <li> Works really well!  Gave me a uniform tennis ball cut over my head and beard.  The trimmer cleaned it all up.  Everything done in a few minutes. Love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband who wears his hair simply cut very short all over.  He tried the shaver once and was left with long spots that he couldn&#x27;t trim down no matter how many times he went over them, and most puzzlingly, he was left with one stripe up the back that was shorter than the setting indicated.  Even when I tried to &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34; his hair with the electric trimmer we always use, the short stripe in the back was still evident.  The product is a great idea, but sadly didn&#x27;t work as described for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, Amazon made the return easy and free, so it was worth trying.</li>
            <li> Ask me again in 6 months and I&#x27;ll rate it in full. only used it 3 times, could not rate it being so early</li>
            <li> I did not like the way it cuts hair at all. Tried to return but missed the window. waste of my money.</li>
            <li> This is the second time my husband is buying this. he used it before and lost the chord. he is in love with it and he looks absolutely fabulous when he cuts his own hair with it. I will recommend it in my sleep.</li>
            <li> After trying to go over my hair to straighten it I gave up and called my barber. I fallowed the directions and still had an uneven cut.  I would not tell anyone to buy this product. It just did not to what they claim</li>
            <li> not same in the video&lt;br /&gt;not easy cut</li>
            <li> Plugged in it works. I just tried it with power connected, and it worked. The cut seems good, but you do end up with hair on your shoulders. The little trimmer, works very well too. The hair cutter, does give an even cut. Will update review as time goes, but don&#x27;t see anything bad at this time, to say about it. Would make a good cut for a military haircut, plus it seems it travels, well. The trimmer is very good for beards, too!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly effective haircutter.</li>
            <li> Wish the charge held a bit longer ...but cuts. Good for ain between visits to the barber</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  Wanted an easier way to cut my hair, but it binds up, and does not trim around the ears.  That means having to use a different clipper to complete the job.  So not worth it, since it takes much longer than my other clippers, that can do the whole thing.  :~(</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for an easier way to cut my own hair short. I have used the Remington short hair cutter and found it acceptable. This thing does a poor job of evenly cutting the hair though. I followed the directions for how to use the tool as they show in the video for the product but it left patches of hair uncut. Maybe it works ok for some kinds of hair but it was almost useless with mine. The only use I found for this is to start cutting with this thing and then finish it off with the Remington short hair cutter. I don&#x27;t think they tested this thing before selling it. I oiled the blades up like they suggested before my first use and it still started to feel like it was pulling some of my hair out. I am hopeful that some day a worthy self short hair cutting tool will be available but the time has not yet come.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair cutter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I use it without any of the attachments.  It gives me a good close cut.  Did I say this was the BEST?  This is the BEST!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it so easy to use.</li>
