    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Works great!!</li>
            <li>It worked great!</li>
            <li>was wrong!:)&lt;br /&gt;After 10 minutes of this miracle product on my hair, it looked PERFECT.</li>
            <li>I paid $16 for both products and that saved us a lot of money for that perfect salon look.  </li>
            <li>it is great!</li>
            <li>So although the product says it will work on any hair color, my conclusions are that it will probably work best if anything on blondes.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just great!  </li>
            <li>Still, no home color product is perfect and this one could be improved a bit.</li>

            <li>Good luck in your journey to fix your hair!</li>
            <li>Well when I did it my darker roots turned a beautiful glowing shade of orange...</li>
            <li>Worked beautifully to reduce the brass of coloring hair blond.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t look like the beautiful hair on the box...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li>Also, the conditioner that comes with this product is amazing; it&#x27;s the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I read a couple really great reviews and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li>Keep on longer - 45 to 1 hour but worked great</li>
            <li>great- like apple blossoms.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>My hair looks great</li>
            <li>this is a great product if you dont feel like waiting another 20 min at the salon to have them apply the toner.</li>
            <li>Great for hairÔºÅ</li>
            <li>Used it before and it works great</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the results and will purchase again when I get brassy.</li>
            <li>I could have gone as the Great Pumpkin.</li>
            <li>I decided to go blond again (a decision I make every couple years LOL).</li>
            <li>Fluorescent can look great, for accessories, maybe clothing, but not in hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>After I washed it out I applied the conditioner, which is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Works amazing!  </li>
            <li>I ended up with either orange or goldilocks colored hair, depends on your color perception - most attractive!</li>
            <li>I saw the relatively good reviews and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was in good condition as well.  </li>
            <li>And surprisingly for a &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34</li>
            <li>The conditioner is always so soothing and smelled good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m away for school and have yet to find a salon as good as the one I visit at home.</li>
            <li>Most people said anywhere from 30-45 minutes was ideal for anyone seeking to wipe out any yellow/red tones.</li>
            <li>I used Brass Banisher because it had a lot of good reviews</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even smell good or make my hair softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know have beautiful golden curls and the colors are blended beautifully.</li>
            <li>I  was always mixing colors to get that elusive \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; color and had some very humorous occurrences along the way.  </li>
            <li>I used to go to a really nice salon and they used a good toner after they took out my foils.</li>
            <li>The conditioner that comes with the brass banisher is lovely and smells very nice.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>So anyway, the smell is not terrible, but it isn&#x27;t pleasant either.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price, it says not to leave in more than 10 minutes, but i would suggest leaving it in maybe 15 minutes for best results.</li>
            <li>My advice is to call the toll free number on the box if you have any questions, because the people at L&#x27;Oreal are always happy to help.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It saved me after I tried to highlight my own hair.  </li>
            <li>I have been bleaching my own hair to achieve an ombre look.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but that&#x27;s all I can say for it.</li>
            <li>I do my own hair.</li>
            <li>Great that it works so well for some, but shouldn&#x27;t it work better for most of us?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I took matters into my own hands.</li>
            <li>Checked the time again, and turned on the faucet to apply warm water into a lather like the directions said.  </li>
            <li>would never buy this product again then again, may not ever color my own hair again.</li>
            <li>warm (brassy).</li>
            <li>Note: the preference is a really nice color</li>
            <li>have colored my own hair for over 20 years and have never had a problem.</li>
            <li>NICE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>My highlights look nice but the rest of my hair is a bit brassy.  </li>
            <li>really worked great!</li>
            <li>Honestly I was kind of expecting it to be a lot better, just didn&#x27;t work as good on my hair as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and I washed it after 10 minutes and it looks good.   </li>
            <li>perfect soft &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Every once in a while I get this grand idea to save $100 and color my own hair.</li>
            <li>Instead of taking away warm tones it made the color even more reddish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ok, I used to go to the best salon&#x27;s, then I didn&#x27;t feel well because I am being treated for lyme disease, you get by Tick bites, it often is mistaked for MS or Fibromyalgia (that&#x27;s what they said I had until I sought a specialist, as I live in CA</li>
            <li>This worked great for me and my hair looks shiny and pretty today.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and it does exactly what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>Bright beautiful blonde.</li>
            <li>l used  &#x27;Nice and Easy&#x27; for years then found Loreal permanent color</li>
            <li>can barly notice I made a booboo love it will be getting lots more</li>
            <li>I should have known better.</li>
            <li>She and I, sure...</li>
            <li>No need to go to the salon! :)</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t seem more damaged because of the use of the product.    </li>
            <li>My results were okay, I suppose.  </li>
            <li>Lovely product.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m going to have to find another cure for the copper penny orange on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>now just more damaged.  </li>
            <li>that looks so much better.  </li>
            <li>However, I am glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>It was supposed to be more caramel and honey</li>
            <li>but instead it was more yellows and oranges.</li>
            <li>but it made everything blend together better.</li>
            <li>I love myself in the mirror again</li>
            <li>and I LOVE MY HAIR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>If it does, I will be on auto ship to make sure that I do it everything I do a touch up.   </li>
            <li>We then applied this product to get that \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; blond look and, 20 minutes later after showering it off, her hair is now picture perfect!</li>
            <li>If your hair is yellow after bleaching it and you want to grt that perfect  lond look, then this product is for you.  </li>
            <li>After using the brass banisher most of the orange has been lifted.</li>
            <li>, I actually think 40 mins wouldve been the perfect amount for my hair.</li>
            <li>am giving this product a one star review based on the fact that it made my hair MORE brassy than it was before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Loreal knows how to make hair color, better than most companies.  </li>
            <li>You would think home hair coloring would have progressed more by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; blonde shade which worked the best for me.  </li>
            <li>I should know better than that,  </li>
            <li>It was lovely and silky and shiny before.</li>
            <li>My hair is even better than it was before in every way, color, silkiness, shine and softness like you can&#x27;t believe.  </li>
            <li>I sure am glad I did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Google had the answer - or rather, many, many hair/make-up bloggers had the answer - most people in the know stated what I already suspected: the 10 minute maximum is a marketing ploy to sell efficiency but this product is not a miracle-worker.</li>
            <li>i love this productÔºÅ</li>
            <li>so glad i found itÔºÅ</li>
            <li>I even took before and after photos just so I would be able to tell if there were results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I desire a more ashy shade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible now</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d just prefer it a bit more ash.</li>
            <li>, I love it.</li>
            <li>like it better than the finest salons</li>
            <li>My guess is this is more for people who bleach their hair, which I did not</li>
            <li>The product directions say to leave this on for 10 minutes, but many of the reviews recommended up to 45 minutes</li>
            <li>I waited 2 days to wash my hair after applying and in my opinion it is more red/orange after using this product than it was to begin with.  </li>
            <li>read the reviews saying it needs more than the 5-10 minutes</li>
            <li>out of the shower and no change if anything it made the top layer even brassier.</li>
            <li>but It seems there have been some good success stories with this product</li>
            <li>Was hoping it would get more of the brassiness out of my summer hair</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure when to start timing...</li>
            <li>I might pick up another box in a week or so and repeat and see if I can help some more.    </li>
            <li>At any rate, this product is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>I suspect that leaving this on even longer, 30 to 45 minutes, may have made a more noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>I watched many YouTube reviews and decided to leave it on for 30 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS</li>
            <li>have brunette hair and wanted my highlights to be more</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to use, smells good and the conditioner that comes with</li>
            <li>I applied it to the root area first and waited... and waited... for it to turn that beautiful cool shade.</li>
            <li>I had better results just using a cool toned toner to try and minimize the warm tones.</li>
            <li>(Nice &#x27;n Easy does itch), and it smells fine.</li>
            <li>is a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Super love!</li>
            <li>I used the conditioner, and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a pretty good conditioner.  </li>
            <li>For $8.50, this was pretty good.</li>
            <li>I use Brass Banisher and it comes out looking so natural and beautiful.</li>
            <li>In my bathroom flourescent lighting, it still looks brassy in most spots, except for my bangs, they look pretty good in all light.</li>
            <li>The color always turns out the most beautiful blonde after the two step process and without even a hint of orange/yellow.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t an easy job</li>
            <li>this in one easy 5 minute application does the trick and removes (or covers over, whatever)</li>
            <li>used to use Wella&#x27;s toners but their smell of ammonia is so strong that I had to wear a mask while applying it on my hair.</li>
            <li>My head didn&#x27;t burn, felt kind of tingly and good actually.</li>
            <li>I liked the color, looked at the back with a hand mirror and looked good, even ringlet curls were forming again.  </li>
            <li>I am a beautiful blonde!</li>
            <li>my hair is now a beautiful combination of champagne, honey, and silvery white highlights.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conditioner is nice (not as nice as other reviewers say) and it smells nice</li>
            <li>All I can say is that it was cheap, easy to use, and did the job.</li>
            <li>Blondes, I think it&#x27;ll work just fine.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and light brown</li>
            <li>It turned the brassy color into a slightly lighter color, made it look more like highlights then bright brassy roots!</li>
            <li>Got the bright yellow look out of my bleached hair without turning any of it gray like many ash blondes and toners have done to me before.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a huge difference, but you could see my roots.</li>
            <li>This is huge, ladies.</li>
            <li>I just looked cheap and fake-blonde.</li>
            <li>Worked great at removing yellow and brassy tones.</li>
            <li>its cheap</li>
            <li>I used Wella T14 the next day and got great results.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is that this product requires more time, but it is worth it to get the results you&#x27;re after.  </li>
            <li>I bought a cheap box hair color and thought I could fix my roots all by myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so good for hair and soft, silky, shiny condition as well as</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>so I went to a salon to have more of my natural colour added so it would blend nicely as it grew out.</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing!!!</li>
            <li>This product is perfect to tone down the warm (yellow, orange shades) and gives hair a more \\&quot;cool\\&quot; tone.  </li>
            <li>If you try this, if you have a ton of brass like me, I suggest leaving it on for greater than 30 minutes as long as your hair is kind of healthy.  </li>
            <li>but there are people who have much more fine/porous hair and the result will be gray, so if there are any doubts, please test a swatch of your hair first, per the directions</li>
            <li>Just for that alone it was all worth it!</li>
            <li>that is when I began to coloring my hair, and that of about every girl on my block, gaining useful knowledge in the art of hair color, at their expense!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Later in life I owned a beauty salon until I realized I could make more money in Real Estate!  </li>
            <li>On top of it, the rest of my hair was darker and more natural looking.</li>
            <li>Used up the entire bottle, then made sure it was nice and saturated, while watching for color change.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m quite fair to begin with so roots aren&#x27;t really a concern) and after a very outdoorsy summer, I was seeing a LOT of brass.</li>
            <li>When i came across this product I didn&#x27;t have high hopes but figured it was worth a try, better than paying $200 for a salon to fix it!</li>
            <li>I had perfectly fine highlights in my naturally golden brown hair.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right almost  $10.00 for NOTHING!</li>
            <li>RIGHT NOW!</li>
            <li>my roots are still brassy and it turned my bright blonde highlights duller.</li>
            <li>BRIGHT red and</li>
            <li>I always get orange when I try and bleach my hair but this time I had some bright yellow also.</li>
            <li>my &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; toner after frosting and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d use it again if my hair was brassy, but if I heard good things about another product, I&#x27;d be just as likely to try that one as well.</li>
            <li>Not at all recommended or impressed with in the least.</li>
            <li>some reason and when I use this and leave on full 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Back in the  60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s the color was not as good.  </li>
            <li>my hair was to that shade where I could get it to the \\&quot;perfect  platinum &#x27;blonde\\&quot;, IF, I used the Dream Blonde color, in the light ash blonde shade!  </li>
            <li>the outer top layer that is exposed to sun a lot gets very brassy and I have yet to find something that helps get rid of brassy hair.</li>
            <li>so i left it in for a good 30</li>
            <li>I chose to double the time after reading reviews where people did leave this on longer than 10 minutes and got good results.  </li>
            <li>So for me this product is a dream come true</li>
            <li>but there are absolutely no bad effects.</li>
            <li>I folowed up by using Nice N Easy&#x27;s 8A Medium Ash Blonde the day after and that did the trick.</li>
            <li>Rinse felt good, condition really nice turned off the water, applied a towel and dried first...</li>
            <li>Luckily I had planned ahead and had bought a box of this, and it worked wonders.</li>
            <li>Works super well.  </li>
            <li>so I initially tried to apply it using the bottle but quickly removed the bottle top and poured it into my gloved hands and applied it that way, which I found quicker and more thorough.  </li>
            <li>excellent product, have used in past, works exactly as promised</li>
            <li>Creates an amazing ashy ultra light blonde tone.</li>
            <li>After all the reviews on YouTube I didn&#x27;t have high hopes, but still I thought anything could be better than having orange hair.   </li>
            <li>I was very nervous about using this because I&#x27;d gathered from multiple reviews that this product works best on natural blonds.  </li>
            <li>the exact color is Loreal Preference Light Brown-</li>
            <li>Works great, definitely removes blond yellow and leaves hair more evenly toned.</li>
            <li>Also works very fast!  </li>
            <li>The orange-yellow is much more subdued but at the expense of losing my lovely bright blonde highlights and my hair feels dry!</li>
            <li>My hair looks a lot more natural now and it got the job done!</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Brass Banisher is ABSOLUTELY terrifc!!</li>
            <li>this product toned them down very nicely.</li>
            <li>I have medium/dark brown hair (straight, shoulder-length, fine).</li>
            <li>It looked very orange at my roots and bright yellow on the rest.  </li>
            <li>The ash shades really turned out gray, the golden shades were bright yellow and the beige shades pinkish.</li>
            <li>I left it on for 10 minutes, and instead of orange, my hair is now a nice beige.</li>
            <li>I suppose some of it looks &amp;#34;caramel&amp;#34; colored, and the even color does look more professional.</li>
            <li>I wanted a natural look again and healthy hair.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed the nice beigy blonde and get compliments for&lt;br /&gt;my hair.</li>
            <li>but this wasn&#x27;t as powerful as it needed to be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the dough.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, my color rarely showed a tint of gray except the  times  </li>
            <li>It kind of works , but if you did a big &amp;#34;ooops&amp;#34; on your hair I wouldn&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>so perhaps it works better on natural blondes.</li>
            <li>It comes with gloves which is nice and a packet of deep conditioner to use afterwards.</li>
            <li>My hair was a nice beige medium blonde color.</li>
            <li>I am going from blonde to my own gray.  </li>
            <li>I usually use L&#x27;Oreal color, but I couldn&#x27;t find the color I wanted, so I picked a Nice &#x27;n Easy light auburn.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product on Amazon and then, I decided to call L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s help line to ask if this was the right product for me.</li>
            <li>I just got it in the mail and tried it right away.</li>
            <li>It is certainly worth the money and does a good job toning down the brass.</li>
            <li>Right now, my hair is brown with blond highlights but too much summer fun turned my highlights into a ghastly, brassy mess, especially right on top of my head.  </li>
            <li>The most important thing to remember, however, is don&#x27;t leave it on too long!</li>
            <li>I had achieved a perfect slowly transitioning look, with very light blond on the bottom that eased into my dark natural color on top.</li>
            <li>the conditioner this comes with is not bad it really moisturized well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li>It did blend the grey nicely and softened the hair.</li>
            <li>I always buy  the \\&quot;extra light ash\\&quot; or \\&quot;light ash\\</li>
            <li>It is quite possible that this is intended for someone with very light hair to begin with.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say this made my hair any darker, it just made my hair more of a light ash blonde instead of like a light \\&quot;golden\\&quot; blonde.  </li>
            <li>I very much regret using this product and as it was Loreal haircolor</li>
            <li>You better off go to salon or try some other remedies, such as purple shampoo or, even better, for the price - re-color your hair into brass free ash or blond if you want to stay away from redness.</li>
            <li>I barely (if at all?) noticed ANY difference after using Brass Banisher; was certainly hoping for-- and expecting more.</li>
            <li>because I was so far from my original hair color, it was not the right product for me and it wouldn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought this it was about $8.  </li>
            <li>about Legally Blonde&#x27;s comment - not everybody can leave it on for more than 10 min.  </li>
            <li>(roots first, followed by lengths.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I tried to get all of my hair coated evenly, then I let it sit for 10 min.</li>
            <li>I bleach the top layer of my hair regularly...</li>
            <li>Thanks L&#x27;Oreal!</li>
            <li>First time I dyed my hair at home</li>
            <li>Here is the funny story.</li>
            <li>I made sure I got ALL the roots and tiny hairs that the stylists seem to always ignore.  </li>
            <li>And it saved us a pretty penny, too.</li>
            <li>Obviously getting my hair glazed at the salon looks better (costs like $40 though).</li>
            <li>I will make sure I have a box of this on hand before lightening my hair in the future.</li>
            <li>I have natural light brown hair</li>
            <li>I ordered 4 boxes and with the first try I followed all the directions.</li>
            <li>took the yellow tones out of my hair, was safe to use and did no damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair has been many shades of light blonde since I began coloring it, but has not been my natural shade in over 40 years.  </li>
            <li>and then I decide to pre-lighten my hair and do a two step process to get my hair to a more platinum blonde shade.</li>
            <li>But... I decided to use this product first, to see what it would do this time.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first but the orange was driving me bonkers</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>I suggest getting 1 more bottle than you think you will need and then if you don&#x27;t use it you have some for next time.</li>
            <li>This was my first time to try this</li>
            <li>It actually made my hair more brassy.  </li>
            <li>but my hair seems drier from the solution, I&#x27;m worried I did damage to my hair for exactly zero results.</li>
            <li>This stuff works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Will order more in the future.</li>
            <li>I bought Brass Banisher and the \\&quot;purple shampoo\\&quot; and decided to banish first.  </li>
            <li>But the red is gone which is what bothered me the most.</li>
            <li>I still wish I had more brown left in my hair.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bleach it first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, the product works pretty well.</li>
            <li>i used the product and unfortunately, no change to the brassiness.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>My hair is a richer color now, more deep tones and not a bit of orange to be found.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and it turned the first few inches of my hair a BRIGHT, brassy orange-red.</li>
            <li>I lighten my hair a lot, so it was already pretty damaged, but it definitely got noticeably more damaged after this application.</li>
            <li>my hair more of a solid blended tone.  </li>
            <li>Always read the box first people.</li>
            <li>Ok so this will not give you the results you want if you&#x27;re trying to bring your yellow gold bleached hair to platinum.  </li>
            <li>It will however even out your blonde and give it a believable tone.</li>
            <li>and I seem to have even more red tones to my hair.</li>
            <li>After reading the other reviews, I took their advice and left it on the FULL 10 minutes, 10 more, then 30 minutes, okay...</li>
            <li>I have taken to coloring my own hair every other color.</li>
            <li>My hair looks much better a couple shades lighter than my natural light to medium brown and grey color.</li>
            <li>I bought this product looking for a more natural look because even though I dyed it a medium cool brown, there were still a lot of orange/red shades within it, especially visible in the sun.</li>
            <li>It took several treatments of various types to arrive at the shade I wanted, but this was a pretty good step on the way.</li>
            <li>It took my orange and yellow highlights and tamed them perfectly to a nice natural color.  </li>
            <li>The last time I did it, I added highlights to the top of my head, which came out very orange and brassy.</li>
            <li>BUT, it took away months of slowly bleaching my hair to the lightest blond I had achieved AND the top of my head is even more brassy and now it is an all over tone.</li>
            <li>I liked it in the salon especially the way she fixed it</li>
            <li>Several of the highlights on top were very brassy which I didn&#x27;t like at all.</li>
            <li>It completely took out the unwanted orangey yellows and gave me  more natural honey blondes and creamy beiges.</li>
            <li>Started in front, the sides and back, and back really really good.  </li>
            <li>My hair came out super soft despite the fact that I did dye it the day before AND used a toner afterwords, so my hair was beaten up and crunchy before Brass Banisher&#x27;s conditioner!</li>
            <li>It also makes your hair super shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>Too cheap to go back and have it redone right now.</li>
            <li>I applied Brass Banisher on my roots first and then continued on to saturate the whole lenght of my hair.</li>
            <li>When it dried, it was significantly lighter and much more orange than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I took the other back and got this one instead.  </li>
            <li>It is scarey for sure and even more so for a newbie at it, but I will learn and so will you, but start with the brass banisher and then if need be the hair color remover and stay away from amonia products when you don&#x27;t need to use them and others like Color silk are available.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty much platinum hair</li>
            <li>It probably would be a good product if your hair is very yellow-orange as anything would look better than that, but I am sad</li>
            <li>It did tone it a bit but no more than a good lather with purple shampoo did.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it took down the brassiness a notch...</li>
            <li>My hair looks exactly the same as it did before this treatment which is super brassy!</li>
            <li>it gives it liftÔºå bounceÔºå lifeÔºå energyÔºå and feels not as dry and more plyableÔºÅ</li>
            <li>Let my hair air dry as to not do more damage to the ends from blow drying again.    </li>
            <li>, however I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s like a regular toner because it didn&#x27;t seem as strong as the toners Sally&#x27;s sells.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have liked a little less of a warm tint in my hair, but I can&#x27;t complain because I didn&#x27;t use it for 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t change the color of blonde in my hair from my previous highlight on any of the hair it did touch or my bangs, so I was happy with that as I have read some people complain of darker hair.  </li>
            <li>When I color it myself with a blonde from the super market my hair always looks lighter but more of an orange-blonde than a blonde.</li>
            <li>it was relatively healthy but after using this it feels very dry.  </li>
            <li>First, I should say I had high expectations for this product and went into it hoping for a miracle.</li>
            <li>I am naturally light brown but color my hair medium blonde, still very brassy after leaving the product on for the specified time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have redhair that get&#x27;s really brassy in the Summer.</li>
            <li>This really does work.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of bleaching my hair with a really cheap bleach, that left my hair ORANGE.</li>
            <li>I was really torn when writing this review, but at the end of the day, this product did not at all do what it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>It was still very orange and brassy...</li>
            <li>Much to my dismay</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Some of my highlights looked really brassy when I got them done 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really do as much as I was hoping.</li>
            <li>A tip, though.. don&#x27;t hesitate to put this all over your hair-- don&#x27;t spare your roots because it has very even coverage.</li>
            <li>It really messed up my hair too.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t work for me much at all.</li>
            <li>I &#x27;was&#x27; a light blonde, and therefore, I would &#x27;always be&#x27; a light blonde.  </li>
            <li>This product and the hair color remover have peroxide and they were totally gentle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very cautious.  </li>
            <li>The product didn&#x27;t really change my hair at all.</li>
            <li>HAHA.</li>
            <li>and it cant make it much</li>
            <li>and when I washed it out I really didnt feel like this did anything to help the brassy unnatural tones that were showing on my hair</li>
            <li>Its cheap enough to try again, if nothing else</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much softer looking now.</li>
            <li>thanks to the evening out of tone this product did.</li>
            <li>it changed the color too much.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t do much for me at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still very orange.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s Halloween time but get real</li>
            <li>you really need something that helps with the brassiness</li>
            <li>highly recommend though..!</li>
            <li>My orange color was very severe</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t give you even light ashy blonde.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I left it on for that long</li>
            <li>My nice white highlights actually seem brassier now.&lt;br /&gt;Need</li>
            <li>It has made my hair a more natural looking blonde.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s more of a glaze than a total color, there was almost no mess.</li>
            <li>and I think in the end it made it easy to get me back to a normal color.</li>
            <li>The effects are subtle but important - my blonde looks a lot more natural now even though I&#x27;m sporting roots - it looks like it was bleached out more by the sun than by a bottle,</li>
            <li>Seriously, how many &#x27;blonding&#x27; products, of any kind, work properly in 10 minutes?!  </li>
            <li>My other point about this product is that it should work better and not wash out in a couple of washings.  </li>
            <li>I use this product in conjunction with L&#x27;Oreal Les Blondessimes Extra Light Natural Blond, and it gives me the exact shade of medium gold that I like.  </li>
            <li>Both products do essentially the same job, but Brass Banisher seems to be more nourishing for the hair, leaving it soft with a super glassy shine.  </li>
            <li>I combed gently, head wasn&#x27;t sore, comb slid through my hair just fine, not all dry or brittle.  </li>
            <li>My hair is still soft and shiny and looks pretty much like it does when I leave the salon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used Brass Banisher before to calm down the gold of lighter shades, so I made my way to Walmart for this fantastic product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought John Frieda Lightening Spray, used it 3 times, lightened to what looked like a nice golden color...was outside a few days in a row in the sun w/o a hat on...instead of going blonder it got orange/red/brassy, so unnatural looking</li>
            <li>when it first touches your hair, or when you are completely done.</li>
            <li>It lightens it about a shade: from red to gold, gold to neutral and neutral to cool.</li>
            <li>I am a pale beigey blonde, very fair skintone, with blue eyes.  </li>
            <li>I could see that it helped, but maybe next time I should leave it on for the full 10 minutes since I still had some brassy areas.  </li>
            <li>the back, darker, but not bad at all</li>
            <li>My natural color is medium brown with red and gold highlights--now turning gray--and it&#x27;s also fine, so what works for one person may not work for another.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m much happier with my new look now</li>
            <li>My roots are still slightly brassier than the rest of my hair, but it&#x27;s not horribly noticeable and with purple shampoo</li>
            <li>I would notice some orangey/yellow tint at times and even then, it was slight and mostly at the roots.</li>
            <li>My natural hair is a light brown/auburn strawberry blonde color.</li>
            <li>I believe it works on reddish super blonde hair, but not anything darker.</li>
            <li>It definitely took out (most of) the brass color from my (colored) blonde and highlighted hair.</li>
            <li>and I got a lot of compliments, but the second time I colored it, it seemed more red.</li>
            <li>I use quick blue and 40% for 10 mintues.</li>
            <li>it left my hair undamaged but also unchanged, if anything the yellow became more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t start timing it until I had applied the entire bottle, and then I left it on for about 15 more minutes.  </li>
            <li>Also I find toning my hair makes it feel healthier, which is the main reason I did it.  </li>
            <li>For a quick fix of an off tone blonde this will work.</li>
            <li>I recently lightened it by just one shade and the red tones were made more pronounced.</li>
            <li>I have a very pretty blonde color now</li>
            <li>Highly reccommend this product.  </li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>And the high moisture conditioner that it comes with made my hair so shiny that it looks like I just got out of the salon and got a color treatment and a haircut, while, in fact, I cut my hair 6 months</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it if you want to get the brassiness out of your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been battling brassiness for some time and wonder if it may have something to do with  high chlorine/mineral content in the water in Atlanta.  </li>
            <li>Just used the product, and took ALL my high lights out .</li>
            <li>I also left it on for 25 minutes, washed it with purple toning shampoo afterward and before using the included conditioner (which is amazing), then let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li>I was just making sure to get all of the product out because, like I said, it was a little bit like glue.  </li>
            <li>For many years, with few exceptions,  I have used a one step blonding process which has made my hair a very pretty , \\&quot;cool\\&quot; , blonde.  </li>
            <li>My eyes never burned, I did put the fan on, was a little runnier than color, but ok</li>
            <li>but if you want to get the orangy tint out of your blonde, go get a blonde boxed dye and add ardell red gold color corrector, much better and softer results and doesn&#x27;t smell so offensive!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle, just hoping for a little more debrassing.  </li>
            <li>This Brass Banisher is just to take out brassiness from blonde hair that has either been freshly bleached and is too brassy or that needs a little refreshing and blending.</li>
            <li>after was left with bright orange roots not cute</li>
            <li>but once I was home it looked very stripey and not as natural as I had wanted.</li>
            <li>no where near what i really wanted.  </li>
            <li>Still not my natural color, but I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to be.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical of this product, but after using it for three differet times, Each time has been great.</li>
            <li>I liked the level of the color, which is dark blonde (I don&#x27;t want it lighter)</li>
            <li>I helped my wife bleach her hair to get that Platinum look and to save the $200 she would normally spend doing it at the salon.</li>
            <li>It really was a pretty blonde</li>
            <li>If you are already blonde and sort of golden (like me) but looking for that fresh-from-the-salon ashy tone, 25 minutes should do the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In natural light my crown looks much better, only reddish in a few spots, but my hair has some natural reds in it anyway, so  </li>
            <li>I normally get my hair colored almost platinum at the salon</li>
            <li>After a couple of days, it all wore off and my hair went right back to its orangy/brassy glory.</li>
            <li>You prob don&#x27;t want to do this right before a big date...</li>
            <li>almost worked...quite a bit turned the right shade but there was also a lot of baby chick yellow.</li>
            <li>I thought, now, I would do a quick review , just of this product, without the long story which I was inspired to write before.  </li>
            <li>So, yellow top, normal but VERY dry ends.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use as the mixture becomes thick enough to not be drippy which makes the whole process simple and clean.  </li>
            <li>We live and learn I suppose, and I have learned not to use this product again.</li>
            <li>Toned down the yellow and orange tones in my highlights - highlights now have a nice, natural look.  </li>
            <li>This is a good toner to help get the &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; out of your blonde;  however, I&#x27;ve had to leave it on at least 20 minutes to see results as opposed to the 5 or 10 minutes the instructions recommend.</li>
            <li>It only takes 10 minutes, but I would prefer if I could use it right in with the color for a one-step treatment like my old Clairol toner used to.  </li>
            <li>but I found the boxed products at the drug store are just as good, if, a little more expensive.  </li>
            <li>, my hair looks exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I probably could&#x27;ve done with only one, but I did use maybe a 1/4 of the second box just to make sure I saturated my ends enough.</li>
            <li>Please, bring back &#x27;Dream Blonde&#x27;, ash shades  or create something better to take the brassiness out of blonde hair</li>
            <li>Long review, but worth reading - promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found any other product that better helps prevent brassy or yellowish tones in home-applied color-treated blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>This was the first and only product i found that claimed to do just that.</li>
            <li>Since I couldn&#x27;t make time to get it colored the usual way, I did what so many women before me</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;d really be better off lightening it yourself again at home, especially because this color does essentially the same thing.</li>
            <li>My hair is dark brown with many platinum highlights that naturally go red with my normal pigmentation.</li>
            <li>and it was a pretty nice shade of dark gold with just a few orangey hints that still bugged me</li>
            <li>, like it use to be only less and the top of my head and sides were orange free, my blonde was back.  </li>
            <li>have naturally black brown hair and has dyed it a light brown auburn.</li>
            <li>Also, if you&#x27;ve got a lot of yellow or orange in your hair from a recent dye, don&#x27;t hesitate to leave it on for the full 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried about damage, but even though I have fine hair</li>
            <li>This time I feel that that I was deceived by numerous positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I wiped it off my skin with cool water whenever I touched it and it must have come right off, because there was no staining on my skin and only a little bit on the washcloth.</li>
            <li>I finally decided I wanted to be blonde again instead of having to keep dying since my roots come in so quickly, and so I used a product that takes the dyed color out of your hair.  </li>
            <li>The darkness washed out over a few weeks, which is fine with me.</li>
            <li>It did turn out a pretty,  neutral, pale blonde but still had more yellow than the I wanted.  </li>
            <li>No stranger to hair coloring disasters myself and allergic to high salon prices, I read directions carefully no matter</li>
            <li>The directions say to rinse until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>Well the water was never running anything but clear.</li>
            <li>It also left my hair very shiny and soft, and the conditioner that came with</li>
            <li>Brass Banisher really does get rid of the brassy color that sometimes occurs with blonde hair color products.  </li>
            <li>After washing it out, my hair was a truer ash blonde but my roots were still very brassy.</li>
            <li>and it looks so natural and</li>
            <li>I use this stuff and in just ten minutes it pulls so much of the gold tones.</li>
            <li>I will still leave the long version here, for those of you who are interested in &#x27;plowing through it&#x27;.</li>
            <li>In fact, I called Clairol once about one of their drug store shades and asked which shade it was in their professional line and was told there was none.  </li>
            <li>but no where near what I hoped to achieve.</li>
            <li>I have well water which turns my blonde hair very brassy over time and</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t use it as frequently as I should I sometimes have to do 2 applications 2 days in a row</li>
            <li>This same product is in Walmart for $9.. can&#x27;t believe people are trying to sell it for as much as they are..</li>
            <li>it is noted to be on the Natural Scale, so it should not have turned so...</li>
            <li>]WOW</li>
            <li>I have naturally medium brown hair fyi</li>
            <li>Very brassy and red.  </li>
            <li>I left it on for 45 minutes and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s something in it that I was allergic to and after taking my hair out of the towel, the fumes caused an allergic reaction that caused my eyes to swell completely shut.</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars only because it didn&#x27;t really do any damage.</li>
            <li>Worked really well at getting rid of orange and yellow brassiness from my bleached hair.</li>
            <li>After coloring my hair with a honey blonde dye from naturtint, I was left with light blonde hair with an orange tint.</li>
            <li>This product definitely didn&#x27;t fix the whole problem but it did soften the orange</li>
            <li>Wish they would pay for me to have it fixed.</li>
            <li>I had platinum blonde dyed hair with an ash blonde low light through.</li>
            <li>My blonde hair was still brassy, didn&#x27;t really look like I had did anything to fix it.</li>
            <li>I have natural reddish hair...</li>
            <li>Sometimes I touch up my roots and highlights between professional appts.  </li>
            <li>I then looked at more reviews and ran across a few saying that it worked for them if you left it in longer than directed.</li>
            <li>the deep conditioner was prob worth ten bucks alone.  </li>
            <li>It was super easy to use--I would do it again and definitely recommend it to other natural dark brunettes.</li>
            <li>After bleaching my natural medium blond hair that had light platinum highlights, using Loreal&#x27;s Super Blolne my hair turned a deep orange, brassy color (very scary for me :) ) especially at the roots.</li>
            <li>But once i dried and used flat iron hair was nice even blonde.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and makes your hair not only much less brassy but also shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Yep, my hair was dry, I did this exactly as advised on the package</li>
            <li>The first color that I saw on my blonde hair after the banisher was a kind of green, after a few days is just blond</li>
            <li>I had read that this Brass Banisher tones really light hair a darker color, but I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be dramatic and that it would be worth it to remove the orange tones.</li>
            <li>Now the red is gone; my hair is more of dark brown with blonde highlights (reflections?)</li>
            <li>after I dried it, I did decide that I like the color, but it is not as light blonde as I normally like it to be.</li>
            <li>it IS worth the cost of this product alone as other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There was more than enough product, and the red is definitely far less in my hair than it was.</li>
            <li>I am naturally dark/medium brown and take my hair down to light blonde.</li>
            <li>I then apply the permanent hair color in \\&quot;extra light ash blonde \\&quot;  after it is dry .  </li>
            <li>So, about six months ago, I dyed my naturally light ash blonde hair to a dark brown.  </li>
            <li>Used this after &amp;#34;high-lift&amp;#34;- from dark brown to light blonde.</li>
            <li>So I tried to be cheap and dye my hair from medium brown to dark blonde and of course it turned orangy.  </li>
            <li>It also left it very soft!</li>
            <li>this takes the yellow out of home processed color jobs and saves a lot of money from high salon prices</li>
            <li>The brassy top and roots are a little lighted beige, and the rest it a tiny bit darker, but it&#x27;s the same color everywhere</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably use two boxes though to really saturate my long hair, that&#x27;s below my shoulder blades.</li>
            <li>It specifically states it will remove red/orange/yellow tints from color treated hair, but not dark hair.</li>
            <li>have strawberry blonde hair and after my last coloring, it became very brassy, so I decided to try this.</li>
            <li>It became cool dark blonde.</li>
            <li>I ended up finally deciding to go to my stylist and get it all fixed professionally.</li>
            <li>I decided to wait  a few days to apply the \\&quot;Dream Blonde\\&quot; light ash blonde.</li>
            <li>since I only used the peroxide spray on my roots and bangs, I only really applied this Brass Banisher to those areas as well.</li>
            <li>For someone who wants a white blonde look, this is not the product for you</li>
            <li>I do have faint gold highlights - which looks good, actually.  </li>
            <li>Had my hair highlighted, but my stylist didnt apply a toner to cool down some of the yellow on my tips.</li>
            <li>After trying to lighten my dark blonde hair to ultra light blonde hair my roots turned orange.</li>
            <li>The next morning my hair looked relatively the same, maybe a little more brassy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a little off track with my original review, I can tell by my review being helpful to only 1 of 7 people.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not due for an appointment yet.  </li>
            <li>What I wanted was a little less brassiness and for my natural color to blend better with the highlights.</li>
            <li>So,  I have a little knowledge in the art of coloring hair, \\&quot;at home\\&quot;, for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>What this product did was blend the color to even it out and tone down the orange a tiny bit, so it looks less \\&quot;OOPSY\\&quot;, more natural.   </li>
            <li>On a scale from 1-10, 1 being black, and 10 being super blonde, my hair is a 7.</li>
            <li>but my daughter quickly informed me it looked the same but slightly darker.  </li>
            <li>My hair was medium blonde to begin with and really baby fine and thin</li>
            <li>There is still a little bit of orange left but not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Over the past six months, I dyed it four times: the first time a light brown, the second time darker because I wanted a dark chocolate brown, and the other two times the same dark chocolate brown because the color faded fast and to cover my roots since my hair grows quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde and it made my hair darker and the brassyness still there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was born with platinum blonde hair and had that shade until it began darkening in my  early teens.</li>
            <li>Soft, silky, ashy blonde hair!!</li>
            <li>, I barely noticed a difference at all.</li>
            <li>I have waist length hair that I highlight, and following up the highlights with this brings it all together and makes it look natural.</li>
            <li>I went to a salon to have it fixed and after 2 attempts at fixing it I left with darker orangy hair.  </li>
            <li>I impulsively lighten with all over color or with highlights, and my hair has natural red tones.</li>
            <li>(my natural color is white)</li>
            <li>This product took all the yellow/orange out of my hair and left it soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I dyed brown over old red, and the old red keeps sneaking through.  </li>
            <li>This fixed it one hundred percent, leave in ten minutes,!I</li>
            <li>We used a Clarol bleach product that turned her hair first orange than yellow, which we expected.</li>
            <li>I use this on DRY hair, for 30 minutes, after I dye my light brown hair dark ash blonde it turns orange/red/gold even with an ash dye.</li>
            <li>I used it for 40 minutes and that was just about right - especially for dark colored hair tint.  </li>
            <li>I left on 20 minutes and hair was too red when i first rinsed and started to dry!</li>
            <li>I used this product for 15 minutes as recommended by other girls with dark hair, longer than the recommended 5-10 for light haired girls.</li>
            <li>and it usually gets super brassy every time I dye it ,</li>
            <li>However, be forewarned, this is a toner, which means you are putting semi-permanent tone or color onto your hair, which will result in your blonde being subdued somewhat - if you have bright yellow blonde hair, this will tone it down, but in the process you will be going slightly - very slightly but for some its a big deal -  darker blonde.</li>
            <li>It left my fine hair somewhat dry, even when using the little conditioner tube afterward, so I rubbed in some lightweight leave-in conditioner, which helped.</li>
            <li>It did not dull the brass at all, but it did dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>So basically my hair is a hot mess</li>
            <li>Do not leave in for more than five minutes and do not color or do any other processing treatment directly before or after or it will seriously damage your hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely took a lot of the yellow out of my daughter&#x27;s new, home done, blonde.</li>
            <li>It did help to reduce the brass and redness, although a complete change from my formerly red hair was a several stage process.</li>
            <li>My  stylist decided to make the highlights very blended and wide, so the effect was full-on blonde.</li>
            <li>only highlights, since im giving up and plan on going back to my natural color)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a natural red tone to my medium/dark blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I spent the morning high lighting my hair.</li>
            <li>I picked up this product on a whim at my local beauty supply store the other day and wasn&#x27;t expecting much from a box toner.</li>
            <li>and I barely had enough product for what I did.</li>
            <li>Apparently this washes out after a while, but if semi-permanent red dye can stick around in my hair for 7 months, I don&#x27;t imagine this is going anywhere.</li>
            <li>It does darken my highlights a bit for the first few days-</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have thick hair and it took a full 10 min to get it into my hair.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my hair and tones down the brassy look</li>
            <li>DOES REALLY CUT DOWN ON BRASSINESS.</li>
            <li>This does help tone down reds and orange tints in your hair if there is not too much.</li>
            <li>we tried to correct it by dying his hair med ash blonde still red orange color hair... found and used this product and it made his hair worse more red....</li>
            <li>But this really tones down the red tones.</li>
            <li>I have a natural warmth to my hair, no matter how cool of a blonde I buy, and it&#x27;s worse in the summer months with the sun.</li>
            <li>But after a day, the brassiness was much reduced and now there is only a slight reddish tinge.</li>
            <li>This product worked like a dream and it even lifted my black roots a bit so the overall effect is much softer.  </li>
            <li>It really does dry your hair out, but that&#x27;s to be expected since it bleaches the gold tones out of your hair.</li>
            <li>You can use it for between 5 and 10 minutes, but I was a little worried about frying my hair, since I&#x27;ve already put it through so much, so</li>
            <li>and I have long hair, no real mess.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> It worked great!</li>
            <li> was wrong!:)&lt;br /&gt;After 10 minutes of this miracle product on my hair, it looked PERFECT.</li>
            <li> I paid $16 for both products and that saved us a lot of money for that perfect salon look.  </li>
            <li> it is great!</li>
            <li> So although the product says it will work on any hair color, my conclusions are that it will probably work best if anything on blondes.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just great!  </li>

            <li> Well when I did it my darker roots turned a beautiful glowing shade of orange...</li>
            <li> Worked beautifully to reduce the brass of coloring hair blond.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t look like the beautiful hair on the box...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> Also, the conditioner that comes with this product is amazing; it&#x27;s the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I read a couple really great reviews and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li> Keep on longer - 45 to 1 hour but worked great</li>
            <li> great- like apple blossoms.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> My hair looks great</li>
            <li> this is a great product if you dont feel like waiting another 20 min at the salon to have them apply the toner.</li>
            <li> Great for hairÔºÅ</li>
            <li> Used it before and it works great</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the results and will purchase again when I get brassy.</li>
            <li> I could have gone as the Great Pumpkin.</li>
            <li> I decided to go blond again (a decision I make every couple years LOL).</li>
            <li> Fluorescent can look great, for accessories, maybe clothing, but not in hair.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> After I washed it out I applied the conditioner, which is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Works amazing!  </li>
            <li> I ended up with either orange or goldilocks colored hair, depends on your color perception - most attractive!</li>
            <li> I saw the relatively good reviews and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was in good condition as well.  </li>
            <li> And surprisingly for a &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The conditioner is always so soothing and smelled good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m away for school and have yet to find a salon as good as the one I visit at home.</li>
            <li> Most people said anywhere from 30-45 minutes was ideal for anyone seeking to wipe out any yellow/red tones.</li>
            <li> I used Brass Banisher because it had a lot of good reviews</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even smell good or make my hair softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know have beautiful golden curls and the colors are blended beautifully.</li>
            <li> I  was always mixing colors to get that elusive \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; color and had some very humorous occurrences along the way.  </li>
            <li> I used to go to a really nice salon and they used a good toner after they took out my foils.</li>
            <li> The conditioner that comes with the brass banisher is lovely and smells very nice.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> So anyway, the smell is not terrible, but it isn&#x27;t pleasant either.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price, it says not to leave in more than 10 minutes, but i would suggest leaving it in maybe 15 minutes for best results.</li>
            <li> My advice is to call the toll free number on the box if you have any questions, because the people at L&#x27;Oreal are always happy to help.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> It saved me after I tried to highlight my own hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been bleaching my own hair to achieve an ombre look.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but that&#x27;s all I can say for it.</li>
            <li> I do my own hair.</li>
            <li> Great that it works so well for some, but shouldn&#x27;t it work better for most of us?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I took matters into my own hands.</li>
            <li> Checked the time again, and turned on the faucet to apply warm water into a lather like the directions said.  </li>
            <li> would never buy this product again then again, may not ever color my own hair again.</li>
            <li> warm (brassy).</li>
            <li> Note: the preference is a really nice color</li>
            <li> have colored my own hair for over 20 years and have never had a problem.</li>
            <li> NICE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> My highlights look nice but the rest of my hair is a bit brassy.  </li>
            <li> really worked great!</li>
            <li> Honestly I was kind of expecting it to be a lot better, just didn&#x27;t work as good on my hair as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and I washed it after 10 minutes and it looks good.   </li>
            <li> perfect soft &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Every once in a while I get this grand idea to save $100 and color my own hair.</li>
            <li> Instead of taking away warm tones it made the color even more reddish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ok, I used to go to the best salon&#x27;s, then I didn&#x27;t feel well because I am being treated for lyme disease, you get by Tick bites, it often is mistaked for MS or Fibromyalgia (that&#x27;s what they said I had until I sought a specialist, as I live in CA</li>
            <li> This worked great for me and my hair looks shiny and pretty today.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and it does exactly what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> Bright beautiful blonde.</li>
            <li> l used  &#x27;Nice and Easy&#x27; for years then found Loreal permanent color</li>
            <li> can barly notice I made a booboo love it will be getting lots more</li>
            <li> I should have known better.</li>
            <li> She and I, sure...</li>
            <li> No need to go to the salon! :)</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t seem more damaged because of the use of the product.    </li>
            <li> My results were okay, I suppose.  </li>
            <li> Lovely product.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m going to have to find another cure for the copper penny orange on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> now just more damaged.  </li>
            <li> that looks so much better.  </li>
            <li> However, I am glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> It was supposed to be more caramel and honey</li>
            <li> but instead it was more yellows and oranges.</li>
            <li> but it made everything blend together better.</li>
            <li> I love myself in the mirror again</li>
            <li> and I LOVE MY HAIR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> If it does, I will be on auto ship to make sure that I do it everything I do a touch up.   </li>
            <li> We then applied this product to get that \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; blond look and, 20 minutes later after showering it off, her hair is now picture perfect!</li>
            <li> If your hair is yellow after bleaching it and you want to grt that perfect  lond look, then this product is for you.  </li>
            <li> After using the brass banisher most of the orange has been lifted.</li>
            <li> , I actually think 40 mins wouldve been the perfect amount for my hair.</li>
            <li> am giving this product a one star review based on the fact that it made my hair MORE brassy than it was before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Loreal knows how to make hair color, better than most companies.  </li>
            <li> You would think home hair coloring would have progressed more by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; blonde shade which worked the best for me.  </li>
            <li> I should know better than that,  </li>
            <li> It was lovely and silky and shiny before.</li>
            <li> My hair is even better than it was before in every way, color, silkiness, shine and softness like you can&#x27;t believe.  </li>
            <li> I sure am glad I did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Google had the answer - or rather, many, many hair/make-up bloggers had the answer - most people in the know stated what I already suspected: the 10 minute maximum is a marketing ploy to sell efficiency but this product is not a miracle-worker.</li>
            <li> i love this productÔºÅ</li>
            <li> so glad i found itÔºÅ</li>
            <li> I even took before and after photos just so I would be able to tell if there were results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I desire a more ashy shade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible now</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d just prefer it a bit more ash.</li>
            <li> , I love it.</li>
            <li> like it better than the finest salons</li>
            <li> My guess is this is more for people who bleach their hair, which I did not</li>
            <li> The product directions say to leave this on for 10 minutes, but many of the reviews recommended up to 45 minutes</li>
            <li> I waited 2 days to wash my hair after applying and in my opinion it is more red/orange after using this product than it was to begin with.  </li>
            <li> read the reviews saying it needs more than the 5-10 minutes</li>
            <li> out of the shower and no change if anything it made the top layer even brassier.</li>
            <li> but It seems there have been some good success stories with this product</li>
            <li> Was hoping it would get more of the brassiness out of my summer hair</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure when to start timing...</li>
            <li> I might pick up another box in a week or so and repeat and see if I can help some more.    </li>
            <li> At any rate, this product is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> I suspect that leaving this on even longer, 30 to 45 minutes, may have made a more noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> I watched many YouTube reviews and decided to leave it on for 30 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS</li>
            <li> have brunette hair and wanted my highlights to be more</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to use, smells good and the conditioner that comes with</li>
            <li> I applied it to the root area first and waited... and waited... for it to turn that beautiful cool shade.</li>
            <li> I had better results just using a cool toned toner to try and minimize the warm tones.</li>
            <li> (Nice &#x27;n Easy does itch), and it smells fine.</li>
            <li> is a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Super love!</li>
            <li> I used the conditioner, and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a pretty good conditioner.  </li>
            <li> For $8.50, this was pretty good.</li>
            <li> I use Brass Banisher and it comes out looking so natural and beautiful.</li>
            <li> In my bathroom flourescent lighting, it still looks brassy in most spots, except for my bangs, they look pretty good in all light.</li>
            <li> The color always turns out the most beautiful blonde after the two step process and without even a hint of orange/yellow.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t an easy job</li>
            <li> this in one easy 5 minute application does the trick and removes (or covers over, whatever)</li>
            <li> used to use Wella&#x27;s toners but their smell of ammonia is so strong that I had to wear a mask while applying it on my hair.</li>
            <li> My head didn&#x27;t burn, felt kind of tingly and good actually.</li>
            <li> I liked the color, looked at the back with a hand mirror and looked good, even ringlet curls were forming again.  </li>
            <li> I am a beautiful blonde!</li>
            <li> my hair is now a beautiful combination of champagne, honey, and silvery white highlights.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conditioner is nice (not as nice as other reviewers say) and it smells nice</li>
            <li> All I can say is that it was cheap, easy to use, and did the job.</li>
            <li> Blondes, I think it&#x27;ll work just fine.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and light brown</li>
            <li> It turned the brassy color into a slightly lighter color, made it look more like highlights then bright brassy roots!</li>
            <li> Got the bright yellow look out of my bleached hair without turning any of it gray like many ash blondes and toners have done to me before.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a huge difference, but you could see my roots.</li>
            <li> This is huge, ladies.</li>
            <li> I just looked cheap and fake-blonde.</li>
            <li> Worked great at removing yellow and brassy tones.</li>
            <li> its cheap</li>
            <li> I used Wella T14 the next day and got great results.</li>
            <li> The bottom line is that this product requires more time, but it is worth it to get the results you&#x27;re after.  </li>
            <li> I bought a cheap box hair color and thought I could fix my roots all by myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so good for hair and soft, silky, shiny condition as well as</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> so I went to a salon to have more of my natural colour added so it would blend nicely as it grew out.</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing!!!</li>
            <li> This product is perfect to tone down the warm (yellow, orange shades) and gives hair a more \\&quot;cool\\&quot; tone.  </li>
            <li> If you try this, if you have a ton of brass like me, I suggest leaving it on for greater than 30 minutes as long as your hair is kind of healthy.  </li>
            <li> but there are people who have much more fine/porous hair and the result will be gray, so if there are any doubts, please test a swatch of your hair first, per the directions</li>
            <li> Just for that alone it was all worth it!</li>
            <li> that is when I began to coloring my hair, and that of about every girl on my block, gaining useful knowledge in the art of hair color, at their expense!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Later in life I owned a beauty salon until I realized I could make more money in Real Estate!  </li>
            <li> On top of it, the rest of my hair was darker and more natural looking.</li>
            <li> Used up the entire bottle, then made sure it was nice and saturated, while watching for color change.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m quite fair to begin with so roots aren&#x27;t really a concern) and after a very outdoorsy summer, I was seeing a LOT of brass.</li>
            <li> When i came across this product I didn&#x27;t have high hopes but figured it was worth a try, better than paying $200 for a salon to fix it!</li>
            <li> I had perfectly fine highlights in my naturally golden brown hair.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right almost  $10.00 for NOTHING!</li>
            <li> RIGHT NOW!</li>
            <li> my roots are still brassy and it turned my bright blonde highlights duller.</li>
            <li> BRIGHT red and</li>
            <li> I always get orange when I try and bleach my hair but this time I had some bright yellow also.</li>
            <li> my &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; toner after frosting and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d use it again if my hair was brassy, but if I heard good things about another product, I&#x27;d be just as likely to try that one as well.</li>
            <li> Not at all recommended or impressed with in the least.</li>
            <li> some reason and when I use this and leave on full 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Back in the  60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s the color was not as good.  </li>
            <li> my hair was to that shade where I could get it to the \\&quot;perfect  platinum &#x27;blonde\\&quot;, IF, I used the Dream Blonde color, in the light ash blonde shade!  </li>
            <li> the outer top layer that is exposed to sun a lot gets very brassy and I have yet to find something that helps get rid of brassy hair.</li>
            <li> so i left it in for a good 30</li>
            <li> I chose to double the time after reading reviews where people did leave this on longer than 10 minutes and got good results.  </li>
            <li> So for me this product is a dream come true</li>
            <li> but there are absolutely no bad effects.</li>
            <li> I folowed up by using Nice N Easy&#x27;s 8A Medium Ash Blonde the day after and that did the trick.</li>
            <li> Rinse felt good, condition really nice turned off the water, applied a towel and dried first...</li>
            <li> Luckily I had planned ahead and had bought a box of this, and it worked wonders.</li>
            <li> Works super well.  </li>
            <li> so I initially tried to apply it using the bottle but quickly removed the bottle top and poured it into my gloved hands and applied it that way, which I found quicker and more thorough.  </li>
            <li> excellent product, have used in past, works exactly as promised</li>
            <li> Creates an amazing ashy ultra light blonde tone.</li>
            <li> After all the reviews on YouTube I didn&#x27;t have high hopes, but still I thought anything could be better than having orange hair.   </li>
            <li> I was very nervous about using this because I&#x27;d gathered from multiple reviews that this product works best on natural blonds.  </li>
            <li> the exact color is Loreal Preference Light Brown-</li>
            <li> Works great, definitely removes blond yellow and leaves hair more evenly toned.</li>
            <li> Also works very fast!  </li>
            <li> The orange-yellow is much more subdued but at the expense of losing my lovely bright blonde highlights and my hair feels dry!</li>
            <li> My hair looks a lot more natural now and it got the job done!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Brass Banisher is ABSOLUTELY terrifc!!</li>
            <li> this product toned them down very nicely.</li>
            <li> I have medium/dark brown hair (straight, shoulder-length, fine).</li>
            <li> It looked very orange at my roots and bright yellow on the rest.  </li>
            <li> The ash shades really turned out gray, the golden shades were bright yellow and the beige shades pinkish.</li>
            <li> I left it on for 10 minutes, and instead of orange, my hair is now a nice beige.</li>
            <li> I suppose some of it looks &amp;#34;caramel&amp;#34; colored, and the even color does look more professional.</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural look again and healthy hair.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed the nice beigy blonde and get compliments for&lt;br /&gt;my hair.</li>
            <li> but this wasn&#x27;t as powerful as it needed to be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the dough.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, my color rarely showed a tint of gray except the  times  </li>
            <li> It kind of works , but if you did a big &amp;#34;ooops&amp;#34; on your hair I wouldn&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> so perhaps it works better on natural blondes.</li>
            <li> It comes with gloves which is nice and a packet of deep conditioner to use afterwards.</li>
            <li> My hair was a nice beige medium blonde color.</li>
            <li> I am going from blonde to my own gray.  </li>
            <li> I usually use L&#x27;Oreal color, but I couldn&#x27;t find the color I wanted, so I picked a Nice &#x27;n Easy light auburn.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on Amazon and then, I decided to call L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s help line to ask if this was the right product for me.</li>
            <li> I just got it in the mail and tried it right away.</li>
            <li> It is certainly worth the money and does a good job toning down the brass.</li>
            <li> Right now, my hair is brown with blond highlights but too much summer fun turned my highlights into a ghastly, brassy mess, especially right on top of my head.  </li>
            <li> The most important thing to remember, however, is don&#x27;t leave it on too long!</li>
            <li> I had achieved a perfect slowly transitioning look, with very light blond on the bottom that eased into my dark natural color on top.</li>
            <li> the conditioner this comes with is not bad it really moisturized well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li> It did blend the grey nicely and softened the hair.</li>
            <li> I always buy  the \\&quot;extra light ash\\&quot; or \\&quot;light ash\\</li>
            <li> It is quite possible that this is intended for someone with very light hair to begin with.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this made my hair any darker, it just made my hair more of a light ash blonde instead of like a light \\&quot;golden\\&quot; blonde.  </li>
            <li> I very much regret using this product and as it was Loreal haircolor</li>
            <li> You better off go to salon or try some other remedies, such as purple shampoo or, even better, for the price - re-color your hair into brass free ash or blond if you want to stay away from redness.</li>
            <li> I barely (if at all?) noticed ANY difference after using Brass Banisher; was certainly hoping for-- and expecting more.</li>
            <li> because I was so far from my original hair color, it was not the right product for me and it wouldn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this it was about $8.  </li>
            <li> about Legally Blonde&#x27;s comment - not everybody can leave it on for more than 10 min.  </li>
            <li> (roots first, followed by lengths.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I tried to get all of my hair coated evenly, then I let it sit for 10 min.</li>
            <li> I bleach the top layer of my hair regularly...</li>
            <li> Thanks L&#x27;Oreal!</li>
            <li> First time I dyed my hair at home</li>
            <li> Here is the funny story.</li>
            <li> I made sure I got ALL the roots and tiny hairs that the stylists seem to always ignore.  </li>
            <li> And it saved us a pretty penny, too.</li>
            <li> Obviously getting my hair glazed at the salon looks better (costs like $40 though).</li>
            <li> I will make sure I have a box of this on hand before lightening my hair in the future.</li>
            <li> I have natural light brown hair</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 boxes and with the first try I followed all the directions.</li>
            <li> took the yellow tones out of my hair, was safe to use and did no damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has been many shades of light blonde since I began coloring it, but has not been my natural shade in over 40 years.  </li>
            <li> and then I decide to pre-lighten my hair and do a two step process to get my hair to a more platinum blonde shade.</li>
            <li> But... I decided to use this product first, to see what it would do this time.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first but the orange was driving me bonkers</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> I suggest getting 1 more bottle than you think you will need and then if you don&#x27;t use it you have some for next time.</li>
            <li> This was my first time to try this</li>
            <li> It actually made my hair more brassy.  </li>
            <li> but my hair seems drier from the solution, I&#x27;m worried I did damage to my hair for exactly zero results.</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought Brass Banisher and the \\&quot;purple shampoo\\&quot; and decided to banish first.  </li>
            <li> But the red is gone which is what bothered me the most.</li>
            <li> I still wish I had more brown left in my hair.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bleach it first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, the product works pretty well.</li>
            <li> i used the product and unfortunately, no change to the brassiness.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> My hair is a richer color now, more deep tones and not a bit of orange to be found.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and it turned the first few inches of my hair a BRIGHT, brassy orange-red.</li>
            <li> I lighten my hair a lot, so it was already pretty damaged, but it definitely got noticeably more damaged after this application.</li>
            <li> my hair more of a solid blended tone.  </li>
            <li> Always read the box first people.</li>
            <li> Ok so this will not give you the results you want if you&#x27;re trying to bring your yellow gold bleached hair to platinum.  </li>
            <li> It will however even out your blonde and give it a believable tone.</li>
            <li> and I seem to have even more red tones to my hair.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews, I took their advice and left it on the FULL 10 minutes, 10 more, then 30 minutes, okay...</li>
            <li> I have taken to coloring my own hair every other color.</li>
            <li> My hair looks much better a couple shades lighter than my natural light to medium brown and grey color.</li>
            <li> I bought this product looking for a more natural look because even though I dyed it a medium cool brown, there were still a lot of orange/red shades within it, especially visible in the sun.</li>
            <li> It took several treatments of various types to arrive at the shade I wanted, but this was a pretty good step on the way.</li>
            <li> It took my orange and yellow highlights and tamed them perfectly to a nice natural color.  </li>
            <li> The last time I did it, I added highlights to the top of my head, which came out very orange and brassy.</li>
            <li> BUT, it took away months of slowly bleaching my hair to the lightest blond I had achieved AND the top of my head is even more brassy and now it is an all over tone.</li>
            <li> I liked it in the salon especially the way she fixed it</li>
            <li> Several of the highlights on top were very brassy which I didn&#x27;t like at all.</li>
            <li> It completely took out the unwanted orangey yellows and gave me  more natural honey blondes and creamy beiges.</li>
            <li> Started in front, the sides and back, and back really really good.  </li>
            <li> My hair came out super soft despite the fact that I did dye it the day before AND used a toner afterwords, so my hair was beaten up and crunchy before Brass Banisher&#x27;s conditioner!</li>
            <li> It also makes your hair super shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> Too cheap to go back and have it redone right now.</li>
            <li> I applied Brass Banisher on my roots first and then continued on to saturate the whole lenght of my hair.</li>
            <li> When it dried, it was significantly lighter and much more orange than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I took the other back and got this one instead.  </li>
            <li> It is scarey for sure and even more so for a newbie at it, but I will learn and so will you, but start with the brass banisher and then if need be the hair color remover and stay away from amonia products when you don&#x27;t need to use them and others like Color silk are available.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty much platinum hair</li>
            <li> It probably would be a good product if your hair is very yellow-orange as anything would look better than that, but I am sad</li>
            <li> It did tone it a bit but no more than a good lather with purple shampoo did.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it took down the brassiness a notch...</li>
            <li> My hair looks exactly the same as it did before this treatment which is super brassy!</li>
            <li> it gives it liftÔºå bounceÔºå lifeÔºå energyÔºå and feels not as dry and more plyableÔºÅ</li>
            <li> Let my hair air dry as to not do more damage to the ends from blow drying again.    </li>
            <li> , however I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s like a regular toner because it didn&#x27;t seem as strong as the toners Sally&#x27;s sells.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have liked a little less of a warm tint in my hair, but I can&#x27;t complain because I didn&#x27;t use it for 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t change the color of blonde in my hair from my previous highlight on any of the hair it did touch or my bangs, so I was happy with that as I have read some people complain of darker hair.  </li>
            <li> When I color it myself with a blonde from the super market my hair always looks lighter but more of an orange-blonde than a blonde.</li>
            <li> it was relatively healthy but after using this it feels very dry.  </li>
            <li> First, I should say I had high expectations for this product and went into it hoping for a miracle.</li>
            <li> I am naturally light brown but color my hair medium blonde, still very brassy after leaving the product on for the specified time.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have redhair that get&#x27;s really brassy in the Summer.</li>
            <li> This really does work.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of bleaching my hair with a really cheap bleach, that left my hair ORANGE.</li>
            <li> I was really torn when writing this review, but at the end of the day, this product did not at all do what it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> It was still very orange and brassy...</li>
            <li> Much to my dismay</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Some of my highlights looked really brassy when I got them done 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t really do as much as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> A tip, though.. don&#x27;t hesitate to put this all over your hair-- don&#x27;t spare your roots because it has very even coverage.</li>
            <li> It really messed up my hair too.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t work for me much at all.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;was&#x27; a light blonde, and therefore, I would &#x27;always be&#x27; a light blonde.  </li>
            <li> This product and the hair color remover have peroxide and they were totally gentle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very cautious.  </li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t really change my hair at all.</li>
            <li> HAHA.</li>
            <li> and it cant make it much</li>
            <li> and when I washed it out I really didnt feel like this did anything to help the brassy unnatural tones that were showing on my hair</li>
            <li> Its cheap enough to try again, if nothing else</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much softer looking now.</li>
            <li> thanks to the evening out of tone this product did.</li>
            <li> it changed the color too much.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do much for me at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still very orange.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s Halloween time but get real</li>
            <li> you really need something that helps with the brassiness</li>
            <li> highly recommend though..!</li>
            <li> My orange color was very severe</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t give you even light ashy blonde.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I left it on for that long</li>
            <li> My nice white highlights actually seem brassier now.&lt;br /&gt;Need</li>
            <li> It has made my hair a more natural looking blonde.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s more of a glaze than a total color, there was almost no mess.</li>
            <li> and I think in the end it made it easy to get me back to a normal color.</li>
            <li> The effects are subtle but important - my blonde looks a lot more natural now even though I&#x27;m sporting roots - it looks like it was bleached out more by the sun than by a bottle,</li>
            <li> Seriously, how many &#x27;blonding&#x27; products, of any kind, work properly in 10 minutes?!  </li>
            <li> My other point about this product is that it should work better and not wash out in a couple of washings.  </li>
            <li> I use this product in conjunction with L&#x27;Oreal Les Blondessimes Extra Light Natural Blond, and it gives me the exact shade of medium gold that I like.  </li>
            <li> Both products do essentially the same job, but Brass Banisher seems to be more nourishing for the hair, leaving it soft with a super glassy shine.  </li>
            <li> I combed gently, head wasn&#x27;t sore, comb slid through my hair just fine, not all dry or brittle.  </li>
            <li> My hair is still soft and shiny and looks pretty much like it does when I leave the salon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Brass Banisher before to calm down the gold of lighter shades, so I made my way to Walmart for this fantastic product!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought John Frieda Lightening Spray, used it 3 times, lightened to what looked like a nice golden color...was outside a few days in a row in the sun w/o a hat on...instead of going blonder it got orange/red/brassy, so unnatural looking</li>
            <li> when it first touches your hair, or when you are completely done.</li>
            <li> It lightens it about a shade: from red to gold, gold to neutral and neutral to cool.</li>
            <li> I am a pale beigey blonde, very fair skintone, with blue eyes.  </li>
            <li> I could see that it helped, but maybe next time I should leave it on for the full 10 minutes since I still had some brassy areas.  </li>
            <li> the back, darker, but not bad at all</li>
            <li> My natural color is medium brown with red and gold highlights--now turning gray--and it&#x27;s also fine, so what works for one person may not work for another.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m much happier with my new look now</li>
            <li> My roots are still slightly brassier than the rest of my hair, but it&#x27;s not horribly noticeable and with purple shampoo</li>
            <li> I would notice some orangey/yellow tint at times and even then, it was slight and mostly at the roots.</li>
            <li> My natural hair is a light brown/auburn strawberry blonde color.</li>
            <li> I believe it works on reddish super blonde hair, but not anything darker.</li>
            <li> It definitely took out (most of) the brass color from my (colored) blonde and highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> and I got a lot of compliments, but the second time I colored it, it seemed more red.</li>
            <li> I use quick blue and 40% for 10 mintues.</li>
            <li> it left my hair undamaged but also unchanged, if anything the yellow became more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t start timing it until I had applied the entire bottle, and then I left it on for about 15 more minutes.  </li>
            <li> Also I find toning my hair makes it feel healthier, which is the main reason I did it.  </li>
            <li> For a quick fix of an off tone blonde this will work.</li>
            <li> I recently lightened it by just one shade and the red tones were made more pronounced.</li>
            <li> I have a very pretty blonde color now</li>
            <li> Highly reccommend this product.  </li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> And the high moisture conditioner that it comes with made my hair so shiny that it looks like I just got out of the salon and got a color treatment and a haircut, while, in fact, I cut my hair 6 months</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it if you want to get the brassiness out of your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling brassiness for some time and wonder if it may have something to do with  high chlorine/mineral content in the water in Atlanta.  </li>
            <li> Just used the product, and took ALL my high lights out .</li>
            <li> I also left it on for 25 minutes, washed it with purple toning shampoo afterward and before using the included conditioner (which is amazing), then let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li> I was just making sure to get all of the product out because, like I said, it was a little bit like glue.  </li>
            <li> For many years, with few exceptions,  I have used a one step blonding process which has made my hair a very pretty , \\&quot;cool\\&quot; , blonde.  </li>
            <li> My eyes never burned, I did put the fan on, was a little runnier than color, but ok</li>
            <li> but if you want to get the orangy tint out of your blonde, go get a blonde boxed dye and add ardell red gold color corrector, much better and softer results and doesn&#x27;t smell so offensive!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle, just hoping for a little more debrassing.  </li>
            <li> This Brass Banisher is just to take out brassiness from blonde hair that has either been freshly bleached and is too brassy or that needs a little refreshing and blending.</li>
            <li> after was left with bright orange roots not cute</li>
            <li> but once I was home it looked very stripey and not as natural as I had wanted.</li>
            <li> no where near what i really wanted.  </li>
            <li> Still not my natural color, but I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to be.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product, but after using it for three differet times, Each time has been great.</li>
            <li> I liked the level of the color, which is dark blonde (I don&#x27;t want it lighter)</li>
            <li> I helped my wife bleach her hair to get that Platinum look and to save the $200 she would normally spend doing it at the salon.</li>
            <li> It really was a pretty blonde</li>
            <li> If you are already blonde and sort of golden (like me) but looking for that fresh-from-the-salon ashy tone, 25 minutes should do the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In natural light my crown looks much better, only reddish in a few spots, but my hair has some natural reds in it anyway, so  </li>
            <li> I normally get my hair colored almost platinum at the salon</li>
            <li> After a couple of days, it all wore off and my hair went right back to its orangy/brassy glory.</li>
            <li> You prob don&#x27;t want to do this right before a big date...</li>
            <li> almost worked...quite a bit turned the right shade but there was also a lot of baby chick yellow.</li>
            <li> I thought, now, I would do a quick review , just of this product, without the long story which I was inspired to write before.  </li>
            <li> So, yellow top, normal but VERY dry ends.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use as the mixture becomes thick enough to not be drippy which makes the whole process simple and clean.  </li>
            <li> We live and learn I suppose, and I have learned not to use this product again.</li>
            <li> Toned down the yellow and orange tones in my highlights - highlights now have a nice, natural look.  </li>
            <li> This is a good toner to help get the &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; out of your blonde;  however, I&#x27;ve had to leave it on at least 20 minutes to see results as opposed to the 5 or 10 minutes the instructions recommend.</li>
            <li> It only takes 10 minutes, but I would prefer if I could use it right in with the color for a one-step treatment like my old Clairol toner used to.  </li>
            <li> but I found the boxed products at the drug store are just as good, if, a little more expensive.  </li>
            <li> , my hair looks exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I probably could&#x27;ve done with only one, but I did use maybe a 1/4 of the second box just to make sure I saturated my ends enough.</li>
            <li> Please, bring back &#x27;Dream Blonde&#x27;, ash shades  or create something better to take the brassiness out of blonde hair</li>
            <li> Long review, but worth reading - promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any other product that better helps prevent brassy or yellowish tones in home-applied color-treated blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> This was the first and only product i found that claimed to do just that.</li>
            <li> Since I couldn&#x27;t make time to get it colored the usual way, I did what so many women before me</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;d really be better off lightening it yourself again at home, especially because this color does essentially the same thing.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown with many platinum highlights that naturally go red with my normal pigmentation.</li>
            <li> and it was a pretty nice shade of dark gold with just a few orangey hints that still bugged me</li>
            <li> , like it use to be only less and the top of my head and sides were orange free, my blonde was back.  </li>
            <li> have naturally black brown hair and has dyed it a light brown auburn.</li>
            <li> Also, if you&#x27;ve got a lot of yellow or orange in your hair from a recent dye, don&#x27;t hesitate to leave it on for the full 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about damage, but even though I have fine hair</li>
            <li> This time I feel that that I was deceived by numerous positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I wiped it off my skin with cool water whenever I touched it and it must have come right off, because there was no staining on my skin and only a little bit on the washcloth.</li>
            <li> I finally decided I wanted to be blonde again instead of having to keep dying since my roots come in so quickly, and so I used a product that takes the dyed color out of your hair.  </li>
            <li> The darkness washed out over a few weeks, which is fine with me.</li>
            <li> It did turn out a pretty,  neutral, pale blonde but still had more yellow than the I wanted.  </li>
            <li> No stranger to hair coloring disasters myself and allergic to high salon prices, I read directions carefully no matter</li>
            <li> The directions say to rinse until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li> Well the water was never running anything but clear.</li>
            <li> It also left my hair very shiny and soft, and the conditioner that came with</li>
            <li> Brass Banisher really does get rid of the brassy color that sometimes occurs with blonde hair color products.  </li>
            <li> After washing it out, my hair was a truer ash blonde but my roots were still very brassy.</li>
            <li> and it looks so natural and</li>
            <li> I use this stuff and in just ten minutes it pulls so much of the gold tones.</li>
            <li> I will still leave the long version here, for those of you who are interested in &#x27;plowing through it&#x27;.</li>
            <li> In fact, I called Clairol once about one of their drug store shades and asked which shade it was in their professional line and was told there was none.  </li>
            <li> but no where near what I hoped to achieve.</li>
            <li> I have well water which turns my blonde hair very brassy over time and</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use it as frequently as I should I sometimes have to do 2 applications 2 days in a row</li>
            <li> This same product is in Walmart for $9.. can&#x27;t believe people are trying to sell it for as much as they are..</li>
            <li> it is noted to be on the Natural Scale, so it should not have turned so...</li>
            <li> ]WOW</li>
            <li> I have naturally medium brown hair fyi</li>
            <li> Very brassy and red.  </li>
            <li> I left it on for 45 minutes and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something in it that I was allergic to and after taking my hair out of the towel, the fumes caused an allergic reaction that caused my eyes to swell completely shut.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars only because it didn&#x27;t really do any damage.</li>
            <li> Worked really well at getting rid of orange and yellow brassiness from my bleached hair.</li>
            <li> After coloring my hair with a honey blonde dye from naturtint, I was left with light blonde hair with an orange tint.</li>
            <li> This product definitely didn&#x27;t fix the whole problem but it did soften the orange</li>
            <li> Wish they would pay for me to have it fixed.</li>
            <li> I had platinum blonde dyed hair with an ash blonde low light through.</li>
            <li> My blonde hair was still brassy, didn&#x27;t really look like I had did anything to fix it.</li>
            <li> I have natural reddish hair...</li>
            <li> Sometimes I touch up my roots and highlights between professional appts.  </li>
            <li> I then looked at more reviews and ran across a few saying that it worked for them if you left it in longer than directed.</li>
            <li> the deep conditioner was prob worth ten bucks alone.  </li>
            <li> It was super easy to use--I would do it again and definitely recommend it to other natural dark brunettes.</li>
            <li> After bleaching my natural medium blond hair that had light platinum highlights, using Loreal&#x27;s Super Blolne my hair turned a deep orange, brassy color (very scary for me :) ) especially at the roots.</li>
            <li> But once i dried and used flat iron hair was nice even blonde.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and makes your hair not only much less brassy but also shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Yep, my hair was dry, I did this exactly as advised on the package</li>
            <li> The first color that I saw on my blonde hair after the banisher was a kind of green, after a few days is just blond</li>
            <li> I had read that this Brass Banisher tones really light hair a darker color, but I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be dramatic and that it would be worth it to remove the orange tones.</li>
            <li> Now the red is gone; my hair is more of dark brown with blonde highlights (reflections?)</li>
            <li> after I dried it, I did decide that I like the color, but it is not as light blonde as I normally like it to be.</li>
            <li> it IS worth the cost of this product alone as other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was more than enough product, and the red is definitely far less in my hair than it was.</li>
            <li> I am naturally dark/medium brown and take my hair down to light blonde.</li>
            <li> I then apply the permanent hair color in \\&quot;extra light ash blonde \\&quot;  after it is dry .  </li>
            <li> So, about six months ago, I dyed my naturally light ash blonde hair to a dark brown.  </li>
            <li> Used this after &amp;#34;high-lift&amp;#34;- from dark brown to light blonde.</li>
            <li> So I tried to be cheap and dye my hair from medium brown to dark blonde and of course it turned orangy.  </li>
            <li> It also left it very soft!</li>
            <li> this takes the yellow out of home processed color jobs and saves a lot of money from high salon prices</li>
            <li> The brassy top and roots are a little lighted beige, and the rest it a tiny bit darker, but it&#x27;s the same color everywhere</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably use two boxes though to really saturate my long hair, that&#x27;s below my shoulder blades.</li>
            <li> It specifically states it will remove red/orange/yellow tints from color treated hair, but not dark hair.</li>
            <li> have strawberry blonde hair and after my last coloring, it became very brassy, so I decided to try this.</li>
            <li> It became cool dark blonde.</li>
            <li> I ended up finally deciding to go to my stylist and get it all fixed professionally.</li>
            <li> I decided to wait  a few days to apply the \\&quot;Dream Blonde\\&quot; light ash blonde.</li>
            <li> since I only used the peroxide spray on my roots and bangs, I only really applied this Brass Banisher to those areas as well.</li>
            <li> For someone who wants a white blonde look, this is not the product for you</li>
            <li> I do have faint gold highlights - which looks good, actually.  </li>
            <li> Had my hair highlighted, but my stylist didnt apply a toner to cool down some of the yellow on my tips.</li>
            <li> After trying to lighten my dark blonde hair to ultra light blonde hair my roots turned orange.</li>
            <li> The next morning my hair looked relatively the same, maybe a little more brassy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a little off track with my original review, I can tell by my review being helpful to only 1 of 7 people.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not due for an appointment yet.  </li>
            <li> What I wanted was a little less brassiness and for my natural color to blend better with the highlights.</li>
            <li> So,  I have a little knowledge in the art of coloring hair, \\&quot;at home\\&quot;, for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> What this product did was blend the color to even it out and tone down the orange a tiny bit, so it looks less \\&quot;OOPSY\\&quot;, more natural.   </li>
            <li> On a scale from 1-10, 1 being black, and 10 being super blonde, my hair is a 7.</li>
            <li> but my daughter quickly informed me it looked the same but slightly darker.  </li>
            <li> My hair was medium blonde to begin with and really baby fine and thin</li>
            <li> There is still a little bit of orange left but not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Over the past six months, I dyed it four times: the first time a light brown, the second time darker because I wanted a dark chocolate brown, and the other two times the same dark chocolate brown because the color faded fast and to cover my roots since my hair grows quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde and it made my hair darker and the brassyness still there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was born with platinum blonde hair and had that shade until it began darkening in my  early teens.</li>
            <li> Soft, silky, ashy blonde hair!!</li>
            <li> , I barely noticed a difference at all.</li>
            <li> I have waist length hair that I highlight, and following up the highlights with this brings it all together and makes it look natural.</li>
            <li> I went to a salon to have it fixed and after 2 attempts at fixing it I left with darker orangy hair.  </li>
            <li> I impulsively lighten with all over color or with highlights, and my hair has natural red tones.</li>
            <li> (my natural color is white)</li>
            <li> This product took all the yellow/orange out of my hair and left it soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I dyed brown over old red, and the old red keeps sneaking through.  </li>
            <li> This fixed it one hundred percent, leave in ten minutes,!I</li>
            <li> We used a Clarol bleach product that turned her hair first orange than yellow, which we expected.</li>
            <li> I use this on DRY hair, for 30 minutes, after I dye my light brown hair dark ash blonde it turns orange/red/gold even with an ash dye.</li>
            <li> I used it for 40 minutes and that was just about right - especially for dark colored hair tint.  </li>
            <li> I left on 20 minutes and hair was too red when i first rinsed and started to dry!</li>
            <li> I used this product for 15 minutes as recommended by other girls with dark hair, longer than the recommended 5-10 for light haired girls.</li>
            <li> and it usually gets super brassy every time I dye it ,</li>
            <li> However, be forewarned, this is a toner, which means you are putting semi-permanent tone or color onto your hair, which will result in your blonde being subdued somewhat - if you have bright yellow blonde hair, this will tone it down, but in the process you will be going slightly - very slightly but for some its a big deal -  darker blonde.</li>
            <li> It left my fine hair somewhat dry, even when using the little conditioner tube afterward, so I rubbed in some lightweight leave-in conditioner, which helped.</li>
            <li> It did not dull the brass at all, but it did dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> So basically my hair is a hot mess</li>
            <li> Do not leave in for more than five minutes and do not color or do any other processing treatment directly before or after or it will seriously damage your hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely took a lot of the yellow out of my daughter&#x27;s new, home done, blonde.</li>
            <li> It did help to reduce the brass and redness, although a complete change from my formerly red hair was a several stage process.</li>
            <li> My  stylist decided to make the highlights very blended and wide, so the effect was full-on blonde.</li>
            <li> only highlights, since im giving up and plan on going back to my natural color)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a natural red tone to my medium/dark blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I spent the morning high lighting my hair.</li>
            <li> I picked up this product on a whim at my local beauty supply store the other day and wasn&#x27;t expecting much from a box toner.</li>
            <li> and I barely had enough product for what I did.</li>
            <li> Apparently this washes out after a while, but if semi-permanent red dye can stick around in my hair for 7 months, I don&#x27;t imagine this is going anywhere.</li>
            <li> It does darken my highlights a bit for the first few days-</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick hair and it took a full 10 min to get it into my hair.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my hair and tones down the brassy look</li>
            <li> DOES REALLY CUT DOWN ON BRASSINESS.</li>
            <li> This does help tone down reds and orange tints in your hair if there is not too much.</li>
            <li> we tried to correct it by dying his hair med ash blonde still red orange color hair... found and used this product and it made his hair worse more red....</li>
            <li> But this really tones down the red tones.</li>
            <li> I have a natural warmth to my hair, no matter how cool of a blonde I buy, and it&#x27;s worse in the summer months with the sun.</li>
            <li> But after a day, the brassiness was much reduced and now there is only a slight reddish tinge.</li>
            <li> This product worked like a dream and it even lifted my black roots a bit so the overall effect is much softer.  </li>
            <li> It really does dry your hair out, but that&#x27;s to be expected since it bleaches the gold tones out of your hair.</li>
            <li> You can use it for between 5 and 10 minutes, but I was a little worried about frying my hair, since I&#x27;ve already put it through so much, so</li>
            <li> and I have long hair, no real mess.  </li>
            <li> I recently dyed my dark blonde roots using a new brand (big mistake!)</li>
            <li> but that is a small downside for such long lasting positive effects!</li>
            <li> After 60 minutes of bleaching my hair was still yellow as usual, but after a 10 minute application of brass banisher the yellow had turned into a nice, slightly beige, pale blond.</li>
            <li> Once I left blonde on too long and it turned orangey and yellow..</li>
            <li> I have used temporary and permanent dye in the past and overall consider myself very informed and knowledgable on hair dye based on a lot of at home experience.</li>
            <li> hair is a medium dark blonde naturally,  I would say, (according to my roots), with white/gray hair emerging now.</li>
            <li> My natural color is a dark blonde/light brown with a red tint and</li>
            <li> It took ALL of the brass away, left with a slightly darker natural color blond with subtler highlights.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian with naturally jet black hair that has zero red/brown tones.  </li>
            <li> My natural hair color is about level 2 (dark brown).</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough</li>
            <li> Had to have been not leaving in long enough because not a damn thing changed in regards to brassy color.</li>
            <li> I left it on way too long and even then</li>
            <li> But this product, after left on twice as long as suggested (20 minutes)</li>
            <li> My ash blonde hair was getting a little brassy, both the natural parts and the highlighted parts.</li>
            <li> The consistency is kind of like glue, and it was a little difficult for me to spread.  </li>
            <li> As far as banishing any brass it was a total waste of time and money</li>
            <li> even my professional stylist has trouble getting parts of it to turn blonde instead of orange- it can take hours.</li>
            <li> Now tired of the high maintenance blonde I wanted to grow it out naturally</li>
            <li> I bought this product after I got my hair professionally dyed to an \\&quot;ash blonde\\&quot; but in reality it was just a brassy mess.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blame the highlights; as my dark red is color treated over already naturally red-toned hair, I expected my highlights to need some toning.  </li>
            <li> I recently used brass banisher after bleaching the bottom half of my hair (ombre hair) was left with a orangey blonde tint.</li>
            <li> Only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because like other reviewers I left product on for 25-30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 stars, though I suppose I&#x27;d say like 3 and a half, really if I could do half stars.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend purchasing 2 boxes if your hair is past your shoulders.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is very dark brown.</li>
            <li> I left it on until it most of the ugly yellow was gone.  </li>
            <li> I added highlights which turned out beautifully bright and added lowlights (mistakenly used an ash base and they turned out golden-orange).</li>
            <li> I have dark blonde hair that I&#x27;ve highlighed very blonde over the years.</li>
            <li> I am naturally a medium brunette and have had my hair bleach blonde for the past couple years.</li>
            <li> My ombre is not nearly as noticeable.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of thinking this would work for any hair color as long as it contained brassiness.</li>
            <li> I have long medium brown hair that was ombre to the ends until this week.  </li>
            <li> I know I wasn&#x27;t supposed to use it that long,</li>
            <li> Dried off my hair, silky, shiny so so soft.  </li>
            <li> I had color stripped my hair and came up with yellow hair (which was expected).</li>
            <li> Have extremely sensitive skin and had zero trouble with the product</li>
            <li> In the process of going grey.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to use this in a long time, but when I was experimenting with hair colors</li>
            <li> but it toned down the yellows and oranges nicely in only ten minutes.</li>
            <li> I am mixed race and went from red to black to bleaching my hair.</li>
            <li> I used this with such high hopes and it made the matters worse, so now I have overall orange hair.</li>
            <li> I simply wanted not to have to highlight every other month.  </li>
            <li> Other toners leave violet or gray tones, but this just took out the yellow and left my expected hair color!  </li>
            <li> Hair color has come a long way since then, thank goodness!  </li>
            <li> I would say it lifted about 5% of the yellow - in other words</li>
            <li> I have asked several other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how long it would have taken if I did my ends too!</li>
            <li> I left it on for 40 minutes like other reviewers said.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions very carefully and left the treament in for 7-8 mins.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> It looks slightly less bright in some places, but where it was the worst, the very front crown, there was no difference.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it&#x27;s definitely not the worst smelling of products that I&#x27;ve used on my hair, so I can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li> But once I had washed it out, conditioned my hair and blew it dry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t take chances on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I did follow one reviewers advice and use the product for much longer than the ridiculous time of 5 minutes recommended by the instructions.  </li>
            <li> After my hair is dry, I can smell something on it still...smells like I just came home from the salon.  </li>
            <li> I did what the directions told me to do, applied even on dry hair, wait 5</li>
            <li> it did leave my hair dry</li>
            <li> I was determined then that I would not live with \\&quot;dishwater blonde\\&quot; hair and</li>
            <li> It also toned down some of the base red in my hair, leaving it with more of a natural tone.  </li>
            <li> After I decided to go back to brown after various shades of red, some of the pesky hard to get rid of color shone through.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works well, too bad the excess can&#x27;t be stored for later use.&lt;br /&gt; Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The hair dye that I use lightens up my hair to the level 7, I think (dark blonde).</li>
            <li> Removed all the red from what should have not turned out to be dark reddish brown hair.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m naturally dark blonde.)</li>
            <li> Highlighting my dark red hair led to fluorescent orange.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it bring down the tone all over</li>
            <li> It did not darken my hair just simply toned down the orange.</li>
            <li> For days I had used all sorts of homemade remedies that only toned down some.  </li>
            <li> But even so, it toned down my yellow hair and got the brassiness out.  </li>
            <li> I had recently lightened my hair and was using purple shampoo to tone down the brassiness</li>
            <li> I recently lightened my dark blonde hair, that had even darker roots, needless to say my roots were looking pretty brassy.</li>
            <li> There are significantly less red tones in my hair after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my hair looked like it had greys in it now from the odd blonde strands here and there.</li>
            <li> I noticed only a slight improvement in getting the brassiness out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> washing out I used a purple shampoo (another disapointment that only slightly keeps brassyness at bay).</li>
            <li> Did half the packet of conditioner (saved the rest for tomorrow) and left on for 2 min.  </li>
            <li> to get red dye out of my hair, and my hair turned out a dark blonde/light brown with a little bit of brassiness and red tones.</li>
            <li> This product actually DARKENED my new expensive salon highlights and only made my base color more orange!  </li>
            <li> The brass banisher did little to combat the orange and yellow tones in my hair and I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> ; I would no way recommend this product.went likely a little over 10 minutes from the start to the finish.  </li>
            <li> with a little white and some orange.</li>
            <li> but I think this product would probably work wonders on anyone who has a yellow brassy problem or even a little orange brassiness.</li>
            <li> For the little bit of a yellow tint I had, it did it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> It toned the brass slightly but it made my hair &amp; highlights flat, almost grayish.</li>
            <li> Also near my roots had a dull yelloish/red tint to it.</li>
            <li> and I just needed to lift about 50% of the yellow so that I could at least go out in public without a head scarf.</li>
            <li> I thought that this product would do the trick, but after using it noticed no difference whatsoever and was left with slightly dried out hair.</li>
            <li> I have been bleaching my hair a few times and have been trying to get the lightest shade possible</li>
            <li> you can have wet</li>
            <li> Total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> As expected when I do my roots they are brassy even if I lighten then with cool/ash toner.</li>
            <li> Looks darker, well it was wet.  </li>
            <li> When it was wet</li>
            <li> I am a natural dirty blonde with salon white blonde highlights.  </li>
            <li> This was a total waste of my money and time.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and left it on a little longer than directed.</li>
            <li> used the Brass Banisher after lightening with the Feria 91 and seeing how my roots went to a pale strawberry blonde, as opposed to the champagne color that the rest of my hair was.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark ash-brown hair that I had previously semi-permanently dyed auburn and the red dye has been stained into my hair for seven months.</li>
            <li> I was very anxious about trying this product, as a L&#x27;Oreal representative warned me that my blonde hair could potentially go gray-ashy (since I was using it after Feria 91: Champagne Cocktail) and reading a bunch of reviews saying \\&quot;It doesn&#x27;t work\\&quot; or \\&quot;It</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what I expected it to do for my brassy, orange &amp; yellow blonde hair after a bad dye job.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would help lift some of the brassy tones out, and it did lift slightly, but only slightly.</li>
            <li> at 5 minutes I was still pretty brassy, so be patient and don&#x27;t be afraid to leave it on because I left it on for probably 11 or 12</li>
            <li> I left it on for 15min because I&#x27;m not really good at following instructions.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark blonde with a few greys here and there.</li>
            <li> I usually dye my roots a medium blonde to lighten it a little and cover the grey.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this is called Brass Banisher since it really only banished another $10 of mine.</li>
            <li> I have dirty blonde hair naturally and had dyed it a lighter blonde in the beginning of september.</li>
            <li> All i can say is, there is no more yellow in my hair.</li>
            <li> The next time I color, I plan on using Revlon Color Silk, no amonia and no more hair color with it ever again.  </li>
            <li> But due to the water here, brass creeps in.  </li>
            <li> would rather cut corners in other areas and leave coloring to a pro.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure this would have been enough to eliminate brassiness.</li>
            <li> There are other toners specifically made for that.</li>
            <li> read other reviews and didn&#x27;t follow the package&#x27;s directions.</li>
            <li> even though my hair is only past my ears.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read people saying that if you leave it on less the less your hair darkens, but the difference is probably only slight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m give it 2 stars if the box had made an disclaimer letting me and all the other brunettes know it would not work for us.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical after reading a few of the reviews here, but this product was exactly what my highlighted hair needed!</li>
            <li> I am very  very careful what I put into my color treated hair,</li>
            <li> was scared the BB will destroy my already dry ends because of the peroxide in it or make the rest of my hair even darker.</li>
            <li> , in the past few years have used the fabulous, Loreal  \\&quot;Dream \\&quot;Blonde\\&quot;, which, unfortunately has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li> It works to tone down your hair a bit, but will not fix extremely orange hair.</li>
            <li> I feel like it did nothing to my hair except make it stiff and dry.</li>
            <li> It , of course, came out  that most terrible pale yellow shade that conflicts with everyone&#x27;s facial coloring.  </li>
            <li> that started this mess and this product only made it worse I won&#x27;t be buying Loreal haircolor products in the future.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s such a dull colour now.</li>
            <li> I have dark blonde/light brown.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Prior to using this my dark brown hair was dyed a medium brown-</li>
            <li> I have not had a problem with it turning dark.  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and had wanted ash blonde/carmel highlights.  </li>
            <li> I plan on telling everyone who is shocked that I just went back to my natural blonde color.</li>
            <li> not for brunettes or dark hair:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair couldn&#x27;t have been worse and Wow is all I can say.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I have thick wavy hair, and it is controlled by Shishado&#x27;s um red box shampoo, conditioner and I</li>
            <li> As for the brassy tone... well, it is toned down, but still there.</li>
            <li> Toned down the brightness without dulling my color.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it would tone down the brass and add some shine.</li>
            <li> Tones down brassiness between visits to my colorist.  </li>
            <li> After dying my hair ombre, I needed to tone down the brassiness.</li>
            <li> My hair turned orange due to some color that I tried, when we tried the highlights, they also turned orange, yikes!  </li>
            <li> It turned my hair an odd, dark, brassy orange color.  </li>
            <li> I have a dark brown hair, which I colored in a slightly lighter brown with blond streaks in the front.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it still didn&#x27;t do much if anything besides darken my hair a little.</li>
            <li> Because I had an inkling that this might happen, I had previously purchased the Brass Banisher and did a strand test.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I boldly left this product in my hair for like forty minutes and still had weak results.</li>
            <li> I get approximately half a head of highlights every 10 weeks.</li>
            <li> , it was slight and washed out in a couple of washes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s less shiny than it was previously.</li>
            <li> hair is not one bit less brassy-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s WAY less [...]</li>
            <li> I do notice a slightly darker tint  </li>
            <li> from the previous dye.</li>
            <li> After turning my hair the most horrible yellow jello color, I thought I&#x27;d have to spend a fortune for a hairdresser to fix it.  </li>
            <li> It was horrible, the top of my head was orange and the rest of my hair was blonde.</li>
            <li> Still not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> If I mess up with tone coloring...</li>
            <li> Also, I have long thick hair, and I bought two boxes thinking I would need them both.</li>
            <li> two boxes if you have even remotely thick or long hair</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s past your shoulders, you might want to buy two boxes because I hardly had enough to cover all my hair.</li>
            <li> but luckily this time wasn&#x27;t so bad.  </li>
            <li> Basically, I went from being dark haired with brassy highlights to looking like I have really dark red hair with very subtle ombre.</li>
            <li> Had a few yellowy spots from previous.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried</li>
            <li> It may have darkened the highlights a little (that&#x27;s what salon toner does too</li>
            <li> I bleach my hair every so often and this past time was the yellowest tone I&#x27;ve ever gotten after 2 bleaches, which I did within days of each other.</li>
            <li> I followed up with tigi dumb blonde violet shampoo and clairol shimmer lights purple conditioner</li>
            <li> It looked a LITTLE bit ashier</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the miracle product I&#x27;d hoped for, but helped a little.</li>
            <li> I felt like it took what little shine out of&lt;br</li>
            <li> my roots had begun to look terrible in my opinion, so like I have done in the past, I bleached a fairly large face-framing streak, to hide my roots right by my face.</li>
            <li> Alas, this only slightly removed the redness to almost not discernible way leaving my hair orangy.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, thick hair and bleaching it</li>
            <li> My situation was a tough one, I put permanent color on that brought out all this red in my hair.</li>
            <li> Not very affective, damages hair and loses the little affect it makes in 3 weeks.. Placebo?</li>
            <li> and when I washed and dried my hair, I found the brassiness was reduced by about 70%.</li>
            <li> Then there was the &#x27;leopard look&#x27; results, from missing places on our heads during the process.  </li>
            <li> Put it on my towel dried hair,  </li>
            <li> my friends told me my hair had a green tint to it</li>
            <li> (I had read some reviews that mentioned a green outcome)</li>
            <li> (waste of time)</li>
            <li> I bleach my medium brown hair and I have trouble with an orange color in it.</li>
            <li> I wasted my time, I wasted my money and I ended up damaging my hair for nothing.</li>
            <li> I know it was the conditioner because it happened after I completed the process and not when the product was in my hair, nor when the fumes were being suppressed by the water or trapped in the towel.</li>
            <li> I have difficult to color hair- even when it&#x27;s done professionally.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this</li>
            <li> so it took a few steps to fix it</li>
            <li> Softens the color and gets rid of the uneven tones.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll waste your time.</li>
            <li> I usually give products the benefit of the doubt and even if it helps a little I&#x27;ll say it worked.</li>
            <li> Kinda made my nose itch and eyes water at first, but not as bad as  ahome perm or anything.  </li>
            <li> In the past it&#x27;s always been a long, arduous process which usually leaves me with orange hair for awhile.</li>
            <li> and I have been bleaching it for the past few years.</li>
            <li> Overall... it actually looks classier and it doesn&#x27;t look bad.</li>
            <li> secret it says dry hair.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> This is the second time L&#x27;Oreal has disappointed, and will be the last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they are selling for almost 40.00 when you can buy at Walmart for 8.00???</li>
            <li> However, I think, but not sure, if my hair was lighter, this product would probably turn it purple.</li>
            <li> gave it 4 stars because I am not sure how often I can use.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> usually does a lot of damage to it--</li>
            <li> Usually, I am too lazy to do it and stick with the one step.  </li>
            <li> not sure.    </li>
            <li> Only sad thing is that is has to be ordered online and take days to get here..</li>
            <li> NOT SURE IF I WANT TO KEEP ON SPENDING THIS MONEY EACH MONTH OR 2.</li>
            <li> but im also not satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention you&#x27;ll sacrifice your hair&#x27;s health in a pointless process.</li>
            <li> I have been testing each 10 min by washing small areas of my hair and</li>
            <li> unlike the boxed haircolor and highlights I used, both ammonia free, this gave my scalp a slight burning feeling and had that awful hair dye smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sick of chasing the blonde around, trying to get the one you want from home is a rough job.</li>
            <li> So I got this sad excuse for a solution.</li>
            <li> Initially I was disappointed with this product - after my hair dried post treatment, it was still brassy and I saw little change.</li>
            <li> I think that may be because it was hard for me to spread the stuff.  </li>
            <li> They were so hard too on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Hard on hair, and did not work well for blondes.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find, so I stock up.  </li>
            <li> My highlights look less dramatic.</li>
            <li> At least, not a speedy one.</li>
            <li> I even used it a couple times and each time I had to cut at least an inch off my hair...</li>
            <li> So, desperate, I picked this up at WalMart for about the same price as listed on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> but lately I haven&#x27;t had time to schedule an appointment.</li>
            <li> This sucks.</li>
            <li> My hair was virgin dirty blonde.</li>
            <li> Product sucks.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy with how gold my hair looked after recent highlights and</li>
            <li> But hey, if you don&#x27;t try something at least once, you will never know, but it might work for someone else, it just didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> If you have really thick hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed 2 bottles for my thick shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> The product is thick (like glue)</li>
            <li> No more L&#x27;oreal products for me!</li>
            <li> I mean no tips ect.</li>
            <li> I was unable to address the problem for 2 days due to work schedule</li>
            <li> I suspect this dye could have been some use with people who ended up with orange hair who were going for blonde, but all I got was DARKER hair (not an unpleasant shade or anything, but</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars, but the price is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I am going to have to re-bleach my ends and try to achieve the subtle ombre again.</li>
            <li> Seriously</li>
            <li> and I am so serious.</li>
            <li> subtle change.</li>
            <li> My hair was looking a little \\&quot;orange\\&quot; after dying it with light-ash-blonde, so I tried this Brass Banisher stuff...full of hope...and sadly it did NOTHING for me at all.</li>
            <li> but I hated the brassiness and too much gold.</li>
            <li> And I did a SECOND 10-minute application...still no change! :(</li>
            <li> Sucks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that I ordered 2 boxes to keep one as a spare for the next oopsy haircolor fiasco, but it will be going in the trash.  </li>
            <li> if your desperate id still give it a try for less than $10 rather than a salon</li>
            <li> It is very thick like glue, and it does work in eventually, but it is time consuming.</li>
            <li> another waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> and after everything really dry, frizzy, and awful to feel, just awful and aren&#x27;t I glad I used this product and the amonia</li>
            <li> I am, however, poor and can&#x27;t afford to get my hair colored at a salon anymore.</li>
            <li> Almost seems to have gotten even worse now.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s so difficult to get through my hair because it&#x27;s so thick.</li>
            <li> Tried a purple shampoo, did nothing, maybe even made it worse?</li>
            <li> it could make your hair worse</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would do something weird to the previously highlighted ends.  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the results - the highlights/lowlights were so thin</li>
            <li> After it was completely combed, checked my worst area</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Sorry, had to say that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SCARY.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t use it as described because it would be too expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, and rightfully so.</li>
            <li> Well needless to say, it didnt benefit my hair nor did it do what it said.</li>
            <li> sadly it did nothing for me</li>
            <li> sadly the product did not meet my expectation.</li>
            <li> I have been battling brassiness through expensive shampoos, washing my hair in cold water, and have been considering buying a shower filter treatment.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and these highlights were terribly brassy.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to use this product, no matter what some of the reviews say.  </li>
            <li> Hope this helps someone not to be afraid to try this.  </li>
            <li> Sorry about that !  </li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> Over all, the product did nothing to hurt me, didn&#x27;t make me sick, burn, or make my hair green or anything terrible.</li>
            <li> Since this economy is so bad.</li>
            <li> Again, it doesn&#x27;t look bad, but it just is not at all what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Nothing smelled bad, I could breath, eyes didn&#x27;t water, solution went on well.  </li>
            <li> But I NEED THIS, and have not one bad thing to say at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bad idea probably.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with a bad bleach accident or someone with spotty hair.</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely shocked at the Gentleness of the product.  </li>
            <li> Ugh, makes me sick.</li>
            <li> So, I was disappointed to hear this</li>
            <li> them oranger:(</li>
            <li> But came out with extactly what I started brownish redish hair :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BUT, as a side note, watch out if you use all-natural hair color like awful Palette by Nature--it will remove it!</li>
            <li> Horrible, horrible product!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sooo frustrated!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a horrible experience</li>
            <li> This is absolutely horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The first time I bought this it was about $8.  Two months ago it was $20.  Now they want $40 for it?&lt;br /&gt;Forget that!  I would give it 5 stars, but the price is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> another waste of money!!! it does not work!!!&lt;br /&gt;still looking for one that does.very disapointed!!!</li>
            <li> Brass Banisher really does get rid of the brassy color that sometimes occurs with blonde hair color products.  It is easy to use and makes your hair not only much less brassy but also shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair month ago didn&#x27;t time it after was left with bright orange roots not cute got this took almost all the orange out now can barly notice I made a booboo love it will be getting lots more</li>
            <li> Highly reccommend this product.  It saved me after I tried to highlight my own hair.  Now I take it to the salon and let the professionals apply it after highlights.  My stylist thinks that it&#x27;s a miracle treatment.</li>
            <li> Not very affective, damages hair and loses the little affect it makes in 3 weeks.. Placebo?</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing!!! That&#x27;s right almost  $10.00 for NOTHING! It did not remove any brassiness at all and my hair is as brassy now as before I used it!!I have strawberry blonde hair and after my last coloring, it became very brassy, so I decided to try this. Waste of money! I guess I will have to add this to the price of whatever it cost me at the saloon to fix it.I should have known better. This is the second time L&#x27;Oreal has disappointed, and will be the last. No more L&#x27;oreal products for me!</li>
            <li> incredible results...my &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; toner after frosting and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it...so good for hair and soft, silky, shiny condition as well as perfect soft &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; (ash) blonde tone ...about Legally Blonde&#x27;s comment - not everybody can leave it on for more than 10 min.  She and I, sure...but there are people who have much more fine/porous hair and the result will be gray, so if there are any doubts, please test a swatch of your hair first, per the directions</li>
            <li> I was very anxious about trying this product, as a L&#x27;Oreal representative warned me that my blonde hair could potentially go gray-ashy (since I was using it after Feria 91: Champagne Cocktail) and reading a bunch of reviews saying \\&quot;It doesn&#x27;t work\\&quot; or \\&quot;It turned my hair green!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Brass Banisher after lightening with the Feria 91 and seeing how my roots went to a pale strawberry blonde, as opposed to the champagne color that the rest of my hair was. I didn&#x27;t want to bleach my roots, and I was reluctant to go to a salon. Because I had an inkling that this might happen, I had previously purchased the Brass Banisher and did a strand test. 10 minutes turned the palest part of my hair gray, so I stuck with timing 5 minutes after finishing the application on my hair (roots first, followed by lengths.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was more than enough product, and the red is definitely far less in my hair than it was. My hair has gone a tad bit darker, but I am going to re-lighten it with John Frieda 9N on Tuesday or Wednesday in order to cover the patchy bits in the back that I missed with the Feria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased! No need to go to the salon! :)</li>
            <li> Since this economy is so bad. I have taken to coloring my own hair every other color. I have dark blonde/light brown. I lighten with a ash blonde and use this and the brassiness is gone.</li>
            <li> Works great!! I have a natural warmth to my hair, no matter how cool of a blonde I buy, and it&#x27;s worse in the summer months with the sun. But this really tones down the red tones. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I used this product after I highlighted my hair with Loreal touch on highlights in toasted almond.  I have dark brown hair and these highlights were terribly brassy.  The brass banisher did little to combat the orange and yellow tones in my hair and I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It took my orange and yellow highlights and tamed them perfectly to a nice natural color.  It also toned down some of the base red in my hair, leaving it with more of a natural tone.  No ammonia, but there is peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, as a side note, watch out if you use all-natural hair color like awful Palette by Nature--it will remove it!</li>
            <li> I have redhair that get&#x27;s really brassy in the Summer. This really does work. I leave on for 10 minutes. I&#x27;m not sure why they are selling for almost 40.00 when you can buy at Walmart for 8.00???</li>
            <li> This product did not perform well on my hair.  I am a natural blonde and it made my hair darker and the brassyness still there.</li>
            <li> So, about six months ago, I dyed my naturally light ash blonde hair to a dark brown.  Over the past six months, I dyed it four times: the first time a light brown, the second time darker because I wanted a dark chocolate brown, and the other two times the same dark chocolate brown because the color faded fast and to cover my roots since my hair grows quickly.  I finally decided I wanted to be blonde again instead of having to keep dying since my roots come in so quickly, and so I used a product that takes the dyed color out of your hair.  It turned my hair an odd, dark, brassy orange color.  So I went immediately back to the drug store and picked up this product.    The product is really simple to use.  You just mix bottle 1 and bottle 2 and put it on your hair.  The consistency is kind of like glue, and it was a little difficult for me to spread.  It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it&#x27;s definitely not the worst smelling of products that I&#x27;ve used on my hair, so I can&#x27;t complain.  I got it all over my hair and used it for 5-6 minutes.  You can use it for between 5 and 10 minutes, but I was a little worried about frying my hair, since I&#x27;ve already put it through so much, so I did the minimum requirement.  I washed it out, and shampooed, even though you don&#x27;t have to.  I was just making sure to get all of the product out because, like I said, it was a little bit like glue.  I used the conditioner, and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a pretty good conditioner.  My hair doesn&#x27;t seem more damaged because of the use of the product.    My results were okay, I suppose.  I gave it a 3 stars, though I suppose I&#x27;d say like 3 and a half, really if I could do half stars.  The orange came out of my hair, but the results are a bit patchy.  I think that may be because it was hard for me to spread the stuff.  I&#x27;d have liked a little less of a warm tint in my hair, but I can&#x27;t complain because I didn&#x27;t use it for 10 minutes.  So I give it a 3.5.  I&#x27;d use it again if my hair was brassy, but if I heard good things about another product, I&#x27;d be just as likely to try that one as well.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product.  I just used it to try and reduce some of the brassiness in my hair and my hair is now blue!  Horrible, horrible product!!!!</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair red almost a year ago, I have been trying to dye it blonde for over six months. I have done the strand tests, dyed it multiple time while only going one shade difference in my hair nothing it turned brassy. I bought this product and tried it last night, my hair looks exactly the same. No difference the only thing this product did do was deep condition it with the enclosed conditioner.</li>
            <li> After bleaching my natural medium blond hair that had light platinum highlights, using Loreal&#x27;s Super Blolne my hair turned a deep orange, brassy color (very scary for me :) ) especially at the roots. So I purchased Brass Banisher. After all the reviews on YouTube I didn&#x27;t have high hopes, but still I thought anything could be better than having orange hair.   I applied Brass Banisher on my roots first and then continued on to saturate the whole lenght of my hair. I left it on for 10 minutes after I was done putting it on my hair.   After I washed it out I applied the conditioner, which is AMAZING! Just for that alone it was all worth it! My hair came out super soft despite the fact that I did dye it the day before AND used a toner afterwords, so my hair was beaten up and crunchy before Brass Banisher&#x27;s conditioner! As for the brassy tone... well, it is toned down, but still there. What this product did was blend the color to even it out and tone down the orange a tiny bit, so it looks less \\&quot;OOPSY\\&quot;, more natural.   Would I use it again? Yes. I would. I&#x27;d probably use two boxes though to really saturate my long hair, that&#x27;s below my shoulder blades. I give it a C+. Good luck to you all!</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of bleaching my hair with a really cheap bleach, that left my hair ORANGE. no big deal, i just did it again. ORANGE AGAIN. Luckily I had planned ahead and had bought a box of this, and it worked wonders. I left it on for 10 minutes, and instead of orange, my hair is now a nice beige. Lovely product. will buy every time i bleach my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after I got my hair professionally dyed to an \\&quot;ash blonde\\&quot; but in reality it was just a brassy mess. I had to apply this product twice. The first time I tried to get all of my hair coated evenly, then I let it sit for 10 min. After washing it out, my hair was a truer ash blonde but my roots were still very brassy. During the second application I applied the product to my roots only, then waited 10 minutes. In retrospect, I could have left it in for another 5 minutes  but I was panicking. My roots are still slightly brassier than the rest of my hair, but it&#x27;s not horribly noticeable and with purple shampoo the brassiness will be further minimized. I have very short hair(cut slightly above the chin) and I barely had enough product for what I did. I would highly recommend purchasing 2 boxes if your hair is past your shoulders. Also, the conditioner that comes with this product is amazing; it&#x27;s the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I was really torn when writing this review, but at the end of the day, this product did not at all do what it was supposed to. I have been bleaching my own hair to achieve an ombre look. I had achieved a perfect slowly transitioning look, with very light blond on the bottom that eased into my dark natural color on top. The last time I did it, I added highlights to the top of my head, which came out very orange and brassy. I had read that this Brass Banisher tones really light hair a darker color, but I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be dramatic and that it would be worth it to remove the orange tones. I applied it and then left it on an additional 7-10 minutes. Here&#x27;s where I was torn.. it ended up evening out my hair color across the board. My ombre is not nearly as noticeable. My highlights look less dramatic. Overall... it actually looks classier and it doesn&#x27;t look bad. BUT, it took away months of slowly bleaching my hair to the lightest blond I had achieved AND the top of my head is even more brassy and now it is an all over tone. Basically, I went from being dark haired with brassy highlights to looking like I have really dark red hair with very subtle ombre. I suppose some of it looks &amp;#34;caramel&amp;#34; colored, and the even color does look more professional. Again, it doesn&#x27;t look bad, but it just is not at all what I wanted. I am going to have to re-bleach my ends and try to achieve the subtle ombre again. Also, I&#x27;m going to have to find another cure for the copper penny orange on the top of my head. It is quite possible that this is intended for someone with very light hair to begin with. Like.. almost white blond, like the picture. I made the mistake of thinking this would work for any hair color as long as it contained brassiness.</li>
            <li> I recently lightened my dark blonde hair, that had even darker roots, needless to say my roots were looking pretty brassy. When i came across this product I didn&#x27;t have high hopes but figured it was worth a try, better than paying $200 for a salon to fix it! So I bought it, put it on last night (for 10 minutes, not 5) and it still looked brassy before I got in the shower. But once I had washed it out, conditioned my hair and blew it dry and I realized that it actually worked! It turned the brassy color into a slightly lighter color, made it look more like highlights then bright brassy roots! This isn&#x27;t going to give you salon quality results (obviously) but if you&#x27;re on a budget and you want that brassy color to go away, buy this! It also makes your hair super shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> I bleach the top layer of my hair regularly...I decided to go back to brown for awhile and then didn&#x27;t like it so I bleached it again.  It looked very orange at my roots and bright yellow on the rest.  I thought maybe I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough so I did it again...big mistake.  It was still very orange and brassy...now just more damaged.  Then I remembered my hair dresser putting a toner on that she said would take out the orange and brassiness.  I didn&#x27;t know anything about toners but I looked at Fred Meyer&#x27;s and found this.  I was a little worried but I left it on for 10 minutes and the orange and brassiness is gone!  I have a very pretty blonde color now that looks so much better.  This worked great for me and my hair looks shiny and pretty today.</li>
            <li> I have been getting highlights forever and they have been getting orang-er and brassier.  I simply wanted not to have to highlight every other month.  I wanted a natural look again and healthy hair.  Put simply, this did that.  It took ALL of the brass away, left with a slightly darker natural color blond with subtler highlights.  Beats spending hundreds a year on orange highlights that damage my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I still can&#x27;t believe it worked this well.  Left it on 10 minutes as directed.  No problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this is called Brass Banisher since it really only banished another $10 of mine. I usually give products the benefit of the doubt and even if it helps a little I&#x27;ll say it worked. I have dark blonde hair that I&#x27;ve highlighed very blonde over the years. Every once in a while I get this grand idea to save $100 and color my own hair. Well when I did it my darker roots turned a beautiful glowing shade of orange... thus turning my hope to Brass Banisher. I read a couple really great reviews and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. Much to my dismay my roots are still brassy and it turned my bright blonde highlights duller. So basically my hair is a hot mess now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t work!!! (and PS. I followed the directions very carefully and left the treament in for 7-8 mins.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002PMLGVI L&#x27;Oreal Paris Colorist Secrets Brass Banisher Hair Treatment]]</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!  Works super well.  Nothing on the market works as well.</li>
            <li> After I decided to go back to brown after various shades of red, some of the pesky hard to get rid of color shone through. I thought that this product would do the trick, but after using it noticed no difference whatsoever and was left with slightly dried out hair. I wouldnt recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have been bleaching my hair a few times and have been trying to get the lightest shade possible so I can get the platinum blonde color. This last time I bleached my hair, my hair turned out like corn yellow. This product is perfect to tone down the warm (yellow, orange shades) and gives hair a more \\&quot;cool\\&quot; tone.  I wouldn&#x27;t say this made my hair any darker, it just made my hair more of a light ash blonde instead of like a light \\&quot;golden\\&quot; blonde.  If you have really thick hair that&#x27;s past your shoulders, you might want to buy two boxes because I hardly had enough to cover all my hair. I would definitely use this again.</li>
            <li> Keep on longer - 45 to 1 hour but worked great</li>
            <li> I was skeptical after reading a few of the reviews here, but this product was exactly what my highlighted hair needed! Toned down the yellow and orange tones in my highlights - highlights now have a nice, natural look.  Thanks L&#x27;Oreal!</li>
            <li> Thank you brass banisher! When I get my hair lightened at the salon they always use a toner. I am, however, poor and can&#x27;t afford to get my hair colored at a salon anymore. My hair looks much better a couple shades lighter than my natural light to medium brown and grey color. When I color it myself with a blonde from the super market my hair always looks lighter but more of an orange-blonde than a blonde. I used this over my color treated hair and now my hair looks blonde and not orange. Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this!</li>
            <li> Initially I was disappointed with this product - after my hair dried post treatment, it was still brassy and I saw little change. But after a day, the brassiness was much reduced and now there is only a slight reddish tinge. I have been battling brassiness through expensive shampoos, washing my hair in cold water, and have been considering buying a shower filter treatment. However, I am glad I found this product. It is certainly worth the money and does a good job toning down the brass.</li>
            <li> My Clairol toner was discontinued so I tried this out as the second part of my 2 step processing. After 60 minutes of bleaching my hair was still yellow as usual, but after a 10 minute application of brass banisher the yellow had turned into a nice, slightly beige, pale blond. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I recently used brass banisher after bleaching the bottom half of my hair (ombre hair) was left with a orangey blonde tint. I was hoping this product would help lift some of the brassy tones out, and it did lift slightly, but only slightly. I had better results just using a cool toned toner to try and minimize the warm tones.</li>
            <li> My hair was looking a little \\&quot;orange\\&quot; after dying it with light-ash-blonde, so I tried this Brass Banisher stuff...full of hope...and sadly it did NOTHING for me at all. No change. And I did a SECOND 10-minute application...still no change! :(</li>
            <li> Just changed the color of my blonde but was still brassy.</li>
            <li> I have long medium brown hair that was ombre to the ends until this week.  I went to my salon and got all over highlights and lowlights. I liked it in the salon especially the way she fixed it but once I was home it looked very stripey and not as natural as I had wanted. Several of the highlights on top were very brassy which I didn&#x27;t like at all. It was supposed to be more caramel and honey but instead it was more yellows and oranges. I waited three days to see if I would change my mind. I didn&#x27;t. I read a lot about how to go about correcting my problem so I bought a box of this at Walmart and tried it out. It worked great! Not only did it bring down the tone all over but it made everything blend together better. I&#x27;m much happier with my new look now that I&#x27;ve had a chance to doctor it with this. It completely took out the unwanted orangey yellows and gave me  more natural honey blondes and creamy beiges. I&#x27;ll be using this again because I know it&#x27;ll be a matter of time before it comes back. And it looks like I need to but it from Amazon.com because it&#x27;s cheaper here than Walmart!</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I boldly left this product in my hair for like forty minutes and still had weak results. Took out none of my brassiness.</li>
            <li> Had to have been not leaving in long enough because not a damn thing changed in regards to brassy color. Almost seems to have gotten even worse now. Go figure... Not at all recommended or impressed with in the least. Does not have the power to correct and change orange, stubborn tones. Save your time and money on this one ladies. Sucks! Got the two star rating because I try not to be a hater. I guess the it made my hair glossy. Somewhat  I suppose. Still not worth the trouble. Moving on.</li>
            <li> I use this on DRY hair, for 30 minutes, after I dye my light brown hair dark ash blonde it turns orange/red/gold even with an ash dye. My natural hair is a light brown/auburn strawberry blonde color. This product works it removes enough orange and red so I am left with some gold and the color almost looks blonde without having to bleach my hair.</li>
            <li> Brass Banisher has already saved me twice. First time I dyed my hair at home and it was a total disaster. Second time I went to a beauty salon and my roots that I bleached turned out... well... not orange, but whitish-yellowish, like a doll hair. I just looked cheap and fake-blonde. On top of it, the rest of my hair was darker and more natural looking. So, yellow top, normal but VERY dry ends. How the hell do you fix this?&lt;br /&gt;I was scared the BB will destroy my already dry ends because of the peroxide in it or make the rest of my hair even darker. because some toners do that.&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong!:)&lt;br /&gt;After 10 minutes of this miracle product on my hair, it looked PERFECT. Like, literally, PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt;Somehow it managed to make my hair an equal neutral beige-blond tone. The brassy top and roots are a little lighted beige, and the rest it a tiny bit darker, but it&#x27;s the same color everywhere and it looks so natural and beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU BRASS BANISHER! I love myself in the mirror again and I LOVE MY HAIR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. I&#x27;m stocking up for future disasters!!!</li>
            <li> I am so thank ful for this and will stock up on this. i use a ash blonde and i get some what brass on roots&lt;br /&gt;for some reason and when I use this and leave on full 10 minutes. I was shocked. secret it says dry hair. you can have wet&lt;br /&gt;hair and add it and leave on 10 minutes. then rinse out. I was amazed the nice beigy blonde and get compliments for&lt;br /&gt;my hair. try it and see.. I love this product. please amazon keep it forever.. thanks</li>
            <li> The first color that I saw on my blonde hair after the banisher was a kind of green, after a few days is just blond no red, no yellow, I like it.</li>
            <li> I use this product occasionally when my roots look too brassy after dying. It seems to even out my&lt;br /&gt;entire hair color, and takes some of the brassy red color away. Not perfectly, but is better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner smells great- like apple blossoms. I wish all hair dyes came with this conditioner!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this works, but it stripped all the unnatural looking tones (orange-red and brass-yellow) out of my hair in only 5 minutes and now my hair looks the way I want it to. I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t known about this product until now. It left my fine hair somewhat dry, even when using the little conditioner tube afterward, so I rubbed in some lightweight leave-in conditioner, which helped. I&#x27;m going to stock up on this stuff.</li>
            <li> Here is the funny story. I ordered this product on Amazon and then, I decided to call L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s help line to ask if this was the right product for me. I described my hair condition at the time. I lighten my hair with a permanent hair color. My natural hair color is about level 2 (dark brown). The hair dye that I use lightens up my hair to the level 7, I think (dark blonde). So, the L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s expert told me that because I was so far from my original hair color, it was not the right product for me and it wouldn&#x27;t do anything for me. So, I was disappointed to hear this but I already ordered it and decided to try it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;So, my lightened hair had a lot of orangey/golden tones in it. I also have some highlights that are level 9. I liked the level of the color, which is dark blonde (I don&#x27;t want it lighter) but I hated the brassiness and too much gold. So, I applied this toner, left it for 10 min. and when I washed and dried my hair, I found the brassiness was reduced by about 70%. It became cool dark blonde. I love it! However, I think, but not sure, if my hair was lighter, this product would probably turn it purple. Again, I wouldn&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Wella&#x27;s toners but their smell of ammonia is so strong that I had to wear a mask while applying it on my hair. This toner, however, doesn&#x27;t have any offensive smells. And the high moisture conditioner that it comes with made my hair so shiny that it looks like I just got out of the salon and got a color treatment and a haircut, while, in fact, I cut my hair 6 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because I am not sure how often I can use. Instructions don&#x27;t mention it. I guess, I will use it every time I touch up my roots, which is about every 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair</li>
            <li> Great product. Got the bright yellow look out of my bleached hair without turning any of it gray like many ash blondes and toners have done to me before.</li>
            <li> I just got it in the mail and tried it right away. It was easy to use and I washed it after 10 minutes and it looks good.   I hope it last for a while but only time will tell. My hair turned orange due to some color that I tried, when we tried the highlights, they also turned orange, yikes!  Looked on line what I could try that would tone this orange color and would not entail an expansive visit to a hair salon. So far so good and I just hope it lasts.  If it does, I will be on auto ship to make sure that I do it everything I do a touch up.   Try it, what have yo got to loss, it&#x27;s only $8?</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing.I still have yellow hair despite leaving it in longer than they say to. Total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Helped to reduce the brassiness in my hair after using over the counter hair color.</li>
            <li> I helped my wife bleach her hair to get that Platinum look and to save the $200 she would normally spend doing it at the salon. We used a Clarol bleach product that turned her hair first orange than yellow, which we expected. I made sure I got ALL the roots and tiny hairs that the stylists seem to always ignore.  We then applied this product to get that \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; blond look and, 20 minutes later after showering it off, her hair is now picture perfect! This brass banisher product turned my wife&#x27;s hair from a dep yellow to the blond she always wanted. And it saved us a pretty penny, too. I paid $16 for both products and that saved us a lot of money for that perfect salon look.  If your hair is yellow after bleaching it and you want to grt that perfect  lond look, then this product is for you.  NOTE: the longer you leave this stuff in your hair, the darker the blond it will make you. We used it for 8 mins instead of the recommended 10 mins.</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what I expected it to do for my brassy, orange &amp; yellow blonde hair after a bad dye job. Toned down the brightness without dulling my color.  Only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because like other reviewers I left product on for 25-30 minutes. I did a stand test and 10 minutes did nothing, left it on &amp; kept checking it until finally after 25 minutes it had the desired results.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. After reading the other reviews, I took their advice and left it on the FULL 10 minutes, 10 more, then 30 minutes, okay... then 45 minutes, then an HOUR. No one had mentioned going longer than that, and frankly, I didn&#x27;t have the time. So I washed it off. The directions say to rinse until the water runs clear. Well the water was never running anything but clear. Nearly two hours now I&#x27;ve spent on this and my hair it still as copper and yellow as ever. What a waste of time and money! Ugh, makes me sick. It smells nice, but that&#x27;s all I can say for it. USE ANOTHER PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I have medium/dark brown hair (straight, shoulder-length, fine). I get approximately half a head of highlights every 10 weeks. I used to go to a really nice salon and they used a good toner after they took out my foils. I&#x27;ve been trying to save $ so I get my highlights done at a cheaper place. They don&#x27;t use toner (unless you ask and pay extra). Some of my highlights looked really brassy when I got them done 3 weeks ago. I saw this product and figured I might as well give it a try. DON&#x27;T GO BY THE PICK ON THE BOX. There&#x27;s no ammonia in this product (or peroxide) so it won&#x27;t lighten your hair. It may have darkened the highlights a little (that&#x27;s what salon toner does too and it fades out over 6 weeks). What I wanted was a little less brassiness and for my natural color to blend better with the highlights. Obviously getting my hair glazed at the salon looks better (costs like $40 though). For $8.50, this was pretty good.</li>
            <li> First, I should say I had high expectations for this product and went into it hoping for a miracle. I am a little disappointed. I went through a phase where I dyed my hair a different shade of blonde and the end result was brassy. I bought this product thinking it would tone down the brass and add some shine. It toned the brass slightly but it made my hair &amp; highlights flat, almost grayish. There was a lot of shine, though. After a couple of days, it all wore off and my hair went right back to its orangy/brassy glory. I ended up finally deciding to go to my stylist and get it all fixed professionally.</li>
            <li> After trying to lighten my dark blonde hair to ultra light blonde hair my roots turned orange. After using the brass banisher most of the orange has been lifted. There is still a little bit of orange left but not bad at all. It did not darken my hair just simply toned down the orange. I will make sure I have a box of this on hand before lightening my hair in the future.</li>
            <li> Had my hair highlighted, but my stylist didnt apply a toner to cool down some of the yellow on my tips. I found this and it did take out some of the yellow from my hair. Not bad for the price, it says not to leave in more than 10 minutes, but i would suggest leaving it in maybe 15 minutes for best results.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews on amazon, I found this product at my local target and decided to give it a try. I have dirty blonde hair naturally and had dyed it a lighter blonde in the beginning of september. It wasn&#x27;t a huge difference, but you could see my roots. Also near my roots had a dull yelloish/red tint to it. I left this product on for 30 mins, even though the box said only 5. I am very glad I left it on for that long, I actually think 40 mins wouldve been the perfect amount for my hair. It definitely did lift the red/yellow tones but it also blended my roots with my dyed color! Which made me even happier. My hair looks a lot more natural now and it got the job done! It also left my hair very shiny and soft, and the conditioner that came with it is great! Also, I have long thick hair, and I bought two boxes thinking I would need them both. I probably could&#x27;ve done with only one, but I did use maybe a 1/4 of the second box just to make sure I saturated my ends enough.</li>
            <li> I have natural light brown hair and I dye my hair medium brown. I have used temporary and permanent dye in the past and overall consider myself very informed and knowledgable on hair dye based on a lot of at home experience. I bought this product looking for a more natural look because even though I dyed it a medium cool brown, there were still a lot of orange/red shades within it, especially visible in the sun. I saw the relatively good reviews and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this product a one star review based on the fact that it made my hair MORE brassy than it was before. I ordered 4 boxes and with the first try I followed all the directions. The next morning my hair looked relatively the same, maybe a little more brassy. I then looked at more reviews and ran across a few saying that it worked for them if you left it in longer than directed. I then tried again and left it in for 15 minutes. When it dried, it was significantly lighter and much more orange than before.&lt;br /&gt;My conclusions? Well to begin with, please consider that this product contains hydrogen peroxide, used it permanent dyes to lighten hair. This chemical in addition to ammonia are chemicals known to cause the brassy tones in hair dye. This product does not contain ammonia, but does contain hydrogen peroxide, so it will therefore lighten and/or cause brassy tones. Also please consider that the toner in this product is purple, which is made to neutralize yellow tones in blondes. So although the product says it will work on any hair color, my conclusions are that it will probably work best if anything on blondes.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck with your hair coloring guys! xoxo</li>
            <li> I was very nervous about using this because I&#x27;d gathered from multiple reviews that this product works best on natural blonds.  I&#x27;m Asian with naturally jet black hair that has zero red/brown tones.  Right now, my hair is brown with blond highlights but too much summer fun turned my highlights into a ghastly, brassy mess, especially right on top of my head.  This product worked like a dream and it even lifted my black roots a bit so the overall effect is much softer.  It was super easy to use--I would do it again and definitely recommend it to other natural dark brunettes.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it took down the brassiness a notch... but it didn&#x27;t really do as much as I was hoping. My situation was a tough one, I put permanent color on that brought out all this red in my hair. It wasn&#x27;t an easy job but this wasn&#x27;t as powerful as it needed to be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the dough.  I&#x27;m sick of chasing the blonde around, trying to get the one you want from home is a rough job. This s***works though. Don&#x27;t be that girl with the peroxide hair-  this stuff will help you out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I do my own hair. I am naturally dark/medium brown and take my hair down to light blonde. As expected when I do my roots they are brassy even if I lighten then with cool/ash toner. After I dye my hair I use this stuff and in just ten minutes it pulls so much of the gold tones. loveee itttt. Side note: you can buy this at Walmart for 8 bucks.</li>
            <li> this product SAVED my hair. I bleach my hair every so often and this past time was the yellowest tone I&#x27;ve ever gotten after 2 bleaches, which I did within days of each other. I have very dry, thick hair and bleaching it usually does a lot of damage to it-- but luckily this time wasn&#x27;t so bad.  However, a need for a toner was a must because I had yellow hair, and bleaching over this disaster just wasn&#x27;t going to cut it. SO I used this product, which i applied immediately after drying my hair having just dyed it. All i can say is, there is no more yellow in my hair. Other toners leave violet or gray tones, but this just took out the yellow and left my expected hair color!  A tip, though.. don&#x27;t hesitate to put this all over your hair-- don&#x27;t spare your roots because it has very even coverage. Also, if you&#x27;ve got a lot of yellow or orange in your hair from a recent dye, don&#x27;t hesitate to leave it on for the full 10 minutes. at 5 minutes I was still pretty brassy, so be patient and don&#x27;t be afraid to leave it on because I left it on for probably 11 or 12 (I&#x27;m telling you.. YELLOW HAIR!)  BOTTOM LINE:   took the yellow tones out of my hair, was safe to use and did no damage to my hair. I would definitely stock up on these if you bleach often!</li>
            <li> I believe it works on reddish super blonde hair, but not anything darker. It really messed up my hair too. My hair became brittle after 30 minutes of having it. I know I wasn&#x27;t supposed to use it that long, but I didn&#x27;t see any effect on my hair. On a scale from 1-10, 1 being black, and 10 being super blonde, my hair is a 7. I didn&#x27;t work for me much at all.</li>
            <li> 8/21/12 UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello fellow Amazonites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a little off track with my original review, I can tell by my review being helpful to only 1 of 7 people.  OUCH!  Sorry about that !  I thought, now, I would do a quick review , just of this product, without the long story which I was inspired to write before.  I will still leave the long version here, for those of you who are interested in &#x27;plowing through it&#x27;. You have been forewarned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lowered the stars on this product to 3 and almost gave it a 2.  I have not purchased this product again and doubt I ever will, but who knows?  I may just mix it with another hair color and try that!  Now I am mixing two shades of hair color to get the shade of blonde that I desire.  Still miss my Dream Blonde ash blonde shade. Sorry, had to say that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It bugs me that this product says it works in 10 minutes. Seriously, how many &#x27;blonding&#x27; products, of any kind, work properly in 10 minutes?!  I had pre-bleached my hair this time and it still did not work all that well on me, and, I had to leave it in over an hour to get the results I got. 10 minutes?!  Where did that come from?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing, this product should not wash out in a couple of washings and require another 45 minute hair color so soon.  My other point about this product is that it should work better and not wash out in a couple of washings.  Great that it works so well for some, but shouldn&#x27;t it work better for most of us?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loreal knows how to make hair color, better than most companies.  Please, bring back &#x27;Dream Blonde&#x27;, ash shades  or create something better to take the brassiness out of blonde hair color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was born with platinum blonde hair and had that shade until it began darkening in my  early teens. I was determined then that I would not live with \\&quot;dishwater blonde\\&quot; hair and that is when I began to coloring my hair, and that of about every girl on my block, gaining useful knowledge in the art of hair color, at their expense!  I &#x27;was&#x27; a light blonde, and therefore, I would &#x27;always be&#x27; a light blonde.  Our neighborhood was  known as the \\&quot;blonde block\\&quot; at school, by the boys. Hair color has come a long way since then, thank goodness!  Back in the  60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s the color was not as good.  The ash shades really turned out gray, the golden shades were bright yellow and the beige shades pinkish. Then there was the &#x27;leopard look&#x27; results, from missing places on our heads during the process.  I  was always mixing colors to get that elusive \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; color and had some very humorous occurrences along the way.  My hair has been many shades of light blonde since I began coloring it, but has not been my natural shade in over 40 years.  I have no idea what it, or I,  would look like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later in life I owned a beauty salon until I realized I could make more money in Real Estate!  So,  I have a little knowledge in the art of coloring hair, \\&quot;at home\\&quot;, for what it&#x27;s worth. That being said, I do not know why this product works so miraculously for some, and yet, and not at all for others!  You would think home hair coloring would have progressed more by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is a medium dark blonde naturally,  I would say, (according to my roots), with white/gray hair emerging now. For many years, with few exceptions,  I have used a one step blonding process which has made my hair a very pretty , \\&quot;cool\\&quot; , blonde.  I  always battled the yellow/orange  tones with the one step blonding process.  l used  &#x27;Nice and Easy&#x27; for years then found Loreal permanent color, in the past few years have used the fabulous, Loreal  \\&quot;Dream \\&quot;Blonde\\&quot;, which, unfortunately has been discontinued.  I always buy  the \\&quot;extra light ash\\&quot; or \\&quot;light ash\\&quot; blonde shade which worked the best for me.  I would notice some orangey/yellow tint at times and even then, it was slight and mostly at the roots. I could always buy the product at the beauty supply  but I found the boxed products at the drug store are just as good, if, a little more expensive.  In fact, I called Clairol once about one of their drug store shades and asked which shade it was in their professional line and was told there was none.  Anyway, my color rarely showed a tint of gray except the  times  I left it on way too long and even then, it was slight and washed out in a couple of washes. Oh, how ash shades have improved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, finally, to the point of this review.  Every now and then I decide to pre-lighten my hair and do a two step process to get my hair to a more platinum blonde shade. Usually, I am too lazy to do it and stick with the one step.  The color always turns out the most beautiful blonde after the two step process and without even a hint of orange/yellow.  I then apply the permanent hair color in \\&quot;extra light ash blonde \\&quot;  after it is dry .  I recently discovered \\&quot;Dream Blonde\\&quot;  Ultra which is -  suppose  - to be both a lightener and toner in one.  I should know better than that,  but it is, after all, a  \\&quot;Dream Blonde\\&quot; product I am talking about!  It , of course, came out  that most terrible pale yellow shade that conflicts with everyone&#x27;s facial coloring.  The bonus - my hair was to that shade where I could get it to the \\&quot;perfect  platinum &#x27;blonde\\&quot;, IF, I used the Dream Blonde color, in the light ash blonde shade!  But... I decided to use this product first, to see what it would do this time.  I applied it to the root area first and waited... and waited... for it to turn that beautiful cool shade. I left it on until it most of the ugly yellow was gone.  Forget the 10 minutes it is suppose to take, it took over  an hour!  It did turn out a pretty,  neutral, pale blonde but still had more yellow than the I wanted.  It really was a pretty blonde just did not go with my skin tone that well and I knew when I washed it, it would fade. The big plus? My hair was even shiner that it has ever been!  It was in good condition as well.  I decided to wait  a few days to apply the \\&quot;Dream Blonde\\&quot; light ash blonde. Here we go again...</li>
            <li> Worked great at removing yellow and brassy tones. I left on 20 minutes and hair was too red when i first rinsed and started to dry! SCARY. But once i dried and used flat iron hair was nice even blonde. I would use again!!</li>
            <li> I picked up this product on a whim at my local beauty supply store the other day and wasn&#x27;t expecting much from a box toner. I was wrong! I had just used [[ASIN:B0012JY4G4 COLOR OOPS HR CLR REMOVER XTRA Size: 1]] to get red dye out of my hair, and my hair turned out a dark blonde/light brown with a little bit of brassiness and red tones. All I can say is that it was cheap, easy to use, and did the job. There are significantly less red tones in my hair after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m planning on lightening my hair with a box dye soon and I will definitely be picking this up to use afterwards.</li>
            <li> I am naturally a medium brunette and have had my hair bleach blonde for the past couple years. Now tired of the high maintenance blonde I wanted to grow it out naturally so I went to a salon to have more of my natural colour added so it would blend nicely as it grew out. I was not impressed with the results - the highlights/lowlights were so thin I still looked like I had 3&amp;#34; roots only to me my hair looked like it had greys in it now from the odd blonde strands here and there. So, I took matters into my own hands. I added highlights which turned out beautifully bright and added lowlights (mistakenly used an ash base and they turned out golden-orange). Hence this product. I was hesitant at first but the orange was driving me bonkers so I thought oh well and took the plunge, regretfully. The orange-yellow is much more subdued but at the expense of losing my lovely bright blonde highlights and my hair feels dry! It was lovely and silky and shiny before. So now I am just an overall ashy blonde. Not happy with the results. It probably would be a good product if your hair is very yellow-orange as anything would look better than that, but I am sad it&#x27;s such a dull colour now. And surprisingly for a &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34; treatment it&#x27;s less shiny than it was previously. We live and learn I suppose, and I have learned not to use this product again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get it -I used it and even left it on longer than recommended, and saw ZERO difference. I just went back to dying my hair and using violet shampoo. This didnt work.</li>
            <li> Worked for what I needed at the time</li>
            <li> This really works! I left it in for 2 hours and it took almost all the brassy tones out of my bleached hair. I followed up with tigi dumb blonde violet shampoo and clairol shimmer lights purple conditioner and that got all the remaining brassiness. My hair looks great now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed 2 bottles for my thick shoulder length hair. I suggest getting 1 more bottle than you think you will need and then if you don&#x27;t use it you have some for next time.</li>
            <li> This product made my bleached (almost platinum blonde) hair orange/brassier. And I used two boxes for my hair...had to pay a salon to correct it. Plus, it irritated my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I would rather use Ardell&#x27;s red gold corrector instead next time I do my roots. (which *were* yellow,btw)&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it works for others but just not for me.:(&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice and both times it just made my hair darker and gritty looking at the scalp; I would no way recommend this product.went likely a little over 10 minutes from the start to the finish.  My eyes never burned, I did put the fan on, was a little runnier than color, but ok and I have long hair, no real mess.  Started in front, the sides and back, and back really really good.  Used up the entire bottle, then made sure it was nice and saturated, while watching for color change. I only saw lots of that champagne color a gritty brown.  I thought not that....  But tried not to panic, finish things to the end.  My head didn&#x27;t burn, felt kind of tingly and good actually. Checked the time again, and turned on the faucet to apply warm water into a lather like the directions said.  Got in rinsed thoroughly, turned off the water to condition and left on several minutes.  The conditioner is always so soothing and smelled good.  Nothing smelled bad, I could breath, eyes didn&#x27;t water, solution went on well.  Rinse felt good, condition really nice turned off the water, applied a towel and dried first... So tempted to take a peek, no not yet and then came the time to peek.  Looks darker, well it was wet.  I combed gently, head wasn&#x27;t sore, comb slid through my hair just fine, not all dry or brittle.  After it was completely combed, checked my worst area the back, darker, but not bad at all, like it use to be only less and the top of my head and sides were orange free, my blonde was back.  I liked the color, looked at the back with a hand mirror and looked good, even ringlet curls were forming again.  Dried off my hair, silky, shiny so so soft.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.  I was absolutely shocked at the Gentleness of the product.  For days I had used all sorts of homemade remedies that only toned down some.  They were so hard too on my hair.  So I thought my hair might even break, or that I might have to cut some ends off, but not at all.  Seriously and you have too take my word for it... My hair is even better than it was before in every way, color, silkiness, shine and softness like you can&#x27;t believe.  My hair was medium blonde to begin with and really baby fine and thin and after everything really dry, frizzy, and awful to feel, just awful and aren&#x27;t I glad I used this product and the amonia must be the culprit in the dyes not peroxide.  This product and the hair color remover have peroxide and they were totally gentle.  The next time I color, I plan on using Revlon Color Silk, no amonia and no more hair color with it ever again.  Why would you want to use hair color with amonia when there are products out there that don&#x27;t damage your hair and you don&#x27;t need to.  If I mess up with tone coloring... I will fall back on this product, but any product I use will not have amonia.  I&#x27;m happy I took the other back and got this one instead.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to use this product, no matter what some of the reviews say.  My hair couldn&#x27;t have been worse and Wow is all I can say.  It is scarey for sure and even more so for a newbie at it, but I will learn and so will you, but start with the brass banisher and then if need be the hair color remover and stay away from amonia products when you don&#x27;t need to use them and others like Color silk are available.  Hope this helps someone not to be afraid to try this.  I sure am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Did not &amp;#34;banish&amp;#34; brass at all. Save your money and get a toner instead.</li>
            <li> I am very  very careful what I put into my color treated hair, even tho I go to a hair stylist for the coloring.  But due to the water here, brass creeps in.  This was my first time to try this and it&#x27;s just great!  Put it on my towel dried hair,  I don&#x27;t take chances on dry hair.  And I didn&#x27;t even leave on but 4 minutes.  I&#x27;m very cautious.  Now I know if I can still find it, will use it again!  Hope this helps you.</li>
            <li> I have a dark brown hair, which I colored in a slightly lighter brown with blond streaks in the front. After which my hair had a red hue. I tried the brass remover, left it for 10 minutes as directed, and nothing happened. The &amp;#34;blond&amp;#34; was red and the brown still had a red hue.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and left it on a little longer than directed. It definitely took out (most of) the brass color from my (colored) blonde and highlighted hair. It also left it very soft!</li>
            <li> Long review, but worth reading - promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I hadn&#x27;t lightened my blonde hair in about 6 months (I&#x27;m quite fair to begin with so roots aren&#x27;t really a concern) and after a very outdoorsy summer, I was seeing a LOT of brass. I&#x27;m away for school and have yet to find a salon as good as the one I visit at home. Out of sheer desperation/boredom I discovered this product through reviews and picked up a box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to do a test with an inch-wide section of hair and waited 5 minutes. No discernible difference. I let it hit the 10 minute mark. It looked a LITTLE bit ashier but no where near what I hoped to achieve. At this point I turned to Google to check out what might happen if I disobeyed the hair gods at L&#x27;Oreal and *gasp* left the product in longer than directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google had the answer - or rather, many, many hair/make-up bloggers had the answer - most people in the know stated what I already suspected: the 10 minute maximum is a marketing ploy to sell efficiency but this product is not a miracle-worker. At least, not a speedy one. Most people said anywhere from 30-45 minutes was ideal for anyone seeking to wipe out any yellow/red tones. If you are already blonde and sort of golden (like me) but looking for that fresh-from-the-salon ashy tone, 25 minutes should do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I defied the instruction sheet (crumpled it up and tossed it in the garbage, actually) and waited for the 25 minutes to pass. Hopped in the shower, DID use a violet shampoo (what instructions?) and then applied the conditioning gloss in step 3 as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After blow-drying.... Gorgeous! Soft, silky, ashy blonde hair!! And without the 2 hour, $200 trek to my go-to salon at home. This is huge, ladies. Don&#x27;t discount this product until you break the rules. It&#x27;s not going to burn your hair out at the roots or fry it or turn it purple. Patience is a virtue and this product is a blessing in disguise.</li>
            <li> this is a great product if you dont feel like waiting another 20 min at the salon to have them apply the toner.</li>
            <li> did not do anything that I could see. it may have even made hair look even brassier. would never buy this product again then again, may not ever color my own hair again. would rather cut corners in other areas and leave coloring to a pro.</li>
            <li> I have well water which turns my blonde hair very brassy over time and this in one easy 5 minute application does the trick and removes (or covers over, whatever) the brassiness and brings my hair back to the color it is meant to be. If I don&#x27;t use it as frequently as I should I sometimes have to do 2 applications 2 days in a row but there are absolutely no bad effects.</li>
            <li> Great for hairÔºÅ it gives it liftÔºå bounceÔºå lifeÔºå energyÔºå and feels not as dry and more plyableÔºÅ i love this productÔºÅ so glad i found itÔºÅ</li>
            <li> It actually made my hair more brassy.  Got to be kidding me.  I&#x27;m sooo frustrated!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any other product that better helps prevent brassy or yellowish tones in home-applied color-treated blonde hair.  But I don&#x27;t use it as described because it would be too expensive.  Instead, I squeeze some of this into each bottle of color mix, shake it up, and then apply the color with the brass banisher in it.  Lasts longs, still works.  Still, no home color product is perfect and this one could be improved a bit.</li>
            <li> I had color stripped my hair and came up with yellow hair (which was expected). I used Brass Banisher because it had a lot of good reviews and I just needed to lift about 50% of the yellow so that I could at least go out in public without a head scarf. I would say it lifted about 5% of the yellow - in other words, I barely noticed a difference at all. I even took before and after photos just so I would be able to tell if there were results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would only recommend this product if you&#x27;re just trying to reduce brassiness of your already-blonde hair. Don&#x27;t bother trying to use this after color stripping or bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I left it on for 25 minutes, even though the max time is 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> My hair looks exactly the same as it did before this treatment which is super brassy! Not only that but my hair seems drier from the solution, I&#x27;m worried I did damage to my hair for exactly zero results. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I feel like it did nothing to my hair except make it stiff and dry. I left it on for 15 minutes after reading reviews that said they did for 25. Also, it&#x27;s so difficult to get through my hair because it&#x27;s so thick. This was supposed to be easier but if you want to get the orangy tint out of your blonde, go get a blonde boxed dye and add ardell red gold color corrector, much better and softer results and doesn&#x27;t smell so offensive!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me..tried to remove the orange color from my blonde highlights. .made them oranger:(</li>
            <li> I have waist length hair that I highlight, and following up the highlights with this brings it all together and makes it look natural. It also helps with blending gray hairs in so they look like highlights. I do add unred drops to this, but my hair is naturally red and I desire a more ashy shade.</li>
            <li> This same product is in Walmart for $9.. can&#x27;t believe people are trying to sell it for as much as they are.. Save ur money don&#x27;t get ripped off..!!</li>
            <li> I noticed only a slight improvement in getting the brassiness out of my hair.  Wasn&#x27;t the miracle product I&#x27;d hoped for, but helped a little.</li>
            <li> Super love! I lighten my daughter&#x27;s brown hair with box color and it is usually left with an orange tint. I use Brass Banisher and it comes out looking so natural and beautiful. Very good product. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, and rightfully so. It did not dull the brass at all, but it did dry out my hair. I left it on for 10 mins. I will not use again.</li>
            <li> Used it before and it works great</li>
            <li> There went 30 minutes of my life I&#x27;ll never get back. Yep, I read the reviews, yep I left it in longer than it said. Yep, my hair was dry, I did this exactly as advised on the package and IT DID NOTHING. Besides stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is not one bit less brassy- I have asked several other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to using this my dark brown hair was dyed a medium brown- the exact color is Loreal Preference Light Brown- it is noted to be on the Natural Scale, so it should not have turned so... warm (brassy). But it did. It&#x27;s not terrible now, I&#x27;d just prefer it a bit more ash. So I got this sad excuse for a solution. Note: the preference is a really nice color and I got a lot of compliments, but the second time I colored it, it seemed more red. I am checking in with a beautician friend to learn more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re blonde it appears to work- I see some of the after pics. But brunettes- that reddish brass we get will not be taken away by this. Someone needs to come up with a de-brasser for us.</li>
            <li> Tones down brassiness between visits to my colorist.  I have not had a problem with it turning dark.  Just takes out some of the yellow my blond hair gets after being out in the sun between color treatments. This would not fix a do at home disaster!</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well. After dying my hair ombre, I needed to tone down the brassiness. It definitely did that, as well as darkens the overall shade (which I didnt mind!) and takes away the brassiness all over. The darkness washed out over a few weeks, which is fine with me.</li>
            <li> Works great, definitely removes blond yellow and leaves hair more evenly toned. Will order more in the future. Use it as needed.</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair blond and surprise surprise  my hair turned out orange ! well this brass banisher works beautifully ! would buy again!</li>
            <li> Ok, I used to go to the best salon&#x27;s, then I didn&#x27;t feel well because I am being treated for lyme disease, you get by Tick bites, it often is mistaked for MS or Fibromyalgia (that&#x27;s what they said I had until I sought a specialist, as I live in CA and it is ALL OVER THE USA) it takes years to get well, so I like to let people know about that, so they may also get well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANYWAY, I adore the product I have it on once a month auto delivery. I have Scotch/Irish background so things tend to go Brassy. I use Miss Clairol Dusk Blonde with 40 percent Oreal peroxcide, keep it on two hours I have brown hair naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I feel like highlights I use quick blue and 40% for 10 mintues. Then THIS[...]WOW No NO NO Brassy. And with Auburn hair it tends to need Ash&#x27;s 8 1/2 ash, aka Dusk Blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No hair damage no nothing, I love it. I look just like I want, Claudia Shiffer Hair! But I NEED THIS, and have not one bad thing to say at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick wavy hair, and it is controlled by Shishado&#x27;s um red box shampoo, conditioner and I add the Shine it comes with if you buy that box the red one and leave some of that on for non drying hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it better than the finest salons and I am so serious. It&#x27;s WAY less [...] even though yeah this all adds up it works perfectly for way longer. I mean no tips ect. Used to be in the thousands to get my hair colored, not it&#x27;s under 100 for months if I buy in bulk. Very Happy.</li>
            <li> It did help to reduce the brass and redness, although a complete change from my formerly red hair was a several stage process. It took several treatments of various types to arrive at the shade I wanted, but this was a pretty good step on the way.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my hair and tones down the brassy look my well water tends to give my dyed hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> Worked beautifully to reduce the brass of coloring hair blond.</li>
            <li> It kind of works , but if you did a big &amp;#34;ooops&amp;#34; on your hair I wouldn&#x27;t bother. Find the cheapest hairdresser who will redye your hair.</li>
            <li> Used this after &amp;#34;high-lift&amp;#34;- from dark brown to light blonde. This stuff really works well, too bad the excess can&#x27;t be stored for later use.&lt;br /&gt; Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Does what the box says.  After coloring some blonde shades get brassy.  This product softens the color and takes the brassiness away.  Works great.</li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t really change my hair at all. It advertises that it only needs to be left in for 10 minutes, but I wish I would have left it in longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product.  I read the reviews and left it on longer than the ten minutes the instructions said.  I did 20, wish I&#x27;d done 25 or 30.  But even so, it toned down my yellow hair and got the brassiness out.  I&#x27;d use this again!</li>
            <li> I am a beautiful blonde!</li>
            <li> I had recently lightened my hair and was using purple shampoo to tone down the brassiness and it was a pretty nice shade of dark gold with just a few orangey hints that still bugged me so I decided to try this product out to see if could squelch the rest of the unwanted brass tones from my hair. I left it on for the maximum 10 minutes and still my hair is about the same as it was before. It did tone it a bit but no more than a good lather with purple shampoo did. In no way did I get \\&quot;ashy\\&quot; colored hair, which I actually wouldn&#x27;t have minded. My guess is this is more for people who bleach their hair, which I did not, however I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s like a regular toner because it didn&#x27;t seem as strong as the toners Sally&#x27;s sells. I have bleached my hair before and I&#x27;m not sure this would have been enough to eliminate brassiness. I have naturally medium brown hair fyi so perhaps it works better on natural blondes. All in all I will stick to Wella toners and purple shampoo.</li>
            <li> So after reading all the mixed reviews, I was nervous to try the Brass Banisher. I have dark brown hair and had wanted ash blonde/carmel highlights.  My  stylist decided to make the highlights very blended and wide, so the effect was full-on blonde. Orange blonde.  Very brassy and red.  I bought Brass Banisher and the \\&quot;purple shampoo\\&quot; and decided to banish first.  Let it stay for 20 minutes, maybe 25.  When it was wet I thought nothing had happened. But, after blowdrying and styling, all the red is gone.  I am definitely blonde and some \\&quot;mellowed\\&quot; yellow remains.  But the red is gone which is what bothered me the most.I still wish I had more brown left in my hair. I might try coloring over it? Bad idea probably.  I&#x27;ll let it stay like this for a bit.  I plan on telling everyone who is shocked that I just went back to my natural blonde color. HAHA.</li>
            <li> So I tried to be cheap and dye my hair from medium brown to dark blonde and of course it turned orangy.  I went to a salon to have it fixed and after 2 attempts at fixing it I left with darker orangy hair.  After reading all of the reviews I could find I decided to try this product to minimize the brassiness in my hair, even after reading all of the mixed reviews.  The product directions say to leave this on for 10 minutes, but many of the reviews recommended up to 45 minutes so I went the semi-cautious route and applied it for 20 minutes (once applied I set the timer for 10 minutes and ended up adding an additional 5 minutes so estimating 20 minutes total).  The product is thick (like glue) so I initially tried to apply it using the bottle but quickly removed the bottle top and poured it into my gloved hands and applied it that way, which I found quicker and more thorough.  I didn&#x27;t note any odor while applying this product.  I initially thought it resolved the brassiness but my daughter quickly informed me it looked the same but slightly darker.  The same evening as I applied it my friends told me my hair had a green tint to it (I had read some reviews that mentioned a green outcome) so of course I was upset.  I waited 2 days to wash my hair after applying and in my opinion it is more red/orange after using this product than it was to begin with.  The product says it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair, but it does!  I realize I&#x27;ve had multiple color applications in a 2 week period of time, but to the point I used this product it was relatively healthy but after using this it feels very dry.  I&#x27;m disappointed that I ordered 2 boxes to keep one as a spare for the next oopsy haircolor fiasco, but it will be going in the trash.  I very much regret using this product and as it was Loreal haircolor that started this mess and this product only made it worse I won&#x27;t be buying Loreal haircolor products in the future.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.  Removed all the red from what should have not turned out to be dark reddish brown hair.  I do have faint gold highlights - which looks good, actually.  I could use another box.  It is very easy to use as the mixture becomes thick enough to not be drippy which makes the whole process simple and clean.  I did follow one reviewers advice and use the product for much longer than the ridiculous time of 5 minutes recommended by the instructions.  I used it for 40 minutes and that was just about right - especially for dark colored hair tint.  Have extremely sensitive skin and had zero trouble with the product, that is why I gave it four stars.  It isn&#x27;t perfect, but very, very good with no hideous smell or side effects.  The conditioner that comes with the brass banisher is lovely and smells very nice.  Go for it.</li>
            <li> not for brunettes or dark hair:&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally black brown hair and has dyed it a light brown auburn. The color faded to this gross brassy orange that i needed to get rid of. This was the first and only product i found that claimed to do just that. So instead of re dying over my hair, i just got this. Well needless to say, it didnt benefit my hair nor did it do what it said. I do notice a slightly darker tint  but...no where near what i really wanted.  i will never repurchase again...it just sucked. (waste of time)</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and light brown and I have been bleaching it for the past few years. the outer top layer that is exposed to sun a lot gets very brassy and I have yet to find something that helps get rid of brassy hair. actually I am basically at the point of giving it up and dying it brown to cover the brass.&lt;br /&gt;Decided to buy this cause what the heck its cheap and it cant make it much worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews saying it needs more than the 5-10 minutes so i left it in for a good 30+ minutes. (i did not bleach before because i decided I will not bleach my hair anymore. only highlights, since im giving up and plan on going back to my natural color)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when washing out I used a purple shampoo (another disapointment that only slightly keeps brassyness at bay). I also have a shower filter to filter out the iron in our well water that turns hair orange. the conditioner this comes with is not bad it really moisturized well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came out of the shower and no change if anything it made the top layer even brassier. but It seems there have been some good success stories with this product and it may have not worked on my becuase I didn&#x27;t bleach it first. if your desperate id still give it a try for less than $10 rather than a salon</li>
            <li> I used this to help take some red n brass tone out of my recently dyed hair.  I left this on for 50mins and when I washed it out I really didnt feel like this did anything to help the brassy unnatural tones that were showing on my hair</li>
            <li> I bleach my medium brown hair and I have trouble with an orange color in it. This product made my blonde color darker, and only got rid of some of the orange.</li>
            <li> I left it on for 45 minutes and it did absolutely nothing. No difference! I used Wella T14 the next day and got great results.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. I wasted my time, I wasted my money and I ended up damaging my hair for nothing. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> THROW AWAY THAT CONDITIONER RIGHT NOW! There&#x27;s something in it that I was allergic to and after taking my hair out of the towel, the fumes caused an allergic reaction that caused my eyes to swell completely shut. I know it was the conditioner because it happened after I completed the process and not when the product was in my hair, nor when the fumes were being suppressed by the water or trapped in the towel. It didn&#x27;t even smell good or make my hair softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the product works pretty well. I have naturally dark ash-brown hair that I had previously semi-permanently dyed auburn and the red dye has been stained into my hair for seven months. I used this product for 15 minutes as recommended by other girls with dark hair, longer than the recommended 5-10 for light haired girls. Since it&#x27;s more of a glaze than a total color, there was almost no mess. I wiped it off my skin with cool water whenever I touched it and it must have come right off, because there was no staining on my skin and only a little bit on the washcloth. Now the red is gone; my hair is more of dark brown with blonde highlights (reflections?) from the previous dye. Still not my natural color, but I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to be. Apparently this washes out after a while, but if semi-permanent red dye can stick around in my hair for 7 months, I don&#x27;t imagine this is going anywhere. Only problem is my hair smells like sulphur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But like I said, TRASH THE CONDITIONER.</li>
            <li> I always keep two or three packages of this at home. I impulsively lighten with all over color or with highlights, and my hair has natural red tones. Brass Banisher removes the orange tint that I get when lightening my hair.</li>
            <li> It does the job it says it does, but this is the only hair product I&#x27;ve ever used that damaged my hair.  I even used it a couple times and each time I had to cut at least an inch off my hair...recommend staying away from the ends of your hair with it</li>
            <li> In the process of going grey. Was hoping it would get more of the brassiness out of my summer hair but it didn&#x27;t. It did blend the grey nicely and softened the hair.</li>
            <li> it left my hair undamaged but also unchanged, if anything the yellow became more noticeable. I gave it two stars only because it didn&#x27;t really do any damage. As far as banishing any brass it was a total waste of time and money</li>
            <li> Situation: Med-Dark brown roots on highlighted hair...roots grew out about 2 inches last highlight 3 months ago. Too cheap to go back and have it redone right now. Bought John Frieda Lightening Spray, used it 3 times, lightened to what looked like a nice golden color...was outside a few days in a row in the sun w/o a hat on...instead of going blonder it got orange/red/brassy, so unnatural looking and I wanted to cry.   Tried a purple shampoo, did nothing, maybe even made it worse? not sure.    So, desperate, I picked this up at WalMart for about the same price as listed on Amazon.  Was so nervous to try it, since I only used the peroxide spray on my roots and bangs, I only really applied this Brass Banisher to those areas as well. I was afraid it would do something weird to the previously highlighted ends.  I left it on my crown and bangs for 20 min from start to finish, and let me say..I don&#x27;t have thick hair and it took a full 10 min to get it into my hair. I can&#x27;t imagine how long it would have taken if I did my ends too! It is very thick like glue, and it does work in eventually, but it is time consuming. I wasn&#x27;t sure when to start timing...when it first touches your hair, or when you are completely done. So anyway, the smell is not terrible, but it isn&#x27;t pleasant either. Kinda made my nose itch and eyes water at first, but not as bad as  ahome perm or anything.  It comes with gloves which is nice and a packet of deep conditioner to use afterwards. At 20 min I hopped in the shower and lathered and rinsed. Did not shampoo.  Did half the packet of conditioner (saved the rest for tomorrow) and left on for 2 min.  Let my hair air dry as to not do more damage to the ends from blow drying again.    Result...subtle change. Nothing drastic. In my bathroom flourescent lighting, it still looks brassy in most spots, except for my bangs, they look pretty good in all light. In natural light my crown looks much better, only reddish in a few spots, but my hair has some natural reds in it anyway, so  I dont mind some reddish..just not the entire crown.  It didn&#x27;t change the color of blonde in my hair from my previous highlight on any of the hair it did touch or my bangs, so I was happy with that as I have read some people complain of darker hair.  My blonde def. doesn&#x27;t look like the beautiful hair on the box...it is not \\&quot;cool\\&quot; it is still \\&quot;warm\\&quot;. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle, just hoping for a little more debrassing.  I might pick up another box in a week or so and repeat and see if I can help some more.    Over all, the product did nothing to hurt me, didn&#x27;t make me sick, burn, or make my hair green or anything terrible. Its cheap enough to try again, if nothing else the deep conditioner was prob worth ten bucks alone.  After my hair is dry, I can smell something on it still...smells like I just came home from the salon.  You prob don&#x27;t want to do this right before a big date...do it in the middle of the week so all the smell is washed out and gone.</li>
            <li> I use this product in conjunction with L&#x27;Oreal Les Blondessimes Extra Light Natural Blond, and it gives me the exact shade of medium gold that I like.  It only takes 10 minutes, but I would prefer if I could use it right in with the color for a one-step treatment like my old Clairol toner used to.  The bottom line is that this product requires more time, but it is worth it to get the results you&#x27;re after.  I saw some horror stories here, but I think it depends on your hair type and how closely you follow directions.  No stranger to hair coloring disasters myself and allergic to high salon prices, I read directions carefully no matter how often I use the product.  My natural color is medium brown with red and gold highlights--now turning gray--and it&#x27;s also fine, so what works for one person may not work for another.  My advice is to call the toll free number on the box if you have any questions, because the people at L&#x27;Oreal are always happy to help.  The most important thing to remember, however, is don&#x27;t leave it on too long!</li>
            <li> I did what the directions told me to do, applied even on dry hair, wait 5 min. rinse. add conditioner wait 2 min. rinse. But came out with extactly what I started brownish redish hair :(</li>
            <li> Definitely took a lot of the yellow out of my daughter&#x27;s new, home done, blonde. It&#x27;s much softer looking now. This isn&#x27;t a colorant, it won&#x27;t make your hair blonder but it toned down the yellows and oranges nicely in only ten minutes.</li>
            <li> Worked really well at getting rid of orange and yellow brassiness from my bleached hair. However, be forewarned, this is a toner, which means you are putting semi-permanent tone or color onto your hair, which will result in your blonde being subdued somewhat - if you have bright yellow blonde hair, this will tone it down, but in the process you will be going slightly - very slightly but for some its a big deal -  darker blonde. This toner will not give you white hair if you bleached to yellow and want platinum. There are other toners specifically made for that. Wella Color Charm White Lady is one such toner for that purpose. This Brass Banisher is just to take out brassiness from blonde hair that has either been freshly bleached and is too brassy or that needs a little refreshing and blending. The effects are subtle but important - my blonde looks a lot more natural now even though I&#x27;m sporting roots - it looks like it was bleached out more by the sun than by a bottle, thanks to the evening out of tone this product did. I&#x27;m happy with the results and will purchase again when I get brassy.</li>
            <li> I had perfectly fine highlights in my naturally golden brown hair. my roots had begun to look terrible in my opinion, so like I have done in the past, I bleached a fairly large face-framing streak, to hide my roots right by my face. I used kaleidocolors neutral powder with 30 vol developer. however, it&#x27;s never happened before but my hair turned neon yellow! with a little white and some orange. I was leaving for Florida the day after and started panicking. brass banisher sounded like the perfect solution based on the box and reviews I&#x27;d read. I went ahead and tried it. left it on for almost 20 minutes then followed up with silver plus purple shampoo. my hair is now a beautiful combination of champagne, honey, and silvery white highlights. overall it balanced and somewhat neutralized my hair color. I would recommend this to anyone with a bad bleach accident or someone with spotty hair. it did leave my hair dry but it still looks shiny.</li>
            <li> Hard on hair, and did not work well for blondes.</li>
            <li> It really does dry your hair out, but that&#x27;s to be expected since it bleaches the gold tones out of your hair. It lightens it about a shade: from red to gold, gold to neutral and neutral to cool. Do not leave in for more than five minutes and do not color or do any other processing treatment directly before or after or it will seriously damage your hair.</li>
            <li> I have difficult to color hair- even when it&#x27;s done professionally. I normally get my hair colored almost platinum at the salon but lately I haven&#x27;t had time to schedule an appointment. My natural color is a dark blonde/light brown with a red tint and even my professional stylist has trouble getting parts of it to turn blonde instead of orange- it can take hours. Since I couldn&#x27;t make time to get it colored the usual way, I did what so many women before me have done- I bought a cheap box hair color and thought I could fix my roots all by myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It almost worked...quite a bit turned the right shade but there was also a lot of baby chick yellow. It was definitely an obvious at-home job. Thank goodness for Brass Banisher!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read other reviews and didn&#x27;t follow the package&#x27;s directions. I applied it throughout the length of my hair instead of  just the problem area in case it changed the color too much. I also left it on for 25 minutes, washed it with purple toning shampoo afterward and before using the included conditioner (which is amazing), then let it dry naturally. It &amp;#34;banished&amp;#34; the baby chick yellow just as promised! My hair is still soft and shiny and looks pretty much like it does when I leave the salon. It may not work for everyone but for me it was perfect plus a time and money saver!</li>
            <li> i used the product and unfortunately, no change to the brassiness.</li>
            <li> Took the brassiness out, but my hair still has an orange tint to it. Would recommend wella toner over this.</li>
            <li> I use it every time my hair looks brassy, it works wonders! You can&#x27;t find it in any stores in my area so I always order it. It needs to stay on WAY longer than it says it it&#x27;s gonna work</li>
            <li> This worked perfectly !! Exactly as described. I would highly recommend it if you want to get the brassiness out of your hair.</li>
            <li> I am a pale beigey blonde, very fair skintone, with blue eyes.  I&#x27;ve been battling brassiness for some time and wonder if it may have something to do with  high chlorine/mineral content in the water in Atlanta.  At any rate, this product is phenomenal.  The closest rival that I&#x27;ve found is \\&quot;UnRed\\&quot; by Ardell - typically only found at Sally&#x27;s or online.  Both products do essentially the same job, but Brass Banisher seems to be more nourishing for the hair, leaving it soft with a super glassy shine.  This is hard to find, so I stock up.  Please continue to make this product, L&#x27;Oreal!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do much for me at all. After coloring my hair with a honey blonde dye from naturtint, I was left with light blonde hair with an orange tint. After reading all of the reviews, I decided to leave this product on for double the recommended time. Unfortunately, it still didn&#x27;t do much if anything besides darken my hair a little. It&#x27;s still very orange.</li>
            <li> It turned my orange hair purple, but left it silky.  (my natural color is white)</li>
            <li> My ash blonde hair was getting a little brassy, both the natural parts and the highlighted parts. I used this with such high hopes and it made the matters worse, so now I have overall orange hair. This sucks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Brass Banisher is ABSOLUTELY terrifc!! After attempting to remove a \\&quot;temporary\\&quot; demicolor (which has been in my hair x 3 months). I used a blonde kit on my hair. I ended up with either orange or goldilocks colored hair, depends on your color perception - most attractive! I was unable to address the problem for 2 days due to work schedule so I ordered this product from Amazon- wonderful website. On my day off and product delivered as Amazon promised I applied this product. I left it on for 15min because I&#x27;m not really good at following instructions. To my DELIGHT and SURPRISE I now no longer have orange/ goldilocks hair. I know it&#x27;s Halloween time but get real, I DO NOT like these colors on my head. This is a truly marvelous product which delivers as advertised!!</li>
            <li> After turning my hair the most horrible yellow jello color, I thought I&#x27;d have to spend a fortune for a hairdresser to fix it.  This product took all the yellow/orange out of my hair and left it soft and manageable.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Keeping a box of this on the shelf for future mishaps!</li>
            <li> This is my account, but it&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s hair. I&#x27;ll let her talk about it.&lt;br /&gt;I have colored my own hair for over 20 years and have never had a problem. I was told my luck would eventually run out, and it did today. I usually use L&#x27;Oreal color, but I couldn&#x27;t find the color I wanted, so I picked a Nice &#x27;n Easy light auburn. (I&#x27;m naturally dark blonde.) Well, let&#x27;s just say that if it were closer to Halloween I could have gone as the Great Pumpkin. BRIGHT red and orange.&lt;br /&gt;It was shocking!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Brass Banisher before to calm down the gold of lighter shades, so I made my way to Walmart for this fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;My hair was so red/orange that I wore a hat to the store. Once I got home, I used the entire product...even though my hair is only past my ears. As soon as I started applying it, I could see color coming out. I didn&#x27;t start timing it until I had applied the entire bottle, and then I left it on for about 15 more minutes.  My hair is a richer color now, more deep tones and not a bit of orange to be found.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and I highly recommend it. It doesn&#x27;t itch (Nice &#x27;n Easy does itch), and it smells fine. I was a little worried about damage, but even though I have fine hair it came out alright.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU L&#x27;OREAL!</li>
            <li> Did not do a thing for my hair. I&#x27;ve bleached it before and then used a dye or toner to get rid of those brassy oranges and yellow tones you get. This did not do that!!</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is very dark brown. I decided to go blond again (a decision I make every couple years LOL). In the past it&#x27;s always been a long, arduous process which usually leaves me with orange hair for awhile. This time I used Manic Panic to strip it followed by this product. In about two hours I had platinum blond hair, not a hint of orange or red.</li>
            <li> this takes the yellow out of home processed color jobs and saves a lot of money from high salon prices</li>
            <li> I have pretty much platinum hair and it usually gets super brassy every time I dye it , so when I saw this I couldn&#x27;t resist buying it but  sadly it did nothing for me&lt;br /&gt;If you really need something that helps with the brassiness don&#x27;t waste your money on this</li>
            <li> excellent product, have used in past, works exactly as promised</li>
            <li> Gets rid of the brassy color, it works</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to use this in a long time, but when I was experimenting with hair colors this was the ONLY thing that took the crap/orange out of my hair..Once I left blonde on too long and it turned orangey and yellow..after using this it was as if I had done nothing to my hair.. which was GREAT!!! Only sad thing is that is has to be ordered online and take days to get here.. sometimes local drug stores would have it..highly recommend though..!</li>
            <li> My hair is dark blonde with a few greys here and there. I usually dye my roots a medium blonde to lighten it a little and cover the grey. I recently dyed my dark blonde roots using a new brand (big mistake!) and it turned the first few inches of my hair a BRIGHT, brassy orange-red. It was horrible, the top of my head was orange and the rest of my hair was blonde. I researched how to fix it and I came across this product. I left it on for 40 minutes like other reviewers said. After that I used Shimmer Lights purple shampoo (which I left in for 30+ minutes using a shower cap.) After that my roots were still orange but they were not as severe or brassy. This product definitely didn&#x27;t fix the whole problem but it did soften the orange and I think in the end it made it easy to get me back to a normal color. I folowed up by using Nice N Easy&#x27;s 8A Medium Ash Blonde the day after and that did the trick. My hair was a nice beige medium blonde color. My orange color was very severe so it took a few steps to fix it but I think this product would probably work wonders on anyone who has a yellow brassy problem or even a little orange brassiness.</li>
            <li> Turned my hair red despite of the box stating that it would not. My hair was virgin dirty blonde. Product sucks. Should be taken off market. Wish they would pay for me to have it fixed.</li>
            <li> Tried this after my color faded and turned brassy-looking. I followed the directions then left it on for about 5 extra minutes. I barely (if at all?) noticed ANY difference after using Brass Banisher; was certainly hoping for-- and expecting more. I was very disappointed and won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I could see that it helped, but maybe next time I should leave it on for the full 10 minutes since I still had some brassy areas.  Will still try it again.</li>
            <li> NICE PRODUCT. NOT SURE IF I WANT TO KEEP ON SPENDING THIS MONEY EACH MONTH OR 2. DOES REALLY CUT DOWN ON BRASSINESS.</li>
            <li> Fluorescent can look great, for accessories, maybe clothing, but not in hair.  Highlighting my dark red hair led to fluorescent orange.  I don&#x27;t blame the highlights; as my dark red is color treated over already naturally red-toned hair, I expected my highlights to need some toning.  But this product, after left on twice as long as suggested (20 minutes), made such a tiny difference that I regret putting my hair through the chemical process.  It looks slightly less bright in some places, but where it was the worst, the very front crown, there was no difference.  I suspect that leaving this on even longer, 30 to 45 minutes, may have made a more noticeable difference.  I chose to double the time after reading reviews where people did leave this on longer than 10 minutes and got good results.  I feared damaging my hair though-- unlike the boxed haircolor and highlights I used, both ammonia free, this gave my scalp a slight burning feeling and had that awful hair dye smell.  Rather than buying another box of this and leaving it on longer, I am trying the Ardell Red Out along with AG&#x27;s blue conditioner.  I hope they help!  If you try this, if you have a ton of brass like me, I suggest leaving it on for greater than 30 minutes as long as your hair is kind of healthy.  Good luck in your journey to fix your hair!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have brassy hair from a coloring mishap, but rather from hardwater buildup. That was a mistake. I suspect this dye could have been some use with people who ended up with orange hair who were going for blonde, but all I got was DARKER hair (not an unpleasant shade or anything, but not what I was going for).&lt;br /&gt;If you are going for the blonde shade pictured on the box, uh...&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;d really be better off lightening it yourself again at home, especially because this color does essentially the same thing. I lighten my hair a lot, so it was already pretty damaged, but it definitely got noticeably more damaged after this application. I left it on for about 20 minutes (mistake!), and I paid for it. I&#x27;ve read people saying that if you leave it on less the less your hair darkens, but the difference is probably only slight. I wouldn&#x27;t bet on it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a horrible experience but im also not satisfied.  I am a natural dirty blonde with salon white blonde highlights.  I get my hair done every 5 weeks.  I used this product because I have an event and I&#x27;m not due for an appointment yet.  My highlights look nice but the rest of my hair is a bit brassy.  Also I find toning my hair makes it feel healthier, which is the main reason I did it.  I watched many YouTube reviews and decided to leave it on for 30 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Left my hair more of a solid blended tone.  My nice white highlights actually seem brassier now.&lt;br /&gt;Need two boxes if you have even remotely thick or long hair&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner is nice (not as nice as other reviewers say) and it smells nice&lt;br /&gt;Roots are blended, could help you prolong time between coloring if you don&#x27;t mind losing the dimension of your highlights and low lights&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t ruin my hair but definitely didn&#x27;t improve it.  For someone who wants a white blonde look, this is not the product for you</li>
            <li> This works just how it says. Always read the box first people. This does not damage your hair because it is just a toner.</li>
            <li> I felt like it took what little shine out of&lt;br /&gt;my hair I had left, but my hair was pretty&lt;br /&gt;processed to begin with.  It got some of the&lt;br /&gt;brassiness out.</li>
            <li> I spent the morning high lighting my hair. Bright beautiful blonde. Had a few yellowy spots from previous. Just used the product, and took ALL my high lights out . Very disappointed :( after I dried it, I did decide that I like the color, but it is not as light blonde as I normally like it to be.</li>
            <li> Did nothing to my hair.</li>
            <li> Ok so this will not give you the results you want if you&#x27;re trying to bring your yellow gold bleached hair to platinum.  It won&#x27;t give you even light ashy blonde. It will however even out your blonde and give it a believable tone. Softens the color and gets rid of the uneven tones. If you want ash or platinum you need to use one of the well a toners. I like T14 silver lady mixed with T18 white lady. Creates an amazing ashy ultra light blonde tone. I wanted to try this and now that I have I&#x27;ll be going back to my well a toners. For a quick fix of an off tone blonde this will work.</li>
            <li> I dyed brown over old red, and the old red keeps sneaking through.  This helped some.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I was unhappy with how gold my hair looked after recent highlights and this product toned them down very nicely.</li>
            <li> Red to Blonde... this product works well.</li>
            <li> my hair did not look  any  better.second time left it on longer,and hairstill reddish,</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take the brass out of my hair.  I am naturally light brown but color my hair medium blonde, still very brassy after leaving the product on for the specified time.</li>
            <li> This is THE best out of salon brass banisher EVER. My hair is dark brown with many platinum highlights that naturally go red with my normal pigmentation. I use this product about once every 2 weeks to remove the brassy changes. It does darken my highlights a bit for the first few days- but that is a small downside for such long lasting positive effects!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I am mixed race and went from red to black to bleaching my hair. I always get orange when I try and bleach my hair but this time I had some bright yellow also. I applied this tonight and left it on for 20 minutes. I know have beautiful golden curls and the colors are blended beautifully. I will definitely use this again when I re-bleach.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect miracles. It works to tone down your hair a bit, but will not fix extremely orange hair. For the little bit of a yellow tint I had, it did it&#x27;s job. However, my purple shampoo does the same thing in just one wash.</li>
            <li> I am going from blonde to my own gray.  This is helping in the transition!</li>
            <li> I had platinum blonde dyed hair with an ash blonde low light through.I wanted to do my roots but didn&#x27;t have product our time to do the ash thus the ash didn&#x27;t take well and I ended up with yellow yellow streaks. This fixed it one hundred percent, leave in ten minutes,!I did two five minute sessions</li>
            <li> It did nothing for my orangish hair</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference after using this. My blonde hair was still brassy, didn&#x27;t really look like I had did anything to fix it. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson since and will never attempt blonde at home... ever.</li>
            <li> really worked great! took the orange tone out of my hair after bleaching it.</li>
            <li> THE PICTURE ON THE BOX IS SOOOO MISLEADING!!!  This product actually DARKENED my new expensive salon highlights and only made my base color more orange!  It IS a peroxide based product even though it proclaims that it has no ammonia! As all peroxide based products, it IS damaging to hair! The gloss conditioner can&#x27;t un-do the damage from the peroxide.  BIG MISTAKE ON MY PART!!!</li>
            <li> My son used a sun in type product that turned his hair orange. we tried to correct it by dying his hair med ash blonde still red orange color hair... found and used this product and it made his hair worse more red.... BEWARE it could make your hair worse</li>
            <li> This is a good toner to help get the &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; out of your blonde;  however, I&#x27;ve had to leave it on at least 20 minutes to see results as opposed to the 5 or 10 minutes the instructions recommend.</li>
            <li> I have a natural red tone to my medium/dark blonde hair. I recently lightened it by just one shade and the red tones were made more pronounced. So, I bought this product hoping that it would neutralize this effect. I followed the directions properly and it actually darkened my hair color and I seem to have even more red tones to my hair. This was a total waste of my money and time. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I would have given it 0 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I give it 1 star because it didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m give it 2 stars if the box had made an disclaimer letting me and all the other brunettes know it would not work for us. It specifically states it will remove red/orange/yellow tints from color treated hair, but not dark hair. Blondes, I think it&#x27;ll work just fine. But, for darker hair, just pass. You&#x27;ll waste your time. Not to mention you&#x27;ll sacrifice your hair&#x27;s health in a pointless process.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely horrible. Instead of taking away warm tones it made the color even more reddish.&lt;br /&gt;I have brunette hair and wanted my highlights to be more ashy.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the review of another user and let the product sit for 30 minutes. I do not recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> Honestly I was kind of expecting it to be a lot better, just didn&#x27;t work as good on my hair as I thought it would. But hey, if you don&#x27;t try something at least once, you will never know, but it might work for someone else, it just didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I rarely leave negative feedback cause I always research about products I buy on Amazon, esp hair related... This time I feel that that I was deceived by numerous positive reviews. Alas, this only slightly removed the redness to almost not discernible way leaving my hair orangy. Mind you, I kept the product for 55 min cause I have been testing each 10 min by washing small areas of my hair and sadly the product did not meet my expectation. I think now after my mishap with the color trying to color ash blond my chestnut hair I just ruined my hair. You better off go to salon or try some other remedies, such as purple shampoo or, even better, for the price - re-color your hair into brass free ash or blond if you want to stay away from redness.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product, but after using it for three differet times, Each time has been great. I have natural reddish hair...with my budget the salon is out of the question. It has made my hair a more natural looking blonde. So for me this product is a dream come true</li>
            <li> It didn t do what it said it would still had the brassiness</li>
            <li> This does help tone down reds and orange tints in your hair if there is not too much. But it also sells at wal mart for only 8 dollars so I will get it there next time.</li>
            <li> Works amazing!  Also works very fast!  I will buy again!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  Love, love, love it.  Sometimes I touch up my roots and highlights between professional appts.  This product totally blended the color and took out all brassiness.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Decided to highlight my hair on the spur of the moment. Of course I didn&#x27;t let it lift enough so had those brassy orange-y roots and yellow highlights. This worked as promised. Super easy to use, smells good and the conditioner that comes with it IS worth the cost of this product alone as other reviewers have said. Totally saved my hair.</li>
