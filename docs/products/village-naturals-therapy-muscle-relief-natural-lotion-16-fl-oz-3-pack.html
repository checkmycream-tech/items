            <li>Got 3 bottles only 2 and just over a half able to be used.</li>
            <li>And like they advertise - &amp;#34;It&#x27;s 90.74% naturally</li>
            <li>but i personally wasnt a fan too much menthol</li>
            <li>This stuff really works on my back!  </li>
            <li>I was surprised by this product it helps to relieve the pain in my legs and lower back.</li>

            <li> Stuff works great, lasts long, and really reaches those deep muscles. I use it after working out and sports, it just gets the job done. The mentholated feel also makes it feel like massage</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for use in wide range of applications.</li>
            <li> just used it last night for the first time.  works great.  just keep away from face and genitals or some burning may occur.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I purchased this in November.  Using it on skin other than hands, which the epidermis is relatively thick, has an immediate cooling effect.  To the degree that you feel cold and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bottle is enough for use on hands.  Three....it&#x27;s gonna take months and months to use it all up.</li>
            <li> As a massage therapist I wanted something to use on my sore muscles. Initially the smell is very like Ben Gay but it fades super fast and the warmth kicks in nicely. I used it on my back several times and felt relief within minutes. I gave a jar to two of my friends,one who is also a massage therapist. They both love it.</li>
            <li> for me to use this muscle relief is very good.i&#x27;m telling other people to try it.</li>
            <li> best buy! I loved the lotion! it smell perfectly wonderful.  def buy it again</li>
            <li> Now I am giving it to friends and family as gifts, so they can feel good and pain free too. .</li>
            <li> My wife works at a computer all day.  I buy this product for her, she SWEARS by it.  Its better then ICY HOT, BEN GAY or any of those other products.  And like they advertise - &amp;#34;It&#x27;s 90.74% naturally derived.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all know the saying... happy wife, happy life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men - buy it!&lt;br /&gt;Women - use it!</li>
            <li> Husband and I love it and will order it again</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It really helps relax my muscles after a hard work out.</li>
            <li> The lotion produces a sensation of cold on the skin, which helps with pain.  Unfortunately, the effect lasts less than an hour.  The scent is like anise, not unpleasant.  The lotion softens skin, and may be good in itself for that reason.</li>
            <li> Very strong spearmint smell, which puts me off a bit. Works wonders to soothe achy joints though. I prefer this brand&#x27;s lotion in the lavender/chamomile/menthol formulation... can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li> Love how it make me feel</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing.  I have fibromyalgia and neuropathy in my left thigh.  I also have. Osteoarthritis especially in my hands This is the only product that has even helped with the pain.</li>
            <li> Feels silky not greasy and great smell.</li>
            <li> Very good for body pains</li>
            <li> Amazing lotion! I love it and will buy again!</li>
            <li> Most excellent product! Works wonderful on my aching bones and muscles</li>
            <li> buy again. this one is a must buy! not everyone can use bio freeze.</li>
            <li> Works well on aching sore muscles...had my doubts but I am happy with the product and how it works.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by this product it helps to relieve the pain in my legs and lower back. Very Very disappointed that the one pump top was opened and part of the product was throughout the plastic bag. Got 3 bottles only 2 and just over a half able to be used.</li>
            <li> I do get some relief from this lotion and have use it on clients also.they have told me they love it</li>
            <li> Great for my fibromyalgia symptoms! smells great too!</li>
            <li> I use these lotions in lieu with another massage lotion at my place of work. This lotion is a great alternative to Tiger Balm brand and helps when performing deep tissue on anyone with tight, strained muscles. The smell is fabulous and I have received numerous compliments from my clients inquiring about where and what kind of lotion I used on them. I still have a bottle and half remaining, and will definitely be purchasing this again. I like that this lotion comes in a 3pk and the each bottle is 16oz. Definitely affordable at $19.95.</li>
            <li> Not a miracle worker but it is great for some relief!</li>
            <li> Way too much menthol, almost like icy hot. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I had woken up with a stiff neck, sore back and hurting arm. Did I do anything spectacular? No, I just fell asleep in a horribly uncomfortable position and slept solidly for several hours. I refused to look like I was auditioning for the Hunchback of Notre Dam so I showered with the muscle relief body wash (of the same company) and when I got out I lotioned with this aches and pains muscle relief lotion. I definetly felt whatever was in there working. I&#x27;m not getting paid for this or have no ties to the company so know that I am not lying.&lt;br /&gt;Will this work for someone with long term chronic pain? I have no idea. I would certainly try it though to see if it provided at least a tinge of relief. However for a minor ache or pain, I would definitely recommend it. Just know that it does have a scent with it. It wasn&#x27;t horrible or unbearable for me, but just a heads up, this cream is scented.</li>
            <li> received part lotion smeared in box</li>
            <li> Gift for my wife she swears it&#x27;s the best thing for back pain.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this for back pain and it does a very good job for her.  She has also used Biofreeze which she found about equally effective.  Biofreeze, however, if far more expensive.  We, therefore, prefer Village Naturals Muscle relief lotion over Biofreeze.</li>
            <li> Just started using.  No conclusion, but I use everyday and so far my elbow feels better.</li>
            <li> Soothes sore muscles!  Try their other products as well for a treat!</li>
            <li> my mother has fibromyalgia and says it works great for her knees but i personally wasnt a fan too much menthol</li>
            <li> This stuff really works on my back!  Gave two bottles away to friends and they think it works great too.</li>
            <li> Got these for my wife&#x27;s persistent pains in her legs and feet. It&#x27;s worked great for her and it really helps keep my hands from getting those cramps while working out her aches.</li>
            <li> Good Lotion. Good value packed in threes . I&#x27;ve recommended it to others who also find the lotion soothing for muscle aches.</li>
            <li> Village Naturals Therapy Muscle Relief Lotion worked just like the package described; right out of a hot bath. I tried using it other times and it was just not the same.</li>
            <li> As expected. Quickly and carefully shipped. No spilling or leaking! Thank you</li>
            <li> Love this product, arrived a day early. Glides with clients and calms them more</li>
            <li> Outstanding long lasting natural refreshing fragrance</li>
            <li> Very good product ,the best</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! Have some pretty advanced arthritis pain on most occasions, and this is better than the $40.00 a tube prescription lotion.  It keeps me able to go up and down ladders at work. If they ever stop making this, we will definitely be rocking chair folk. .</li>
            <li> one of the best pain relief lotion that I have used. It feels fabulous..</li>
            <li> Great product! Makes my back feel amazing!</li>
            <li> Everything I thought it would be.  Love the smell but that does fade in about 10 minutes.  The product works for various aches and pains.  Love it, will order again.</li>
            <li> this is the best muscle relax lotion ever!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product will always be in my home. It is a very good lotion, not too thick or runny, and the aroma is not overpowering, It sure alleviates my pain and helps me to sleep much easier.</li>
