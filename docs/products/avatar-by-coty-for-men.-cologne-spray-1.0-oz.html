            <li>you are looking for sexy man smell but</li>
            <li>wonderful, could not find any where in local stores of this size.my son</li>
            <li>wish I could find some more</li>
            <li>was on his wish list.not a strong smell,compared to axe body sprays.</li>
            <li>years ago it was really cheap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and sexy.  </li>
            <li>The scent is clean and not overpowering, but I wasn&#x27;t blown away.</li>
            <li>He goes through the bottles quickly, Avatar has just become part of his personality and he even passed Avatar to his brother, who also wears it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is worth</li>
            <li>and it arrived right on time...</li>
            <li>um use caution I usually have great</li>
            <li>I was unimpressed at first.</li>
            <li>I have tried, smelled and bought many different brands in my time.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my son, he was very happy, its very hard to find!!</li>
            <li>Wish it was easier to find and didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this for anyone looking for something light and noticeable.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Im a very picky person when it comes to cologne</li>
            <li>I really like the scent of the Avatar cologne and my son</li>
            <li>Got this stuff originally at Walgreens, but I think they stopped selling it, and possibly it is no longer being made.</li>
            <li>Avatar will attract all the ladies, seriously it smells that good.</li>
            <li>smells good enough for a black guy to swipe it from me..</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t praise it enough--I will continue to wear it as long as it remains available.  </li>
            <li>I love this smell and prefer it over many expensive colognes.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an older cologne that I knew was discontinued</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend that your man tries it.</li>
            <li>High quality product.</li>
            <li>now it is pretty much the only cologne I care to wear,</li>
            <li>and when she came outside she said she smelled my cologne right away</li>
            <li>but this is by far a timeless classic.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for getting this back into the real world.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find and is great for a teen or young male.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good but am really sad that they discontinued it, I wish they get it back to the line of products .</li>
            <li>Without fail, women think it smells amazing every time.  </li>
            <li>every woman I have dated and every girlfriend I&#x27;ve had has always complimented me on it, one time I was hiding outside an old girlfriend&#x27;s work and it was kinda windy</li>
            <li>Avatar is subtle, yet strong enough to catch hints of it all night.</li>

            <li> My husband loves Avatar spray cologne for men. Wish it was easier to find and didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
            <li> I have been using Avatar for the past 5 years now it is pretty much the only cologne I care to wear, every woman I have dated and every girlfriend I&#x27;ve had has always complimented me on it, one time I was hiding outside an old girlfriend&#x27;s work and it was kinda windy and when she came outside she said she smelled my cologne right away and it made her happy but she didn&#x27;t see me because I was hiding!</li>
            <li> smells good enough for a black guy to swipe it from me.. why I bought this one..</li>
            <li> Got this stuff originally at Walgreens, but I think they stopped selling it, and possibly it is no longer being made. I was unimpressed at first. The scent is clean and not overpowering, but I wasn&#x27;t blown away. However, almost every time I wear this, I get compliments on the scent from men and women alike. I&#x27;m constantly being asked what cologne I wear when I use it, and, of course, no one has ever heard of it. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this for anyone looking for something light and noticeable.</li>
            <li> Coty needs to make this product again!!!! It smells amazing on my husband.</li>
            <li> My husbands.  This is an awesome scent.  It&#x27;s very gentle and sexy.  The 1.0 Oz is a great buy for about 10$.  Strongly recommend that your man tries it.</li>
            <li> I am a fanatic of cologne. I have tried, smelled and bought many different brands in my time. However I always seem to go back to this one. Its a bit hard to find at times, but this is by far a timeless classic. THANKS</li>
            <li> No this cologne may not be the most expensive cologne in the world, but Avatar will always be in my husband&#x27;s collection. I love this smell and prefer it over many expensive colognes. Avatar is subtle, yet strong enough to catch hints of it all night. This is my favorite cologne for men. Perfect for any man!</li>
            <li> its not a strong sent and it lasts along time. Im a very picky person when it comes to cologne and i love this one and get complements all the time.</li>
            <li> so I took a chance in order this it&#x27;s an older cologne that I knew was discontinued and I used to use it years ago it was really cheap and I enjoyed ityeah this is nothing like it should be I don&#x27;t know the score was old or this is a fake but it smells terrific it it smells like the most horrific thing I can state without being overzealous my review um use caution I usually have great is on but with this item cannot be returned I will do it on my credit card company and see where that goes</li>
            <li> Can you imagine, some people were trying to sell this cologne on line for over 100 dollars? Well it looks like Amazon took the bull by the horns and offered it for a price that is more in line with the product. 18 bucks it is worth but 100...No Way!!  Thanks Amazon for getting this back into the real world.</li>
            <li> This my husband favorite cologne. I was so happy to find it here I just had to get it for my husband.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son, he was very happy, its very hard to find!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good but am really sad that they discontinued it, I wish they get it back to the line of products .</li>
            <li> I love this cologne, got it for my husbands birthday and it arrived right on time... i love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Niii-ce !! Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere ~ so thanx !!!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this cologne religiously for almost 15 years.  Without fail, women think it smells amazing every time.  Every.  Time.  I can&#x27;t praise it enough--I will continue to wear it as long as it remains available.  Seriously, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my Avatar cologne by Coty, I would recommend it very highly. High quality product.This will make any man happy as a gift</li>
            <li> A friend of mine has this cologne, and after smelling it I thought it would make a nice gift. Bonus: it smells so good! Definitely a good choice for any guy in your life.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mens cologne for my then boyfriend and now fiancee.  I love it on him, the smell is sexy and manly, bt not musky.  It smells like some of the fancier and more expensive (designer) colognes.  He goes through the bottles quickly, Avatar has just become part of his personality and he even passed Avatar to his brother, who also wears it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for sexy man smell but something that does not overpower the nostrils.  Avatar will attract all the ladies, seriously it smells that good.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of the Avatar cologne and my son requests it every time he runs out.  It is hard to find and is great for a teen or young male.</li>
            <li> wonderful, could not find any where in local stores of this size.my son was very happy i got it for him.it was on his wish list.not a strong smell,compared to axe body sprays. doesn&#x27;t bother my nose/sinuses as bad as Axe products</li>
            <li> wish I could find some more</li>
            <li> Good buy and prompt delivery. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I shopped all over and finally just order it online to have it by holidays. None of the malls had the product</li>
