            <li>Well it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>This product is good for on the go.</li>
            <li>It&#x60;s so good</li>

            <li>I was not disappointed and was very impressed as to how sturdy and well made it is.  </li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with this mirror.</li>

            <li>I love this mirror!</li>
            <li>The tension of the joints holds perfectly for whatever exact adjustment angle you need.</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Make sure to read what size before buying !</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Probably more than you ever wanted to see, but you can&#x27;t stop looking because you&#x27;ve never seen it before!</li>
            <li>exactly the perfect size for traveling.</li>
            <li>Nice and compact for travel.  </li>
            <li>And, the mirror is a nice size, looks good on your tabletop, nightstand, or bathroom counter top...</li>
            <li>magnification is nice.  </li>
            <li>A case would be nice, but not at the expense of mirror quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was paying so much attention to finding the greatest magnification and looking for 15x,</li>
            <li>so it fits nicely on the sink or in your suitcase.  </li>
            <li>It stands up well and folds up with no problem of collapsing on its own</li>
            <li>Handy item for travel.  </li>
            <li>Perfect size for travel and very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>This mirror came in handy.</li>
            <li>Nice mirror.</li>
            <li>Very nice items, fast shipping, great transaction.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for small counters and the adjustable height make it perfect wherever you are.</li>
            <li>OK, I own a 15X mirror already but wanted one for traveling.  </li>
            <li>I love this mirror - easily adjustable, good clarity and magnification.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to the diameter of the mirror...</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll want more than one of these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Mirror is cute and magnification is OK.</li>
            <li>I love 15 magnification mirror.</li>
            <li>so I can set it on the vanity top.</li>
            <li>Make sure to read your dimensions before ordering this product.</li>
            <li>You can hang this from the top rim of the tabletop model to add additional magnification and height.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten used to a magnifying mirror when I put on makeup, and now that I&#x27;ve started travelling more I was looking for one that would fold up to keep in my makeup case.  </li>
            <li>I also wanted more than the 10x</li>
            <li>It is a nice product, comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>The 99¢ store brand I bought was better than this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute</li>
            <li>I do a much better job with it since the size is equipped for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>(could see alot better)</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>quality also better than anticipated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay esp.</li>
            <li>just lovely construction, finish and mirrors.</li>
            <li>so wish I had looked more closely at dimensions Before buying.</li>
            <li>Plan on buying more as grab bag gifts.</li>
            <li>The magnification is ok.</li>
            <li>The magnification is OK</li>
            <li>Make sure you understand the mirror size.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect to be able to see more than one eye at a time.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a mirror that could magnify 15x or more and be able to fit nicely in my travel bag.</li>
            <li>You will not be able to use it to look at your ears, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>:  )</li>
            <li>: Be sure that the mirror is not in a position where it can reflect sunlight.</li>
            <li>I sell at craft fairs with a friend, and many of our items are wearable, like hats and headbands.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.</li>
            <li>Mostly my fault that I purchased this mirror.</li>
            <li>Ended up going to Bed Bath and Beyond to make sure I got the size I wanted.</li>
            <li>it will be better</li>
            <li>Love the magnification and size.  </li>
            <li>The magnification level sure helps to focus on skin problems on the face.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s small, it&#x27;s easily portable, and perfect for travel, but great at home, too.</li>
            <li>This is a late review ( my apologize ) but: still was an excellent purchase, a quickly shipping process and a very good price.</li>
            <li>I have limited counter space in my bathroom, so this was a great find, for a good price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;8/4/14 Mirror still bright as the first day.</li>
            <li>I needed a strong magnified mirror so I could see more than just my nose.  </li>
            <li>The mirror was smaller than I was expecting, however the magnification is very good</li>
            <li>My &#x27;cheap&#x27; 10X works better.</li>
            <li>The magnifying glass on the other side is awesome and so helpful.  </li>
            <li>Better portability than originally intended, I can pack for travel.</li>
            <li>The sturdy folding frame allows easy, compact storage - opened it sits without tipping over.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I can now easily trim my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>It is really strong so you may want to use a lower number than the one I got.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent, small 15X mirror for my needs, and I am glad that I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, if you don&#x27;t mind angling the mirror up it works fine as is.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>TThe mirror is light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The neck makes it great to use for various applications and its easy to fold.</li>
            <li>But this little mirror is perfect for what it is.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent little magnification mirror.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect little make up mirror</li>
            <li>This little mirror is perfect!</li>
            <li>otherwise it is very high quality and a nice mirror.......</li>
            <li>Higher magnification might give you the ability to see more, but if you are not dating a hawk with spectacular vision, then this is just fine, and I am really picky!</li>
            <li>I wish this was bigger, and had a light, but it&#x27;s great for what it is.</li>
            <li>Free  </li>
            <li>Very well made with a nice finish on the metal frame.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I bought another as a backup.  </li>
            <li>The big side actually is great and I like that</li>
            <li>Just wish it had a light.</li>
            <li>I use a book light with it to do my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wonderful for taking on trips, it folds so small and easy to handle</li>
            <li>Very useful for putting on makeup, and the fact that it stands up helps a lot.</li>
            <li>Very useful.  </li>
            <li>Looking forward to getting my new mirror and having more travel adventures with it!</li>
            <li>Anyway, it was shipped quickly and packaged nicely, the price was reasonable too.</li>
            <li>although, I probably would have bought the rubbed bronze one if I had saw that one first I am quite satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this little travel mirror - handy, well put-together, and the velvet drawstring bag did a great job of keeping it safe (also if you pack it in the middle of your toiletries bag, that&#x27;ll help too.  </li>
            <li>Works well, for me; is of sufficiently durable construction for my use,  folds up for travel or out of the way storage, is compact and light-weight, and the price is most reasonable, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>A lovely gift for reasonable money.</li>
            <li>I have a full size one at home</li>
            <li>Good design and solid materials.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a FULL sized mirror....</li>
            <li>Not bad.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfectly fine, high magnification, easy fold up and swivel</li>
            <li>I like it rather than love it as I found a bigger one  that I love.</li>
            <li>Great for my old 50 year old eyes on trips.</li>
            <li>It is just a very nice mirror for positioning on uneven surfaces for hands free use.  </li>
            <li>This is very cute, however it is very, very tiny.</li>
            <li>It is super magnified and can sit easily on the counter or desk without taking up too much space.</li>
            <li>Small, light and great.  </li>
            <li>It magnifies very well and can fold up which is easy to travel with or store in a draw.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>This mirror would be fine except that the magnification side is 15 times which is too much to use as a travel make up mirror</li>
            <li>This is a great little mirror.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little mirror...</li>
            <li>Not cheaply made and a great price.</li>
            <li>I Hang it for everyday use and folds up great for travel.</li>
            <li>You cannot really see much if you&#x27;re trying to apply makeup, but it is very sturdy and the magnifying side is quite nice.</li>
            <li>My mistake, however I placed it in my purse and it is useful for travel</li>
            <li>It is worth having in your makeup kit.</li>
            <li>Love the magnification however this is like the old compact cases you could carry in your purse.  </li>
            <li>No difficulty seeing most everything (I say most because how do you know what you are really not seeing?)  </li>
            <li>Maybe good for make-up, not much else.  </li>
            <li>Be more clear in the product description about the size of the product.</li>
            <li>It may be a teeny bit heavier than a plastic mirror, but worth every ounce.</li>
            <li>This is one of those great little items that is exactly as described-</li>
            <li>this is just right for traveling, and it is so well made.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is just the right size for traveling.</li>
            <li>Everyone is right, needs a protective pouch.</li>
            <li>Folds right up to store and opens and stays where you put it.</li>
            <li>The price is right too.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t read the size right.</li>
            <li>The big problem is having to set the mirror at the perfect angle or you get major distortion, and I can&#x27;t hold my breath long enough to do much good with it.  </li>
            <li>I think that it is a nice product, but would be better suited for small children.</li>
            <li>its is very large</li>
            <li>great travel item as it is small and compact -</li>
            <li>Small but works great</li>
            <li>It is small but all I need to see great detail in the corner of my eye.</li>
            <li>Seems fairly durable, packs down</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, my only wish that it was bigger.  </li>
            <li>This smaller mirror was a great addition to my personal kit for traveling.</li>
            <li>small size makes it easy to store/portable which comes in handy.</li>
            <li>Works great for those of us with new intraocular lenses who are no longer near sighted enough to tweeze eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>It is a perfect size, not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li>The order did not arrive the first time, the company re-sent the item with no problem.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>15x magnification can be a bit overwhelming if you are not used to seeing your face that up close and personal, but this is a tweezers girls dream mirror!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my late 50s and do need reading glasses, so it might work better for younger people with great vision.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a different (better) one at Walmart Online but cheaper than this.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>I would not purchase this item again but probably put out some more money for a much larger mirror.</li>
            <li>but it seems pretty distorted to me</li>
            <li>Please make sure you understand that this mirror is only 3&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Now I can pour over my pores and pluck my eyebrows with ease ;-)</li>
            <li>Good lighting is important, and there are no built-in lights, but if you can use this outdoors or near a window, or have any small lamp with a high resolution white bulb that can give you optimal lighting, I think you will love this!</li>
            <li>Super high magnification.</li>
            <li>Just the right size for close-ups if you don&#x27;t need to see your whole face at one time.</li>
            <li>Okay, perhaps love is a strong term for a small travel mirror, especially when you don&#x27;t use it when traveling.  </li>
            <li>Smaller than expected make sure you check the description :)</li>
            <li>It arrived pretty fast in the mail also.</li>
            <li>small, not practical to produce a make up with good sight (this size).</li>
            <li>It folds up and down nicely.</li>
            <li>Three inches is pretty small, but the adjustment feature works very well, the mirror is very clear and the 15x magnification is greater than most compact magnifying mirrors.</li>
            <li>received my first one as a gift and after using it a few times and loving it, bought one for 3 of my friends.</li>
            <li>The photo looks like it is large</li>
            <li>i wanted a large  mirror  </li>
            <li>The mirror comes with h nice little travel bag.</li>
            <li>On its own little stand and travels well too</li>
            <li>It was a nice little mirror.</li>
            <li>So this is a  nice little buy if you want something to use for, say, your eyebrows</li>
            <li>The mirror is fine, but I didn&#x27;t read the overall dimensions very well.  </li>
            <li>This is a handy dandy little pop up mirror that really lets you see what you are doing.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a cheap import for the low price, but it is very well made.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is very well made...</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it and her makeup is a lot straighter these day.</li>
            <li>It tends to fall over too much for me.</li>
            <li>I really like this mirror.  </li>
            <li>If you are like me and like to see what&#x27;s really going on with those eyebrows or with your pores, this is the option to get.</li>
            <li>15x is too much magnification for a 3 inch travel mirror, just saying.</li>
            <li>You do have to get real close to the mirror to see flaws in makeup.</li>
            <li>I do agree that the 15x mirror is way too much magnification, but I don&#x27;t use it anyway.  </li>
            <li>I really like this mirror</li>
            <li>very well constructed and designed.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>It is really durable, so</li>
            <li>I really like the 15x mirror and the fact that it folds up so compact.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much....</li>
            <li>Was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>The item also arrived fast.</li>
            <li>but when I got it I was really upset</li>
            <li>I know I should have considered how much 15 X is</li>
            <li>You can really see your teeth, your eyebrows, your skin.  </li>
            <li>but I do prefer for my hair not to be sticking straight up.  </li>
            <li>We wanted a mirror so people could try our items on and see what they look like, but we didn&#x27;t want anything that would take up too much display space.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This item was a bit too small and challenging to see my reflection adequately.  </li>
            <li>Better than other travel mirrors I have.</li>
            <li>I  was excited to finally  find it.</li>
            <li>You have to get pretty close to use it, but it&#x27;s clear!</li>
            <li>15x magnification is a real plus as it allows you to clearly see those pesky little what-nots and whatevers from your face when needed and you can get that eyeliner on in a clean, smooth line</li>
            <li>Nicely made, like the stand, but reflects no better than the $3 one I got at a discount store....doesn&#x27;t seem to enlarge at 15x.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice small mirror that you can take anywhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice but quite small.</li>
            <li>It is small and folds nicely for trips as well.</li>
            <li>It also has great strength for seeing those tiny little hairs that I don&#x27;t want!!</li>
            <li>Mirror is decent.  </li>
            <li>As you get older you need these kinds of things as it is</li>
            <li>It is made very well, and is very clear, without any flaws.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Folds up nice and small and it looks ok, but it is too small to be of much practical use.</li>
            <li>Usually Amazon is GREAT about just the right packaging to protect item without causing waste and frustration.</li>
            <li>Cute little mirror, the 15X doesn&#x27;t seem any stronger than 10x</li>
            <li>cute little compact mirror</li>
            <li>It is a little too heavy for a travel mirror; best actually on your bathroom counter for tweezing.</li>
            <li>At 15x magnification and the small size of the mirror you have to have the mirror just about touching your face to not get a very blurry image.  </li>
            <li>It is so nottt worth returning it, but if I knew what I know now, I definitely would not have ordered this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way too tiny to be useful.</li>
            <li>I am keeping this mirror because I like the normal side 1x of the mirror.</li>
            <li>Good travel mirror small for daily use</li>
            <li>But either the extra inch and the curvature of my blue folding mirror makes the 15x more powerful, or this is not really 15x.  </li>
            <li>I do agree with other reviewers that it needs a protective case, but if you&#x27;re crafty</li>
            <li>That, I could live with.</li>
            <li>and I love the style, but it was MUCH smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older and maybe a young person can just use it as is.</li>
            <li>The regular side is ok, but not what I expected.</li>
            <li>I actually replaced this mirror - the first one fell and broke.</li>
            <li>It is a travel mirror at the max in a way that many would not want to have one this small as a stand alone mirror and instead just use one in their pocket that folds up instead.</li>
            <li>It holds position wo holding w one hand like most small mirrors.</li>
            <li>3 inches is okay for regular mirrors, like a compact in your purse, but with magnification, especially at 15 strength, you just can&#x27;t view enough of what you need to see.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generally have much time to make a decision</li>
            <li>I personally prefer higher degree of enlargement.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and packs so very easily, yet big enough to be very usefulness!</li>
            <li>It is a great little mirror, just wish it was just a little bigger.</li>
            <li>I love my little mirror!!  </li>
            <li>easily.&lt;br /&gt;The non-magnifying side is clear with no distortion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Completely my mistake.</li>
            <li>I dont use it ofter only when I really need to see up close</li>
            <li>It folds compactly to put away and adjusts to nearly all angles</li>
            <li>the only real use I could see for it is to give to a child to play with.</li>
            <li>The Mirror is very small,I thought it would be much bigger.</li>
            <li>We had to return ours and bought the larger Jerson 5.5 inch which works very well for us.</li>
            <li>this is my second one of these they work very well and are well made.</li>
            <li>wish it had come with a travel bag to keep it in, but my old one did, so i am using that.</li>
            <li>Wish it had a soft bag protector, but I can make that.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it is advertised as a travel mirror but does not come with any kind of travel case to protect during travel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d strongly recommend a larger diameter mirror, even if the magnification was a bit less.</li>
            <li>I most likely wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it if I knew it was that small.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would like better is if it were a little larger.</li>
            <li>Small enough to fit in her purse large enough for her to use.</li>
            <li>But I really should have ordered next larger one.  </li>
            <li>but it just is not big enough to really see anything.</li>
            <li>flat, frame is stiff enough that it will sit at most any angle.  </li>
            <li>but I found a small make-up bag to store it in so it will stay clean and be protected.</li>
            <li>For better or worse the 15x leaves nothing to the imagination.</li>
            <li>This little mirror is just the right size for my needs.  </li>
            <li>The mirror size is large in comparison to some other compact mirrors.</li>
            <li>The magnification is much better than other small mirrors</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m working on because the other eye really can&#x27;t &amp;#34;see&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Very small, not as big as you think and feels cheap mirror chips</li>
            <li>I can barely focus with this smaller one.</li>
            <li>Way to small to be useful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very compact when folded down.</li>
            <li>It just right for me as I have very little counter space in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I returned it even though the return postage was half as much as the cost of the product.</li>
            <li>The description does not adequately explain how tiny it really is.</li>

            <li> Well it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This product is good for on the go.</li>

            <li> I was not disappointed and was very impressed as to how sturdy and well made it is.  </li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this mirror.</li>

            <li> Make sure to read what size before buying !</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Probably more than you ever wanted to see, but you can&#x27;t stop looking because you&#x27;ve never seen it before!</li>
            <li> exactly the perfect size for traveling.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact for travel.  </li>
            <li> And, the mirror is a nice size, looks good on your tabletop, nightstand, or bathroom counter top...</li>
            <li> magnification is nice.  </li>
            <li> A case would be nice, but not at the expense of mirror quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was paying so much attention to finding the greatest magnification and looking for 15x,</li>
            <li> so it fits nicely on the sink or in your suitcase.  </li>
            <li> It stands up well and folds up with no problem of collapsing on its own</li>
            <li> Handy item for travel.  </li>
            <li> Perfect size for travel and very lightweight.  </li>
            <li> This mirror came in handy.</li>
            <li> Nice mirror.</li>
            <li> Very nice items, fast shipping, great transaction.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for small counters and the adjustable height make it perfect wherever you are.</li>
            <li> OK, I own a 15X mirror already but wanted one for traveling.  </li>
            <li> I love this mirror - easily adjustable, good clarity and magnification.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the diameter of the mirror...</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want more than one of these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> Mirror is cute and magnification is OK.</li>
            <li> I love 15 magnification mirror.</li>
            <li> so I can set it on the vanity top.</li>
            <li> Make sure to read your dimensions before ordering this product.</li>
            <li> You can hang this from the top rim of the tabletop model to add additional magnification and height.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten used to a magnifying mirror when I put on makeup, and now that I&#x27;ve started travelling more I was looking for one that would fold up to keep in my makeup case.  </li>
            <li> I also wanted more than the 10x</li>
            <li> It is a nice product, comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> The 99¢ store brand I bought was better than this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute</li>
            <li> I do a much better job with it since the size is equipped for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> (could see alot better)</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> quality also better than anticipated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay esp.</li>
            <li> just lovely construction, finish and mirrors.</li>
            <li> so wish I had looked more closely at dimensions Before buying.</li>
            <li> Plan on buying more as grab bag gifts.</li>
            <li> The magnification is ok.</li>
            <li> The magnification is OK</li>
            <li> Make sure you understand the mirror size.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to be able to see more than one eye at a time.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a mirror that could magnify 15x or more and be able to fit nicely in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> You will not be able to use it to look at your ears, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> :  )</li>
            <li> : Be sure that the mirror is not in a position where it can reflect sunlight.</li>
            <li> I sell at craft fairs with a friend, and many of our items are wearable, like hats and headbands.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.</li>
            <li> Mostly my fault that I purchased this mirror.</li>
            <li> Ended up going to Bed Bath and Beyond to make sure I got the size I wanted.</li>
            <li> it will be better</li>
            <li> Love the magnification and size.  </li>
            <li> The magnification level sure helps to focus on skin problems on the face.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s small, it&#x27;s easily portable, and perfect for travel, but great at home, too.</li>
            <li> This is a late review ( my apologize ) but: still was an excellent purchase, a quickly shipping process and a very good price.</li>
            <li> I have limited counter space in my bathroom, so this was a great find, for a good price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;8/4/14 Mirror still bright as the first day.</li>
            <li> I needed a strong magnified mirror so I could see more than just my nose.  </li>
            <li> The mirror was smaller than I was expecting, however the magnification is very good</li>
            <li> My &#x27;cheap&#x27; 10X works better.</li>
            <li> The magnifying glass on the other side is awesome and so helpful.  </li>
            <li> Better portability than originally intended, I can pack for travel.</li>
            <li> The sturdy folding frame allows easy, compact storage - opened it sits without tipping over.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I can now easily trim my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> It is really strong so you may want to use a lower number than the one I got.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent, small 15X mirror for my needs, and I am glad that I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, if you don&#x27;t mind angling the mirror up it works fine as is.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> TThe mirror is light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The neck makes it great to use for various applications and its easy to fold.</li>
            <li> But this little mirror is perfect for what it is.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent little magnification mirror.  </li>
            <li> This is the perfect little make up mirror</li>
            <li> This little mirror is perfect!</li>
            <li> otherwise it is very high quality and a nice mirror.......</li>
            <li> Higher magnification might give you the ability to see more, but if you are not dating a hawk with spectacular vision, then this is just fine, and I am really picky!</li>
            <li> I wish this was bigger, and had a light, but it&#x27;s great for what it is.</li>
            <li> Free  </li>
            <li> Very well made with a nice finish on the metal frame.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I bought another as a backup.  </li>
            <li> The big side actually is great and I like that</li>
            <li> Just wish it had a light.</li>
            <li> I use a book light with it to do my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wonderful for taking on trips, it folds so small and easy to handle</li>
            <li> Very useful for putting on makeup, and the fact that it stands up helps a lot.</li>
            <li> Very useful.  </li>
            <li> Looking forward to getting my new mirror and having more travel adventures with it!</li>
            <li> Anyway, it was shipped quickly and packaged nicely, the price was reasonable too.</li>
            <li> although, I probably would have bought the rubbed bronze one if I had saw that one first I am quite satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this little travel mirror - handy, well put-together, and the velvet drawstring bag did a great job of keeping it safe (also if you pack it in the middle of your toiletries bag, that&#x27;ll help too.  </li>
            <li> Works well, for me; is of sufficiently durable construction for my use,  folds up for travel or out of the way storage, is compact and light-weight, and the price is most reasonable, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> A lovely gift for reasonable money.</li>
            <li> I have a full size one at home</li>
            <li> Good design and solid materials.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a FULL sized mirror....</li>
            <li> Not bad.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s perfectly fine, high magnification, easy fold up and swivel</li>
            <li> I like it rather than love it as I found a bigger one  that I love.</li>
            <li> Great for my old 50 year old eyes on trips.</li>
            <li> It is just a very nice mirror for positioning on uneven surfaces for hands free use.  </li>
            <li> This is very cute, however it is very, very tiny.</li>
            <li> It is super magnified and can sit easily on the counter or desk without taking up too much space.</li>
            <li> Small, light and great.  </li>
            <li> It magnifies very well and can fold up which is easy to travel with or store in a draw.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> This mirror would be fine except that the magnification side is 15 times which is too much to use as a travel make up mirror</li>
            <li> This is a great little mirror.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little mirror...</li>
            <li> Not cheaply made and a great price.</li>
            <li> I Hang it for everyday use and folds up great for travel.</li>
            <li> You cannot really see much if you&#x27;re trying to apply makeup, but it is very sturdy and the magnifying side is quite nice.</li>
            <li> My mistake, however I placed it in my purse and it is useful for travel</li>
            <li> It is worth having in your makeup kit.</li>
            <li> Love the magnification however this is like the old compact cases you could carry in your purse.  </li>
            <li> No difficulty seeing most everything (I say most because how do you know what you are really not seeing?)  </li>
            <li> Maybe good for make-up, not much else.  </li>
            <li> Be more clear in the product description about the size of the product.</li>
            <li> It may be a teeny bit heavier than a plastic mirror, but worth every ounce.</li>
            <li> This is one of those great little items that is exactly as described-</li>
            <li> this is just right for traveling, and it is so well made.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is just the right size for traveling.</li>
            <li> Everyone is right, needs a protective pouch.</li>
            <li> Folds right up to store and opens and stays where you put it.</li>
            <li> The price is right too.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the size right.</li>
            <li> The big problem is having to set the mirror at the perfect angle or you get major distortion, and I can&#x27;t hold my breath long enough to do much good with it.  </li>
            <li> I think that it is a nice product, but would be better suited for small children.</li>
            <li> its is very large</li>
            <li> great travel item as it is small and compact -</li>
            <li> Small but works great</li>
            <li> It is small but all I need to see great detail in the corner of my eye.</li>
            <li> Seems fairly durable, packs down</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, my only wish that it was bigger.  </li>
            <li> This smaller mirror was a great addition to my personal kit for traveling.</li>
            <li> small size makes it easy to store/portable which comes in handy.</li>
            <li> Works great for those of us with new intraocular lenses who are no longer near sighted enough to tweeze eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> It is a perfect size, not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li> The order did not arrive the first time, the company re-sent the item with no problem.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> 15x magnification can be a bit overwhelming if you are not used to seeing your face that up close and personal, but this is a tweezers girls dream mirror!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 50s and do need reading glasses, so it might work better for younger people with great vision.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a different (better) one at Walmart Online but cheaper than this.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this item again but probably put out some more money for a much larger mirror.</li>
            <li> but it seems pretty distorted to me</li>
            <li> Please make sure you understand that this mirror is only 3&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Now I can pour over my pores and pluck my eyebrows with ease ;-)</li>
            <li> Good lighting is important, and there are no built-in lights, but if you can use this outdoors or near a window, or have any small lamp with a high resolution white bulb that can give you optimal lighting, I think you will love this!</li>
            <li> Super high magnification.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for close-ups if you don&#x27;t need to see your whole face at one time.</li>
            <li> Okay, perhaps love is a strong term for a small travel mirror, especially when you don&#x27;t use it when traveling.  </li>
            <li> Smaller than expected make sure you check the description :)</li>
            <li> It arrived pretty fast in the mail also.</li>
            <li> small, not practical to produce a make up with good sight (this size).</li>
            <li> It folds up and down nicely.</li>
            <li> Three inches is pretty small, but the adjustment feature works very well, the mirror is very clear and the 15x magnification is greater than most compact magnifying mirrors.</li>
            <li> received my first one as a gift and after using it a few times and loving it, bought one for 3 of my friends.</li>
            <li> The photo looks like it is large</li>
            <li> i wanted a large  mirror  </li>
            <li> The mirror comes with h nice little travel bag.</li>
            <li> On its own little stand and travels well too</li>
            <li> It was a nice little mirror.</li>
            <li> So this is a  nice little buy if you want something to use for, say, your eyebrows</li>
            <li> The mirror is fine, but I didn&#x27;t read the overall dimensions very well.  </li>
            <li> This is a handy dandy little pop up mirror that really lets you see what you are doing.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a cheap import for the low price, but it is very well made.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it is very well made...</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it and her makeup is a lot straighter these day.</li>
            <li> It tends to fall over too much for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror.  </li>
            <li> If you are like me and like to see what&#x27;s really going on with those eyebrows or with your pores, this is the option to get.</li>
            <li> 15x is too much magnification for a 3 inch travel mirror, just saying.</li>
            <li> You do have to get real close to the mirror to see flaws in makeup.</li>
            <li> I do agree that the 15x mirror is way too much magnification, but I don&#x27;t use it anyway.  </li>
            <li> I really like this mirror</li>
            <li> very well constructed and designed.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> It is really durable, so</li>
            <li> I really like the 15x mirror and the fact that it folds up so compact.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much....</li>
            <li> Was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> The item also arrived fast.</li>
            <li> but when I got it I was really upset</li>
            <li> I know I should have considered how much 15 X is</li>
            <li> You can really see your teeth, your eyebrows, your skin.  </li>
            <li> but I do prefer for my hair not to be sticking straight up.  </li>
            <li> We wanted a mirror so people could try our items on and see what they look like, but we didn&#x27;t want anything that would take up too much display space.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This item was a bit too small and challenging to see my reflection adequately.  </li>
            <li> Better than other travel mirrors I have.</li>
            <li> I  was excited to finally  find it.</li>
            <li> You have to get pretty close to use it, but it&#x27;s clear!</li>
            <li> 15x magnification is a real plus as it allows you to clearly see those pesky little what-nots and whatevers from your face when needed and you can get that eyeliner on in a clean, smooth line</li>
            <li> Nicely made, like the stand, but reflects no better than the $3 one I got at a discount store....doesn&#x27;t seem to enlarge at 15x.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice small mirror that you can take anywhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice but quite small.</li>
            <li> It is small and folds nicely for trips as well.</li>
            <li> It also has great strength for seeing those tiny little hairs that I don&#x27;t want!!</li>
            <li> Mirror is decent.  </li>
            <li> As you get older you need these kinds of things as it is</li>
            <li> It is made very well, and is very clear, without any flaws.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Folds up nice and small and it looks ok, but it is too small to be of much practical use.</li>
            <li> Usually Amazon is GREAT about just the right packaging to protect item without causing waste and frustration.</li>
            <li> Cute little mirror, the 15X doesn&#x27;t seem any stronger than 10x</li>
            <li> cute little compact mirror</li>
            <li> It is a little too heavy for a travel mirror; best actually on your bathroom counter for tweezing.</li>
            <li> At 15x magnification and the small size of the mirror you have to have the mirror just about touching your face to not get a very blurry image.  </li>
            <li> It is so nottt worth returning it, but if I knew what I know now, I definitely would not have ordered this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too tiny to be useful.</li>
            <li> I am keeping this mirror because I like the normal side 1x of the mirror.</li>
            <li> Good travel mirror small for daily use</li>
            <li> But either the extra inch and the curvature of my blue folding mirror makes the 15x more powerful, or this is not really 15x.  </li>
            <li> I do agree with other reviewers that it needs a protective case, but if you&#x27;re crafty</li>
            <li> That, I could live with.</li>
            <li> and I love the style, but it was MUCH smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older and maybe a young person can just use it as is.</li>
            <li> The regular side is ok, but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I actually replaced this mirror - the first one fell and broke.</li>
            <li> It is a travel mirror at the max in a way that many would not want to have one this small as a stand alone mirror and instead just use one in their pocket that folds up instead.</li>
            <li> It holds position wo holding w one hand like most small mirrors.</li>
            <li> 3 inches is okay for regular mirrors, like a compact in your purse, but with magnification, especially at 15 strength, you just can&#x27;t view enough of what you need to see.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally have much time to make a decision</li>
            <li> I personally prefer higher degree of enlargement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and packs so very easily, yet big enough to be very usefulness!</li>
            <li> It is a great little mirror, just wish it was just a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I love my little mirror!!  </li>
            <li> easily.&lt;br /&gt;The non-magnifying side is clear with no distortion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Completely my mistake.</li>
            <li> I dont use it ofter only when I really need to see up close</li>
            <li> It folds compactly to put away and adjusts to nearly all angles</li>
            <li> the only real use I could see for it is to give to a child to play with.</li>
            <li> The Mirror is very small,I thought it would be much bigger.</li>
            <li> We had to return ours and bought the larger Jerson 5.5 inch which works very well for us.</li>
            <li> this is my second one of these they work very well and are well made.</li>
            <li> wish it had come with a travel bag to keep it in, but my old one did, so i am using that.</li>
            <li> Wish it had a soft bag protector, but I can make that.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is advertised as a travel mirror but does not come with any kind of travel case to protect during travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d strongly recommend a larger diameter mirror, even if the magnification was a bit less.</li>
            <li> I most likely wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it if I knew it was that small.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would like better is if it were a little larger.</li>
            <li> Small enough to fit in her purse large enough for her to use.</li>
            <li> But I really should have ordered next larger one.  </li>
            <li> but it just is not big enough to really see anything.</li>
            <li> flat, frame is stiff enough that it will sit at most any angle.  </li>
            <li> but I found a small make-up bag to store it in so it will stay clean and be protected.</li>
            <li> For better or worse the 15x leaves nothing to the imagination.</li>
            <li> This little mirror is just the right size for my needs.  </li>
            <li> The mirror size is large in comparison to some other compact mirrors.</li>
            <li> The magnification is much better than other small mirrors</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m working on because the other eye really can&#x27;t &amp;#34;see&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very small, not as big as you think and feels cheap mirror chips</li>
            <li> I can barely focus with this smaller one.</li>
            <li> Way to small to be useful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very compact when folded down.</li>
            <li> It just right for me as I have very little counter space in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I returned it even though the return postage was half as much as the cost of the product.</li>
            <li> The description does not adequately explain how tiny it really is.</li>
            <li> You would have to put it on a stack of books to get it high enough to use, and then you could only make up one half of an eye at a time.</li>
            <li> I also recommend having a soft case that other reviewers encourage.</li>
            <li> 15x is too much magnification for such a small mirror.</li>
            <li> If you only want a small mirror which will not take too much place of your desk,then choose it.</li>
            <li> You have to remember this is a very closeup reflection and no one sees all the little details you are going to see when you look in the mirror, so no picking!</li>
            <li> It just seems the area covered is not adequate, making it necessary to scan frequently.</li>
            <li> The small cardboard box had so much tape on it</li>
            <li> Sturdy and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> It stands at almost any angle and still folds flat for travel.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is very hard to focus, you can&#x27;t see any thing unless you get the right focus, and the size of the mirror is also a big problem</li>
            <li> It is small to fit on my shelf but not too small to make it impractical.</li>
            <li> but I needed a small one so it would fit in my small overnight travel bag.  </li>
            <li> it took a long, long time to open.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tiny bit smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> It is small but as stated it is mainly for detail.</li>
            <li> When I got it open, it was then taped in so much bubble wrap, that it took another insanely long time to open, and then when I finally got that open, it came in one of those plastic protective sleeves that are so difficult to open/cut.</li>
            <li> it is smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I wish they make one with long neck</li>
            <li> a small compact folding mirror with 15x magnification and normal in one unit.</li>
            <li> this is smaller than I expected it to be for the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Way smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> MUCH SMALLER than I expected.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> X 15 is not really clear and takes a lot of eye string to focus</li>
            <li> But some of the past reviews were correct when they said it was not large enough to properly and clearly see yourself in the mirror.</li>
            <li> that there is a regular mirror on the other side.</li>
            <li> the other in the tiny mirror.  </li>
            <li> , OTHER REVIEWERS OBVIOUSLY DIDN&#x27;T READ THE TITLE.  </li>
            <li> The field of vision is far too small for my viewing need.</li>
            <li> so I tracked one down and was ordering it when I saw this smaller travel size.</li>
            <li> : Size, easy to get it dirty when you switch magnifications&lt;</li>
            <li> It works for traveling, but really just too small for everyday use.</li>
            <li> recently saw this for less at Target</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small but enough for daily makeup</li>
            <li> Often times these little mirrors are cheesy and easily breakable.  </li>
            <li> Being 6\\&quot; tall, you have to really bend your neck down unless you place some sort of thick stand (or a dictionary) underneath this mirror.</li>
            <li> about 2.5\\&quot; across--and awkward to look into, but fine for travel.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend said the little ball broke off because of a defect in the way it was manufactured, so it&#x27;s likely to break off soon.</li>
            <li> A little larger than my fist, but I use it all the time anyway.  </li>
            <li> But was upset with how little the mirror actually is !</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> and I know it says travel size I just expected to be a little bigger than what it is.</li>
            <li> I actually took a break in the middle of opening this box; it took me at least 30 minutes to get through it all.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be too careful with something that might be banging around in your luggage.</li>
            <li> Not a responsible vendor.</li>
            <li> Bottom line &amp;#34;Cute, but not very functional&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> A regular size mirror that magnifies to 15x is really hard to find, and then super expensive.  </li>
            <li> not much to say, it is what it says it is, i wish i had actually realized how small it is.  </li>
            <li> the only recommendation I&#x27;d make is that it came with a case or little draw string bag for it!</li>
            <li> The space of the actual mirror is too small</li>
            <li> Terrific mirror - small</li>
            <li> Small, but ample enough!</li>
            <li> I can use it for other things</li>
            <li> the other eye</li>
            <li> This is so small about the only thing you can use it for is to look at your nose.</li>
            <li> It is not at all what I expected!</li>
            <li> Any other part of my face</li>
            <li> Just what you need for a convenience mirror, small, sturdy, and has 2 mirrors, standard and 15x.  </li>
            <li> I use it regularly, like the small size, and would recommend others to buy this.</li>
            <li> Mirror was too small, the advertisement (picture) made this mirror appear larger than it was.</li>
            <li> Lighting can be difficult, with such a small mirror, it&#x27;s hard to avoid blocking the light with your face.</li>
            <li> Also seems a little spiky, you feel like parts are sticking into you, even though they&#x27;re really not.</li>
            <li> i was unable to see my whole face.</li>
            <li> This is a love hate thing I think.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too hard to sew one up with leftover fabric, much less go out to someplace like Target and buy a generic camera case.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to see your entire face in the mirror, so I wish I bought something a little</li>
            <li> I can see my eyes in it and remove eyelashes and specks from my eyes without spending a half hour searching for the offending lash or hair.  </li>
            <li> Folding hinge still tight.</li>
            <li> Must be sturdy, I&#x27;ve knocked it down several times and it hasn&#x27;t broken (</li>
            <li> If not then be prepared to lean in a little.</li>
            <li> but I like the way the little mirror can be moved around.</li>
            <li> The picture was a little misleading.  </li>
            <li> Well made little mirror.  </li>
            <li> I like this little mirror.</li>
            <li> Mirror was too little, something that you couldn&#x27;t tell from advertised photos.</li>
            <li> I like the quality of the 2 optical sides this little mirror.</li>
            <li> emphasis on LITTLE.  </li>
            <li> This little mirror rocks.</li>
            <li> Not cheap looking or feeling.</li>
            <li> Its a product I use everyday</li>
            <li> Too heavy for travel.</li>
            <li> For everyday, though, it&#x27;s a bit small for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> A little small but</li>
            <li> But once you get used to 15X, its hard to go down in magnification.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been shocked to see how much magnifying mirrors cost.</li>
            <li> It had to be small for traveling..</li>
            <li> The 3\\&quot; diameter on this mirror is so small that you cannot see with it.</li>
            <li> That being said, when it was opened, there was a small ball bearing that bounced out, and a piece basically is not attached to the mirror that should be.</li>
            <li> This is way too small for what I need, but it does say 3&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It is just way too small.</li>
            <li> So this might be my fault, but I didn&#x27;t realize just how small this mirror was.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is so small and the stand is so short that it would be useless as a travel mirror.</li>
            <li> I did not like this mirror because it was too small for the magnification</li>
            <li> I knew it would be small</li>
            <li> it was that small</li>
            <li> The mirror was way too small.</li>
            <li> Too small for practical purposes.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is the size that I must get use to or the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> really small mirror.</li>
            <li> I knew it would be small</li>
            <li> but it is too small</li>
            <li> the mirror is small</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is small but with the stand</li>
            <li> It is a bit small</li>
            <li> For contact lenses however it is WAY too small.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely small mirror and the 15x magnify is silly in such a small mirror.  </li>
            <li> it was sooooo small....</li>
            <li> small.  </li>
            <li> cause it was so small</li>
            <li> TOO SMALL ...</li>
            <li> The face is just too small.</li>
            <li> But too small for me.</li>
            <li> I needed a small mirror that I could put in a desk drawer for FaceTime emergencies.</li>
            <li> This mirror folds up perfectly small.  </li>
            <li> The diameter is small.</li>
            <li> It is small but just what I needed to help me get my eye makeup on in the mornings.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size -- which is SMALL.  </li>
            <li> YES, IT&#x27;S SMALL</li>
            <li> After almost 6 years of daily use, I have to finally buy a new one because an awkward fall off my sink broke the base.  </li>
            <li> So I tried a bunch of other travel mirrors and was never happy.</li>
            <li> it was held by a spot weld and not a very good one.  </li>
            <li> but I am not an expert and would not have know that it was not suitable.</li>
            <li> but it makes it a bit hard to use.</li>
            <li> I try hard</li>
            <li> so makes is hard to zero</li>
            <li> Then after about 5 years, I dropped it on a hard surface and it broke.</li>
            <li> at least 13\\&quot; height</li>
            <li> Its not good for hair because its too small, just for eyebrow tweezing, etc.</li>
            <li> I put it in a thick sport sock when I travel to give it protection.</li>
            <li> If you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very small.</li>
            <li> However it is a very small mirror.</li>
            <li> It is very small.</li>
            <li> the base snapped off within a few hours of using this, i tried to open it up to stand and snap</li>
            <li> I found this a little difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> a little bit expensive</li>
            <li> First off, if I realized how insane the packaging was, I would never have bought this.</li>
            <li> but it does not work as i needed due to the missing base</li>
            <li> This looks about like a 7-10X and is very hard to see in.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with it stsl</li>
            <li> ugly and is not worth the price, This thing should cost $5 max..</li>
            <li> Too small, hard to operate especially in poorly lit place.  </li>
            <li> I fail to see how it could be labeled \\&quot;Model&#x27;s Choice.\\</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t and am sorry.</li>
            <li> it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> What I can&#x27;t is the fact that the mirrors are so concave that they distort whatever you can see in them, making them completely useless.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it was so small:(.</li>
            <li> Silly me</li>
            <li> I am so blind it worked for me.</li>
            <li> I can hardly see one eyeball in it.... :(</li>
            <li> I originally hated it because it was so small</li>
            <li> However, it appeared to have some damage around the nickle rim, which was disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have bad eyesight</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> The base also is collapsible</li>
            <li> These type of mirrors are awful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, my only wish that it was bigger.  Really great quality.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror! I keep it in my travel bag. It is a perfect size, not too big and not too small. Not cheaply made and a great price.</li>
            <li> great for travel.  magnification excellent.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact for travel.  Collapses so you can pack it.  Mirror is decent.  Price was good.  Better than other travel mirrors I have.</li>
            <li> I like it rather than love it as I found a bigger one  that I love. But this little mirror is perfect for what it is.  I gave it to my daughter and she loves it.  :)</li>
            <li> I love my little mirror!!  I take it with me when I travel and use it almost daily!!</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the diameter of the mirror... (3 inches) it is smaller than I expected.  At 15x magnification and the small size of the mirror you have to have the mirror just about touching your face to not get a very blurry image.  Otherwise, it is very well made...</li>
            <li> It had to be small for traveling..but it makes it a bit hard to use. It is well made and it does the job. If you need to get something out of your eye...this mirror[[ASIN:B001DKVBJU Jerdon Model&#x27;s Choice MC315N 3\\&quot; 15X Travel Folding Mirror, Nickel Finish]] will do the trick. The mirror comes with h nice little travel bag.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want more than one of these.&lt;br /&gt;These mirrors are great. The sturdy folding frame allows easy, compact storage - opened it sits without tipping over.&lt;br /&gt;The 15x magnification is a real plus as it allows you to clearly see those pesky little what-nots and whatevers from your face when needed and you can get that eyeliner on in a clean, smooth line easily.&lt;br /&gt;The non-magnifying side is clear with no distortion.&lt;br /&gt;I received my first one as a gift and after using it a few times and loving it, bought one for 3 of my friends.</li>
            <li> The order did not arrive the first time, the company re-sent the item with no problem.  The company staff is very courteous and described item acurate. The mirror is great for travel.</li>
            <li> It is a great little mirror, just wish it was just a little bigger. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and magnification!!! Good for home and travel.</li>
            <li> I purchased the mirror as a birthday gift for my wife. She absolutely loves it and her makeup is a lot straighter these day. LOL  Small enough to fit in her purse large enough for her to use.</li>
            <li> Works well, for me; is of sufficiently durable construction for my use,  folds up for travel or out of the way storage, is compact and light-weight, and the price is most reasonable, in my opinion.  This is an excellent, small 15X mirror for my needs, and I am glad that I purchased it.</li>
            <li> The 3\\&quot; diameter on this mirror is so small that you cannot see with it. I fail to see how it could be labeled \\&quot;Model&#x27;s Choice.\\&quot; Don&#x27;t bother to purchase. I returned it even though the return postage was half as much as the cost of the product.</li>
            <li> I found this mirror to be the perfect size and magnification. It is small to fit on my shelf but not too small to make it impractical. It magnifies very well and can fold up which is easy to travel with or store in a draw.</li>
            <li> what is there to say...this is just right for traveling, and it is so well made.  love it</li>
            <li> Not the Mirror for Both Hands Free  Being 6\\&quot; tall, you have to really bend your neck down unless you place some sort of thick stand (or a dictionary) underneath this mirror. Mirror is cute and magnification is OK. I love 15 magnification mirror. I wish they make one with long neck at least 13\\&quot; height so I can set it on the vanity top. I used to have one with bendable/stretchable neck but then magnification was only 8...</li>
            <li> This mirror is very hard to focus, you can&#x27;t see any thing unless you get the right focus, and the size of the mirror is also a big problem, it&#x27;s very very tiny, you can hadley see any thing. Not happy with it stsl</li>
            <li> Very nice items, fast shipping, great transaction. Thanks!</li>
            <li> As looking at the photo of this item it looks bigger than it portrys as it is I thought it was bigger and I will order a bigger one as I need that. As you get older you need these kinds of things as it is I try hard and I am not so happy with this item but its mine and my daughter uses it I will order again in time thank you for asking did not want to say what I felt.</li>
            <li> Double check the size. I didn&#x27;t and am sorry. The photo looks like it is large</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my wife, and she´s absolutely happy about it, it is a must have for women.</li>
            <li> It tends to fall over too much for me. The space of the actual mirror is too small</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror.  It magnifies enough so that I can put my makeup on without my glasses.  The only thing I would like better is if it were a little larger.</li>
            <li> I am basing my comment on the size of the mirror, I didn&#x27;t like the size. if you are looking for a mirror to soley travel with than this is the mirror for you.</li>
            <li> 15x magnification can be a bit overwhelming if you are not used to seeing your face that up close and personal, but this is a tweezers girls dream mirror! You can see everything! And, the mirror is a nice size, looks good on your tabletop, nightstand, or bathroom counter top... although, I probably would have bought the rubbed bronze one if I had saw that one first I am quite satisfied with this purchase. If you are like me and like to see what&#x27;s really going on with those eyebrows or with your pores, this is the option to get.</li>
            <li> 15x is too much magnification for a 3 inch travel mirror, just saying.</li>
            <li> I originally hated it because it was so small but now I just use it to travel. Turned out good in the end (:</li>
            <li> Works.  But I really should have ordered next larger one.  It just seems the area covered is not adequate, making it necessary to scan frequently.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted but I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size of it. The mirror is the size of a compact mirror the size of the palm of your hand. Wanted a bigger one but this one works</li>
            <li> Not bad.  15x magnification is nice.  Mirror is smaller than it appears in picture.  Seems fairly durable, packs down flat, frame is stiff enough that it will sit at most any angle.  Lighting can be difficult, with such a small mirror, it&#x27;s hard to avoid blocking the light with your face.</li>
            <li> Great product and seller!</li>
            <li> I should have checked the size better.&lt;br /&gt;Too small, not practical to produce a make up with good sight (this size).</li>
            <li> First off, if I realized how insane the packaging was, I would never have bought this. Usually Amazon is GREAT about just the right packaging to protect item without causing waste and frustration. This item was not the case. The small cardboard box had so much tape on it it took a long, long time to open. When I got it open, it was then taped in so much bubble wrap, that it took another insanely long time to open, and then when I finally got that open, it came in one of those plastic protective sleeves that are so difficult to open/cut. I actually took a break in the middle of opening this box; it took me at least 30 minutes to get through it all. That being said, when it was opened, there was a small ball bearing that bounced out, and a piece basically is not attached to the mirror that should be. My boyfriend said the little ball broke off because of a defect in the way it was manufactured, so it&#x27;s likely to break off soon. It is so nottt worth returning it, but if I knew what I know now, I definitely would not have ordered this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror itself is as described. It is a little too heavy for a travel mirror; best actually on your bathroom counter for tweezing.</li>
            <li> I actually replaced this mirror - the first one fell and broke. It just right for me as I have very little counter space in my bathroom. It folds up and down nicely. Stays in place. The mirror size is large in comparison to some other compact mirrors. The magnifying side is perfect. Good value and good to use.</li>
            <li> The metal and its brushed satin finish are high-quality, as are the mirror components themselves. The tension of the joints holds perfectly for whatever exact adjustment angle you need. This mirror is an excellent bargain. I highly recommend it. I also recommend having a soft case that other reviewers encourage. Can&#x27;t be too careful with something that might be banging around in your luggage.</li>
            <li> A little larger than my fist, but I use it all the time anyway.  You can see everything - just not all at once. Works great for those of us with new intraocular lenses who are no longer near sighted enough to tweeze eyebrows.  Very well made with a nice finish on the metal frame. Not cheap looking or feeling. A lovely gift for reasonable money. A case would be nice, but not at the expense of mirror quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/4/14 Mirror still bright as the first day. Folding hinge still tight.</li>
            <li> I wish this was bigger, and had a light, but it&#x27;s great for what it is. I use it for brows and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> This is very cute, however it is very, very tiny. Make sure to read your dimensions before ordering this product.</li>
            <li> This is way too small for what I need, but it does say 3&amp;#34;. My mistake, however I placed it in my purse and it is useful for travel and it also says that too. Completely my mistake. You do have to get real close to the mirror to see flaws in makeup.</li>
            <li> I was paying so much attention to finding the greatest magnification and looking for 15x, that I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the diameter of the mirror, which is only 3\\&quot;. I had already ordered it when I noticed the size. It arrived today and I can&#x27;t use it for tweezing. I tried. It is just way too small. I already have a couple of the blue fold up mirrors that can also be found on Amazon. They are the perfect size and magnification, but they loosen after a while and stop standing up at the angle I need. They are actually 4\\&quot; in diameter and 15x. That extra inch in diameter makes all the difference. I looked in my blue mirror, and then this one, and there is no way they are the same magnification! I can barely focus with this smaller one. I&#x27;m in my late 50s and do need reading glasses, so it might work better for younger people with great vision. But either the extra inch and the curvature of my blue folding mirror makes the 15x more powerful, or this is not really 15x.  I guess I&#x27;ll just get another blue one.</li>
            <li> This is one of those great little items that is exactly as described- the only recommendation I&#x27;d make is that it came with a case or little draw string bag for it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for the intent to use when I travel (the 15x was the selling point). I do agree with other reviewers that it needs a protective case, but if you&#x27;re crafty it&#x27;s not too hard to sew one up with leftover fabric, much less go out to someplace like Target and buy a generic camera case. When travelling, I have placed it atop the stack of phonebooks one finds in their hotel room. If not then be prepared to lean in a little. For the price I&#x27;d say it does its job and the manufacture chose quality materials putting this together. Aside from the inclusion of a protective case with this purchase, the next thing I&#x27;d improve would be the height it unfolds out to. Otherwise, if you don&#x27;t mind angling the mirror up it works fine as is.&lt;br /&gt;This also works well with their 10x tabletop mirror. You can hang this from the top rim of the tabletop model to add additional magnification and height.</li>
            <li> I waited to write this till after my trip.  It&#x27;s small and packs so very easily, yet big enough to be very usefulness!</li>
            <li> SO Tiny, not what I thought I was ordering</li>
            <li> Very small, not as big as you think and feels cheap mirror chips</li>
            <li> Okay, perhaps love is a strong term for a small travel mirror, especially when you don&#x27;t use it when traveling.  It is just a very nice mirror for positioning on uneven surfaces for hands free use.  I liked it so much that I bought another as a backup.  I do agree that the 15x mirror is way too much magnification, but I don&#x27;t use it anyway.  The 1x mirror is all I need or use.</li>
            <li> So this might be my fault, but I didn&#x27;t realize just how small this mirror was.  It&#x27;s hard to see your entire face in the mirror, so I wish I bought something a little bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Sturdy - I&#x27;ve dropped it on the ground quite a bit and it&#x27;s perfectly fine, high magnification, easy fold up and swivel&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Size, easy to get it dirty when you switch magnifications&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if this size meets your requirements, this is a great and sturdy mirror. But if you want it as a makeup mirror/vanity, get something bigger.</li>
            <li> This mirror is so small and the stand is so short that it would be useless as a travel mirror. You would have to put it on a stack of books to get it high enough to use, and then you could only make up one half of an eye at a time. I returned it immediately. The description does not adequately explain how tiny it really is.</li>
            <li> Cute little mirror, the 15X doesn&#x27;t seem any stronger than 10x but I like the way the little mirror can be moved around.Price is fair. It is worth having in your makeup kit.</li>
            <li> After almost 6 years of daily use, I have to finally buy a new one because an awkward fall off my sink broke the base.  I&#x27;ve dropped it before, but the combo of ricocheting off the sink into the tub edge did it on.  I love this little travel mirror - handy, well put-together, and the velvet drawstring bag did a great job of keeping it safe (also if you pack it in the middle of your toiletries bag, that&#x27;ll help too.  Looking forward to getting my new mirror and having more travel adventures with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten used to a magnifying mirror when I put on makeup, and now that I&#x27;ve started travelling more I was looking for one that would fold up to keep in my makeup case.  I also wanted more than the 10x I&#x27;d been using ... This works perfectly!  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It is a nice product, comfortable to use.  To be a 5 star product it needs a protective case. The stand folds on to glass and will brake it. I made a sleeve to prevent  metal stand impacting and braking the glass.</li>
            <li> Definitely not 15x magnification. The 99¢ store brand I bought was better than this. And way overpriced. I ended up buying a different (better) one at Walmart Online but cheaper than this.</li>
            <li> Love the magnification however this is like the old compact cases you could carry in your purse.  It&#x27;s way too tiny to be useful.</li>
            <li> this is a great magnifying mirror. This mirror is just the right size for traveling. This mirror meets all my needs.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this and I love the style, but it was MUCH smaller than I expected.Always read the measurements folks! Anyway, it was shipped quickly and packaged nicely, the price was reasonable too. If you need a tiny mirror, this one is it.Everyone is right, needs a protective pouch.</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror but it&#x27;s very small.</li>
            <li> I did not like this mirror because it was too small for the magnification so it was not functional.  I had to hold it so close to my face and manuever it around to focus and then could not get my hand in to tweeze my eyebrown without the mirror being in the way.</li>
            <li> Super high magnification. I knew it would be small and it is pretty darn small but well made.</li>
            <li> Both sides are excellent. Very useful for putting on makeup, and the fact that it stands up helps a lot.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  small size makes it easy to store/portable which comes in handy. very well constructed and designed.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent little magnification mirror.  It is made very well, and is very clear, without any flaws.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute but I had no idea it was that small it&#x27;s tiny like the palm of your hand</li>
            <li> The mirror was way too small. I was looking for a bigger one and didn&#x27;t realize this was only 3 inch.</li>
            <li> Too small, hard to operate especially in poorly lit place.  Too small for practical purposes.  I would&#x27;ve gotten a bigger size</li>
            <li> I bought this to travel with since I can not see to put make up on without a good magnification mirror.  I found this a little difficult to use.  I am not sure if it is the size that I must get use to or the product. I have a full size one at home and the size may be the case.  After using for a while I decided it worked best for my eye make up area.  I do a much better job with it since the size is equipped for that purpose.  I now keep it on my vanity along with my larger one for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again so that I can keep one in my travel case or in my guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> the mirror i broke was a different brand 15x (could see alot better) this miirror is not as good. don&#x27;t like it at all. wasn&#x27;t happy with it. now i still have to go buy  another mirror. i use it to put on my make-up and puck my eye brows.</li>
            <li> Seniors!  And others -  buy this.  The magnifying glass on the other side is awesome and so helpful.  It&#x27;s small so it fits nicely on the sink or in your suitcase.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Terrific mirror - small but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> a small compact folding mirror with 15x magnification and normal in one unit.</li>
            <li> It was smaller than I thought. but will use it anyway. It will pack well. I just thought it would be bigger than my hand.</li>
            <li> This is a handy dandy little pop up mirror that really lets you see what you are doing. Great for eye-liner or finding an errant hair here and there. You have to remember this is a very closeup reflection and no one sees all the little details you are going to see when you look in the mirror, so no picking!</li>
            <li> really small mirror. It&#x27;s like a powder compact mirror on a stand. It works for traveling, but really just too small for everyday use.</li>
            <li> This item was a bit too small and challenging to see my reflection adequately.  I would encourage consideration to the size, if purchased.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected make sure you check the description :)</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to get up close and personal.  On its own little stand and travels well too</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Fast shipment. Thanks!! 5 stars*****</li>
            <li> great travel item as it is small and compact -</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. I have one for travel and one at home. The magnification is much better than other small mirrors and I like that there is a regular mirror on the other side. It is perfect for small counters and the adjustable height make it perfect wherever you are.</li>
            <li> this is smaller than I expected it to be for the price I paid for it. it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have bad eyesight so this mirror is great for plucking eyebrows and doing my eyeliner. Love it. Great mirror great price. Not very big. But perfect</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror its is very large I dont use it ofter only when I really need to see up close</li>
            <li> This is the perfect little make up mirror It folds compactly to put away and adjusts to nearly all angles</li>
            <li> Very useful.  Perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I know the description has the dimensions, but it seems even smaller than what is listed. That, I could live with. What I can&#x27;t is the fact that the mirrors are so concave that they distort whatever you can see in them, making them completely useless. It is really durable, so the only real use I could see for it is to give to a child to play with.</li>
            <li> Better portability than originally intended, I can pack for travel. Magnification is very good. Color &amp; Mfgr. quality also better than anticipated.</li>
            <li> OK, I own a 15X mirror already but wanted one for traveling.  This isn&#x27;t it!  This looks about like a 7-10X and is very hard to see in.  I put both of the 15X side by side and there is no comparison.  I&#x27;ve got to find that stray hair and this isn&#x27;t going to help... it went back to Amazon!</li>
            <li> I bought this as an add-on item and it was a very good price and it works well too. It stands up well and folds up with no problem of collapsing on its own and it does all that it is supposed to. However it is a very small mirror. It is a travel mirror at the max in a way that many would not want to have one this small as a stand alone mirror and instead just use one in their pocket that folds up instead.</li>
            <li> When I ordered my mirror I knew it would be small but I needed a small one so it would fit in my small overnight travel bag.  I was not disappointed and was very impressed as to how sturdy and well made it is.  I really like the 15x mirror and the fact that it folds up so compact.  I wish it would come with a travel bag but I found a small make-up bag to store it in so it will stay clean and be protected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay esp. to travel but it is too small and so you have to use very bright lighting. I&#x27;m older and maybe a young person can just use it as is.</li>
            <li> I thought this mirror would be perfect for travel but it just is not big enough to really see anything.</li>
            <li> the mirror is small so you cant focus the magnify side unless it is so close to your face.  The regular side is ok, but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This mirror is as described.  But some of the past reviews were correct when they said it was not large enough to properly and clearly see yourself in the mirror. I&#x27;d strongly recommend a larger diameter mirror, even if the magnification was a bit less.</li>
            <li> 15x is too much magnification for such a small mirror.</li>
            <li> just lovely construction, finish and mirrors. It holds position wo holding w one hand like most small mirrors.</li>
            <li> A great travel mirror</li>
            <li> I love it! I looked everywhere. Target, Walmart, Beauty Supply stores &amp; could not find anything like it.  I  was excited to finally  find it. Perfect for traveling and great for putting on eye makeup. Thanks so much....</li>
            <li> I love this mirror - easily adjustable, good clarity and magnification. Because it&#x27;s small, it&#x27;s easily portable, and perfect for travel, but great at home, too.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love it! Small, but ample enough! No difficulty seeing most everything (I say most because how do you know what you are really not seeing?)  Higher magnification might give you the ability to see more, but if you are not dating a hawk with spectacular vision, then this is just fine, and I am really picky! Good lighting is important, and there are no built-in lights, but if you can use this outdoors or near a window, or have any small lamp with a high resolution white bulb that can give you optimal lighting, I think you will love this!</li>
            <li> This is great for traveling as it states.&lt;br /&gt;It is small but with the stand it can be&lt;br /&gt;use to put on makeup and do some&lt;br /&gt;plucking (which every girl needs!).</li>
            <li> The mirror stand is quite sturdy but a bit heavier than I would like for travel (it is metal).  The stand is quite adjustable and the mirror stays in the desired position.  I also use the magnified side at home for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This is a late review ( my apologize ) but: still was an excellent purchase, a quickly shipping process and a very good price. I will recommended. Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> This mirror is TINY! It no bigger than a compact mirror that if keep in my purse.</li>
            <li> The Mirror is very small,I thought it would be much bigger.</li>
            <li> the base snapped off within a few hours of using this, i tried to open it up to stand and snap it was held by a spot weld and not a very good one.  I can use it for other things but it does not work as i needed due to the missing base</li>
            <li> The magnification strength is great, so&#x27;s the idea. The big problem is having to set the mirror at the perfect angle or you get major distortion, and I can&#x27;t hold my breath long enough to do much good with it.  Useable in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Way smaller than I expected. If you want something travel size, then this is the way to go, but if you&#x27;re looking for a standard sized mirror, this is not your product.</li>
            <li> A lot a lot smaller then it appears ! Make sure to read what size before buying ! Was packaged very well. But was upset with how little the mirror actually is !</li>
            <li> This little mirror is just the right size for my needs.  I can see my eyes in it and remove eyelashes and specks from my eyes without spending a half hour searching for the offending lash or hair.  It&#x27;s very good quality and I would definitely purchase it again.  It&#x27;s very compact when folded down.</li>
            <li> Great product made a great choice on this item</li>
            <li> Small but works great</li>
            <li> It is a bit small so wish I had looked more closely at dimensions Before buying. Quality is solid, though.</li>
            <li> It was a nice little mirror. However, it appeared to have some damage around the nickle rim, which was disappointing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on January with a delivery date of 2 days. Currently I am told it will arrive up to 16 days from the order date. Not a responsible vendor.</li>
            <li> Handy item for travel.  Well made.  I can now easily trim my eyebrows.  Plan on buying more as grab bag gifts. Perfect item at a perfect price.</li>
            <li> I have limited counter space in my bathroom, so this was a great find, for a good price. The item also arrived fast.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wonderful for taking on trips, it folds so small and easy to handle</li>
            <li> I ended up giving it to my grandmother for makeup and hair removal, which is what it is designed for.  For contact lenses however it is WAY too small.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I expected. These mirrors are over priced for the size. The magnification is ok. I would not purchase this item again but probably put out some more money for a much larger mirror.</li>
            <li> It is small but exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It is awesome. But it is too small to see the whole face of my friend!</li>
            <li> I like the mirror and I know it says travel size I just expected to be a little bigger than what it is.</li>
            <li> The mirror is fine, but I didn&#x27;t read the overall dimensions very well.  This is an extremely small mirror and the 15x magnify is silly in such a small mirror.  Will probably see if my daughter can use it and I&#x27;ll look locally for one that I can use.</li>
            <li> it was sooooo small.... i was unable to see my whole face. so i returned it.</li>
            <li> cute little compact mirror but it&#x27;s actually &amp;#34;too&amp;#34; small.  The magnification is OK but it seems pretty distorted to me so makes is hard to zero in on what you&#x27;re looking for.  I have big eyes that attract eyelashes and junk to them so seems like I&#x27;m always digging something out of them.  I can&#x27;t use one eye to &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; the other eye I&#x27;m working on because the other eye really can&#x27;t &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; the other in the tiny mirror.  Sort of a one eye-ball only gig.  Maybe good for make-up, not much else.  I found a wider one for 1/2 the price at my local drug store and that&#x27;ll be my go-to search-and-destroy mirror.  Bottom line &amp;#34;Cute, but not very functional&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great traveling mirror. Just the right size for close-ups if you don&#x27;t need to see your whole face at one time. Make sure you understand the mirror size. It is small but as stated it is mainly for detail.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for travel and very lightweight.  Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been shocked to see how much magnifying mirrors cost. A regular size mirror that magnifies to 15x is really hard to find, and then super expensive.  So this is a  nice little buy if you want something to use for, say, your eyebrows but you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.  The magnification is great.  But it IS tiny.  Don&#x27;t expect to be able to see more than one eye at a time.</li>
            <li> Must be sturdy, I&#x27;ve knocked it down several times and it hasn&#x27;t broken (yeah, I&#x27;m a klutz). Three inches is pretty small, but the adjustment feature works very well, the mirror is very clear and the 15x magnification is greater than most compact magnifying mirrors. I was expecting a cheap import for the low price, but it is very well made. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a mirror that could magnify 15x or more and be able to fit nicely in my travel bag. This mirror came in handy. Perfect for what I need to see.</li>
            <li> The 12x side is so distorted that literally gave me a headache. I am keeping this mirror because I like the normal side 1x of the mirror.</li>
            <li> Please make sure you understand that this mirror is only 3&amp;#34;.  The field of vision is far too small for my viewing need.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t see enough of your face when you look into it. 3 inches is okay for regular mirrors, like a compact in your purse, but with magnification, especially at 15 strength, you just can&#x27;t view enough of what you need to see. We had to return ours and bought the larger Jerson 5.5 inch which works very well for us.</li>
            <li> On the website I didn&#x27;t see it said 2&amp;#34; because the picture made it look big but when I got it I was really upset cause it was so small but I actually use it alot. The big side actually is great and I like that it folds up and I can put it in my tiny drawer on my vanity. I am going to get a bigger one but will definitely take this traveling.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these, one for travel and one to leave at my mom&#x27;s house. It&#x27;s tiny--about 2.5\\&quot; across--and awkward to look into, but fine for travel. Also seems a little spiky, you feel like parts are sticking into you, even though they&#x27;re really not. If you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Nicely made, like the stand, but reflects no better than the $3 one I got at a discount store....doesn&#x27;t seem to enlarge at 15x.  My &#x27;cheap&#x27; 10X works better.</li>
            <li> TOO SMALL ...BYERS PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO SIZE.</li>
            <li> The picture was a little misleading.  I realize in retrospect that discription was accured but my mind had already made an assumption based on photo.</li>
            <li> Warning. This is so small about the only thing you can use it for is to look at your nose. You will not be able to use it to look at your ears, that&#x27;s for sure. Pay attention to the size. It really is only 3-inches.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel as advertised and at a price you can&#x27;t beat.</li>
            <li> Well made little mirror.  Sturdy and long lasting.  Often times these little mirrors are cheesy and easily breakable.  Not this one.  Good design and solid materials.  It&#x27;s a tiny bit smaller than I expected but that makes it good for traveling.</li>
            <li> This is a great little mirror.  It doesn&#x27;t seem distorted at all.  I just wish it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> This mirror would be fine except that the magnification side is 15 times which is too much to use as a travel make up mirror which is why I bought it and I imagine that was what it was intended.  I know I should have considered how much 15 X is but I am not an expert and would not have know that it was not suitable.</li>
            <li> TThe mirror is light and easy to use. I would recommend it for people that use readers. Just wish it had a light.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it was so small:(.</li>
            <li> this is my second one of these they work very well and are well made. i would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Was smaller then I thought it would be</li>
            <li> mirror works well but not a sturdy as I was hoping</li>
            <li> I just got this and it is TINY!  I hope I can return it.  It is not at all what I expected!</li>
            <li> I like this little mirror. You have to get pretty close to use it, but it&#x27;s clear! Folds right up to store and opens and stays where you put it.</li>
            <li> not much to say, it is what it says it is, i wish i had actually realized how small it is.  size is stated, my fault, but what you picture in your mind is bigger than when in your hand.  :  )</li>
            <li> Mirror comes with a sticker that says \\&quot;WARNING: Be sure that the mirror is not in a position where it can reflect sunlight. Reflected sunlight can cause a fire.\\&quot; Great!</li>
            <li> recently saw this for less at Target</li>
            <li> Very good product. It is small but all I need to see great detail in the corner of my eye. The base also is collapsible so I hang it from my swinging mirror to position it at eye level.</li>
            <li> perfect size, folds up for easy carrying, fits perfectly in a makeup bag, excellent magnification, stands on its own or can be hung on a robe hook on the back of the door for hands free use. Its a product I use everyday and I always take it with me when I travel. The perfect size for eye makeup application or tweezing eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Small, light and great.  Got it for keeping in a drawer in my desk, but it&#x27;s perfect for travel. (ever try to put eye makeup on without your glasses?) I recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is a nice small mirror that you can take anywhere.&lt;br /&gt; I use a book light with it to do my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The face is just too small. Magnification is good though.</li>
            <li> I needed a strong magnified mirror so I could see more than just my nose.  Any other part of my face I cannot see if I turn the slightest bit.  If the mirror were much bigger it would be useable.</li>
            <li> Just what you need for a convenience mirror, small, sturdy, and has 2 mirrors, standard and 15x.  The price is right too.</li>
            <li> What a great price for a great item.  Ever see yourself magnified by 15 times?  This is the best thing ever.  You can really see your teeth, your eyebrows, your skin.  Probably more than you ever wanted to see, but you can&#x27;t stop looking because you&#x27;ve never seen it before!</li>
            <li> The mirror was smaller than I was expecting, however the magnification is very good and you can &amp;#34;zoom&amp;#34; in on a specific area. It is really a good size since I travel a lot. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s good. But too small for me. If you only want a small mirror which will not take too much place of your desk,then choose it. It&#x27;s small but enough for daily makeup</li>
            <li> I was expecting a FULL sized mirror....it is something you put in your purse. I can hardly see one eyeball in it.... :( otherwise it is very high quality and a nice mirror.......</li>
            <li> I needed a small mirror that I could put in a desk drawer for FaceTime emergencies. This mirror folds up perfectly small.  I wanted it to have a stand though, in case I need to make repairs before I talk to someone.  I don&#x27;t generally have much time to make a decision but I do prefer for my hair not to be sticking straight up.  LOL.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this mirror.</li>
            <li> Nice!!  Good price, very handy.</li>
            <li> Size is misconcieving.  Way to small to be useful.</li>
            <li> It is very small. As big as my palm.</li>
            <li> A perfect cute mirror to compliment my desk at work.  It looks very stylish!  I get compliments from colleagues.</li>
            <li> I sell at craft fairs with a friend, and many of our items are wearable, like hats and headbands. We wanted a mirror so people could try our items on and see what they look like, but we didn&#x27;t want anything that would take up too much display space. This little mirror is perfect!</li>
            <li> Nice mirror. It folds well. My only complaint is that it is advertised as a travel mirror but does not come with any kind of travel case to protect during travel.</li>
            <li> I Hang it for everyday use and folds up great for travel.</li>
            <li> ugly and is not worth the price, This thing should cost $5 max..i will keep it around and give it to someone as Christmas gift</li>
            <li> I like this mirror for my purse, I had to buy a bigger mirror for home to do my hair and make-up. This product is good for on the go.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for travel. Too short to be used on the table. The diameter is small. I personally prefer higher degree of enlargement. I returned the product.</li>
            <li> These type of mirrors are awful! I see everything . This is a love hate thing I think. Get one and see what you have missed....lol</li>
            <li> MUCH SMALLER than I expected. I most likely wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it if I knew it was that small. It is very good quality though and good for travel.</li>
            <li> a little bit expensive</li>
            <li> Mirror was too little, something that you couldn&#x27;t tell from advertised photos. Be more clear in the product description about the size of the product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for fitting in my makeup bag and putting on a table to do makeup. Stands without falling over. Great idea!</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. It is small but just what I needed to help me get my eye makeup on in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Great purr or for eye Makeup!🎉😘</li>
            <li> Nice but quite small.</li>
            <li> Great for my old 50 year old eyes on trips.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this on a whim. My girl friend had used the bigger 8 inch Jerdon in a hotel so I tracked one down and was ordering it when I saw this smaller travel size. She loves it. It&#x27;s the perfect size and the stand is genius. It stands at almost any angle and still folds flat for travel.  For better or worse the 15x leaves nothing to the imagination. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I like the quality of the 2 optical sides this little mirror. I use it regularly, like the small size, and would recommend others to buy this. It arrived pretty fast in the mail also.</li>
            <li> Mostly my fault that I purchased this mirror. I didn&#x27;t read the size right. Mirror was too small, the advertisement (picture) made this mirror appear larger than it was. Gave mirror to my boyfriend. Ended up going to Bed Bath and Beyond to make sure I got the size I wanted. Plus I would recommend a case for this mirror to travel with.</li>
            <li> A little small but It&#x60;s so good I tink if you make the item in 10 cms. it will be better</li>
            <li> This is a great little mirror... emphasis on LITTLE.  Silly me, I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size -- which is SMALL.  But, I needed a travel mirror, and this is perfect for that situation.  For everyday, though, it&#x27;s a bit small for everyday use.  But that&#x27;s not the mirror&#x27;s fault!!!</li>
            <li> SURE HELPS WHEN YOU CAN&#x27;T SEE!!</li>
            <li> This little mirror rocks. It is super magnified and can sit easily on the counter or desk without taking up too much space. It is small and folds nicely for trips as well. Now I can pour over my pores and pluck my eyebrows with ease ;-)</li>
            <li> this is just what i wanted to replace one that broke.  it is great for travel.  wish it had come with a travel bag to keep it in, but my old one did, so i am using that.</li>
            <li> Love the magnification and size.  Wish it had a soft bag protector, but I can make that.</li>
            <li> Good travel mirror small for daily use</li>
            <li> Works perfect for travel and fits in my makeup bag</li>
            <li> This smaller mirror was a great addition to my personal kit for traveling. The magnification level sure helps to focus on skin problems on the face.</li>
            <li> This mirror is a great size for traveling.  It also has great strength for seeing those tiny little hairs that I don&#x27;t want!!</li>
            <li> i wanted a large  mirror  so i return  it for something else i saw the same one in a store</li>
            <li> I think that it is a nice product, but would be better suited for small children. You cannot really see much if you&#x27;re trying to apply makeup, but it is very sturdy and the magnifying side is quite nice. I would not recommend this unless you are strictly using it for travel. One thing you should consider though, is that even though it was listed as a travel mirror, it does not come with a carrying case or protective film to actually travel with.</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I WANTED.  YES, IT&#x27;S SMALL, OTHER REVIEWERS OBVIOUSLY DIDN&#x27;T READ THE TITLE.  PERFECT FOR MY NEEDS.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror years ago just by chance at a drugstore. I thought at the time it might not be great for traveling because of the metal/glass combination but it was the only 15X travel mirror in the store. I traveled around the world with this thing on business and pleasure, and got to the point where I couldn&#x27;t travel without it. Then after about 5 years, I dropped it on a hard surface and it broke. So I tried a bunch of other travel mirrors and was never happy. I FINALLY found this one again here on Amazon! I am so happy! The neck makes it great to use for various applications and its easy to fold. Its not good for hair because its too small, just for eyebrow tweezing, etc. It may be a teeny bit heavier than a plastic mirror, but worth every ounce. I put it in a thick sport sock when I travel to give it protection. I might buy the 5\\&quot; one, too, so I can use it for hair. But once you get used to 15X, its hard to go down in magnification. I never had problems with the screws or their tension, but maybe they have since put some cheaper screws in??? I&#x27;m buying it today and I&#x27;ll find out.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I expected. X 15 is not really clear and takes a lot of eye string to focus</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually smaller than I expected. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> smaller then I thought it would be. But still a great product.</li>
            <li> It is really strong so you may want to use a lower number than the one I got.  I am so blind it worked for me.</li>
            <li> exactly the perfect size for traveling. Excellent mirror and compact folding.</li>
            <li> Folds up nice and small and it looks ok, but it is too small to be of much practical use.</li>
            <li> Good to travel with but would have been easier to use if it were an inch or so wider in diameter.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this mirror.  After putting in my contacts in I can not see up close to put on my eye make up.  The 15x magnification is great.</li>
