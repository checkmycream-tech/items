            <li>really cute.</li>
            <li>curling iron is very easy to use, heats up very quickly</li>
            <li>By the way, it did not come with a free comb either.</li>
            <li>just the feel of it is cheap.</li>
            <li>it is really hot!!</li>
            <li>God willing, will be asking for more of it</li>

            <li>It takes some getting used to, but well worth the effort.</li>
            <li>and I wish him well and success</li>
            <li>Great product, exactly as described and it shows no signs of breaking down.</li>
            <li>Super hot.     </li>
            <li>access was very fast</li>
            <li>, if used properly, this is a fantastic styling tool!</li>
            <li>It gets really hot</li>
            <li>Let me say this first: I returned my wand.</li>
            <li>This iron is quite good, you make your hair in few minutes.</li>
            <li>but I wanted more clean waves, and to tone down the frizz.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m harible at doing my own hair usually but with this I can do it pretty well!</li>
            <li>The rod is easy enough to get the hang of, but don&#x27;t try it without the heat resistant glove!</li>
            <li>I feel really pissed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real jose eber</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I will recommend my friends, I thank you very much&lt;</li>
            <li>so fast ..</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve shelled out the money for professional straighteners, but never even knew there was a curling rod like this available until recently.</li>
            <li>I have very long, thick, coarse hair that can be unmanageable, but this iron is perfect!  </li>
            <li>With 2 little ones in the house I didn&#x27;t feel safe using it.</li>
            <li>only tried it once as of right now.</li>
            <li>Especially the cute pink zebra print option.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li>Thank you for offering professional products at a discounted price.  </li>
            <li>I have spent a considerable sum of money in an attempt to get some curls in my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have small hands, so I had to find another one at  Sally&#x27;s to fit me.  </li>
            <li>It is more expensive than any curling iron I&#x27;ve used in the past, but so worth it!</li>

            <li> I have spent a considerable sum of money in an attempt to get some curls in my long, fine hair. It&#x27;s day two with this iron and I&#x27;m amazed. I got out of bed with curls. So many celebrity endorsements prove to be all flash with no substance. Not this one..  It takes some getting used to, but well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I have seen movie stars with long wavy curls in their hair, and never knew how they achieved it.  Now I know their secret!  I have very long, thick, coarse hair that can be unmanageable, but this iron is perfect!  I have never gotten so many compliments on my hairstyle before.  I am so thrilled I made this purchase!  I&#x27;ve been using it every day.  The only caution I would give is if you accidentally touch the iron to your skin it burns badly within seconds, so you have to be very careful!  Other than that, if used properly, this is a fantastic styling tool!</li>
            <li> I bought the product expecting it to be Jose Eber, it turned out to be aJeAngeLIQUE !!.&lt;br /&gt;having paid over 40$ in shipping I feel really pissed.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve shelled out the money for professional straighteners, but never even knew there was a curling rod like this available until recently. It is more expensive than any curling iron I&#x27;ve used in the past, but so worth it! I have thick, naturally curly hair, and this has made my hair life so much easier. Now all I have to do is blow dry and curl, which is a lot faster than straightening everything to perfection. The curls look awesome and hold for days.     The rod is easy enough to get the hang of, but don&#x27;t try it without the heat resistant glove! Super hot.     Definitely recommend! Especially the cute pink zebra print option.</li>
            <li> I liked the product so&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s wonderful In use&lt;br /&gt;Good temperature&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And delivers on time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for this wonderful product</li>
            <li> Turns out that this curling iron does not work at all. I read the reviews on this same brand and decided to go for the bigger sized barrel since I don&#x27;t like tight curls. My hair is naturally wavy but I wanted more clean waves, and to tone down the frizz. This iron does not curl at all! I wish I could return it cause Im so unhappy with it...I don&#x27;t recommend it at all. By the way, it did not come with a free comb either.</li>
            <li> amazing in everything .. i recommend it for everyone.. i love it in the morning because it doesn&#x27;t take time to do my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real jose eber</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0046HO9PK Jose Eber Pro Series 25mm Pink Zebra Curling Iron w/Free Comb]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curling iron is very easy to use, heats up very quickly and I recommend you use glove which comes with the product.  The iron was fitted with a 2 prong plug - you will need to purchase international plug for use in the UK but this just fitted in together without removing the 2 prong plug.</li>
            <li> works great just the feel of it is cheap. and non of the paper work matched the product that I got. odd but this product works great only tried it once as of right now.</li>
            <li> This iron is quite good, you make your hair in few minutes. Only disadvantage is there isn&#x27;t heat adjustment, but again it is god</li>
            <li> I bought the  jose eber 19mm awhile back and i love it! When i seen this one i thought wow a jose eber for half the price of what i paid for my other one! So i got it and i feel like its a knock off. Note to self, if it seems to good to be true; it probably is.</li>
            <li> The Jose Eber was bought for a gift and my daughter loves it. It makes her hair bouncy and the curls last all day. (depends on humidity) I bought her the 25mm barrel and 19mm.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this seller and item lead time was very fast and in perfect condition&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend dealing with him and I wish him well and success</li>
            <li> This excellent product has impressed all who saw or Try it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; God willing, will be asking for more of it&lt;br /&gt; In the coming period</li>
            <li> My sister and I both have really long hair and it worked wonders . Comes with a glove and comb and the iron its self is very cute</li>
            <li> Great , I love it so much üòç&lt;br /&gt;Thank you ..</li>
            <li> jose is papillary at my can try spicily between college girl  make your hair nice thanks I thank of miny one</li>
            <li> We have had this product for a long time and I forgot to write a review.  Great product, exactly as described and it shows no signs of breaking down.</li>
            <li> I am a hair stylist, these were offered at a show, and my team mates bought them.  When I saw how well they worked, on beautiful beachy waves for hair, I had to have one.  So, I found them on AMAZON, which I was excited and got it cheaper.  Thank you for offering professional products at a discounted price.  Oh, in case you are wondering, the golve comes with it inside the box, although it does not state it.  One size.  I have small hands, so I had to find another one at  Sally&#x27;s to fit me.  Otherwise, it is great.  Fast ship, great item.  Thank you Amazon</li>
            <li> If I can do it, you can do it! I love my Jose Eber Curling Iron. I&#x27;m harible at doing my own hair usually but with this I can do it pretty well! This is a great price for this Pro Iron! It gets really hot so make sure you wear your glove!</li>
            <li> Hello this product is excellent and thank you, you accelerated access was very fast I will recommend my friends, I thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;¬† This product is excellent</li>
            <li> Let me say this first: I returned my wand. The wand worked perfectly, however one split second touch of it and I have a nikel sized scar on my arm from it. With 2 little ones in the house I didn&#x27;t feel safe using it. It doesn&#x27;t have any type of stand so a brush of the cord and it was tumbling off the counter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect item .. I love it and my hair love it&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so fast .. Just  in quarter hour</li>
            <li> Came with heat resistant glove. Use it! it is really hot!! makes long lasting curls. really cute. works well. I have about 18 in length hair and it works well, but I think I want to get the 32mm next for larger curls.</li>
            <li> This works well and I paid 1/3 of the price for this one here on Amazon than I paid for my 20mm wand at the mall!</li>
            <li> I liked the way the hair work</li>
    </ol>
