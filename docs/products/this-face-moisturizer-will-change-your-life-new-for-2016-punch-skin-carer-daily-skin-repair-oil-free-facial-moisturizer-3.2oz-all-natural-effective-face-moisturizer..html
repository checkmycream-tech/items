            <li>It even came with a nice cover for the pump to use when you travel.</li>
            <li>And I really liked that product as well until my skin became accustom to it and became oily by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>After a week or so it normalized, now I use it sparingly during the day and abundantly at night.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell of it and the texture.</li>
            <li>The Best that I have tried hands down and at a great price that does not break the bank</li>
            <li>Gentle and easy to use, the packaging is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I love it, it works amazingly well :)</li>
            <li>The bottle it came in is very nice, and it pumps just the right amount.</li>
            <li>Since it really works well on my skin to smooth out wrinkles and seems to be a very good product, I purchased again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS MOISTURIZER</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I love how my skin feels.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so, so much better than before I started using this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love this company.</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>Non greasy, nice and light scent.</li>
            <li>You would think I paid much more for this than I did.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I LOVE this moisturizer...</li>
            <li>I love every product made by Punch Skin Care.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this skin cream.</li>
            <li>I love the way my face feels after I have applied it.</li>
            <li>What a lovely combination.  </li>
            <li>More supple, smoother, softer, healthier looking.</li>
            <li>Love this cream.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s more of a variety....</li>
            <li>:) I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>It has a very mild, fresh scent and feels so good.</li>
            <li>Works right away!!</li>
            <li>Punch&#x27;s product has a very light cumber-like scent that is so mild you may not even notice it.</li>
            <li>First time it was amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is hands down, the very best I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Seams to be working just fine, in combination with a vitamin c</li>
            <li>To give the product another chance because it wasn&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li>I am a 60 year old man who never followed the wise advice to protect my skin from UV.</li>
            <li>I really like the texture and really do enjoy how refreshing and light it feels on my face.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best moisurizers I have tried; the only issue I have with it is my 23 year old daughter keeps taking it.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth and my face is left with a lovely glow afterwards.</li>
            <li>I already have more coming, mainly because I keep using it on my hands and arms.</li>
            <li>Not seen any results, went quickly</li>
            <li>I also end up super shiny during the day.</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much!</li>
            <li>Was looking for an organic moisturizer for my sensitive skin and was so so glad when I stumbled upon this product.</li>
            <li>I put it on right before my make-up</li>
            <li>Right now it smells soapy to me</li>
            <li>I also love the natural scent and bottle its very practical.</li>
            <li>The more i used it though I felt the center of my face become very agitated then full blown irritation!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but it&#x27;s just a simple moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Pretty packaging.</li>
            <li>After declining to buy the $63 moisturizer at the salon where I got my facial, I found this lovely moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Used for first time today.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid Amazon purchaser and never do you find this.</li>
            <li>As an Asian woman who is very heavily dependent on her skincare regime, I feel this is a great staple to have and can see myself switching out between my name brands that I often use to keep my skin young and healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very interesting how every (with the exception of just few people that gave it 1-2 stars) person happen to give 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Regardless, there are much cheaper oil-free moisturizers out there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and this company!</li>
            <li>IT RESURFACES, IT IS VERY RECOMMENDED.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizer is really lightweight.</li>
            <li>Additionally shipping is really fast.</li>
            <li>Really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li>and I am still undecided if I really like it or not.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using shiseido for my face and decollete prior and wanted to try something more natural.</li>
            <li>so it isn&#x27;t my favorite scent, but also my skin feels pretty tight after I use it.</li>
            <li>All of the reviews are great, but unfortunately it has been really breaking out my skin which is usually pretty clear.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it for a few more weeks just because I want to give it time to see if it really improves my skin or not.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Its a good moisturizer, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Really works and lots cheaper than those fancy creams from dept stores that I used to buy when I was young.</li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s hot outside my face gets really shiny.</li>
            <li>My only reason for not giving five stars is I was personally hoping it would keep my skin from becoming oily the entire day, but I do find my skin becoming oily by about the mid afternoon.</li>
            <li>But does not list the ingredients on the actual bottle which is not common in the beauty industry, kind of shady.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how they could possibly have so many positive reviews, but I HIGHLY recommend reading the negative reviews before buying this.</li>
            <li>I am 48 yrs old and never have breakouts.</li>
            <li>NOT WATERY, BUT NOT HEAVY.  </li>
            <li>Did not cause any break out to my ultra sensitive face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and acne prone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a face rash before this, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and it works perfect as a base.</li>
            <li>little comment the pump disperses a tremendous amount</li>
            <li>Left my skin very soft and eliminated most oil, but broke me out worse.</li>
            <li>but it has a bit of an odd odor (consistent with the ingredients).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for the past few days now and am quite pleased with it thus far.  </li>
            <li>It IS an organic product that uses natural ingredients so that&#x27;s the only reason I can think that it smells so different</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hard sell, and don&#x27;t commit to many beauty products, but this product I will buy again when it runs out, and won&#x27;t look for any other product.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer left my face feeling soft and hydrated all day long.</li>
            <li>I have very apparent dark circles from long work days and not as much sleep as I can get and saw that after using it the past few days they disappeared as well as some spots around my face that were a bit more dry.  </li>

            <li> My only reason for not giving five stars is I was personally hoping it would keep my skin from becoming oily the entire day, but I do find my skin becoming oily by about the mid afternoon.</li>
            <li> But does not list the ingredients on the actual bottle which is not common in the beauty industry, kind of shady.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they could possibly have so many positive reviews, but I HIGHLY recommend reading the negative reviews before buying this.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for the past few days now and am quite pleased with it thus far.  </li>
            <li> It IS an organic product that uses natural ingredients so that&#x27;s the only reason I can think that it smells so different</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hard sell, and don&#x27;t commit to many beauty products, but this product I will buy again when it runs out, and won&#x27;t look for any other product.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer left my face feeling soft and hydrated all day long.</li>
            <li> I have very apparent dark circles from long work days and not as much sleep as I can get and saw that after using it the past few days they disappeared as well as some spots around my face that were a bit more dry.  </li>

            <li> have tried other moisturizers, like Mac oil-free, and they either leave my skin feeling still dry or too oily.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s oil-free, my skin isn&#x27;t left with that over oiled feel or appearance, and my skin still feels firm and supple.</li>
            <li> Second, my skin broke out into a rash in my T-zone after using this for a few days, so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month now and for the last week and a half, my face has been getting little bumps, which is not normal for my skin.  </li>

            <li> I bought this about a week ago and have been using it everyday</li>
            <li> Waste of 28 bucks.</li>
            <li> I have a small brown patch on my forehead from tanning,  and the lotion has done nothing to lighten it as it claims (it days to focus on that spot and rub in circles) and</li>

            <li> It feel like silk on my face, seriously.  </li>
            <li> First off, the smell is awful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dishonest.</li>

            <li> Congrats on those who found this product helpful for their skin, but alas I must look elsewhere.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works right away!! The Best that I have tried hands down and at a great price that does not break the bank</li>
            <li> Moisurizer works great - but does not pump out of the pump at all. So very inconvenient to get to it to use it. Serious design flaw.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it felt when applied....two days later my face started breaking out. I am 48 yrs old and never have breakouts. To give the product another chance because it wasn&#x27;t cheap I quit using it for a week. Two days later same thing. So disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Please do your due diligence. Look at the ratings history of the majority of these users. All evidence points toward an unnatural ratings hike. The majority of people have only made one rating. The way they advertise the product screams scam. &amp;#34;Hyaluronic acid holds 1000 times it&#x27;s weight in water&amp;#34; but what does that mean for my skin? And claiming &amp;#34;this moisturizer will change your life&amp;#34; is a shameful way of preying on those with bad skin who want nothing more than to have clear, radiant skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s a great product but I cannot purchase this product if the company is inherently dishonest. Regardless, there are much cheaper oil-free moisturizers out there.&lt;br /&gt;I felt I must tell you all.</li>
            <li> if it didn&#x27;t smell so god awful I would have kept it but the scent absolutely made me sick</li>
            <li> makes you smell like a cucumber. not for dudes!!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer.  I would have given it 5 stars but it has a bit of an odd odor (consistent with the ingredients).  Will purchase again &amp; recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer will change your life!&lt;br /&gt;It is hands down, the very best I have ever tried. It has a very mild, fresh scent and feels so good. I already have more coming, mainly because I keep using it on my hands and arms. It just feels too good not to use! I highly recommend this product and this company! I also have the eye cream coming and if it&#x27;s anything like the moisturizer, I know I will love it too!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS MOISTURIZER BUT IT SEEMS TO HAVE DISAPPEARED FROM AMAZON AND ITS OWN WEBSITE.  TOO BAD.  A REALLY GOOD PRODUCT.  WOULD HAVE BEEN A RETURN PURCHASER.&lt;br /&gt;THE CREAM WAS MEDIUM CONSISTANCY:  NOT WATERY, BUT NOT HEAVY.  SINCE I WAS OIL FREE, I WAS HAPPY TO USE IT IN THE WARMER MONTHS, BUT FELT IT WOULD WORK ALL YEAR.&lt;br /&gt;IF IT RESURFACES, IT IS VERY RECOMMENDED.  I&#x27;D LIKE TO TRY THE EYE CREAM TOO.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer ever!!!!  You only need a small amount (1/2-pump or 1-pump) to cover your face and neck.  There is no greasy residue and it blends nicely.  The smell is good, too.  I love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I like the product over all. Don&#x27;t care for the smell. I like that it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores!!</li>
            <li> Absorbs well!  I mix it with Vitamin C Powder for morning application.  Goes great under sunscreen, etc.</li>
            <li> I do believe that this is a great product for someone with non-sensitive skin. There was something in this product that I aggravated my skin and made it almost look shiny and a snake like.</li>
            <li> Moisturizer is really lightweight. Did not cause any break out to my ultra sensitive face.&lt;br /&gt;However, there&#x27;s a fragrance that took me some days to getting use to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for the past few days now and am quite pleased with it thus far.  I have very apparent dark circles from long work days and not as much sleep as I can get and saw that after using it the past few days they disappeared as well as some spots around my face that were a bit more dry.  I really like the texture and really do enjoy how refreshing and light it feels on my face.  As an Asian woman who is very heavily dependent on her skincare regime, I feel this is a great staple to have and can see myself switching out between my name brands that I often use to keep my skin young and healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. The pump comes in very handy as well. I leave it out on my vanity and use it every morning before my makeup. My skin is sensitive and acne prone. This moisturizer did not upset me at all. It has no smell which is wonderful and is not at all greasy or watery. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Was looking for an organic moisturizer for my sensitive skin and was so so glad when I stumbled upon this product. I bought this about a week ago and have been using it everyday and I love how my skin feels. Since it&#x27;s oil-free, my skin isn&#x27;t left with that over oiled feel or appearance, and my skin still feels firm and supple. I put it on right before my make-up and it works perfect as a base. It truly is an amazing product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It is very smooth and my face is left with a lovely glow afterwards.</li>
            <li> and I not give it 20 stars because I can not but wonderful my skin looks great and people can see I feel I have wanted to ask feel but dare i love skin punch care</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:7cb569916e0c29ea4846fdc35f224ba9]] My skin looks so, so much better than before I started using this moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve even taking to not wearing foundation as often because my skin looks so amazing.  I will definitely be repurchasing this when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before.  Since it really works well on my skin to smooth out wrinkles and seems to be a very good product, I purchased again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this second purchase, even though it still performs well as a moisturizer, the smell was horrible!  I am still using it b/c I like the results of the product.  It IS an organic product that uses natural ingredients so that&#x27;s the only reason I can think that it smells so different this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, as I said, I like  the results but it smells TOTALLY different this time than the previous purchase I made.</li>
            <li> I did not see the change after using it. Not as good as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and it came immediately in the mall. Honestly,  this product has done wonders to my face and I am truly content with the results. My face is so supple and this product is 100% organic. Thank you so very much! Additionally shipping is really fast. I love this company. XO</li>
            <li> I had no qualms with the seller, just the product. All of the raving reviews and the pictures convinced me to buy this. I have been using it for about a month now and have noticed NO change. I have used it as it instructs.  I have a small brown patch on my forehead from tanning,  and the lotion has done nothing to lighten it as it claims (it days to focus on that spot and rub in circles) and if it&#x27;s hot outside my face gets really shiny. It&#x27;s okay, but it&#x27;s just a simple moisturizer. I will continue to use it but it&#x27;s not as great as it claims to be.</li>
            <li> Left my skin very soft and eliminated most oil, but broke me out worse. Another product given to my niece, leaves her skin beautiful. I will not be ordering these products again due to my sensitive skin, however my niece loves them, they work wonders for her and she will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Pretty packaging. First time it was amazing. Felt great and no oily face. The more i used it though I felt the center of my face become very agitated then full blown irritation! Really wanted it to work. Congrats on those who found this product helpful for their skin, but alas I must look elsewhere. Returned.</li>
            <li> Just ok. No clue why this got all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Non greasy, nice and light scent. Haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet.</li>
            <li> All of the reviews are great, but unfortunately it has been really breaking out my skin which is usually pretty clear. I am going to stick with it for another week, and see what happens.  I will update with any changes.</li>
            <li> Really nice moisturizer.  I found this after having a chemical peel which caused my skin to break out in a &amp;#34;dry rash.&amp;#34;  This has&lt;br /&gt;helped to quell those break outs.  I will keep buying this one.</li>
            <li> Great product, moisturizes the skin nicely.  Gentle and easy to use, the packaging is wonderful.  Love it!</li>
            <li> After declining to buy the $63 moisturizer at the salon where I got my facial, I found this lovely moisturizer. This moisturizer makes my face feel great from the moment I put it on, and all the throughout the day. The bottle it came in is very nice, and it pumps just the right amount. It even came with a nice cover for the pump to use when you travel. You would think I paid much more for this than I did.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other moisturizers, like Mac oil-free, and they either leave my skin feeling still dry or too oily. This moisturizer provides what us oily skin gals are looking for - moisture without the oil. I&#x27;m a hard sell, and don&#x27;t commit to many beauty products, but this product I will buy again when it runs out, and won&#x27;t look for any other product. I guess you could say, I found the &amp;#34;one&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell. This smells like stinky weeds, I like a herbal smell, but this just smells bad.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this moisturizer...I love every product made by Punch Skin Care.</li>
            <li> I am a 60 year old man who never followed the wise advice to protect my skin from UV. I am outside a LOT! This is one of the best moisurizers I have tried; the only issue I have with it is my 23 year old daughter keeps taking it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this skin cream. I had been using Dove&#x27;s Men + Care Hydrate Face Lotion for about a year prior to trying Punch&#x27;s product. And I really liked that product as well until my skin became accustom to it and became oily by the end of the day. Punch&#x27;s product has a very light cumber-like scent that is so mild you may not even notice it. My skin feels great all day and my wife is even enjoying it. My only reason for not giving five stars is I was personally hoping it would keep my skin from becoming oily the entire day, but I do find my skin becoming oily by about the mid afternoon. Regardless, I am extremely happy with this product and I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Not seen any results, went quickly</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:cf8e885acabd18a247f9561fd608403d]] This moisturizer left my face feeling soft and hydrated all day long. I also love the natural scent and bottle its very practical.</li>
            <li> First off, the smell is awful. Can&#x27;t really describe it, just not pleasant. Second, my skin broke out into a rash in my T-zone after using this for a few days, so I stopped using it. The rash went away the next day. I decided to just try it again just in case it was something else. I put it on, the rash was back the next day. So I&#x27;ve concluded without a doubt that it&#x27;s this product. I&#x27;ve never had a face rash before this, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin either.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m throwing this in the trash. Waste of 28 bucks. I don&#x27;t know how they could possibly have so many positive reviews, but I HIGHLY recommend reading the negative reviews before buying this.</li>
            <li> love this stuff! it keeps my skin moisturized all day without getting oily!!</li>
            <li> I stopped using this because I think this broke me out. I also end up super shiny during the day.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream since I got it and I don&#x27;t think I could not wear it.  It feels good as you apply it and it absorbs into the skin immediately, it&#x27;s not greasy or leaves your face shiny.  There are times when I use it as a night cream also.  I love the way my face feels after I have applied it.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!  I use this product with the exfoliator.  What a lovely combination.  I&#x27;ve noticed such a change in my skin.  More supple, smoother, softer, healthier looking. My boyfriend loves this lotion.  It feel like silk on my face, seriously.  We will definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> like it a lot! Good product and my face is softer than ever.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer!! I love it, it works amazingly well :)</li>
            <li> Its a good moisturizer, a little goes a long way. I will purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using shiseido for my face and decollete prior and wanted to try something more natural. The transition was a little strange, my skin went through changes, it got extra oily towards the end of the day. After a week or so it normalized, now I use it sparingly during the day and abundantly at night. Seams to be working just fine, in combination with a vitamin c serum.&lt;br /&gt;One little comment the pump disperses a tremendous amount, i stopped using it all together(one star less).</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry sick (age 69 ).  Used for first time today.  Really works and lots cheaper than those fancy creams from dept stores that I used to buy when I was young.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.  Not greasy and makes your skin feel really good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very interesting how every (with the exception of just few people that gave it 1-2 stars) person happen to give 5 stars. I am an avid Amazon purchaser and never do you find this. There&#x27;s more of a variety....not almost all 5 stars, not even on the best of products. I&#x27;m starting to wonder if people that work for the company fill out these reviews?&lt;br /&gt;Well I liked the smell of it and the texture. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky. I have been using it for a month now and for the last week and a half, my face has been getting little bumps, which is not normal for my skin.  I am very skeptical about the ingredients. It says organic on amazon and on the box. But does not list the ingredients on the actual bottle which is not common in the beauty industry, kind of shady. I like to know what I am putting on my skin. I do not like when people use the word &amp;#34; organic&amp;#34; as a selling point but cannot back it up. It&#x27;s very dishonest. Ingredients should always be on the bottle!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:c37c96cc649ce9c6efee07bc4b1698f0]] Really great moisturizer :) I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any changes in my face since i started using it,  just a burning sensation every time i use it.  i don&#x27;t recommend this cream to anyone  is not what it says......</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a week and I am still undecided if I really like it or not. Right now it smells soapy to me so it isn&#x27;t my favorite scent, but also my skin feels pretty tight after I use it. It might be because it has &amp;#34;small protein peptides stimulating cell renewal, strengthen collagen and elastin fibers...&amp;#34; and I am just not used to anti-aging products. I will continue to use it for a few more weeks just because I want to give it time to see if it really improves my skin or not. I will come back and let you know!</li>
