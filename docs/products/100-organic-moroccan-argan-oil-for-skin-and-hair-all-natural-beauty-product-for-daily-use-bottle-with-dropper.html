            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it and will be purchasing more when this bottle runs out!</li>
            <li>It’s in an amber bottle, which is great for argan oil, and it has a nice eyedropper with it, so it is easy to control the amount and dispersion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>An oil can be 100% pure, resolutely certified, and absolutely wonderful - yet still vary in origin, absorption and even scent.  </li>

            <li>I really liked this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and immediately it feels and looks better, but the best results come after it has had a chance to get absorbed in a bit.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>This oil is a good consistency and works great on my skin and hair absorbing quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I found this to be a nice oil and of very high quality and good value.</li>
            <li>I prefer droplet applicators because they gives me more control than the spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked great, but the area it really worked fantastically was my HAIR.</li>
            <li>which I&#x27;m sure you already know, but</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair feels after using a drop or</li>
            <li>Organic Argan Oil is considered one of the most versatile beauty oils that one can have in their collections of beauty products.</li>

            <li>Very pleased with the results at a very competitive price (18.99 for 2 oz at the time of this review)</li>
            <li>It is especially helpful for heat-treated or damaged hair and gives it a beautiful sheen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not bad, but much more so than the serum,</li>
            <li>I put my oil in a misting bottle and finely mist my hair.</li>
            <li>It made the split ends less noticeable and still, no grease.&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is also wonderful for helping your eyelashes grow, just like Castor Oil.</li>

            <li>My hair looks shiny and best of all, this oil does not weigh it down!</li>
            <li>free sample was provided for review.</li>
            <li>It feels smooth and silky even in the morning when you wake up.  </li>
            <li>I wake up with baby-soft, acne free skin.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample for evaluation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>was provided a free sample for review.</li>
            <li>I was offered a free sample of this oil from Health Nut in exchange for my unbiased opinion, so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scent free, nothing else added to make me break out, those two things are important.</li>
            <li>I was provided a free sample of this for my review.</li>
            <li>The oil really helps the tangles slide out, and her hair looks nice and shiny.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic for de-tangling hair.</li>
            <li>Free Product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is incredible when you use it just after blow drying and right before using a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>dropper bottle, making it very easy to control just how much you want to use.</li>
            <li>bottle for review, I was excited.</li>
            <li>For those familiar with curly hair, my hair looks like a 2C but feels like a 2B.  </li>
            <li>This is pure, organic Argan oil, a great oil for natural hair and skin care.</li>
            <li>This oil is not heavy or smelly and does not leave your hair greasy looking, it&#x27;s nice and light.  </li>
            <li>Really is the most precise way to get the amount I want without dealing with a stubborn euro-dropper.  </li>
            <li>I received this for free and decided to use it in that way to try it out and so far it&#x27;s worked nicely.</li>
            <li>This oil is great for dry skin and hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s supposed to be pretty good for hair, so this also makes it more likely</li>
            <li>The reason this is AMAZING is because I have naturally oily skin.</li>
            <li>That means a lot when you&#x27;re trying to both care for your skin and look as good as possible for your age!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product for daily use.</li>
            <li>It is quickly absorbed by the skin, locking in moisture, leaving it smooth and moist, and not at all greasy.</li>
            <li>what I like most about this is how much it makes my hair shine.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it..</li>
            <li>If you have normal to oily skin, the eye dropper would give you more control over how much oil you&#x27;re getting/using, but Pura D&#x27;or is the better value per ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>also really like that the glass pipette has graduated measuring marks for a consistent or more precise</li>
            <li>This oil absorbs quickly and doesn’t make her head feel oily and doesn’t have any scent.</li>
            <li>Super shiny and felt just like silk.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed when my hair is damp even though my hair is cool at that point</li>
            <li>It goes on and smooths in easily, leaving skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>this unscented, 100% Pure Organic Moroccan Argan Oil works wonderfully well in restoring health to dry, brittle hair giving it a healthy sheen and likewise restoring moisture to rough, patchy, scaly areas of the skin that have clearly seen better days.</li>
            <li>amber glass bottle protects it from the light and the glass dropper attached to the cap is very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really, truly, enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The oil was easily absorbed into my skin without leaving it greasy.</li>
            <li>Complimentary product</li>
            <li>(That&#x27;s rare to see)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because of its organic nature I think , my skin absorbed this product and was just supple.</li>
            <li>I own 5 different varieties of Argan oil.  </li>
            <li>that the manufacturer provided me with a complimentary sample for this hopefully unbiased review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very light feeling oil too, it absorbs easily and will help with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I was super nervous the first time I used it on my face.  </li>
            <li>A little bit goes a LONG way, so use a light hand until you see what works best for you.</li>
            <li>use it right after I shower and have blotted some water out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>couple of things I like about this right off the bat</li>
            <li>I rubbed a little oil on my hands and instantly they felt so much better and looked great.</li>
            <li>She said it felt really nice and kept her skin moist for a long time, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and does not cause any irritations.</li>
            <li>am 62 with very dry skin and, while I don&#x27;t see any miracles in these products, I do see very good hydration and protection of my skin during what has been the harshest part of one of the harshest winters we&#x27;ve had in several years.</li>
            <li>With the other oils, I tend to have a pleasant feeling with the oil, not so much with this oil.</li>
            <li>Also, I like that Argan Oil by Health Nut comes in glass bottle with dropper, which makes it so easy to use, and it is not wasted by putting it on cotton wool.</li>
            <li>The bottle I got had a date that was good for a year and a half-</li>
            <li>I have curly yet fine hair, so the ends dry out easily and when that happens I get tons of tangles and knots in my hair.</li>
            <li>Some of the oils that claim to be Moroccan are actually thickened by something and tend to sit more of the surface of skin and hair.</li>
            <li>I also put it on my hands, feet and in my bath and my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it after my 3 most recent shampoo days.</li>
            <li>promised in the many YT vids I&#x27;ve watched about this oil, it actually soothed my skin and helped my moisturizer&#x27;s efficiency.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it should do.</li>
            <li>As an lover and owner of a variety of Argan Oils, I definitely give Health Nut&#x27;s a hearty recommendation for skin, hair and beard!  :)</li>
            <li>they actually look BETTER than when I started</li>
            <li>It keeps skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is 100% luscious and precious argan oil, no additives, no extra fragrance.  </li>
            <li>When my hair dried it was gorgeous.</li>
            <li>one from Health Nut is completely scent free, made in the USA, and I love it far better as beard management than a compound Argan oil that I had been using (because of the other oils included</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the scent, it smells slightly nutty and exotic</li>
            <li>it is to find moisturizes that won’t irritate my face and neck - I currently make my own moisturizer with natural oils.  </li>
            <li>I found out that the oil produced from the nut of the Argan tree has been used, pretty much forever, for food, skin and hair.</li>
            <li>My curls stay bouncy and soft and this is light enough to use on day 2 or 3 (without washing) to smooth out the ends again without being oily and</li>
            <li>first thing I did was manage to put too much in my hair.</li>
            <li>It only took a few drops rubbed between my hands and then applied through the hair to give it a nice shine and alleviate static.</li>
            <li>However, I have found over the years (wisdom) that the combination of the  &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; hair washing method, combing with a comb with smooth plastic teeth (without plastic molding edge that is like a razor), and aragan oil has allowed me to grow my hair this long for the first time in my life with ends that are smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>She said many of her clients get dry hair from wearing hats in the winter.</li>
            <li>1oo% Pure Certified Organic Moroccan Argan (Argania  spinosa) Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is 100% pure certified argan oil.  </li>
            <li>Argan oil is 100% pure, it has very lite, hardly noticeable, pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to regulate how much you use too because the dropper has actual measurements.</li>
            <li>oil is a very, very light, almost clear yellow and quite translucent.  </li>
            <li>so I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose by giving the oil a shot.</li>
            <li>This Health Nut Moroccan Oil for me, seems to be the real deal.</li>
            <li>Skin - This oil softens my nail cuticles really well.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer this to the Vitamin C Serum, for my needs.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really believe that it would work.</li>
            <li>And this product really makes my hair shine; the shine lasts all day, too.</li>
            <li>but I really like this one...</li>
            <li>not so much under the lips.  </li>
            <li>and then it really helps to prevent all this.</li>
            <li>I have been using this moroccan argan oil as a hair treatment for myself and my daughter over these cold winter months, and I am very impressed with it!  </li>
            <li>it was very fresh.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs readily.</li>
            <li>So when I was asked if I would try out this product and post an honest review, I wasn&#x27;t hit totally from left field</li>
            <li>As much as I don&#x27;t prefer the dropper applicator when it comes to face or hair, I love it when it comes to hands, because I can put a drop on each knuckle and it soaks right in with little to no rubbing required.</li>

            <li>Like many other curly girls, I have tried so many different products on my curls, and this is by far my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I used it mainly on my hands and forearms which are becoming increasingly dry as I get older.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I love the way it helps with fizziness and seems to lay the cuticle down.</li>
            <li>I really, truly, enjoy using it.ons can when your skin is very dry.</li>

            <li>It only takes a couple of drops to apply to the face for a moisturizer that absorbs well and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I have used it on my hair, which is mainly what I bought it for.</li>
            <li>I have used regular moisturizing cream for so many years, but the results just aren&#x27;t lasting.</li>
            <li>tried it on my legs and they were smooth and soft for an entire day.  </li>
            <li>You can tell it’s a high quality oil that works well and lasts.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li>Only a few drops - which can be easily dispensed with the included dropper - are needed for each application and there is no bothersome, greasy aftereffect with this light oil.</li>
            <li>The first is as a gentle moisturizer on my entire body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very soothing addition to the mask and it leaves your skin very soft and clear.</li>
            <li>love using Argan oil, it helps tame the frizzies.</li>
            <li>and I like to change brands and try new ones all the time to see the differences.  </li>
            <li>I am a new fan of this brand.</li>
            <li>Hair - I have long (passed middle back), very fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>This does rub well between your palms and applies just fine; I don&#x27;t know how long it would last on hair that isn&#x27;t basically fuzz.</li>
            <li>It has slightly nutty light smell, it is not a perfume scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first time I try pure 100% organic Argan oil without any fillers or any other ingredients that compromise the quality of the oil.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is more like the traditional, or even of Jose Maran&#x27;s oil quality, that I have previously purchased.</li>
            <li>We have tried a couple different brands of Argan oil as the better half has always been a believer in Argan oil and uses this on her hair.</li>
            <li>Fairly quick absorption both in skin and wiry beard hairs, and I definitely appreciate this one as the only bottle of Argan Oil</li>
            <li>However, it soaks right into dry</li>

            <li>dfc3d11ed66c1145b0d969c68facf1f4]]I began using argan on regular basis several years ago after my hairdresser recommended that I start using it in the winter because she noticed that the hair on on top of my hair felt dry.</li>
            <li>Now I know I will be purchasing the large bottle next time.  </li>
            <li>Now I know I will be purchasing the large bottle next time.  </li>
            <li>Where do I start with this amazing beauty secret from Morocco?</li>
            <li>The key is not to apply too much not have a greasy hair look.</li>
            <li>This organ oil is 100% and has a natural scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was so surprised when I used the oil</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft with not a trace of oil.</li>
            <li>This can strip the hair of its natural oils, which often leads to frizz and flyaways.</li>
            <li>I spread it out over my hands, pat it onto my hair, and work it through with a natural bristle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far this hasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>On my head, all I can really tell you is that it didn&#x27;t discolor anything or seem too oily, but unfortunately I just can&#x27;t test the hair claims effectively.</li>
            <li>have used a few different brands of Moroccan Argan oil, some have been better than others.</li>
            <li>You should always try new products on a small area of skin before larger use to be sure you won&#x27;t have a problem with it (</li>
            <li>I have tried quite a few different brands trying to avoid the high cost of Josie&#x27;s which is wonderful but expensive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a wonder if you live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way with this in most heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Try a little bit at first before using a whole bottle of lotion.</li>
            <li>By the next morning my hair feels and looks much healthier and over time I really can see a difference in how the ends look because they were looking dry before I started</li>
            <li>It appears to be highly filtered, and possibly deodorized.  </li>
            <li>It is not very much oil at all, but if I use more than that, my hair is oily and limp.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very hard to explain, but it&#x27;s a very light scent.</li>
            <li>The fact we received them for free has no bearing on our review, and we have written negative reviews in the past for products we were sent for free.</li>
            <li>-- first, it&#x27;s pure argan oil, which is somewhat hard to find these days.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find a product that is what it claims, and I believe Health Nut offers a true product.</li>
            <li>In fact, it was after years of going through doctors and medication that her skin finally cleared up and has stayed clear with...extra virgin olive oil.</li>
            <li>It left it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have tried different natural oils like jojoba and avocado</li>
            <li>Argan oil is definitely something to add to your natural care supplies.</li>
            <li>wife mixed this in her body lotion, hand lotion, as well as put it directly on the ends of her hair.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of weeks so far.</li>
            <li>Because it soaks in rapidly and doesn&#x27;t leave a film behind, it is safe to use before I dress</li>
            <li>when used by itself in its pure state (not blended with any other oils)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Argan Oil is one of the few, dry oils available.</li>
            <li>I need to use those oils like a hot treatment and then wash my hair after half an hour or so.  </li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t find that it has much of a scent, so it doesn&#x27;t conflict with other products I choose to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems that the older I get the harder</li>
            <li>Saw it in major stores recently.</li>
            <li>I was afraid to use it at first, because we both have fine silky hair</li>
            <li>I am familiar with Moroccan Argan Oil as one of the key ingredients in a comparable product that I recently evaluated (KERALOGIE Hair Oils Complex -see</li>
            <li>/&gt;This seems to do what it says for both hair and skin and although I will reserve final judgment for my dry skin problem, so far it has worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within a day the dry patch was gone and wonderfully soft hands were left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also used it on my hands; they get dried out really easily and get funky dried patches on them.</li>

            <li> Moroccan Oil is a wonderful beauty treatment and conditions hair and moisturizes skin without clogging pores and breaking out skin.</li>

            <li> Also good to prevent chapped</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with it and will be purchasing more when this bottle runs out!</li>
            <li> It’s in an amber bottle, which is great for argan oil, and it has a nice eyedropper with it, so it is easy to control the amount and dispersion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> An oil can be 100% pure, resolutely certified, and absolutely wonderful - yet still vary in origin, absorption and even scent.  </li>

            <li> I really liked this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and immediately it feels and looks better, but the best results come after it has had a chance to get absorbed in a bit.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> This oil is a good consistency and works great on my skin and hair absorbing quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I found this to be a nice oil and of very high quality and good value.</li>
            <li> I prefer droplet applicators because they gives me more control than the spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked great, but the area it really worked fantastically was my HAIR.</li>

            <li> It is especially helpful for heat-treated or damaged hair and gives it a beautiful sheen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not bad, but much more so than the serum,</li>
            <li> I put my oil in a misting bottle and finely mist my hair.</li>
            <li> It made the split ends less noticeable and still, no grease.&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is also wonderful for helping your eyelashes grow, just like Castor Oil.</li>

            <li> I was provided a free sample of this for my review.</li>

            <li> Free Product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is incredible when you use it just after blow drying and right before using a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> dropper bottle, making it very easy to control just how much you want to use.</li>
            <li> bottle for review, I was excited.</li>
            <li> For those familiar with curly hair, my hair looks like a 2C but feels like a 2B.  </li>
            <li> This is pure, organic Argan oil, a great oil for natural hair and skin care.</li>
            <li> This oil is not heavy or smelly and does not leave your hair greasy looking, it&#x27;s nice and light.  </li>
            <li> Really is the most precise way to get the amount I want without dealing with a stubborn euro-dropper.  </li>
            <li> I received this for free and decided to use it in that way to try it out and so far it&#x27;s worked nicely.</li>
            <li> This oil is great for dry skin and hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s supposed to be pretty good for hair, so this also makes it more likely</li>
            <li> The reason this is AMAZING is because I have naturally oily skin.</li>
            <li> That means a lot when you&#x27;re trying to both care for your skin and look as good as possible for your age!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good product for daily use.</li>
            <li> It is quickly absorbed by the skin, locking in moisture, leaving it smooth and moist, and not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> what I like most about this is how much it makes my hair shine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it..</li>
            <li> If you have normal to oily skin, the eye dropper would give you more control over how much oil you&#x27;re getting/using, but Pura D&#x27;or is the better value per ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> also really like that the glass pipette has graduated measuring marks for a consistent or more precise</li>
            <li> This oil absorbs quickly and doesn’t make her head feel oily and doesn’t have any scent.</li>
            <li> Super shiny and felt just like silk.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed when my hair is damp even though my hair is cool at that point</li>
            <li> It goes on and smooths in easily, leaving skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> this unscented, 100% Pure Organic Moroccan Argan Oil works wonderfully well in restoring health to dry, brittle hair giving it a healthy sheen and likewise restoring moisture to rough, patchy, scaly areas of the skin that have clearly seen better days.</li>
            <li> amber glass bottle protects it from the light and the glass dropper attached to the cap is very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really, truly, enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The oil was easily absorbed into my skin without leaving it greasy.</li>
            <li> Complimentary product</li>
            <li> (That&#x27;s rare to see)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because of its organic nature I think , my skin absorbed this product and was just supple.</li>
            <li> I own 5 different varieties of Argan oil.  </li>
            <li> that the manufacturer provided me with a complimentary sample for this hopefully unbiased review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very light feeling oil too, it absorbs easily and will help with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was super nervous the first time I used it on my face.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a LONG way, so use a light hand until you see what works best for you.</li>
            <li> use it right after I shower and have blotted some water out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> couple of things I like about this right off the bat</li>
            <li> I rubbed a little oil on my hands and instantly they felt so much better and looked great.</li>
            <li> She said it felt really nice and kept her skin moist for a long time, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and does not cause any irritations.</li>
            <li> am 62 with very dry skin and, while I don&#x27;t see any miracles in these products, I do see very good hydration and protection of my skin during what has been the harshest part of one of the harshest winters we&#x27;ve had in several years.</li>
            <li> With the other oils, I tend to have a pleasant feeling with the oil, not so much with this oil.</li>
            <li> Also, I like that Argan Oil by Health Nut comes in glass bottle with dropper, which makes it so easy to use, and it is not wasted by putting it on cotton wool.</li>
            <li> The bottle I got had a date that was good for a year and a half-</li>
            <li> I have curly yet fine hair, so the ends dry out easily and when that happens I get tons of tangles and knots in my hair.</li>
            <li> Some of the oils that claim to be Moroccan are actually thickened by something and tend to sit more of the surface of skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I also put it on my hands, feet and in my bath and my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it after my 3 most recent shampoo days.</li>
            <li> promised in the many YT vids I&#x27;ve watched about this oil, it actually soothed my skin and helped my moisturizer&#x27;s efficiency.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it should do.</li>
            <li> As an lover and owner of a variety of Argan Oils, I definitely give Health Nut&#x27;s a hearty recommendation for skin, hair and beard!  :)</li>
            <li> they actually look BETTER than when I started</li>
            <li> It keeps skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It is 100% luscious and precious argan oil, no additives, no extra fragrance.  </li>
            <li> When my hair dried it was gorgeous.</li>
            <li> one from Health Nut is completely scent free, made in the USA, and I love it far better as beard management than a compound Argan oil that I had been using (because of the other oils included</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the scent, it smells slightly nutty and exotic</li>
            <li> it is to find moisturizes that won’t irritate my face and neck - I currently make my own moisturizer with natural oils.  </li>
            <li> I found out that the oil produced from the nut of the Argan tree has been used, pretty much forever, for food, skin and hair.</li>
            <li> My curls stay bouncy and soft and this is light enough to use on day 2 or 3 (without washing) to smooth out the ends again without being oily and</li>
            <li> first thing I did was manage to put too much in my hair.</li>
            <li> It only took a few drops rubbed between my hands and then applied through the hair to give it a nice shine and alleviate static.</li>
            <li> However, I have found over the years (wisdom) that the combination of the  &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; hair washing method, combing with a comb with smooth plastic teeth (without plastic molding edge that is like a razor), and aragan oil has allowed me to grow my hair this long for the first time in my life with ends that are smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> She said many of her clients get dry hair from wearing hats in the winter.</li>
            <li> 1oo% Pure Certified Organic Moroccan Argan (Argania  spinosa) Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is 100% pure certified argan oil.  </li>
            <li> Argan oil is 100% pure, it has very lite, hardly noticeable, pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to regulate how much you use too because the dropper has actual measurements.</li>
            <li> oil is a very, very light, almost clear yellow and quite translucent.  </li>
            <li> so I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose by giving the oil a shot.</li>
            <li> This Health Nut Moroccan Oil for me, seems to be the real deal.</li>
            <li> Skin - This oil softens my nail cuticles really well.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer this to the Vitamin C Serum, for my needs.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really believe that it would work.</li>
            <li> And this product really makes my hair shine; the shine lasts all day, too.</li>
            <li> but I really like this one...</li>
            <li> not so much under the lips.  </li>
            <li> and then it really helps to prevent all this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moroccan argan oil as a hair treatment for myself and my daughter over these cold winter months, and I am very impressed with it!  </li>
            <li> it was very fresh.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs readily.</li>
            <li> So when I was asked if I would try out this product and post an honest review, I wasn&#x27;t hit totally from left field</li>
            <li> As much as I don&#x27;t prefer the dropper applicator when it comes to face or hair, I love it when it comes to hands, because I can put a drop on each knuckle and it soaks right in with little to no rubbing required.</li>

            <li> Like many other curly girls, I have tried so many different products on my curls, and this is by far my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It soaks into dry skin very quickly and does *not</li>
            <li> It is frizzy in the winter and the ends tend to dry easily.  </li>
            <li> pharmaceutical-grade, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) requirements underscores the manufacturer&#x27;s (Health Nut) serious commitment to quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it mainly on my hands and forearms which are becoming increasingly dry as I get older.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I love the way it helps with fizziness and seems to lay the cuticle down.</li>
            <li> I really, truly, enjoy using it.ons can when your skin is very dry.</li>
            <li> I am a life long herbal supplement taker with strong interests both in the  medicinal traditions and modern pharmacological aspects of Earth&#x27;s Natural Bounties.</li>
            <li> It only takes a couple of drops to apply to the face for a moisturizer that absorbs well and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my hair, which is mainly what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> I have used regular moisturizing cream for so many years, but the results just aren&#x27;t lasting.</li>
            <li> tried it on my legs and they were smooth and soft for an entire day.  </li>
            <li> You can tell it’s a high quality oil that works well and lasts.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Only a few drops - which can be easily dispensed with the included dropper - are needed for each application and there is no bothersome, greasy aftereffect with this light oil.</li>
            <li> The first is as a gentle moisturizer on my entire body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very soothing addition to the mask and it leaves your skin very soft and clear.</li>
            <li> love using Argan oil, it helps tame the frizzies.</li>
            <li> and I like to change brands and try new ones all the time to see the differences.  </li>
            <li> I am a new fan of this brand.</li>
            <li> Hair - I have long (passed middle back), very fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> This does rub well between your palms and applies just fine; I don&#x27;t know how long it would last on hair that isn&#x27;t basically fuzz.</li>
            <li> It has slightly nutty light smell, it is not a perfume scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first time I try pure 100% organic Argan oil without any fillers or any other ingredients that compromise the quality of the oil.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is more like the traditional, or even of Jose Maran&#x27;s oil quality, that I have previously purchased.</li>
            <li> We have tried a couple different brands of Argan oil as the better half has always been a believer in Argan oil and uses this on her hair.</li>
            <li> Fairly quick absorption both in skin and wiry beard hairs, and I definitely appreciate this one as the only bottle of Argan Oil</li>

            <li> dfc3d11ed66c1145b0d969c68facf1f4]]I began using argan on regular basis several years ago after my hairdresser recommended that I start using it in the winter because she noticed that the hair on on top of my hair felt dry.</li>
            <li> Now I know I will be purchasing the large bottle next time.  </li>
            <li> Now I know I will be purchasing the large bottle next time.  </li>
            <li> Where do I start with this amazing beauty secret from Morocco?</li>
            <li> The key is not to apply too much not have a greasy hair look.</li>
            <li> This organ oil is 100% and has a natural scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was so surprised when I used the oil</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft with not a trace of oil.</li>
            <li> This can strip the hair of its natural oils, which often leads to frizz and flyaways.</li>
            <li> I spread it out over my hands, pat it onto my hair, and work it through with a natural bristle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far this hasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> On my head, all I can really tell you is that it didn&#x27;t discolor anything or seem too oily, but unfortunately I just can&#x27;t test the hair claims effectively.</li>
            <li> have used a few different brands of Moroccan Argan oil, some have been better than others.</li>
            <li> You should always try new products on a small area of skin before larger use to be sure you won&#x27;t have a problem with it (</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few different brands trying to avoid the high cost of Josie&#x27;s which is wonderful but expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a wonder if you live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this in most heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Try a little bit at first before using a whole bottle of lotion.</li>
            <li> By the next morning my hair feels and looks much healthier and over time I really can see a difference in how the ends look because they were looking dry before I started</li>
            <li> It appears to be highly filtered, and possibly deodorized.  </li>
            <li> It is not very much oil at all, but if I use more than that, my hair is oily and limp.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very hard to explain, but it&#x27;s a very light scent.</li>
            <li> The fact we received them for free has no bearing on our review, and we have written negative reviews in the past for products we were sent for free.</li>
            <li> -- first, it&#x27;s pure argan oil, which is somewhat hard to find these days.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a product that is what it claims, and I believe Health Nut offers a true product.</li>
            <li> In fact, it was after years of going through doctors and medication that her skin finally cleared up and has stayed clear with...extra virgin olive oil.</li>
            <li> It left it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have tried different natural oils like jojoba and avocado</li>
            <li> Argan oil is definitely something to add to your natural care supplies.</li>
            <li> wife mixed this in her body lotion, hand lotion, as well as put it directly on the ends of her hair.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of weeks so far.</li>
            <li> Because it soaks in rapidly and doesn&#x27;t leave a film behind, it is safe to use before I dress</li>
            <li> when used by itself in its pure state (not blended with any other oils)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Argan Oil is one of the few, dry oils available.</li>
            <li> I need to use those oils like a hot treatment and then wash my hair after half an hour or so.  </li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t find that it has much of a scent, so it doesn&#x27;t conflict with other products I choose to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems that the older I get the harder</li>
            <li> Saw it in major stores recently.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to use it at first, because we both have fine silky hair</li>
            <li> I am familiar with Moroccan Argan Oil as one of the key ingredients in a comparable product that I recently evaluated (KERALOGIE Hair Oils Complex -see</li>
            <li> /&gt;This seems to do what it says for both hair and skin and although I will reserve final judgment for my dry skin problem, so far it has worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within a day the dry patch was gone and wonderfully soft hands were left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also used it on my hands; they get dried out really easily and get funky dried patches on them.</li>
            <li> It tames the frizz, leaving slightly unruly curls I can live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thus, daily applications for healthier hair and skin are a problem-free undertaking; even the smaller 2-ounce bottle is bound to last a very long time</li>
            <li> my extremely dry hair and skin (especially on my feet) have benefited noticeably from using this natural remedy during the past 14 days and the very reasonable price of less than $20.00 being asked for a 2-ounce bottle makes this item a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; if you suffer from hair or skin problems that are looking for a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> And really, that small amount does the trick.  </li>
            <li> I have the 2 ounce size and know this bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Spend an hour blow drying and flat ironing.</li>
            <li> You can also stretch it by adding a few drops to your normal body lotion.</li>
            <li> Especially in the dry winter.  </li>
            <li> and it helps keep her hair from being dry and brittle and makes her hair healthier and softer overall.</li>
            <li> Tried it on my arms and the white, dry look went away.  </li>
            <li> Be care about applying too much near your scalp or you might end up looking like a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> Just recently, I used this as a carrier oil to tea tree oil for a skin rash on my neck and upper mid-chest that was extremely itchy.  </li>
            <li> and then I rub it in a little in my face for a soft feel that lasts for a while.</li>
            <li> On delicate skin, it&#x27;s very soothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really did try to stick to the half and half test of this and the Vitamin C Serum, but I cheated and applied this to the dry knuckles on the \\&quot;C\\&quot; hand as well.</li>
            <li> As long as I keep the oil away from my scalp, just a drop or two spread on my hands and then moved through my hair does wonders for it.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser said it can be applied to dry hair or wet hair with the same effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I rubbed a few drops of this on the ends (only the ends, if I use it on my roots it looks greasy and my hair is not dry at the roots anyway) and combed it through</li>
            <li> when it doesn&#x27;t soak in, so if your skin isn&#x27;t dry, this will act as a protectant but will also take a long time to absorb.</li>
            <li> when it doesn&#x27;t soak in, so if your skin isn&#x27;t dry, this will act as a protectant but will also take a long time to absorb.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way - I only need a drop like the size of a penny, so 2 oz will last me a while.  </li>
            <li> I can say that it seems nicer than other conditioners I&#x27;ve used, but, again, my hair is short.</li>
            <li> I no longer have the knots I&#x27;m usually left with other hair</li>
            <li> Argan oil also works well as a scalp conditioner, and it can treat brittle, dry hair with split ends.</li>
            <li> I apply it to damp skin and let it dry.</li>
            <li> I use a wide-tooth comb to distribute the oil in my hair, and then let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> I end up washing off the silicones and my hair is dry again.  </li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry overnight and then use a bit of this oil in the morning.</li>
            <li> They all have their place in use though, like the imported one from Morocco that has a longer oily duration, I like on my forearms when they are feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> you have dry hair and skin</li>
            <li> but I also need some sort of leave-in treatment for the ends or they look dry.</li>
            <li> when I put it on my dry hair, it looked a bit</li>
            <li> so I am not new to it.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people who uses shampoo every single day.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair looking natural with a softness and shine to it that it&#x27;s never had before and very little frizz.</li>
            <li> I have fine, flyaway hair and was skeptical about putting it on for fear of it weighing it down and making it look greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s typically not much older than a month or two at the ends.</li>
            <li> Personally, I find I prefer the oils with the typical argan scent for my hair, though they often do deodorize it since a lot of people don’t like the scent.</li>
            <li> * cause the pain that some lotions can when your skin is very dry.</li>
            <li> Made a visible difference with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> After towel drying your hair you only need a few drops in your palms to run through.</li>
            <li> I only use a few drops -- 4 or 5 -- on my shoulder length hair, which is thinning.  </li>
            <li> , I expected a buildup of oil on my face, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> I have hair that is frizzy and tends to poof up like the Pink Panther</li>
            <li> For me, I put a few drops on my palms and rub them together, and then massage the oil into the ends of my damp hair only.  </li>
            <li> It has a pale straw color and a fragrance similar to roasted</li>
            <li> The second try left me with a very small amount of oil that I worked into the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> This soaks into dry skin and tends to soak less into not-dry skin, so if your face/etc is unevenly dry, rubbing this on will tend to get it to the drier areas over the less try ones...</li>
            <li> While they are somewhat different products, they are both skin treatments, and I decided to use one on half of my face and one hand, and the other on the other half of my face and other hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you have never used it before is a little goes a long way, start with two to three drops and build up from there.</li>
            <li> A little of this stuff goes a long way, no need to pile it on.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:76996f6c014e33a5363ef128a25539d]]I have been comparing two different brands of argan oil (both sold on Amazon) over the past 6-7 weeks (Pura d&#x27;Or and Health Nut brands).</li>
            <li> There are other mix of oils I’ve tried that include Argan oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a ton of other oils like this...</li>
            <li> She says this works as well as any other brand</li>
            <li> I do have some other types of hair products with the Argan oil in it</li>
            <li> Plus unlike other oils, my hair never feels greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> This oil has no odor (other Argan oils have a slightly nutty earthy smell), it doesn&#x27;t absorb into my hair quite as well, and it leaves an oily feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the argan oil seems to absorb the quickest, and has the least amount of visible oil left on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As noted above, this can be oily feeling (well, duh)</li>

            <li> I dye my hair jet black</li>
            <li> It only takes a few drops, even for my hair (thick, waist-length).</li>
            <li> I have used one previous brand of argan oil</li>
            <li> When she is in the tub, I put a dropperful or two in my palms and rub it into the bottom half of her hair, and let it soak for a while.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I have thin, long hair which means I have dry and split ends.</li>
            <li> and I prefer for it to have a little shine to it</li>
            <li> It is very thick, I put only a couple of drops to massage on my skin.  </li>

            <li> [[VIDEOID:dfc3d11ed66c1145b0d969c68facf1f4]]I began using argan on regular basis several years ago after my hairdresser recommended that I start using it in the winter because she noticed that the hair on on top of my hair felt dry. She called it \\&quot;hat hair\\&quot;. She said many of her clients get dry hair from wearing hats in the winter. A few drops does not make the hair look or feel greasy. My hairdresser said it can be applied to dry hair or wet hair with the same effectiveness. The key is not to apply too much not have a greasy hair look. On my next appointment she said she could see the difference that the hair felt better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This argan oil comes in a 2 oz bottle with a glass droplet applicator. It has slightly nutty light smell, it is not a perfume scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried bottles with different applicators: spray bottles and bottle with droplets. I prefer droplet applicators because they gives me more control than the spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This argan oil provided by Health Nut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> I use this lightweight non-greasy organic argan oil two ways. The first is as a gentle moisturizer on my entire body. Because it soaks in rapidly and doesn&#x27;t leave a film behind, it is safe to use before I dress or before I plan to lie down for the night. Nothing gets on my clothes or my sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second way I use this oil is to manage and condition my hair. On humid days, I can gently tame down frizzy hair by slicking a small amount of argan oil over the misbehaving strands. Argan oil also works well as a scalp conditioner, and it can treat brittle, dry hair with split ends. My hair goes well below my rear, so I need products to help keep it strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 100% organic argan oil (That&#x27;s the only ingredient in the glass bottle.) comes with a syringe dropper. The dropper isn&#x27;t my prefered method of applying a beauty aid; I&#x27;d prefer a spray or wide-mouth container. I&#x27;m afraid of knocking the high-profile bottle over and wasting the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Strongly-scented oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this product for quality testing purposes. I hope you found my review helpful.</li>
            <li> The Health Nut Argan oil is different compared to the Argan oils I have tried. This oil has no odor (other Argan oils have a slightly nutty earthy smell), it doesn&#x27;t absorb into my hair quite as well, and it leaves an oily feeling on my skin. This may have gone through an extra purification step because something about the oil is different. With the other oils, I tend to have a pleasant feeling with the oil, not so much with this oil. This oil seems different compared to the almost a dozen different samples I&#x27;ve tried. The oil comes in a glass bottle with an eyedropper. I prefer a pump bottle for ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A free sample was provided for review.</li>
            <li> It was my daughter who originally told me that putting oil on my face could actually be good for it. In fact, it was after years of going through doctors and medication that her skin finally cleared up and has stayed clear with...extra virgin olive oil. So when I was asked if I would try out this product and post an honest review, I wasn&#x27;t hit totally from left field but I DID look it up before using it. I found out that the oil produced from the nut of the Argan tree has been used, pretty much forever, for food, skin and hair. So I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil was easily absorbed into my skin without leaving it greasy. I used it mainly on my hands and forearms which are becoming increasingly dry as I get older. It worked great, but the area it really worked fantastically was my HAIR. I&#x27;ve fought getting my hair cut short but dryness has become an increasing problem for me. Products that I have used for years seem to make it worse so I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose by giving the oil a shot. I used enough to coat my hands and ran them from my neck downward through my hair. Then I left it alone. It left it soft and shiny. A little bit goes a LONG way, so use a light hand until you see what works best for you. I also dampened my hands before using the oil because it&#x27;s supposed to help with the process of absorption. I&#x27;ve gone to a gentler shampoo, almost no conditioner and use the oil. I have a ways to go yet, but the oil has made a noticeable difference. Plus I&#x27;m happy to find another way to eliminate chemicals in products I use on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I can recommend this product without reservation. You should always try new products on a small area of skin before larger use to be sure you won&#x27;t have a problem with it (which I&#x27;m sure you already know, but once a mom....I can&#x27;t help myself).</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:76996f6c014e33a5363ef128a25539d]]I have been comparing two different brands of argan oil (both sold on Amazon) over the past 6-7 weeks (Pura d&#x27;Or and Health Nut brands). I have used the two brands on different days or at different times of day (i.e., morning and evening) and can see no differences except the delivery method, despite the difference in price. Pura D&#x27;or uses a pump for delivery and Health Nut uses an eyedropper. If you have normal to oily skin, the eye dropper would give you more control over how much oil you&#x27;re getting/using, but Pura D&#x27;or is the better value per ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 62 with very dry skin and, while I don&#x27;t see any miracles in these products, I do see very good hydration and protection of my skin during what has been the harshest part of one of the harshest winters we&#x27;ve had in several years. That means a lot when you&#x27;re trying to both care for your skin and look as good as possible for your age!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil can be used for face, body, hair and nails. The Health Nut brand was provided to me in exchange for a fair and honest review. I purchased the Pura D&#x27;or brand myself.</li>
            <li> This Health Nut Moroccan Oil for me, seems to be the real deal. The consistency is more like the traditional, or even of Jose Maran&#x27;s oil quality, that I have previously purchased. Some of the oils that claim to be Moroccan are actually thickened by something and tend to sit more of the surface of skin and hair. This oil is a good consistency and works great on my skin and hair absorbing quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is nicely packaged and comes with a dropper. I like the dropper vs. a pump. Moroccan Oil is a wonderful beauty treatment and conditions hair and moisturizes skin without clogging pores and breaking out skin. It&#x27;s really a wonder if you live in a dry climate. I think this brand is a good source since so many companies have began to create Moroccan Oil with cheap fillers. It is hard to find a product that is what it claims, and I believe Health Nut offers a true product. I have tried quite a few different brands trying to avoid the high cost of Josie&#x27;s which is wonderful but expensive. This seems to be a good answer. I received this product to test and review and I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it! My daughter has terribly unruly and frizzy hair and after wasting my money trying so many expensive products, this one finally did the trick. Made a visible difference with minimal effort. Has a good nutty smell and authentic yellowish color. Even feels good on my hands when I apply it and then I rub it in a little in my face for a soft feel that lasts for a while.</li>
            <li> If you do not know what argan oil is, just do a search online and there are tons of videos about it.  My wife uses it for her hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It makes them smooth and more healthy looking.  I use it for my face at night.  It is very thick, I put only a couple of drops to massage on my skin.  The surprising thing is that once you apply it to your skin it is not greasy anymore.  It feels smooth and silky even in the morning when you wake up.  We have another bottle of argan oil that is scented.  My wife likes the scented oil but I personally do not care if it scented or not.  This organ oil is 100% and has a natural scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often have painful cuticle splinters.  This is also good to prevent those.  Also good to prevent chapped lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample item was sent to me for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> Complimentary product received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using Argan oil, it helps tame the frizzies. Just a drop rubbed between the palms of your hands, then smoothed over your hair before or after styling protects and conditions your hair. I love the way my hair feels after using a drop or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very light feeling oil too, it absorbs easily and will help with dry skin. I alternate between using argan, almond, apricot, and jojoba oils. In my opinion, the argan oil seems to absorb the quickest, and has the least amount of visible oil left on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Moroccan Argan oil arrives in a nice 2 Oz. dropper bottle, making it very easy to control just how much you want to use. Good product for daily use.</li>
            <li> This high-quality, organic argan oil is cold-pressed from the kernel of the seed of the fruit of the Argania spinosa tree, which is native to the semi-arid valleys of Morocco.  It has a pale straw color and a fragrance similar to roasted nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few drops of argan oil conditions the skin, nails, cuticles, or hair.  It is quickly absorbed by the skin, locking in moisture, leaving it smooth and moist, and not at all greasy. It is especially helpful for heat-treated or damaged hair and gives it a beautiful sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amber glass bottle protects it from the light and the glass dropper attached to the cap is very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HBA Express provided a bottle of argan oil for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> Organic Argan Oil is considered one of the most versatile beauty oils that one can have in their collections of beauty products. In fact, Argan Oil, also referred to as \\&quot;liquid gold\\&quot; is about all one needs to have in their beauty regime. The oil can be used on both the hair and the skin and can be used as a face moisturizer, leave in hair conditioner, cuticle and heel softener and a hair shine as well as gets rid of frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Health Nut 100% Organic Moroccan Argan Oil comes in a brown bottle with a dropper dispenser. It only takes a couple of drops to apply to the face for a moisturizer that absorbs well and absorbs quickly. It is a dry oil and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel behind. I have fine, flyaway hair and was skeptical about putting it on for fear of it weighing it down and making it look greasy. It only took a few drops rubbed between my hands and then applied through the hair to give it a nice shine and alleviate static. I also put it on my hands, feet and in my bath and my skin feels soft and smooth. Something I don&#x27;t get through the winter - especially with being on public water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Health Nut 100% Organic Moroccan Argan Oil comes in both the 2 and 4 ounce size. I have the 2 ounce size and know this bottle will last a long time. I&#x27;m very pleased with it and will be purchasing more when this bottle runs out! Yes, \\&quot;liquid gold\\&quot; is the perfect name for this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: This is an HONEST review regarding a sample I received for testing purposes. I was not asked nor was I required to write a good review.</li>
            <li> Where do I start with this amazing beauty secret from Morocco? Well, when I received the 2oz. bottle for review, I was excited. I&#x27;ve read many great things about the power of this oil but haven&#x27;t had the luck of using a pure product. Seriously,  I&#x27;ve purchased Argan oils only to be disappointed once I reviewed the ingredient lists. Thankfully, this brand only has only 1 ingredient. 1oo% Pure Certified Organic Moroccan Argan (Argania  spinosa) Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it after my 3 most recent shampoo days. After towel drying your hair you only need a few drops in your palms to run through. It&#x27;s easy to regulate how much you use too because the dropper has actual measurements. (That&#x27;s rare to see)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve gotten amazing results. It seems to lock in moisture, softness and shine. Additionally, I love the way it helps with fizziness and seems to lay the cuticle down. Plus unlike other oils, my hair never feels greasy or weighed down. I&#x27;ve also used it on my face after exfoliating in the evening. I apply it to damp skin and let it dry. Then I apply my moisturizer (10-15 min later) and go to bed. I wake up with baby-soft, acne free skin. No breakouts whatsoever. The reason this is AMAZING is because I have naturally oily skin. I was super nervous the first time I used it on my face.  Glad I applied it despite my fears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As promised in the many YT vids I&#x27;ve watched about this oil, it actually soothed my skin and helped my moisturizer&#x27;s efficiency. I can&#x27;t believe an oil can do all these things. I will repurchase from this brand when I run out.</li>
            <li> I use argan oil just about every day and I like to change brands and try new ones all the time to see the differences.  This is very nice and high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXPERIENCE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Hair - I have long (passed middle back), very fine curly hair. Tending to the ends have always been a challenge to prevent splitting, breakage, and frizz.  However, I have found over the years (wisdom) that the combination of the  &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; hair washing method, combing with a comb with smooth plastic teeth (without plastic molding edge that is like a razor), and aragan oil has allowed me to grow my hair this long for the first time in my life with ends that are smooth and soft.  This oil is not heavy or smelly and does not leave your hair greasy looking, it&#x27;s nice and light.  My curls stay bouncy and soft and this is light enough to use on day 2 or 3 (without washing) to smooth out the ends again without being oily and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Skin - This oil softens my nail cuticles really well.  Especially in the dry winter.  I like to also use it on my face for a night moisturizer and with a Gua Sha treatment.  Just recently, I used this as a carrier oil to tea tree oil for a skin rash on my neck and upper mid-chest that was extremely itchy.  On delicate skin, it&#x27;s very soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like that the glass pipette has graduated measuring marks for a consistent or more precise application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would surely purchase this brand, I&#x27;m really happy with it. I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> Note: I received a free sample for evaluation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received both this and their [[ASIN:B00P6P98X4 Vitamin C Serum]] for review. While they are somewhat different products, they are both skin treatments, and I decided to use one on half of my face and one hand, and the other on the other half of my face and other hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my conclusions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) I much prefer this to the Vitamin C Serum, for my needs. This doesn&#x27;t lighten skin or protect against UV damage (not that I could test that claim of the Serum here in the middle of winter in the northeast), and the dropper applicator is messier than the pump of the serum, but... I really liked this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Yes, this is a bit oily when applied. Not bad, but much more so than the serum, but that&#x27;s OK. This soaks into dry skin and tends to soak less into not-dry skin, so if your face/etc is unevenly dry, rubbing this on will tend to get it to the drier areas over the less try ones... which is what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) I tried this in my virtually non-existent hair and on my short beard. On my head, all I can really tell you is that it didn&#x27;t discolor anything or seem too oily, but unfortunately I just can&#x27;t test the hair claims effectively. I can say that it seems nicer than other conditioners I&#x27;ve used, but, again, my hair is short. It&#x27;s typically not much older than a month or two at the ends. Your mileage my vary. This does rub well between your palms and applies just fine; I don&#x27;t know how long it would last on hair that isn&#x27;t basically fuzz. On my (greying) beard, though... this soaked in well, didn&#x27;t seem greasy, made it feel better, and overall was excellent. I&#x27;d never even *considered* something like this. Now I&#x27;m ordering some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) This is AWESOME on dry hands. Awesome. I really did try to stick to the half and half test of this and the Vitamin C Serum, but I cheated and applied this to the dry knuckles on the \\&quot;C\\&quot; hand as well. It soaks into dry skin very quickly and does *not* cause the pain that some lotions can when your skin is very dry. It protects well. As much as I don&#x27;t prefer the dropper applicator when it comes to face or hair, I love it when it comes to hands, because I can put a drop on each knuckle and it soaks right in with little to no rubbing required. The effect lasts, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(5) As noted above, this can be oily feeling (well, duh) when it doesn&#x27;t soak in, so if your skin isn&#x27;t dry, this will act as a protectant but will also take a long time to absorb. However, it soaks right into dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works, it improved my skin and beard, it doesn&#x27;t smell at all (well, maybe very faintly, but nothing I notice unless, as I did now, I open the bottle and sniff it to see if it has a scent). I really, truly, enjoy using it.ons can when your skin is very dry. It protects well.

            <li> I&#x27;m a very big fan of this oil.  I use it on my hair, which is curly.  Like many other curly girls, I have tried so many different products on my curls, and this is by far my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it right after I shower and have blotted some water out of my hair.  I only use a few drops -- 4 or 5 -- on my shoulder length hair, which is thinning.  It is not very much oil at all, but if I use more than that, my hair is oily and limp.  And really, that small amount does the trick.  I use a wide-tooth comb to distribute the oil in my hair, and then let it air dry.  It dries into beautiful frizz-free curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!  My skin improved immediately.  Pleasant scent and texture.  It does not leave your skin oily.  Because of its organic nature I think , my skin absorbed this product and was just supple.</li>
            <li> I am curling my hair quite often, and the frizz is difficult to tame. I was looking for something to protect my hair against the heat. A friend recommended this product to me. I didn&#x27;t really believe that it would work. When I was offered to test and review Argan Oil by Health Nut, I decided to give it a try. I found this to be a nice oil and of very high quality and good value. I have used it on my hair, which is mainly what I bought it for. I use this as a &#x27;mask&#x27;, leaving it on my hair for a few minutes and then shampooing and conditioning my hair as usual. As I have combination hair, prone to oily roots, I don&#x27;t usually leave it on, although I have occasionally used a very small amount on ends to tame frizz and found it to work well for this. This product does exactly what it should do. It leaves my hair looking natural with a softness and shine to it that it&#x27;s never had before and very little frizz. I no longer have the knots I&#x27;m usually left with other hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product. I have used regular moisturizing cream for so many years, but the results just aren&#x27;t lasting. I have sensitive skin and I find this oil as a great alternative to it. I was so surprised when I used the oil, I expected a buildup of oil on my face, but that wasn&#x27;t the case. My skin feels so soft with not a trace of oil. Much better than many of day creams I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Argan oil is 100% pure, it has very lite, hardly noticeable, pleasant aroma. It is smooth and silky. Also, I like that Argan Oil by Health Nut comes in glass bottle with dropper, which makes it so easy to use, and it is not wasted by putting it on cotton wool. This is a excellent product!</li>
            <li> This Argan Oil has helped keep my hands from chapping up.  I wash my hands a lot because of our baby and I apply this at night to rehydrate them.  It smells pleasant also.  My mother used this on her hair and after a few weeks it looked healthier.  She likes to dye her hair so it dries up, but definitely using this made it look shinier.  I like the dropper style because it is easy to dispense and cleaner.  I would give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a free sample for review.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the results of this oil.  This is the first time I try pure 100% organic Argan oil without any fillers or any other ingredients that compromise the quality of the oil.  Here it’s my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair:&lt;br /&gt;My hair is med-fine, wavy/curly, about three inches below my shoulders.  For those familiar with curly hair, my hair looks like a 2C but feels like a 2B.  It is frizzy in the winter and the ends tend to dry easily.  I have tried different natural oils like jojoba and avocado but my hair is not coarse enough to absorb the oils rapidly.  I need to use those oils like a hot treatment and then wash my hair after half an hour or so.  There are other mix of oils I’ve tried that include Argan oil but the mixes include silicones that mask a temporary shine.  I end up washing off the silicones and my hair is dry again.  This is an amazing oil for my hair.  It is absorbed when my hair is damp even though my hair is cool at that point - I always do my last rinse with cold water.  My hair looks shiny and best of all, this oil does not weigh it down! That’s a big deal for me since I like to keep my hair wavy or curly.  My hair is shiny, tamed, bouncy, and it doesn’t wash off after a shampoo.  A little goes a long way - I only need a drop like the size of a penny, so 2 oz will last me a while.  I am very excited to have received this product for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin:&lt;br /&gt;I have very delicate skin.  It seems that the older I get the harder it is to find moisturizes that won’t irritate my face and neck - I currently make my own moisturizer with natural oils.  I tried this Argan oil on my hands and they felt very smooth.  I now use this oil as a night moisturizer for my face and neck, especially around my eyes.  It doesn’t irritate my skin and absorbs well. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this oil has been a good addition to my hair and skin routine.  I was provided with this product for testing purposes and I am glad to have tried it.  Now I know I will be purchasing the large bottle next time.  Very pleased with the results at a very competitive price (18.99 for 2 oz at the time of this review)t.  Now I know I will be purchasing the large bottle next time.

            <li> I am one of those people who uses shampoo every single day. This can strip the hair of its natural oils, which often leads to frizz and flyaways. I&#x27;m always looking for a good hair oil to use to counteract these effects. This is the latest I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things I like about this right off the bat -- first, it&#x27;s pure argan oil, which is somewhat hard to find these days. (Even my beloved Sedu has silicones in it, as well.) Also, I don&#x27;t find that it has much of a scent, so it doesn&#x27;t conflict with other products I choose to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I like most about this is how much it makes my hair shine. I dye my hair jet black and I prefer for it to have a little shine to it (*not* the same as being oily/greasy). And this product really makes my hair shine; the shine lasts all day, too. I think it is definitely helping with frizz and flyaways, as well, especially around the part of my hair (I part in the center).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shampoo at night, use conditioner, and follow with a detangling spray while my hair is still damp. I let my hair air dry overnight and then use a bit of this oil in the morning. It only takes a few drops, even for my hair (thick, waist-length). I spread it out over my hands, pat it onto my hair, and work it through with a natural bristle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t use oil-based products to moisturize my face (learned that the hard way), although argan oil is supposed to be non-comedogenic and may work well as a hair oil for people who have had trouble with other oils (including coconut oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.&lt;br /&gt;Comment</li>
            <li> I was offered a free sample of this oil from Health Nut in exchange for my unbiased opinion, so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a few different brands of Moroccan Argan oil, some have been better than others. This brand is a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent free, nothing else added to make me break out, those two things are important. I have hair that is frizzy and tends to poof up like the Pink Panther carton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few choices in life to make my hair behave. Shave it short. Spend an hour blow drying and flat ironing. Stuff it under a hat. Apply Argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil works. I put my oil in a misting bottle and finely mist my hair. It tames the frizz, leaving slightly unruly curls I can live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is a top choice. No additives and grown organically so I am not getting doused with pesticides. I will be looking into this oil again when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caveat I have for you if you have never used it before is a little goes a long way, start with two to three drops and build up from there. Be care about applying too much near your scalp or you might end up looking like a greasy mess. Start applying at the ends and then use what is left on your hands closer to your scalp.</li>
            <li> I love this oil for both my hair and my skin.  It is an excellent lightweight oil to tame fly aways and to add a healthy smoothness to my long hair.  It is incredible when you use it just after blow drying and right before using a flat iron.  It just adds a healthy luster that I love.  Every now and then I add a drop or two to a wrinkle I see on my skin...I am not sure if it&#x27;s a miracle wrinkle cure but it can&#x27;t hurt...lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh...and one more thing...and this is just totally something I have always done...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also actually just rub a drop into my hands and rub it along my Tonkinese cats fur.  It helps with static and makes their coats glossier than ever.  They don&#x27;t mind it and I like doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a ton of other oils like this...but I really like this one...it&#x27;s light...and a great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thank you to the manufacturer for sending me a bottle to try!</li>
            <li> I own 5 different varieties of Argan oil.  An oil can be 100% pure, resolutely certified, and absolutely wonderful - yet still vary in origin, absorption and even scent.  They all have their place in use though, like the imported one from Morocco that has a longer oily duration, I like on my forearms when they are feeling dry.  Another one has a warmer scent than others, and I often use that on my neck and face.  And so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one from Health Nut is completely scent free, made in the USA, and I love it far better as beard management than a compound Argan oil that I had been using (because of the other oils included, it had a bit too \\&quot;glossy\\&quot; look on my beard, like I just ate a large 3\\&quot; steak - great for the top of my head... not so much under the lips.  LOL).  Fairly quick absorption both in skin and wiry beard hairs, and I definitely appreciate this one as the only bottle of Argan Oil I have that uses a traditional eyedropper cap.  Really is the most precise way to get the amount I want without dealing with a stubborn euro-dropper.  Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But ya, dudes, think about Argan oil instead of waxy or greasy beard conditioners.  After a while of using, your beard will be softer, more controlled, and a nice sheen even in arid conditions.  As an lover and owner of a variety of Argan Oils, I definitely give Health Nut&#x27;s a hearty recommendation for skin, hair and beard!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- I received this as a complimentary review supplement with the aim of hopefully elucidating features and drawbacks that may help you ultimately decide what fits your needs and budget best.

            <li> My wife loves this product. She uses this oil on her hair and it makes the hair healthy looking again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is especially helpful during the winter months when the heat is going and the house dries out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love Argan oil and it is hitting mainstream in a big way. Saw it in major stores recently. I like this because this is organic. Nice flavor and feels good! The product was sent in exchange of a fair review.</li>
            <li> We have tried a couple different brands of Argan oil as the better half has always been a believer in Argan oil and uses this on her hair. She says this works as well as any other brand and it helps keep her hair from being dry and brittle and makes her hair healthier and softer overall. This oil absorbs quickly and doesn’t make her head feel oily and doesn’t have any scent. A little goes a long way with this in most heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to do what it says for both hair and skin and although I will reserve final judgment for my dry skin problem, so far it has worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is pure, organic Argan oil, a great oil for natural hair and skin care. Comes in a dropper bottle from Health Nut for easy application. Argan oil is definitely something to add to your natural care supplies. I was provided a free sample of this for my review.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my girlfriend to review. Here is what she thinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin, long hair which means I have dry and split ends. I have tried numerous hair care products and found those with argan oil in them seemed to work the best. But it didn’t last and who know what else I’m putting on my hair. So when the opportunity came up to try this oil for review I couldn’t wait to see how it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I did was manage to put too much in my hair. I’m used to using more of the store bough stuff so I ended up looking like I dunked my head in oil. The second try left me with a very small amount of oil that I worked into the ends of my hair. When my hair dried it was gorgeous. Super shiny and felt just like silk. The best part was it lasted a couple days before I had to use any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used it on my hands; they get dried out really easily and get funky dried patches on them. I rubbed a little oil on my hands and instantly they felt so much better and looked great. Within a day the dry patch was gone and wonderfully soft hands were left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry hair and skin I recommend getting this oil. You can tell it’s a high quality oil that works well and lasts. This is one thing to add to your skin and hair care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shawn Kovacich&lt;br /&gt;Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> (Disclaimer - My wife and I were invited by the seller to try and review their products. We only agree to these requests when it&#x27;s something we would actually use. The fact we received them for free has no bearing on our review, and we have written negative reviews in the past for products we were sent for free. Also, for this type of invited review, we always begin with a disclaimer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife mixed this in her body lotion, hand lotion, as well as put it directly on the ends of her hair. She said it felt really nice and kept her skin moist for a long time, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and does not cause any irritations. The included eyedropper makes it easier to use too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She likes the Moroccan Argan Oil a lot and will definitely recommend it to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I am familiar with Moroccan Argan Oil as one of the key ingredients in a comparable product that I recently evaluated (KERALOGIE Hair Oils Complex -see my review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when used by itself in its pure state (not blended with any other oils) this unscented, 100% Pure Organic Moroccan Argan Oil works wonderfully well in restoring health to dry, brittle hair giving it a healthy sheen and likewise restoring moisture to rough, patchy, scaly areas of the skin that have clearly seen better days. Only a few drops - which can be easily dispensed with the included dropper - are needed for each application and there is no bothersome, greasy aftereffect with this light oil. Thus, daily applications for healthier hair and skin are a problem-free undertaking; even the smaller 2-ounce bottle is bound to last a very long time indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this preparation is made in the USA all while fulfilling pharmaceutical-grade, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) requirements underscores the manufacturer&#x27;s (Health Nut) serious commitment to quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my extremely dry hair and skin (especially on my feet) have benefited noticeably from using this natural remedy during the past 14 days and the very reasonable price of less than $20.00 being asked for a 2-ounce bottle makes this item a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; if you suffer from hair or skin problems that are looking for a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the manufacturer provided me with a complimentary sample for this hopefully unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I have curly yet fine hair, so the ends dry out easily and when that happens I get tons of tangles and knots in my hair. I&#x27;ve found that if I put oil on the ends every now and then it really helps to prevent all this. I received this for free and decided to use it in that way to try it out and so far it&#x27;s worked nicely. I like that it&#x27;s organic and only the oil - nothing else added to the bottle. Because of this I&#x27;m inclined to keep using it going forward. I do have some other types of hair products with the Argan oil in it and it&#x27;s supposed to be pretty good for hair, so this also makes it more likely I&#x27;ll keep using this. I think the only thing that might change that is if my hair becomes sticky from it. I have had a few oils do this and I end up getting a build up that actually increases the tangles and knots. So far this hasn&#x27;t but I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of weeks so far. We&#x27;ll see how it goes!</li>
            <li> I was offered a sample of this product for testing and review purposes so of course I jumped at the chance. I have used one previous brand of argan oil so I am not new to it. I used this brand exclusively for at least two weeks and I can say I wholeheartedly recommend it. I use it in my hair to combat dry ends from bleaching and I was actually really impressed how well this oil improved my hair. I already use Redken Allsoft shampoo and conditioner so I give my hair the best products I have found but I also need some sort of leave-in treatment for the ends or they look dry. I rubbed a few drops of this on the ends (only the ends, if I use it on my roots it looks greasy and my hair is not dry at the roots anyway) and combed it through and immediately it feels and looks better, but the best results come after it has had a chance to get absorbed in a bit. By the next morning my hair feels and looks much healthier and over time I really can see a difference in how the ends look because they were looking dry before I started and I am in need of a trim and by the end of my trial they actually look BETTER than when I started and I have not yet cut my hair. I really enjoy the scent, it smells slightly nutty and exotic, it&#x27;s very hard to explain, but it&#x27;s a very light scent. I love that this oil is paraben-free and organic. I don&#x27;t know how to professionally judge the quality of argan oil but by the results I have experienced I can say this is a great oil. I am a new fan of this brand.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moroccan argan oil as a hair treatment for myself and my daughter over these cold winter months, and I am very impressed with it!  I was afraid to use it at first, because we both have fine silky hair and I was afraid it would weigh our hair down and make it greasy.&lt;br /&gt;That did not happen!  For me, I put a few drops on my palms and rub them together, and then massage the oil into the ends of my damp hair only.  It makes my hair softer and more shiny.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has trouble with tangles in her hair and she cries when I try to brush it out.  The argan oil is surprisingly the best detangler I&#x27;ve used on her hair.  When she is in the tub, I put a dropperful or two in my palms and rub it into the bottom half of her hair, and let it soak for a while.  Then I rinse it out.  The oil really helps the tangles slide out, and her hair looks nice and shiny.  But it doesn&#x27;t make her hair greasy or weigh it down.&lt;br /&gt;I never realized this was a hair treatment that would work for us, but we love it.  I also like the dropper bottle instead of a pump bottle, and I like the organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> Given To Me For An Honest Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Health Nut 100&amp; Organic Moroccan Argan Oil for Skin &amp; Hair by Health Nut is a great product that everyone needs to try. I wasn&#x27;t sure about it but I tried it and so did my granddaughter and we both love it. This oil is great for dry skin and hair. It also helps with eczema and psoriasis. It keeps skin soft and smooth. It relieves itching and there is no greasy feeling. When we used it for our hair, it made our hair feel softer and more shiny. This product is fantastic for de-tangling hair. My granddaughter has problems with tangled hair. She used it for that and she loves it. No more problems with those tangles. Her hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or weighed down. We like that the ingrediants are organic. I gave this product 5 stars but wish I could give it more because it deserves many, many more. I highly recommend this to everyone. I look for more great products from Health Nut.</li>
            <li> There was a time when I thought that putting an oil on my hair would just make my hair oily looking.  Dummy me!  Not so!  As long as I keep the oil away from my scalp, just a drop or two spread on my hands and then moved through my hair does wonders for it.  This is a nice product.  It is 100% luscious and precious argan oil, no additives, no extra fragrance.  I especially love it in the dry winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my legs and they were smooth and soft for an entire day.  Tried it on my arms and the white, dry look went away.  Used it on my elbows, and the scaliness and redness there from constant contact with a desktop is slowly going away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from Health Nut.</li>
            <li> *Item Received Without Cost For Purpose of Evaluation and Review*&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil is one of the few, dry oils available. Unlike baby oil, you can just rub it into your skin and it will absorb without leaving you greasy. I use it on my nails and in a homemade facial mask made from Matcha, turmeric, and vitamin c.  It&#x27;s a very soothing addition to the mask and it leaves your skin very soft and clear. I can not use oils on my hair anymore so I passed some to my daughter. She used just on her ends and then used the blow dryer. It made the split ends less noticeable and still, no grease.&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is also wonderful for helping your eyelashes grow, just like Castor Oil. A little of this stuff goes a long way, no need to pile it on. You can also stretch it by adding a few drops to your normal body lotion. Try a little bit at first before using a whole bottle of lotion. I add it to my Oil of Olay at night. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it..It&#x27;s good stuff, recommended.</li>
            <li> Free Product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a small 2 ounce bottle.  It’s in an amber bottle, which is great for argan oil, and it has a nice eyedropper with it, so it is easy to control the amount and dispersion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is a very, very light, almost clear yellow and quite translucent.  It appears to be highly filtered, and possibly deodorized.  It has almost no scent. Personally, I find I prefer the oils with the typical argan scent for my hair, though they often do deodorize it since a lot of people don’t like the scent. The bottle I got had a date that was good for a year and a half- it was very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle states it is 100% pure certified argan oil.  It absorbs readily. It does seem to make my hair shinier, and smoother.  I found this variety was best put on damp hair, when I put it on my dry hair, it looked a bit oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It feels fairly silky on my skin.  It goes on and smooths in easily, leaving skin soft and smooth.  It seems particularly very nice on skin.</li>
