            <li> The base is 15&amp;#34; so make sure you have enough room.</li>

            <li> The only thing is that it came with a bend and a small crack, I guess it happened while delivering.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the price which is why I took one star off because I do think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced for what it is.</li>
            <li> Gift for wife , did not like the black plastic said it looked like a &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s s little to bulky</li>
            <li> Got it yesterday, alittle plain,  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this hands down!!</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of stuff and small space like me, this is your life savior.</li>
            <li> This is a DIVA&#x27;s Dream  or anyone that has limited counter space but with room for the base of this giant.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find organizers like this.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m just going to put a little crazy glue.</li>
            <li> I know it is expensive but some Diva&#x27;s must have organization!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely love it. Recived it on time and in perfect condition.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Hold all of my wife things but I think it&#x27;s s little to bulky</li>
            <li> I love this and it holds all my stuff while easily giving me access to what I need. I would not hesitate to buy this again and it does seem to be well made. My only complaint is the price which is why I took one star off because I do think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced for what it is. However, I couldn&#x27;t find anything else like it for cheaper. I decided to personalize mine a bit with some printed duct tape and it is the perfect size if you want to put a strip around the top and bottom. I did tape the entire thing but prefer just taping the top and bottom so I can easily change it out when I feel like it.</li>
            <li> I love it holds A lot and look like one you would see at a professional sal</li>
            <li> This is amazing for organizing your vanity and de cluttering your space! It&#x27;s sturdy, tall enough to store the tallest of hairspray cans, dividers spaced enough to store plenty of products! I have from hair tools, hair products, tall skincare bottles, section to store all my brushes for makeup which are also inside storage containers and swivels smoothly! I&#x27;m glad I made the investment! Highly recommend if you have a a lot of stuff (product junkie) like me!</li>
            <li> Love this! We use it in our cosmetology dept for frequently used products and it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Got it yesterday, alittle plain,  but I&#x27;ll change that....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good , helped to organize my lotions .</li>
            <li> It holds everything!  I like being organized, and thanks to this I have been able to do organize with style!  I would recommend this hands down!!</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because it is bigger than I expected. One other thing I noticed is that the job is roughly made .there is glue all over it. It does the job however.</li>
            <li> this product is the best purchase ive made all year&lt;br /&gt;now my counter tops are clear and i get more use out of my products since they are all in plain view</li>
            <li> This i Awesome for the price......so much room so glad i did not go with my other choice...fits my needs</li>
            <li> Makes space on the counter so much better.</li>
            <li> save space and that was what I needed. I have several One for work and home.</li>
            <li> This caddy is perfect in my bedroom.  It has given me so space on my dresser.  I am glad I decided to buy it.  Everything is so accessible and easy to get to because it spins.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!  Kinda pricey..but man can this thing clean up and organize a space...never really knew how much space was available until u see it again! Wish i had more</li>
            <li> wow excellent all my hair products and some cosmetics  in one place excellent highly recommended plastic very resistant and cute</li>
            <li> I do like this organizer.  Its hard to find organizers like this.  I&#x27;ve got one for cosmetics and one that was ordered on accident that I&#x27;m using for spices/condiments for now.  This particular one has lips on the two shelves that I find very helpful.  I like the smaller and larger size.  Its finish is not fancy looking - really for the $60-something it should look more polished.  I do believe it is overpriced based on materials and finish.  A third, middle shelf would be nice.  It turns pretty easily.  Remember to measure your space - it took up more than I imagined it would and that is fine.</li>
            <li> Love this product so much. I bought two</li>
            <li> Awesome and super big but for the price it should be taller! Amazing product! Transform my dresser space and made it very convient to search and find products I needed by just rotating both shelved! Expensive but nice! Make it 3 shelves and I will buy another one! 😉</li>
            <li> Any one with bathroom clutter will love this item! It holds a lot of items. The pictures of other reviews are true! My husband came home he was wowed! It is large, holds hairsprays &amp; hair products, perfumes, body lotions,a whole roll of paper towels in the lower part &amp; more! This is a DIVA&#x27;s Dream  or anyone that has limited counter space but with room for the base of this giant. It spins easily. It is a must have!  It holds loads of things.  It was packaged well &amp; was completely put together except for 2 dividers that attach easily. I am so pleased with this item. Very easy to clean. It is black &amp; the spinning base is awesome! I know it is expensive but some Diva&#x27;s must have organization!</li>
            <li> Gift for wife , did not like the black plastic said it looked like a &amp;#34; trash can &amp;#34; or tacky but she soon warmed up to it and thanked me for it plenty of times after actually using it.  So form and function are 100% aesthetics as a center piece between two sinks in a bathroom could use some jazzing up.</li>
            <li> I love love this! So much I have 2 in my room for all my stuff. It fits all my hair styling products, lotions &amp; other tall bottles perfectly! I&#x27;ve recommended this to so many people</li>
            <li> This is large! Make sure to measure your space to make sure it will fit. I now have all my stuff very organized and out if the way. I love it!</li>
            <li> This looks and feels cheap. It is too tall and bulky. I will return it.</li>
            <li> Much bigger than I thought. and the edge is not smooth, which makes it feel cheap</li>
            <li> I LOVE this thing!! I read all the reviews before purchase, so was expecting it to be big but was still amazed at just how much this thing holds, I was able to totally organize all my hair products, foundation collection and perfumes on top. I hang earrings on the sides and necklaces from the perfume bottles. I will be back to purchase another when I get my beauty room set up ... one of the best purchases I have made on Amazon to date.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at this organizer for a long time and now I don&#x27;t know why I waited. I got rid of three baskets and loose cosmetic bottles as well. My bathroom counter top looked sooooo unorganized. I was so happy everything is in a neat spot and can quickly be found. The base is 15&amp;#34; so make sure you have enough room. Mine sticks out a few inches beyond my counter, but it sits on the far side of the counter and it&#x27;s not noticeable. And who cares, it&#x27;s my bathroom counter top any way. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love this thing. Is bigger than I expected. I have a lot of bath products, a lot! It fit everything plus there is room for more. The only thing is that it came with a bend and a small crack, I guess it happened while delivering. I kept it, didn&#x27;t want to deal with the return process. The crack doesn&#x27;t impede it functions so I&#x27;m just going to put a little crazy glue. If you have a lot of stuff and small space like me, this is your life savior.</li>
            <li> You will be amazed at what this holds!!</li>
            <li> It was well made, but way too big for where I wanted to put it, so I had to send it back.</li>
