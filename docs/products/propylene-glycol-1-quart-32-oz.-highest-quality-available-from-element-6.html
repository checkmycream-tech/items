            <li> I use it casually for mixing with glycerine and other stuff when vaping, but if you don&#x27;t know what that is, don&#x27;t worry about it.</li>
            <li> It is colorless, odorless, and the consistency is very thin which helps cut down my vegetable glycerin.  </li>
            <li> I use e-cigs to keep from starting up the bad habit of smoking - it is expensive to buy the prepared liquid</li>
