            <li> Nothing in the world, a shampoo and conditioner better than this!  It was the best buys of recent times. My hair is shiny, soft and hydrated. On first use, already noticed the difference.  The Oil is sensational.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product through my hairstylist, my daughters and my husband suffer from psorasis and very dry skin all over. Moroccanoil helps with the dandruff and the dry skin in one its a fabulous product. It works awesome with the power of all three and even more powerful with the fourth product which is a mask for the scalp.</li>
            <li> Great for your hair.. Smells amazing and my hair feels so much healthier</li>
            <li> Morroccon Oil shampoo, conditioner, and oil are the best hair product to date. My hair is shiny and I don&#x27;t have any static with the dry weather. Buying it at Amazon it saved me some money.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair and tried another Moroccan oil shampoo and conditioner and oil. My hair was so matted and tangled that I was almost in tears trying to comb it out. Using this Moraccanoil Brand repaired my hair and it is starting to grow again. I am very happy with this product. My husband uses it on his beard too. It has stopped breaking and also is growing.</li>
            <li> I love being able to order my favorite hair products online and not have to&lt;br /&gt;pay salon prices. Plus they always arrive earlier than expected. I would&lt;br /&gt;definitely recommend this seller and product to anyone who uses Moroccan Oil!</li>
            <li> The best ever and ever!</li>
            <li> I love these products! Hair feels and smells wonderful!  Don&#x27;t be afraid of the word \\&quot;oil.\\&quot;  It looks like olive oil when you pour out, but it dries clean and leaves hair feeling tremendous.  I won&#x27;t buy any other shampoos or conditioners again.  Just try the oil alone with your current shampoo if you want to try it.  You&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Moroccan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner for 2 years.  I&#x27;m not so sure this is the real deal.  It doesn&#x27;t smell the same and it doesn&#x27;t work the same.  I have heard there are knock offs on Amazon.  I am going to buy direct from the salon from now on.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo and the conditioner. I really Like the Oil It leaves my hair shinny and soft. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is ok and conditioner is ok..i like the oil and will reorder that but will skip the shampoo and conditioner. Vive shampoo andand conditioner has beat that in moisture in repair</li>
            <li> Great product with an even better smell, this stuff is amazing, and don&#x27;t listen to anyone who tells you it&#x27;s too strong for finer hair, it&#x27;s just perfect. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest you overdo it but the smell alone might prompt you to use more and more.</li>
            <li> I really love these products. They are usually really expensive, and it was good to get the &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; for a good price. I think these are the best for curly hair. My hair is fine and thinning, but dry, and this adds moisture.</li>
            <li> I love these product. I use it on myself and my daughter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed this product once already and don&#x27;t know why I was asked to again.  There was some numbers scrateched off the back of the bottles and left me asking questions.  I don&#x27;t know if it was expiration dates or serial numbers.  This left me suspicious.  This was not disclosed to me on purchase.  I was told that Brandstuff routinely scratches off numbers so they can sell way below retail.  I won&#x27;t buy from then again.  Then the owner of the company called me and asked for me to take my review down.  I consider this harassing.  You asked me to review it and I did.  That&#x27;s my opinion on the matter.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feel of my hair after but the products are very heavy and can cause breakouts on skin surrounding hairline and back!</li>
            <li> Depois de tanta propaganda resolvi adquirir o kit Moroccanoil.&lt;br /&gt;O óleo realmente é maravilhoso, para uso no cabelo seco ou molhado, não deixa o mesmo pesado e tem um cheiro delicioso, venho acompanhando a melhora da qualidade e intensificação do brilho usando o produto.&lt;br /&gt;Já o shampoo e o condicionador foram experiencias ruins, não recomendo pois não agregaram ao tratamento.</li>
            <li> i  tried this product twice and each time after one day i found my hair so dry so it doesnot help the frizz or the smoothness of my hair . and moraccoin oil is one of many contents ,generally  i amnot happy of the product .</li>
            <li> Sometimes when trying new products it takes a minute (few weeks) to notice a difference, not this product.  I noticed a dfference after the first use, and it&#x27;s a good buy!</li>
            <li> This was the second time I bought the moroccanoil oil treatment and I like it because it came with a pump so I&#x27;m not spilling oil all over the place now! I also noticed that there is now a &amp;#34;ligher version&amp;#34; which I am very excited to try because I think this works best for people with lots of hair that is unruly/curly/ etc. I think a ligher version would be better for people wanting the shine and sleekness, but at the same time don&#x27;t want it to look oily in any way. Shampoo and Condition was also a BIT on the heavier side too.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this kit. We&#x27;ll definetly keep buying this from now on. Very good long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter swims five days a week and her hair was a chlorine disaster.  Solved the problem and her hair is even growing again!  Great for damaged hair!</li>
            <li> I have been using Morrocanoil products for about 2 years now and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. It is a high quality product, kind of expensive but worth it for the health of your hair.</li>
            <li> Trust me, this is the real deal. I looked everywhere and could not find a better deal on this magic product. I have psoriasis and can&#x27;t live without it. I&#x27;m convinced that this deal can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Whenever I feel like my hair needs revitalizing I go back to this product- it never fails to deliver silky, shiny, healthy looking mane.</li>
    </ol>
