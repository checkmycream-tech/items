            <li>great deal great to use on bottom of your  feet  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!  </li>
            <li>The product is very good, better than hair gel.</li>
            <li>Wax does NOT wash out very easily!</li>
            <li>Suavacito (it smells amazing and holds great but doesn&#x27;t hold all</li>
            <li>If you want good information on dreadlocks then go over to Dreadlock Truth dot Com .</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and return to buy again when this runs out.</li>
            <li>It works great and has a slightly sweet aroma that is pleasant to have under my nose.  </li>
            <li>and I will buy more!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for many hairstyles.</li>
            <li>I use this wax to shape my mustache, it has good hold and the color is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Very strong hold.</li>
            <li>But did you know it&#x27;s also the most effective MUSTACHE WAX on the market?  </li>
            <li>The other two smell pleasant, with the pomeade smelling the best.  </li>
            <li>This is an interesting product.  </li>
            <li>Although I use the wax for my brows and love the fact that it has a bit of color.  </li>
            <li>own)&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap!</li>
            <li>and it is ok.</li>
            <li>like the picture arrived at time i love this produst</li>
            <li>There is information on dreads and the products safe for them.</li>
            <li>Also, it was an okay hold.</li>
            <li>Especially straight Caucasian hair types!</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic for blending away the gray!</li>
            <li>I would say it has way more petroleum than wax.</li>
            <li>You can always add more, so build up to the maount you need.</li>
            <li>Will help me to start to dread my hair and hopes that it will tunr out to be pretty good</li>
            <li>good product fast shipping</li>
            <li>It is BETTER than any &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; on the market when it comes to hold, not greasy with clean &amp; effortless removal.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it just gets under your nails and doesn&#x27;t do much for the job itself.)  </li>
            <li>But Murray&#x27;s is great for jazzing up your look before your next night on the town!</li>
            <li>Getting it warmed up is important</li>
            <li>so it goes into your smoothly that way.</li>
            <li>Its not quite as pleasant smelling as the regular Murray&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I purchased this and 2 other Murray&#x27;s products, the Natural Beeswax and the Hair Dressing Pomeade, to see which one would work best for controlling my mountain man beard.  </li>
            <li>The original Murray&#x27;s wax is great for limp hair in cooler climes.  </li>
            <li>, in fact it may not be a good idea to put in wet hair.</li>
            <li>This product wasn&#x27;t worth the shipping expense.</li>
            <li>Honestly, you can find this at Walmart, CVS, or a grocery store for the same price or cheaper and won&#x27;t have to wait for shipping.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy</li>
            <li>i like the clear color better</li>
            <li>I  order thismurrays beeswax because of the dark color to help hide the gray hair on my edges, to my surprise it also conditions it great product will buy more in the future</li>
            <li>This product is just as good and cost less than $5 for 3.5 ounces.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong waxy scent, similar to axle grease, or very hot wax.</li>
            <li>I cut my first set of locks because of this.</li>
            <li>Then you can come back here and buy those safe products.</li>
            <li>definitely buy more........</li>
            <li>I would definately continue to use this product, Althought this is my first time using this product, I like that there is no build up and it and has given my hair a healthier look.</li>
            <li>This the first wax that I started using 10 years ago when I first started styling my hair.</li>
            <li>So DELIGHTED I found Murray&#x27;s Black Beeswax, and I hope to use it until death do us part!</li>
            <li>Give the hair a muss to have a more modern look or smooth it back for all day professional look.</li>
            <li>IMPERIAL: Waterbased which is a positive</li>
            <li>it holds my curls really well and seems to defy humidity.  </li>
            <li>and my hair will magically be straight, in anticipation of that day</li>
            <li>it really keeps your hair together,I really like it</li>
            <li>I guess it wasn&#x27;t holding so much because my hair had oil in it.</li>
            <li>Black beeswax I chose this to try instead of original the original when used sometimes can be seen it shows in hair as a whitish color</li>
            <li>Received all 3 on the same day and was excited to try them out and get my answer.  </li>
            <li>I first found this product in my uncles old cabinet(yes</li>
            <li>(Never quite sure what&#x27;s up with the black coloring.  </li>
            <li>if you use black socks it will be ok  </li>
            <li>I have the other Yellow kind which I like a lot</li>
            <li>It could be mixed with a more fragrant hair grease to cut the scent, but the waxy smell fades, and having auto mechanic experience, its not very hard for me  to get used to the scent on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>Weather you need your hair to look nice for work or just for the ladies I would recommend Murray&#x27;s (traditional or black) over Layrite, Imperial or Suavacito</li>
            <li>can sleep with it in your hair, wake up and comb your hair for a little more &amp;#34;worn in&amp;#34; loose look, still holds pretty decent at this point (but bewared!</li>
            <li>I am young) and I used all out that jar for MONTHS!</li>
            <li>made my hair soft and locked in that feeling for weeks without brushing and applying!</li>
            <li>Murray&#x27;s is really best for short, straightened Negro hair which is almost impossible to hold down if its been \\&quot;fried, dyed, and laid to the side.\\&quot; Laughing, and grinning as I applied my new black Murray&#x27;s Beeswax to my newly grown grayish handlebar moustache (delighted with the results), I decided to try it on my prematurely gray head.</li>
            <li>I guess I expected something more dry.</li>
            <li>I applied another large gob just enough to evenly cover my scalp, rubbed it between my hands to melt it, and massaged it through, and guess what?</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.  </li>
            <li>So I use this when I do not feel like doing my complete eyebrow routine but still want to feel like my brows are groomed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had naturally &amp;#34;wavy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>many of you, I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>and I work in a professional office environment</li>
            <li>some people who really don&#x27;t want to wash their hair and are diehard will even sleep with shower caps to avoid this, not my personal choice but to each their</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing your product is old.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s all rough heals them right up for diabetic problems</li>
            <li>Although it holds my hair ALL DAY It washes easily off my hands with plain water!</li>
            <li>The only problem is that I&#x27;m a huge Celtics fan and it gets over any green hoodies, headphones etc.</li>
            <li>take several days for the stickiness to fade and for hair to return to its natural texture.</li>
            <li>Just in case they wants Dreads Mon.&lt;br /&gt;Dis one for The Dark Haired Girl</li>
            <li>thought I might have been overreacting and really wanted to see how the black looked in my beard</li>
            <li>and its impossible to get out of anything washable, like my headphones, but at least my hair looks excellent!</li>
            <li>I put a little in the palm, rub hands together to melt it and work it in gently.  </li>
            <li>works as a good hair hold for me to tame my hairline and cover the gray,has a pleasent smell a little hard to spread but just work with it</li>

            <li> works as a good hair hold for me to tame my hairline and cover the gray,has a pleasent smell a little hard to spread but just work with it</li>
            <li> Being of a multiracial stock (Black, Irish, and American Indian) with Negro hair type, I was well aware of Murray&#x27;s products, having used the regular pomade ONCE in the past when I had a long Afro.</li>
            <li> when you dry your hair you can comb it back into place and it will hold for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;-You</li>
            <li> I have a very wiry beard (usually use Proraso Moustache wax, Murrays beeswax (regular) or a similar product in addition to a home-made beard oil to control the sideburns)  and outside of making everything dark and shiny - didn&#x27;t hold at all.</li>
            <li> Holds all day long with about a dime to a quarter size amount (depending on your hair length)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected</li>
            <li> but i got the black and it rules and barely has an odor</li>
            <li> Several offered other water-proof waxes and jells, but not beeswax.</li>
            <li> Murray&#x27;s is NOT formulated for long hair, Afro&#x27;s or otherwise!</li>
            <li> (Murray&#x27;s Black Australian Beeswax)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i got both- the yellow and the black.</li>
            <li> I am a black male</li>
            <li> it will make it harder for your dreads to dry which will cause your locks to start to mold and rot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- VERY Greasy and tough to get out, I usually have to wash my hair twice or leave in my shampoo for extra long to get it all out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> OK, now for the bad part.</li>
            <li> It is basically Vaseline (petroleum) with a minimal amount of wax - which means that one must basically melt it out of one&#x27;s hair or use an industrial detergent.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also 100× harder for your hair to lock up because the wax acts as a lubricant .</li>
            <li> Holds hair up all day especially for dry and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used practically every other mens pomade, here are my thoughts on this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products, but this is the one for me.</li>
            <li> Then Amazon provided me with Murray&#x27;s Black Beeswax and it worked just like I expected.</li>
            <li> Only negative is the smell, it reminds me of crayon box in kindergarten</li>
            <li> Convenient for dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The black is hard to find in our local stores, so I get it here.  </li>
            <li> Black Murray&#x27;s Beeswax is not as thick as the regular Murray&#x27;s that I once swore never to use again on my head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;#1 choice: MURRAY&#x27;S BLACK BEESWAX (holds all day even after a shower but has a crayon</li>
            <li> Works but makes my shower black when washing hair.</li>
            <li> The product leaves a black stain on everything it comes in contact with.  </li>
            <li> this product and find another alternative if you have to have the black.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going to use this one to see if by it being black</li>
            <li> The black is really BLACK, so if your hair isn&#x27;t black, don&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li> A little TOO shiny despite its claims to be a &amp;#34;medium shine&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Overall, I guess I would recommend the prodcut but just know that it is very thick and really hard to work though wet hair</li>
            <li> too heavy i threw it away.</li>
            <li> If smell is a big deal to you, try Suavacito (it&#x27;s a serious lady killer!)</li>
            <li> Your hair will keep its hold without feeling stiff or greasy.  </li>
            <li> If you want to use something  to tame the frizzy  hairs then use aloe gell.</li>
            <li> My first experience with Murray&#x27;s pomade was a bad one.</li>
            <li> however has very little hold if you have wavy or curly hair.</li>
            <li> I usually buy a small tube of Pinaud, which can cost $3 to $5 for 1/2 ounce.  </li>
            <li> Just get a small amount on two fingers and get it warmed up by rubbing it across all your finger tips.</li>
            <li> The negative thing about the product is that it is way too thick and to me, very hard to work through wet hair.  </li>
            <li> and the yellow stinks.</li>
            <li> Or 2 it will cover the hair and make it impossible  for you to actually  get your locks</li>
            <li> The pomade in the orange can is really a soft wax and when I massaged it through my Afro which was difficult to do from the start, it matted my hair down and was VERY difficult spread, and to remove even after 3 or 4 &#x27;Dawn&#x27; degreasing&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> The smell - having that horrible metallic tinged slightly acidic aroma near one&#x27;s nose for any amount of time is unbearable.  </li>
            <li> Tough to wash off hands after applying, you have to spend about 1-2 minutes of serious hand scrubbing between the fingers to get this stuff off</li>
            <li> Having lost the Afro long ago, and now sporting a tennis ball fuzz cut I applied a few dabs at a time to my temples, and was shocked!</li>
            <li> smells nasty, I brought this before at a local store.</li>
            <li> Murray&#x27;s has a thick oil base, sometimes it will get on your pillow and you&#x27;ll need to wash the case,</li>
            <li> It did hold my twists, but it was so greasy, I was afraid it would get all over everything.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff in place of a moustache wax which is VERY expensive.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I immediately washed it out, hoped my wife would not smell any residue and wonder why I was rolling in dog poo, and threw the evil thing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product, my hair looks perfect.</li>
            <li> I  order thismurrays beeswax because of the dark color to help hide the gray hair on my edges, to my surprise it also conditions it great product will buy more in the future</li>
            <li> Bought it for a Christmas present For Nieces. Just in case they wants Dreads Mon.&lt;br /&gt;Dis one for The Dark Haired Girl</li>
            <li> This is an interesting product.  I like that it holds my curls really well and seems to defy humidity.  The negative thing about the product is that it is way too thick and to me, very hard to work through wet hair.  Overall, I guess I would recommend the prodcut but just know that it is very thick and really hard to work though wet hair, in fact it may not be a good idea to put in wet hair.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far.  Although I use the wax for my brows and love the fact that it has a bit of color.  So I use this when I do not feel like doing my complete eyebrow routine but still want to feel like my brows are groomed.</li>
            <li> Will help me to start to dread my hair and hopes that it will tunr out to be pretty good so im goin to try this &amp; see....</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t worth the shipping expense. It did hold my twists, but it was so greasy, I was afraid it would get all over everything. I&#x27;m not going to use it anymore. I guess I expected something more dry.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell. I have the other Yellow kind which I like a lot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had naturally &amp;#34;wavy&amp;#34; hair, I fantasize about the day that I wake up and my hair will magically be straight, in anticipation of that day I&#x27;ve used practically every other mens pomade, here are my thoughts on this product. (Murray&#x27;s Black Australian Beeswax)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;like many of you, I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and I work in a professional office environment so my hair always has to be ON POINT, AND still express my personal style somewhat (think 1960&#x27;s madmen meets 2015 Fashion Week) Weather you need your hair to look nice for work or just for the ladies I would recommend Murray&#x27;s (traditional or black) over Layrite, Imperial or Suavacito and here&#x27;s why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Holds all day long with about a dime to a quarter size amount (depending on your hair length)&lt;br /&gt;- Even after you swim or shower (if you don&#x27;t wash your hair) when you dry your hair you can comb it back into place and it will hold for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;-You can sleep with it in your hair, wake up and comb your hair for a little more &amp;#34;worn in&amp;#34; loose look, still holds pretty decent at this point (but bewared! Murray&#x27;s has a thick oil base, sometimes it will get on your pillow and you&#x27;ll need to wash the case, some people who really don&#x27;t want to wash their hair and are diehard will even sleep with shower caps to avoid this, not my personal choice but to each their own)&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap! Honestly, you can find this at Walmart, CVS, or a grocery store for the same price or cheaper and won&#x27;t have to wait for shipping.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to &amp;#34;mold&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t move&lt;br /&gt;-You don&#x27;t need an additional topical like hairspray to keep it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- VERY Greasy and tough to get out, I usually have to wash my hair twice or leave in my shampoo for extra long to get it all out.&lt;br /&gt;- Tough to wash off hands after applying, you have to spend about 1-2 minutes of serious hand scrubbing between the fingers to get this stuff off&lt;br /&gt;- A little TOO shiny despite its claims to be a &amp;#34;medium shine&amp;#34;, personally I prefer a matte finish but to each their own!&lt;br /&gt;- The Smell: It smells like crayons which is why a lot of people will use some type of topical treatment. If smell is a big deal to you, try Suavacito (it&#x27;s a serious lady killer!) You can also try the regular murray&#x27;s which has no scent at all to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 choice: MURRAY&#x27;S BLACK BEESWAX (holds all day even after a shower but has a crayon smell)&lt;br /&gt;#2 choice: Suavacito (it smells amazing and holds great but doesn&#x27;t hold all day)&lt;br /&gt;#3 choice: Layrite: Only holds your hair in place if you use a hairspray topical (which makes your hair look crispy so I don&#x27;t recommend)&lt;br /&gt;#4 choice: IMPERIAL: Waterbased which is a positive however has very little hold if you have wavy or curly hair.</li>
            <li> works as a good hair hold for me to tame my hairline and cover the gray,has a pleasent smell a little hard to spread but just work with it and it is ok.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my moustache.  I was looking for an actual moustache wax when I came across this and decided to give it a try.  It works great and has a slightly sweet aroma that is pleasant to have under my nose.  I usually buy a small tube of Pinaud, which can cost $3 to $5 for 1/2 ounce.  This product is just as good and cost less than $5 for 3.5 ounces.  The company also shipped it within two days of my ordering.</li>
            <li> good product fast shipping</li>
            <li> Works but makes my shower black when washing hair.</li>
            <li> I ranged through a number of hardware and shoe stores locally looking for beeswax and could find none. Several offered other water-proof waxes and jells, but not beeswax. Then Amazon provided me with Murray&#x27;s Black Beeswax and it worked just like I expected. My outdoor work gloves were softened and protected by this product. I am very pleased and return to buy again when this runs out.</li>
            <li> like the picture arrived at time i love this produst</li>
            <li> I purchased this upon recommendation from an acquaintance who has a bushy beard as an alternative to the regular Murray&#x27;s wax.  The product leaves a black stain on everything it comes in contact with.  It is basically Vaseline (petroleum) with a minimal amount of wax - which means that one must basically melt it out of one&#x27;s hair or use an industrial detergent.  The Iron oxide, mica &amp; titanium dioxide appear only to add colour; don&#x27;t do anything else for the product.  The smell - having that horrible metallic tinged slightly acidic aroma near one&#x27;s nose for any amount of time is unbearable.  And the kicker - it doesn&#x27;t work.  I have a very wiry beard (usually use Proraso Moustache wax, Murrays beeswax (regular) or a similar product in addition to a home-made beard oil to control the sideburns)  and outside of making everything dark and shiny - didn&#x27;t hold at all.</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected I used it for my starter locs I would recommend it for starter or beginning dreadlocks</li>
            <li> yeah, i got both- the yellow and the black. and the yellow stinks. i have always wondered why these hippies put that smelly stuff in their hair. but i got the black and it rules and barely has an odor</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> So DELIGHTED I found Murray&#x27;s Black Beeswax, and I hope to use it until death do us part! It is BETTER than any &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; on the market when it comes to hold, not greasy with clean &amp; effortless removal. Although it holds my hair ALL DAY It washes easily off my hands with plain water! Same with getting on sides of my face; I just tissue off &amp; it doesn&#x27;t even affect my makeup! Great stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I first found this product in my uncles old cabinet(yes I am young) and I used all out that jar for MONTHS! I am a black male and I don&#x27;t have dreads but I used this product to get wavey hair and it worked like a charm, made my hair soft and locked in that feeling for weeks without brushing and applying! The only problem is that I&#x27;m a huge Celtics fan and it gets over any green hoodies, headphones etc. and its impossible to get out of anything washable, like my headphones, but at least my hair looks excellent! I use it daily, I suggest you apply after a shower and brush in OR before you go to bed, brush in and tie in a scarf/ du-rag etc.</li>
            <li> Holds hair up all day especially for dry and thick hair. Only negative is the smell, it reminds me of crayon box in kindergarten</li>
            <li> The product is very good, better than hair gel. It&#x27;s good for many hairstyles. I recomend to all shoppers at amazon.</li>
            <li> it really keeps your hair together,I really like it</li>
            <li> I purchased this and 2 other Murray&#x27;s products, the Natural Beeswax and the Hair Dressing Pomeade, to see which one would work best for controlling my mountain man beard.  Received all 3 on the same day and was excited to try them out and get my answer.  The answer is NOT THIS ONE.  The other two smell pleasant, with the pomeade smelling the best.  This one smells like a joke product or a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I might have been overreacting and really wanted to see how the black looked in my beard, so I put just a tiny amount in my hand and began to style.  I immediately wished I had not, for although it looked alright, my uncontrollable gagging became had given me cramps and double vision.  Needless to say, I immediately washed it out, hoped my wife would not smell any residue and wonder why I was rolling in dog poo, and threw the evil thing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip this product and find another alternative if you have to have the black.  Otherwise use the Murray&#x27;s Pomeade.</li>
            <li> This product should NEVER be used on dreadlocks. Wax is not water soluble and therefore  will stay in your dreads even when you wash them. Over time wax will build up in your locks and two things can happen, 1 it will make it harder for your dreads to dry which will cause your locks to start to mold and rot. Or 2 it will cover the hair and make it impossible  for you to actually  get your locks clean.&lt;br /&gt;It is also 100× harder for your hair to lock up because the wax acts as a lubricant . I cut my first set of locks because of this. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake. If you want to use something  to tame the frizzy  hairs then use aloe gell. If you want good information on dreadlocks then go over to Dreadlock Truth dot Com . There is information on dreads and the products safe for them. Then you can come back here and buy those safe products.</li>
            <li> Black beeswax I chose this to try instead of original the original when used sometimes can be seen it shows in hair as a whitish color so I&#x27;m going to use this one to see if by it being black it will not show up or will not be seen. I&#x27;m natural so I don&#x27;t use heat I just twist and go.</li>
            <li> I use this wax to shape my mustache, it has good hold and the color is phenomenal. Not to mention I got it for an unbeatable price, a definite suggestion to anyone looking for styling wax!</li>
            <li> I have 4a-4b naural hair, and I used this on ym edges since my color is growing out. The black is really BLACK, so if your hair isn&#x27;t black, don&#x27;t get this. Also, it was an okay hold. I guess it wasn&#x27;t holding so much because my hair had oil in it. For maximum hold, I say don&#x27;t use any greasy products before putting this in.</li>
            <li> smells nasty, I brought this before at a local store. It never smelled this way before. I&#x27;m guessing your product is old.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff in place of a moustache wax which is VERY expensive. It does the job quite well and I am very pleased with the results! Being of a multiracial stock (Black, Irish, and American Indian) with Negro hair type, I was well aware of Murray&#x27;s products, having used the regular pomade ONCE in the past when I had a long Afro. Black Murray&#x27;s Beeswax is not as thick as the regular Murray&#x27;s that I once swore never to use again on my head. Murray&#x27;s is NOT formulated for long hair, Afro&#x27;s or otherwise! Especially straight Caucasian hair types! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!  My first experience with Murray&#x27;s pomade was a bad one. The pomade in the orange can is really a soft wax and when I massaged it through my Afro which was difficult to do from the start, it matted my hair down and was VERY difficult spread, and to remove even after 3 or 4 &#x27;Dawn&#x27; degreasing&#x27;s! Wax does NOT wash out very easily! Murray&#x27;s is really best for short, straightened Negro hair which is almost impossible to hold down if its been \\&quot;fried, dyed, and laid to the side.\\&quot; Laughing, and grinning as I applied my new black Murray&#x27;s Beeswax to my newly grown grayish handlebar moustache (delighted with the results), I decided to try it on my prematurely gray head. Having lost the Afro long ago, and now sporting a tennis ball fuzz cut I applied a few dabs at a time to my temples, and was shocked! This stuff is fantastic for blending away the gray! I applied another large gob just enough to evenly cover my scalp, rubbed it between my hands to melt it, and massaged it through, and guess what? I look 20 years younger!! OK, now for the bad part. Its not quite as pleasant smelling as the regular Murray&#x27;s. It has a strong waxy scent, similar to axle grease, or very hot wax. It could be mixed with a more fragrant hair grease to cut the scent, but the waxy smell fades, and having auto mechanic experience, its not very hard for me  to get used to the scent on my upper lip. I&#x27;d  probably wipe it off if I need to kiss. In conclusion, it is a great product for what I use it for and I will buy more!ss. In conclusion, it is a great product for what I use it for and I will buy more!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dreadlocks and this product holds my locks to the Max, without leaving any visible residue. My hair looks great..........wish I&#x27;d known about this a while back.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy more........and the price is great value too.</li>
            <li> everything meet my standards and i couldn&#x27;t be happier.If their  is anyone thinking of buy this product I would recommend it with 100% of my confidence and my word that they will be satisfy.</li>
            <li> The original Murray&#x27;s wax is great for limp hair in cooler climes.  But did you know it&#x27;s also the most effective MUSTACHE WAX on the market?  (Never quite sure what&#x27;s up with the black coloring.  Honestly, it just gets under your nails and doesn&#x27;t do much for the job itself.)  But Murray&#x27;s is great for jazzing up your look before your next night on the town!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using beeswax for several years now.  Your hair will keep its hold without feeling stiff or greasy.  The black is hard to find in our local stores, so I get it here.  I put a little in the palm, rub hands together to melt it and work it in gently.  Give the hair a muss to have a more modern look or smooth it back for all day professional look.</li>
            <li> This is not what you think it is the 100% bees wax is just what&#x27;s in the product once you feel it for yourself you can tell there something else in it. Which happens to be petroleum. I would say it has way more petroleum than wax. Also the smell gives it away as well in my mind</li>
            <li> great deal great to use on bottom of your  feet  that&#x27;s all rough heals them right up for diabetic problems only problem with white  it get your socks stained  if you use black socks it will be ok  i like the clear color better</li>
            <li> I would definately continue to use this product, Althought this is my first time using this product, I like that there is no build up and it and has given my hair a healthier look.</li>
            <li> This the first wax that I started using 10 years ago when I first started styling my hair. I&#x27;ve tried other products, but this is the one for me. It holds all day allows me to style it the way I want, which is pushed up in the front. The trick is not to use a lot, which is what I used to do 10 years ago. If you use to much, plan on it not coming out for a few days. Just get a small amount on two fingers and get it warmed up by rubbing it across all your finger tips. Getting it warmed up is important so it goes into your smoothly that way. Then run in through all you hair and start to style as you want. You can always add more, so build up to the maount you need.</li>
            <li> If your twisting dreads order 2!!!! Obsolete.</li>
            <li> too heavy i threw it away.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very strong hold. Convenient for dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Can take several days for the stickiness to fade and for hair to return to its natural texture.</li>
