            <li> My wife has used this perfume for most of the 35 years we have been married.  She loves it and can&#x27;t bring herself to change to &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; perfumes.  I&#x27;m so thankful that I can still buy it for her through Amazon  and &amp;#34;Jubujub&amp;#34;!  Will keep ordering as long as she wants it and I can get it!  Thank You. Packaged very well and arrived withing 2 day window.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this for years and its my favorite EVER!! I will always buy it as long as it&#x27;s available. Mary Kay should never have discontinued it! With some of the nasty smelling scents out there and THIS ONE is DISCONTINUED!!? Makes absolutley NO SENSE at all! Bring it back so I can buy it forever!!!</li>

            <li> Was exactly what I wanted !!</li>
            <li> This is my signature fragrance.  So thrilled I found it on Amazon, Mary Kay should have never discontinued this fragrance. I receive more compliments with Elige than any other fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have found this perfume here,  I love it and whenever I use it I get tons of compliment.  I hated when Mary Kay told me it was discontinue, I don&#x27;t know why.... But I am glad to have found it here....</li>
            <li> My mother loves this stuff.  Unfortunately, they no longer make it!  I searched all over and am SO GLAD to have found it on Amazon.com (thanks guys!).  I purchased it for Christmas.  I think she&#x27;ll be surprised.  It smells really good on her.  (Hope she&#x27;s not reading this.  lol)</li>
            <li> I ordered Elige perfume because I received a lot of compliments when I wore Elige&lt;br /&gt;I hope Mary Kay will have this perfume after 2015</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my purchase.  It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this perfume to anyoneâ€¦Wish it would come in a powder.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it wouldn&#x27;t be as much as it is.</li>
            <li> So glad I can still get this!!  It&#x27;s the real deal. This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume, and it makes a great Christmas gift when I can save the day and get it!</li>

            <li> I love the sent of this perfume.  I am only sorry that it is discontinued from Mary Kay company.</li>
            <li> This perfume is watered down and does not smell like the real Elige.  I still have the body shower gel and the perfume doesn&#x27;t come close.  What little smell it has lasts about 5 minutes.  This was a terrible experience and I will not buy from this site again.</li>
