    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>, this is the best lip plumper I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer but no plumping!</li>
            <li>Good product, I like it!</li>
            <li>is good and the customers service is awesome and</li>
            <li>LOL  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t work for me, but it&#x27;s still a good lip moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I loved the customer service.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase for sure!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>and she was very quick and happy to resolve my issue.</li>
            <li>The seller kept in touch with me to ensure the arrival of the lip balm and be sure I was satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>i use it the better</li>
            <li>Worked for the 1st week or so pretty good</li>
            <li>It does have some good moisturizing elements which is good, but not what I expected based on the advertising.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice natural shine.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend this product to all the ladies that want a nice natural plump to their lips.</li>
            <li>, thanks guys!I love the product</li>
            <li>The light sting is quite pleasant actually and the balm itself is very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li>My skin is on the sensitive side so that may help with me having more of a positive reaction to this product.  </li>
            <li>custom sucks lol</li>
            <li>I applied it several times throughout the day and even applied another lip plumping balm on top of it to see if that would help.</li>
            <li>I initially received the product and was very excited when it arrived.</li>
            <li>It leaves my lips feeling very soft and moisturized, and with the bee venom ingridient it contains, it immediatly plumps your lips naturally, forming a sublte sexy pout.</li>
            <li>The positive reviews convinced me to try this.  </li>
            <li>My lips are soft and full and the morr</li>
            <li>I really like the product itself.</li>
            <li>Really makes your lips tingle.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see much difference when using this product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really give reviews normally, so</li>
            <li>Absolutely Ridiculously High Price for something that seems like \\&quot;snake</li>
            <li>The cost is too high of a gamble.</li>
            <li>also, does bee venom can cause swelling when injected into the skin - are the live bees going to inject it into the lips???  </li>
            <li>When I first received the package, I&#x27;d left it out in my purse in the car, so it became very soft, and when I went to apply it, the balm part of it broke off.</li>
            <li>if you copy and cut out the lips and put them on top of each other, you can see that they are the same fish lips</li>
            <li>- the person clearly had some injections, Caucasians don&#x27;t have fish lips like that....  </li>
            <li>Actually, the size of the lips in both pictures are the same, the &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; has some light color on the lips to make them look smaller and the &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; picture has a lot of lip gloss on it to make them look brighter and bigger!</li>
            <li>What I really liked it that it doesn&#x27;t leave that thick glossy layer of product like other lip plumpers.</li>
            <li>Not sure what to expect at first, but it works well and makes my lips soft.</li>

            <li> but her customer service is worth it and customs is the mean ones</li>
            <li> you can hardly see the difference, and if there is it easily fades after a few minutes of applying.</li>
            <li> It does moisturize with a little tingle that doesn&#x27;t last long and no plumping.</li>
            <li> and I received a little gift along with it with a personal note</li>
            <li> but I see absolutely no lip plumping going on here.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> so not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> but now it does not even sting or plump even a little..</li>
            <li> would, with just a little tingle that goes nowhere.  </li>
            <li> it just stung a little.</li>
            <li> I think your lips kinda get immuned to it after using it a few day.</li>
            <li> Feels like I got hot sauce on my lips but not so bad that it bothers me.</li>
            <li> The burning sensation lasts for at least half an hour</li>
            <li> Not worth it no difference! !</li>
            <li> I mean noting lip tingle</li>
            <li> Not very happy with the product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean to be unpleasant about my review, just not happy with the products claims.</li>
            <li> It felt like it was just regular lip balm with an awful smell and taste</li>
            <li> I was going to try the mask, but since I&#x27;m not impressed with the lip balm, I won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I agree it does not taste bad either.  </li>
            <li> This lip plumper tingles &amp; plumps well, and doesn&#x27;t taste bad.</li>
            <li> really bad product bluntly&lt;</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Did not do crap to my lips.</li>
            <li> they think all buyers are idiots....</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.</li>

            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work for me, but it&#x27;s still a good lip moisturizer.</li>
            <li> this product did nothing for my lips.</li>
            <li> This is the only lip plumper that has actually worked for me.  I got it yesterday and put it on last night for a while and then this morning.  I can definately tell there&#x27;s a difference.  It says the effect is cumulative so if I keep using it daily I&#x27;m hopeful.  The light sting is quite pleasant actually and the balm itself is very hydrating.  I agree it does not taste bad either.  My skin is on the sensitive side so that may help with me having more of a positive reaction to this product.  Very pleased with this purchase for sure!</li>

            <li> Actually, the size of the lips in both pictures are the same, the &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; has some light color on the lips to make them look smaller and the &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; picture has a lot of lip gloss on it to make them look brighter and bigger! if you copy and cut out the lips and put them on top of each other, you can see that they are the same fish lips - the person clearly had some injections, Caucasians don&#x27;t have fish lips like that....  also, does bee venom can cause swelling when injected into the skin - are the live bees going to inject it into the lips???  LOL  they think all buyers are idiots....</li>
            <li> Did nothing and I mean noting lip tingle no plumbing at all</li>
            <li> Worked for the 1st week or so pretty good but now it does not even sting or plump even a little.. I think your lips kinda get immuned to it after using it a few day. Not very happy with the product!</li>
            <li> Not worth it no difference! !</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different.</li>
            <li> Do Not Plump YOUR LIPS</li>
            <li> The vendor kept me in touch at all times when my stuff got caught in customs. That&#x27;s why she can&#x27;t guarantee the two day or three day but her customer service is worth it and customs is the mean ones so I will order from this vendor again. I loved the customer service. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m out for the product is good and the customers service is awesome and custom sucks lol</li>
            <li> I initially received the product and was very excited when it arrived. The seller kept in touch with me to ensure the arrival of the lip balm and be sure I was satisfied with it. I really like the product itself. It leaves my lips feeling very soft and moisturized, and with the bee venom ingridient it contains, it immediatly plumps your lips naturally, forming a sublte sexy pout. What I really liked it that it doesn&#x27;t leave that thick glossy layer of product like other lip plumpers. It&#x27;s a nice natural shine. When I first received the package, I&#x27;d left it out in my purse in the car, so it became very soft, and when I went to apply it, the balm part of it broke off. I informed the seller of this and she was very quick and happy to resolve my issue. I would reccomend this product to all the ladies that want a nice natural plump to their lips.</li>
            <li> If you like the sting/tingle and you&#x27;re not allergic to bee stings, this is the best lip plumper I&#x27;ve ever used. But be warned, if you kiss someone on the lips, if even a peck, they will tingle too!</li>
            <li> Really makes your lips tingle. Can feel them plumping. Others have had no luck with this product but I love it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing except burn my lips! Good moisturizer but no plumping!</li>
            <li> It stings and maybe moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t plump your lips at all. I would return it if it wasn&#x27;t a pain to do. I don&#x27;t really give reviews normally, so I don&#x27;t mean to be unpleasant about my review, just not happy with the products claims.</li>
            <li> Works well and I received a little gift along with it with a personal note, thanks guys!I love the product</li>
            <li> It felt like it was just regular lip balm with an awful smell and taste</li>
            <li> Makes my lips tingle but I have not noticed them getting fuller.</li>
            <li> Not enough venom.  Act just like a regular lip gloss would, with just a little tingle that goes nowhere.  All hype no sting.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!!! My lips are soft and full and the morr i use it the better my lips look</li>
            <li> Not for the price!!!  My results weren&#x27;t noticeable it just stung a little.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see much difference when using this product.  It does have some good moisturizing elements which is good, but not what I expected based on the advertising.</li>
            <li> The positive reviews convinced me to try this.  Feels like I got hot sauce on my lips but not so bad that it bothers me. The burning sensation lasts for at least half an hour but I see absolutely no lip plumping going on here. I applied it several times throughout the day and even applied another lip plumping balm on top of it to see if that would help. Nope.  I didn&#x27;t expect it to perform miracles, but was hoping for some improvement.  Absolutely Ridiculously High Price for something that seems like \\&quot;snake oil\\&quot; in a lip balm. I was going to try the mask, but since I&#x27;m not impressed with the lip balm, I won&#x27;t. The cost is too high of a gamble.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to expect at first, but it works well and makes my lips soft. Good product, I like it!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product. It does moisturize with a little tingle that doesn&#x27;t last long and no plumping. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> No it did not plump my lips just stung a lil</li>
            <li> I love this! I can tell a difference as I wear it each day and use it like chapstick and even before bed. Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> This lip plumper tingles &amp; plumps well, and doesn&#x27;t taste bad. I would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> dont wast your money. tingles for 10 seconds than gone along with any plumping. so not worth the money.  really bad product bluntly&lt;br /&gt;lies about what it does.</li>
            <li> nothing extraordinary. you can hardly see the difference, and if there is it easily fades after a few minutes of applying.</li>
