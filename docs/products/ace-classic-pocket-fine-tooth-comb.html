    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Brittle teeth that snap rather than bending like the best plastic</li>
            <li>I am very happy that I took the chance of looking for it on Amazon at the time I did and found that the warehouse surplus inventory of this discontinued product was in stock.  </li>
            <li>That said, these are the best molded plastic combs I can find.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect pocket comb!&lt;br /&gt;Anything to keep my man happy.</li>
            <li>quality product fair price happy to have it!</li>

            <li>These are great combs.</li>
            <li>Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t sell this anymore at the drug stores, so I was happy to see them online , I bought them no waiting in line , didn&#x27;t have to look around for them all day</li>
            <li>Delighted with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Good delivery, met my goals.</li>
            <li>Not your ACE that everyone loved.</li>
            <li>I am delighted to once again have a supply of these pocket combs that I have used for over fifty years.</li>
            <li>Ace combs are a great buy for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>A NICE  COMB</li>
            <li>By far the best quality and handy combs that ive used.</li>
            <li>It is more suitable for a child than a man.&lt;br /&gt;The description of the comb did not give the dimensions.</li>
            <li>not so good compared to the combs of yesteryear, these break quickly</li>
            <li>My favorite pocket comb.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find any.  </li>
            <li>THESE ARE OK BUT NOT RELLY WHAT I WANTED.</li>
            <li>BUT I SHOULD HAVE  LOOKED MORE AT THE SITE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad because I even had a chance to tell two of my friends that have store and  drugstore, the material feels and looks like  </li>
            <li>many years ago.</li>
            <li>To require me to type in more words before I can submit is wack.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll still use these combs, there perfect size for pocket comb, i like all fine teeth as my hair is fine, whats left of it</li>
            <li>This model has not been available in stores for more than two years.  </li>
            <li>My husband was absolutely amazed and thrilled that I was able to get these.</li>
            <li>Easy to</li>
            <li>These are 100% fine tooth and pocket size.</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic combs just break.  </li>
            <li>It does the trick, but it&#x27;s cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>ACE is making these cheap combs.</li>
            <li>(Question: Is the trademark for the original Ace rubber comb available for a renaissance start-up?</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, they&#x27;re still fine combs (referring to the spacing of the teeth) and don&#x27;t just fall apart, so I&#x27;ve gotten adequate use out of them.  </li>
            <li>an ACE comb was still the original design material.  </li>
            <li>Ordered the six pack of men&#x27;s fine tooth pocket combs right away.  </li>
            <li>What a way to ruin good and essential products.</li>
            <li>The Ace classic is not as fine a tooth comb as would like, but as fine as we can find</li>
            <li>but you need to buy the 6 pack to get your moneys worth.  </li>
            <li>The main end tooth or frame breaks off and the teeth follow very quickly after that.  </li>
            <li>A quick online search told me all I should have been aware of.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The combs came and I opened up one to put it in my pocket right away.  </li>
            <li>Really miss the hard rubber but am happy with these and grateful</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s cheap (enough) and there is no other comb available like it</li>
            <li>These are very durable combs, not like the cheap versions that constantly break, and it is a very slender comb.</li>
            <li>I would not change their design at all; I just wish I were more careful how I sit.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Too short for my father with arthritis to hold comfortably.  </li>
            <li>now they are plastic and lucky if they last 6 months.</li>
            <li>For the life of me, I cannot understand why ACE, the maker, discontinued this particular pocket comb.  </li>
            <li>Classic combs that continue to give value.  </li>
            <li>The store buyer in my local drug store could only tell me this particular pocket comb was no longer available although the one with half-fine-and-half-course teeth is still on the market and available in my local store.  </li>
            <li>Had to scrap these for a new brand I found that does appeal with quality.  </li>
            <li>Its design is consistent with the classic Ace Hard Rubber fine tooth comb, but that is where it ends.</li>
            <li>the product comes back as a low priced cheap piece of????.  </li>
            <li>Thus they only last for a  month or so, longer when I am lucky.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t wait for them to be delivered and be able to throw out the latest junk plastic one that is only a few weeks old but already missing the ends and multiple</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewers that the older rubberized version was much nicer and durable.  </li>
            <li>Used to be a time I would only have to buy a new comb because I lost it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s close, but the old one I still have is a little higher in profile, which is what I had hoped to obtain.  </li>
            <li>The loss of the original iconic hard rubber comb and passing off of this cheap imitation as &amp;#34;the real thing&amp;#34; represents one of the painful symbols of a culture in decline.</li>
            <li>These combs scrape your scalp and clearly are not going to last.</li>
            <li>These must be the same people who refuse to make the old kitchen drainboards that everyone is clamoring for.</li>
            <li>Overall, not disappointed, but not thrilled.</li>
            <li>Too bad it&#x27;s not as good as the ones made years ago.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Just will have to use them up the same as the other junk ones bought locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Classic Ace product 61636 is hard to find these days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for classic Ace unbreakable hard rubber combs in my area for some time.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the cost of sending them back.  </li>
            <li> Since I carry them in my back pocket with my handkerchief, they are subject to deformation dues to the configuration of the chairs I sit in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using ACE combs for years and just didn&#x27;t read the description carefully.</li>
            <li> Just what was expected.</li>
            <li> I have used this same comb in the past, and have not had this problem.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used these combs for 40 years plus, they used to be hard rubber and would last in your pocket for 2-3-4 years,</li>
            <li> In less than a year, I&#x27;ve gone through three of these.  </li>
            <li> Alas, manufactured by a &amp;#34;Rubbermaid Company&amp;#34; in name only.</li>
            <li> The width of this comb was only one inch making it difficult to hold.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this fine-tooth model comb since I was 16 (now 83) and it has been my usual luck to lose or break one at least every three years.  </li>
            <li> but if someone made the comb in hard rubber</li>
            <li> I SHULD HAVE ORDERED  HARD RUBBER COMBS.</li>
            <li> ACE use to be known for quality hard rubber combs with machine cut teeth, but they don&#x27;t seem to be making those anymore.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> The negative reviews are correct.</li>
            <li> this is serious omission.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find these in bulk.</li>
            <li> I bought two packets of the comb and will give the extras to friends if they happen to let me know they have lost or broken theirs.  </li>
            <li> But at least I now have a supply of Ace combs!!</li>
            <li> I wonder if the truth is that governmental regulations have made it impossible for the ACE company to go on making this hard rubber product.</li>
            <li> i guess its sad, we americans want everything for the lowest price, so companies that make quality go broke or sell out then</li>
            <li> They sent the wrong combs.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, another icon fades into the sunset.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Too sad!!!</li>
            <li> plastic equivalents are terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have used this model all my life.  Too bad it&#x27;s not as good as the ones made years ago.  Used t be unbreakable.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t find these combs in the stores, around here, anymore.  Cheap plastic combs just break.  These will last until you lose them.  My husband was absolutely amazed and thrilled that I was able to get these.</li>
            <li> One end keeps breaking off in my pocket.  I have used this same comb in the past, and have not had this problem. The quality seems to have dropped.  Each comb lasts a couple days.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how to judge whether these are \\&quot;genuine\\&quot; Ace combs (as in not Chinese knock-offs), but I can say that the plastic is low quality.  Brittle teeth that snap rather than bending like the best plastic combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, they&#x27;re still fine combs (referring to the spacing of the teeth) and don&#x27;t just fall apart, so I&#x27;ve gotten adequate use out of them.  Overall, not disappointed, but not thrilled.</li>
            <li> By far the best quality and handy combs that ive used.</li>
            <li> These are very durable combs, not like the cheap versions that constantly break, and it is a very slender comb. I have thick hair, carry two thick wallets, and these work quite nicely. My favorite pocket comb.</li>
            <li> quality product fair price happy to have it!</li>
            <li> This was not the comb I wanted.  It&#x27;s close, but the old one I still have is a little higher in profile, which is what I had hoped to obtain.  When I have time I will go through the product listings and see if I can find the one I wanted.  But at least I now have a supply of Ace combs!!</li>
            <li> The Ace classic is not as fine a tooth comb as would like, but as fine as we can find</li>
            <li> Delighted with my purchase.  The combs arrived as described by the Seller and it arrived ahead of schedule.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> The width of this comb was only one inch making it difficult to hold. It is more suitable for a child than a man.&lt;br /&gt;The description of the comb did not give the dimensions. this is serious omission.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used these combs for 40 years plus, they used to be hard rubber and would last in your pocket for 2-3-4 years, now they are plastic and lucky if they last 6 months. i still like them but you need to buy the 6 pack to get your moneys worth.  i guess its sad, we americans want everything for the lowest price, so companies that make quality go broke or sell out then the product comes back as a low priced cheap piece of????.  i&#x27;ll still use these combs, there perfect size for pocket comb, i like all fine teeth as my hair is fine, whats left of it but if someone made the comb in hard rubber i&#x27;d buy it.</li>
            <li> Good delivery, met my goals.</li>
            <li> Ace combs are a great buy for a cheap price. These are 100% fine tooth and pocket size.</li>
            <li> not so good compared to the combs of yesteryear, these break quickly</li>
            <li> Not your ACE that everyone loved. Had to scrap these for a new brand I found that does appeal with quality.  Too bad, another icon fades into the sunset.</li>
            <li> Was expecting longer tooth version. My mistake. I&#x27;ve been using ACE combs for years and just didn&#x27;t read the description carefully.</li>
            <li> Classic Ace product 61636 is hard to find these days so these are a great find and at a great price.</li>
            <li> Just what was expected. I always seem to be misplacing combs. I leave them in a pocket and somewhere through the laundry the go away. So I picked up the six pack and should be set for a while. They are rigid enough to work well while they seem to be quire durable. I haven&#x27;t purposely tried to break one but they have held up to basic daily use sitting in the back pocket of my jeans.</li>
            <li> Goody Products says &amp;#34;Ace is performance grooming tools for men. They are precision engineered to meet the highest standards of quality, durabiltiy, simplicity, versatility and masculinity&amp;#34;.  The quality of the product is about the same as the quality of the English used in the blurb to describe it.  I definitely feel the &amp;#34;precision engineered masculinity&amp;#34; when I carry it around.  Well anyway, it works, it&#x27;s cheap (enough) and there is no other comb available like it so just go with it.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for classic Ace unbreakable hard rubber combs in my area for some time.  Haven&#x27;t been able to find any.  Turned to Amazon, did a search on &amp;#34;unbreakable rubber comb&amp;#34;, and there they were!  Ordered the six pack of men&#x27;s fine tooth pocket combs right away.  Couldn&#x27;t wait for them to be delivered and be able to throw out the latest junk plastic one that is only a few weeks old but already missing the ends and multiple teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combs came and I opened up one to put it in my pocket right away.  Big disappointment. They are plastic junk from China.  Not worth the cost of sending them back.  Just will have to use them up the same as the other junk ones bought locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fault for just assuming an ACE comb was still the original design material.  A quick online search told me all I should have been aware of.  It would have made me pass on the purchase.</li>
            <li> Have used Ace combs all my life.  They are not what they used to be &amp;#34;unbreakable</li>
            <li> This is no durable product..  Used to be a time I would only have to buy a new comb because I lost it.  In less than a year, I&#x27;ve gone through three of these.  The main end tooth or frame breaks off and the teeth follow very quickly after that.  The first I thought was a fluke, the second I was having serious doubts.  Then the third started falling apart and I moved on.  I found an &amp;#34;unbreakable&amp;#34; comb here on amazon and ordered the two pack, Ace is no longer a brand I can trust.</li>
            <li> Alas, manufactured by a &amp;#34;Rubbermaid Company&amp;#34; in name only. Its design is consistent with the classic Ace Hard Rubber fine tooth comb, but that is where it ends. The loss of the original iconic hard rubber comb and passing off of this cheap imitation as &amp;#34;the real thing&amp;#34; represents one of the painful symbols of a culture in decline. Too sad!!! (Question: Is the trademark for the original Ace rubber comb available for a renaissance start-up? If some manufacturer took it on, I think they&#x27;d sweep the market! Review by Stan Mattson</li>
            <li> I SHULD HAVE ORDERED  HARD RUBBER COMBS. THESE ARE OK BUT NOT RELLY WHAT I WANTED. THESE WILL BRAKE IN MY POCKET. A NICE  COMB BUT I SHOULD HAVE  LOOKED MORE AT THE SITE</li>
            <li> These are great combs. I have been using them for almost 70 years, and yes, I still have a head of hair to comb.&lt;br /&gt;Gary</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad because I even had a chance to tell two of my friends that have store and  drugstore, the material feels and looks like  I remember.</li>
            <li> It does the trick, but it&#x27;s cheap plastic.  I agree with the other reviewers that the older rubberized version was much nicer and durable.  It&#x27;s a shame ACE is making these cheap combs.</li>
            <li> I am delighted to once again have a supply of these pocket combs that I have used for over fifty years. Since I carry them in my back pocket with my handkerchief, they are subject to deformation dues to the configuration of the chairs I sit in. Thus they only last for a  month or so, longer when I am lucky. I would not change their design at all; I just wish I were more careful how I sit.</li>
            <li> For the life of me, I cannot understand why ACE, the maker, discontinued this particular pocket comb.  I have purchased this fine-tooth model comb since I was 16 (now 83) and it has been my usual luck to lose or break one at least every three years.  This model has not been available in stores for more than two years.  I am very happy that I took the chance of looking for it on Amazon at the time I did and found that the warehouse surplus inventory of this discontinued product was in stock.  I bought two packets of the comb and will give the extras to friends if they happen to let me know they have lost or broken theirs.  The store buyer in my local drug store could only tell me this particular pocket comb was no longer available although the one with half-fine-and-half-course teeth is still on the market and available in my local store.  I wonder if the truth is that governmental regulations have made it impossible for the ACE company to go on making this hard rubber product.</li>
            <li> ACE use to be known for quality hard rubber combs with machine cut teeth, but they don&#x27;t seem to be making those anymore. That said, these are the best molded plastic combs I can find. Really miss the hard rubber but am happy with these and grateful I could find them. I stocked up!</li>
            <li> Very hard to find these in bulk. Easy to lose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic equivalents are terrible.</li>
            <li> Just what my husband was looking for! It is the perfect pocket comb!&lt;br /&gt;Anything to keep my man happy. Thanks</li>
            <li> Classic combs that continue to give value.  I&#x27;ve been carrying Ace Combs since I was about 13...many years ago.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t sell this anymore at the drug stores, so I was happy to see them online , I bought them no waiting in line , didn&#x27;t have to look around for them all day</li>
            <li> These combs are not as long as described.  They are only about 5 inches long.  Too short for my father with arthritis to hold comfortably.  I had to send them back.</li>
            <li> The negative reviews are correct. This is not the Ace hard rubber comb one wants. Ace/Goody got taken over by Newell Rubbermaid. These must be the same people who refuse to make the old kitchen drainboards that everyone is clamoring for. Now they&#x27;ve mucked up combs. What next?! These combs scrape your scalp and clearly are not going to last. Not even the manufacturer thinks they will last since there&#x27;s no longer a guarantee. What a way to ruin good and essential products. Some companies are able to produce high quality products in China, but this company is giving China a bad name.</li>
            <li> They sent the wrong combs.  To require me to type in more words before I can submit is wack.  I suggest you remove this requirement immediately</li>
