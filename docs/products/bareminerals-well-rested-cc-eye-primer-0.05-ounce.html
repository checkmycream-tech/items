            <li>LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s basically a good product, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s causing me some irritation.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice cooking feel when you put it on.</li>
            <li>easy to apply and gives good coverage</li>
            <li>This concealer is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I use this with my Boo-Boo Cover Up concealer, and it looks awesome and natural!</li>
            <li>Does a pretty good job, nothing amazing.</li>
            <li>well rested powder over the top of it</li>
            <li>Works better than the powder form.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Through years, and years of winters, summers, hormonal changes, it still looks better on my skin than anything else on the market.</li>
            <li>This is the most fool proof makeup I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>and when I run out, I may purchase it again. :)</li>
            <li>Feels cool and nice on the skin, but doesn&#x27;t quite provide the coverage I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I wanted a concealer for my eyes and this is perfect and even nicer than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Best thing I&#x27;ve found to cover up dark circles.</li>
            <li>I use it under my eyes and in the fine lines around my eyes  </li>
            <li>The eye primer goes on easy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it every day and it doesn&#x27;t always cover that well, but it&#x27;s pretty much better than most of the concealers I&#x27;ve used around the eye area.</li>
            <li>Love this very much!</li>
            <li>Goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li>This glides on smooth and sits well under my under eye concealer all day.</li>
            <li>Arise the look and gives an impression of freshly made eyebrow.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing!</li>
            <li>I even put this on when I&#x27;m not putting on any other makeup because it feels so great.</li>
            <li>It does rather quickly which I like</li>
            <li>This product is OK, but it missed its chance to wow me...</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals  is hands down, the Very Best Makeup I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>and it came super fast!</li>
            <li>I really like this product and how cool it feels when you apply.</li>
            <li>Truly covers impurities, feels great on skin and if needed only needs to be re-applied once after several hours .</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and seems to cover dark circles ok</li>
            <li>I still love the actual make-up, but the application lid has way too much suction power!  </li>
            <li>Item exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Love the entire line.</li>
            <li>If you have dark circles under your eyes this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is so sad, but 2 weeks after LOVING this product, the super duper suction of the lid, popped the primer stick right out!  </li>
            <li>Works better than any other under eye make up</li>
            <li>Minerals, my skin, no matter the season, always looks fresh, never dry, or caked on.</li>
            <li>This product is decent.</li>
            <li>I Started wearing this when QVC first aired it waaay back when.</li>
            <li>love this, but it tends to break and then you&#x27;re left with a little nub of product that falls out of the case.</li>
            <li>Never had a breakout, that I had to stop wearing, clear up, and start over.</li>
            <li>At 55 years old, with sun damaged skin, which it does cover, I still get compliments on my makeup.</li>
            <li>I use is as a coverup for red spots on other places on my face, and it&#x27;s fine there.</li>
            <li>Just a little outside the corner of my eyes really &amp;#34;perks&amp;#34; up my whole face</li>
            <li>It covers up those dark circles very well.  </li>
            <li>It really lightens up the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It helps disguise my dark circles really well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see much coverage of dark circles.</li>
            <li>very cooling and lightens the dark circles.  </li>

            <li> Great I love it .... It hides my bags really good</li>
            <li> I really like this product and how cool it feels when you apply.</li>
            <li> Love this! Instantly brightens my eyes. Goes on so smooth. Plus I received it two days after ordering!</li>
            <li> This product gave me an under eye irritation. I use is as a coverup for red spots on other places on my face, and it&#x27;s fine there.</li>
            <li> love this, but it tends to break and then you&#x27;re left with a little nub of product that falls out of the case.</li>

            <li> This stuff works wonders. I use this with my Boo-Boo Cover Up concealer, and it looks awesome and natural!</li>
            <li> Great creme under eye cover</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my eyes at all.</li>
            <li> If you have dark circles under your eyes this product is amazing.  It covers up those dark circles very well.  I use bareminerals well rested powder over the top of it and it stays until I take it off.  Best thing I&#x27;ve found to cover up dark circles.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Works better than the powder form.</li>
            <li> This works great.  I use it under my eyes and in the fine lines around my eyes  It really lightens up the dark circles under my eyes.  Wrinkle are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> The eye primer goes on easy and smooth.  It doesn&#x27;t get lines in it like my last one did.  Also, my mascara does not wipe off on it like my last one did!  I will be buying this again.  We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts. :)  **This is so sad, but 2 weeks after LOVING this product, the super duper suction of the lid, popped the primer stick right out!  I tried to just shove it back into the black tubing, but it ended up being a mess.  I still love the actual make-up, but the application lid has way too much suction power!  Sad.</li>
            <li> Need to exchange this item.</li>

            <li> Awesome seller + awesome product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this. Was not very blendable or creamy.</li>
            <li> Perfect name for this product!! Just a little outside the corner of my eyes really &amp;#34;perks&amp;#34; up my whole face</li>
            <li> Works better than any other under eye make up ive tried. Stays all day without creasing</li>
            <li> Great for under eye shadows, blemishes, or any skin imperfections.</li>
            <li> Love this very much! Feels cool and nice on the skin, but doesn&#x27;t quite provide the coverage I was looking for. I would still order it again!</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals  is hands down, the Very Best Makeup I have ever bought. Fell in love with the mineral base, the first product. I Started wearing this when QVC first aired it waaay back when. Through years, and years of winters, summers, hormonal changes, it still looks better on my skin than anything else on the market. Never had a breakout, that I had to stop wearing, clear up, and start over. With wearing&lt;br /&gt;Bare Minerals, my skin, no matter the season, always looks fresh, never dry, or caked on. At 55 years old, with sun damaged skin, which it does cover, I still get compliments on my makeup. I hate the feel of any other foundation now days. Gooey, smears off on my clothes, yuk!&lt;br /&gt;Bare Minerals  will be with me til I go to my grave. I Love It!</li>
            <li> This concealer is very easy to use. It blends so well it can be worn without any other makeup.  It doesn&#x27;t settle into my wrinkles or crease when I use it on my upper lids. This is the most fool proof makeup I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I used the eye primer to cover the dark circles under my eyes.  It covered them well and was not noticeable.  It is a very good product and easy to apply. I expect this tube will last for years and years.</li>
            <li> Works great!! Love it!! Arrived on time. Truly covers impurities, feels great on skin and if needed only needs to be re-applied once after several hours .</li>
            <li> Arise the look and gives an impression of freshly made eyebrow.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing!</li>
            <li> Best under eye concealer I&#x27;ve found... And I&#x27;ve been looking for a while.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! Can&#x27;t beat the price and it came super fast! Will definitely buy again and again!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. Item exactly as advertised. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product is decent. I don&#x27;t use it every day and it doesn&#x27;t always cover that well, but it&#x27;s pretty much better than most of the concealers I&#x27;ve used around the eye area. In a pinch, I&#x27;ve used it to help cover up some blemishes/pimples on my face and it works, but rubs off easily...same under the eyes.  I like it and when I run out, I may purchase it again. :)</li>
            <li> Great product! Love the entire line.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover as well and as long as the powder product.</li>
            <li> Does a pretty good job, nothing amazing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s basically a good product, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s causing me some irritation.  I do try to keep it on my eyelid but not so close to my eyelashes!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see much coverage of dark circles. Disappointed in product. Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, squished down into tube when I applied it.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I wanted a concealer for my eyes and this is perfect and even nicer than I expected.  I like how my makeup sticks to the primer and it has a cooling effect too that is really pleasant!  I even put this on when I&#x27;m not putting on any other makeup because it feels so great.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for tired, puffy eyes!  very cooling and lightens the dark circles.  I buy it over and over!</li>
            <li> I only use bare minerals and was looking for something for the dark circles under my eyes and this does the trick! It blends perfect and does what it says, will defiantly be buying again.</li>
            <li> Love how this feels and the coverage is great. It does rather quickly which I like so you don&#x27;t wind up wiping it all off as you blend it. It has a nice cooking feel when you put it on.</li>
