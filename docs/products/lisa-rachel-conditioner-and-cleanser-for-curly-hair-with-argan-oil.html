    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This way, you don&#x27;t need to rinse out Lisa Rachel all the way, because it seems to work best if you leave some in your hair.</li>
            <li>This conditioning shampoo works wonderfully!  </li>
            <li>however, I still use the WEN styling cream, which IMO is what makes my hair the best.</li>

            <li>If product remains on the ends of your hair that&#x27;s a good thing!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did not leave my hair any softer than a good conditioning shampoo.</li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>As a comparison..it&#x27;s every bit as good as Wen.</li>
            <li>good.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works good for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>Works well, and smells good.</li>
            <li>Very good product, leaves hair clean and smelling good.</li>
            <li>But, the price was great, so it made it even better.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, creamy &amp; moisturizing, &amp; had good slip.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I found this online because I will continue to purchase this miracle product!</li>
            <li>i love the minty feeling the scalp gets while using it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I am transitioning and this is amazing</li>
            <li>Smells nice, cleans my hair well (even when I&#x27;ve used a lot of product) doesn&#x27;t over-condition or strip my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice and creamy.</li>
            <li>I am excited to find this product on the internet and the price is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 61 and have a fair amount of fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I find the cost for Wen out of my budget, so looking for a more cost effective product.</li>
            <li>Loved this- almost as good as Wen in terms of how my hair felt but much more economical.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to come out!</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love!</li>
            <li>General pump mechanics aside, this product is perfect for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair like me you will love this product!</li>
            <li>Product works fine and leaves the hair in nice condition.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser had some great slip, and I was able to detangle fairly easily with it, but my hair didn&#x27;t feel right until I used some Aussie Moist.  </li>
            <li>It worked OK for me - using it was pleasant and convenient, it smelled fine and my hair ended up clean and somewhat conditioned.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  a lot like WEN but slightly better because it&#x27;s formulated for curly hair... and cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this because I did notice my curly hair respond better to products (deva curl cream) and my difuser after using it.</li>
            <li>I also LOVE the Lisa Rachel Avocado/Tea Tree cleanser.</li>
            <li>Try instead: Hair One Cucumber Aloe Cleansing Conditioner smells lovely.</li>
            <li>The longer you leave it on the better.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to rinse well.</li>
            <li>It smells okay.</li>
            <li>Like so many reviewers</li>
            <li>My curls separate and stay frizz free!</li>
            <li>And looks better than it has in ages.  </li>
            <li>I have tried Wen and L&#x27;Oreal EverCurl, and this is probably my favorite.  </li>
            <li>, it works almost as well, but I wish it smelled better.</li>
            <li>I would recomend this product to anyone that has curlly hair, it makes it so much more manageable.</li>
            <li>but I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this .....</li>
            <li>but you get a better deal.  </li>
            <li>Rather use Wen, much better</li>
            <li>but since this isnt drying I havent been notiving as many flakes</li>
            <li>I have been using a couple of months and it has my hair looking so much better, and my hair has even grown quite a bit since beginning use and appears healthier.</li>
            <li>I can use a drug store conditioner and get better results.  </li>
            <li>and I needed a more budget-friendly cowash.  </li>
            <li>and my curls have never looked better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just used better (Wen, Deva-Curl No Poo).  </li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>so looks like a winning combination for me.</li>
            <li>I love this product and the price and have already ordered it again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I had a faulty product, I can&#x27;t be sure, but I know for a fact that I will never use it again.</li>
            <li>so i added lemon and lavender essential oils to help perfect that.</li>
            <li>Try it in you favorite products.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo/ cleaner.</li>
            <li>I have NEVER been able to not use a conditioner.</li>
            <li>I cant stop touching my hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely comparable to WEN with better scents and price!!!</li>
            <li>It seems to rinse out better and leaves my curls clean and bouncy!</li>
            <li>This product proved a pretty good substitute.</li>
            <li>I like it just as good as some of the higher priced products.</li>
            <li>My hair is full, shiny and not frizzy!</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to detangle.</li>
            <li>Others have mentioned the smell, and it does have a strong astringent smell, but I don&#x27;t find it offensive</li>
            <li>I use it for my son as well since is very gentle, smell nice but not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I really liked this at first, I even reordered it.</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil version also has a strong smell, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant and seems to work even better on my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>Seems to work just fine.  </li>
            <li>Strong, and cheap.  </li>
            <li>Imagine the company bought a vat of fragrance from a manufacturer of cheap men&#x27;s shaving cream, then added 100x the amount that they needed to a batch of this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I was purchasing a product from my local Sally&#x27;s store it worked really great</li>
            <li>You can even leave some in if you want to wear your hair curly and it helps keep hair smooth.</li>
            <li>I bit the bullet and ordered Lisa Rachel Sulfate Free Conditioner &amp; Cleanser with Argan Oil</li>
            <li>Sulfate free is a nice bonus, too, for those looking for a more natural hair product.</li>
            <li>This works great, leaves my wavy hair looking and feeling terrific.</li>
            <li>I was experienced in the proper use of a cleansing conditioner, and I read the reviews for suggestions on using it that might differ what I was used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took a while for me to perfect the whole routine, but I finally found a conditioner that I like and a sulfate/silicone free shampoo.</li>
            <li>that are sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I have never used a conditioning cleanser before and am just switching to a sulfate free product.</li>
            <li>And since I travel quite a bit, I find it very handy that I need only 1 bottle for my haircare.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it now about 4 times and not disappointed yet.</li>
            <li>We were not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Scalp feels fresh!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was excited to try this.  </li>
            <li>I originally picked up Lisa Rachel at a discount store, having been attracted to the argan oil promise.</li>
            <li>It makes you scalp feel tingly and clean.  </li>
            <li>Hair does t even feel clean</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo because my hair feels clean &amp; soft for more than a day.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and conditioned.</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t feel stripped...but it didn&#x27;t feel squeaky clean either...more clean, but a bit gooey.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to find this product at Ross for the convincing price of $5, and I am so glad that I tried it out!</li>
            <li>Getting away from sulfates have helped so much, and this is product lasts a long time and is a great price :)</li>
            <li>Great product, I use it for me, I have lots of hair and sometimes very dry and frizzy and this product helps to clean it without overdrawing the hair.</li>
            <li>Not such a good idea to leave it in as a conditioner.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion this is a better choice as it moisturizes as well as Wen but rinses out much cleaner (a problem I had with Wen).  </li>
            <li>Like many who buy this, I was looking for an affordable variation of the Wen cleansing conditioners, which I just can&#x27;t make myself spend so much money on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not Bad...</li>
            <li>It activates the curl and smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>and it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>That has been greatly reduced since I started using this instead of conventional shampoo and conditioner combos.</li>
            <li>Lisa Rachel sulfate free with argon oil conditions my hair very well!</li>
            <li>Not to mention it was completely clean which surprised me since most of these cleansing conditioners tend to leave a residue and don&#x27;t leave me feeling like i have refreshed hair.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>Thankfully the smell fades pretty quickly!&lt;br /&gt;Second, it doesn&#x27;t clean as well as Wen, but it does get the job done.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I can say is this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It really does stink of cheap men&#x27;s cologne...</li>
            <li>This is the only cream hair cleanser I&#x27;ve ever tried and, once I got used to it, I liked the concept.</li>
            <li>It also has such a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>So, the lower rating is just due to the scent, not the results, which are actually good.</li>
            <li>It not only makes brings out beautiful natural curls, but also makes hair so much easier to style!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it in place of shampoo and it leaves my hair feelings so soft and clean + clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all kinds of products over the years for my thick curly hair and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>The keys are:  use enough product, get hair wet with warm water, spread on the head itself (think more of covering the scalp surface), THEN put your head under the shower as someone else said &amp;#34;1.3 seconds&amp;#34; and then &#x27;lather&#x27;(it won&#x27;t be a real lather but that 1.3 second step makes a huge difference in how spread able it is).  </li>
            <li>Then I can kinda pick apart the curls and fluff it out a little.no more frizz!</li>
            <li>I like this product very much and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I also have dandruff that was leaving my scalp pretty itchy and</li>
            <li>Thanks, Lisa Rachel!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This stuff works pretty well</li>
            <li>The pump doesn&#x27;t work very well!</li>
            <li>It gets my hair clean and soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>It does have more amodimethicone than Deva, but my long curly 3b hair can live with, as I&#x27;m in a super humid climate.</li>
            <li>The smell is very light, with a slight and not unpleasant minty/medicinal smell.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to use a ton of this stuff and it doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>I recently began using no-lather, sulfate free cleansers on my biracial, curly hair.</li>
            <li>My hair seems to stay cleaner, and my scalp is much healthier.</li>
            <li>If you have curly hair, I highly (infact, I insist) that you try this product!</li>
            <li>Havent noticed any real benefits here.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier than the shampoo-conditioner-dry hair-compensating with a multitude of hair products routine</li>
            <li>My daughter came out of the shower with smooth manageable hair and no tears when i brushed it for her.  </li>
            <li>I used wen conditioning cleanser before,bbut it cost so much.</li>
            <li>and I need products that are gentle for my hair.  </li>
            <li>But it had too much menthol in it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update - If you are looking for real results for your hair, try Wen.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a mixture of curly, wavy, and nearly straight.</li>
            <li>my scalp, rinse, use this conditioner on the rest of the length of my hair and detangle with fingers, leave in for the rest of my shower, rinse, turn off water, add a bit more of this conditioner to the length of my hair while still sopping wet.</li>
            <li>My result is a ton of body with big frizz free curls.</li>
            <li>It works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Very overpowering.</li>
            <li>So, I have been doing the whole &amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34; method for about six months: co-washing, no sulfates, silicones, etc.</li>
            <li>but my hair is really frizzy and I&#x27;m not liking it at all.</li>
            <li>I especially like the way it magically encourages the curl, more than any other cleaning conditioner I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>It does not &amp;#34;tame&amp;#34; it like I had expected, but it is better than most other cleansing conditioners.  </li>
            <li>This left my hair feeling clean without stripping my hair from its natural oils, it left my scalp feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I tried other products to replace it, but never was able to find anything that worked as well as WEN.  </li>
            <li>Love it, my extremely curly hair (corkscrew curls) has never been happier.</li>
            <li>My hair has gone from stick straight to rather wavy in my older age</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first several uses were fine, and the result was okay, probably because I used it with my usual DevaCurl One Condition.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if I really even liked how it was on my hair either.</li>
            <li>sure you use more than enough product (at least seven pumps)&lt;br /&gt;-Leave</li>
            <li>Not worth losing more hair over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave away the full bottle I had left and already see an improvement in the shine of my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft after the first use.</li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t be my one and only cleaning conditioner, but I do plan to buy more when this bottle gets low.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried the conditioning cleanser, my hair dried into non-frizzy beautiful curls (without gel or any other product!!!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mixed (black and white) and this stuff works great on my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I will say this product was easy to get through my hair, it seemed to me my hair looked shinier then normal, but I did notice more hair in the drain then usual which was concerning, after rinsing it out and squeezing it dry</li>
            <li>I find this product not only cleans my hairs, but leaves it super manageable and soft -- and doesn&#x27;t strip my color!</li>
            <li>process, every 1-2 times per week: wet hair, sulfate free shampoo</li>
            <li>I can wash my hair more often (everyday) without my hair stripping.</li>
            <li>It the only one that not only makes it easy to comb through but also keeps the volume.</li>
            <li>My gray hairs are slowly becoming less gray.  </li>
            <li>It makes a pretty decent shaving cream, so I guess it wasn&#x27;t a total loss.</li>
            <li>I am new to cowashing.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anybody looking for new products.</li>
            <li>I realize that one needs to give hair time to adjust to a new product</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and regular conditioners make my hair too flat.  </li>
            <li>My hair also has moderate heat damage and this product (in combination with others)is helping nurse it back to its original health.   </li>
            <li>This is the first product that I have purchased for curly hair that has actually worked well!  </li>
            <li>I then set my hair with curlformers and i cannot believe how soft my hair is!</li>
            <li>I have thin frizzy and dry curly hair, this product is great for that.</li>
            <li>I bought this at a large pharmacy chain last night and used it.</li>
            <li>Nothing special and not worth the price.</li>
            <li>Finding stuff that works on my crazy hair and not leave it frizzy is great.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li>The only reason I am giving this one 4 stars is I really don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li>I only use this product (at a much lower cost than another brand).  </li>
            <li>and my hair feels soft as silk when I rinse this out.</li>
            <li>Bottom line: it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft, manageable and shiny as Wen.</li>
            <li>Soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>leaves hair soft .</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to fragrances</li>
            <li>I have natural curl</li>
            <li>I went straight back to the store and bought another one so as not to run out.</li>
            <li>It conditions my hair and leaves it so soft.</li>
            <li>I still cant believe how soft my hair is.</li>
            <li>My hair felt really soft,</li>
            <li>so I will try it at least 2 more days</li>
            <li>I wash my hair once a week with my regular sulfate free shampoo (biomega or its a 10) for clarification, and then i use this every other day.</li>
            <li>(there&#x27;s no other word for it) at the soft, silky yet defined curl.</li>
            <li>Any curly haired gal of any sort trust as believe there is no other product out there that will do what this does for you!</li>
            <li>Although I have a lot of it, my hair is basically fine in nature so too much of any hair product leaves it flat and dull.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and not dry at all.</li>
            <li>Similar products to this one are very exepensive (such as no-poo) and do not produce results close to Lisa Rachel.</li>
            <li>use these products about 5 days a week without shampoo, and on the other 2 days I first use a pea-sized dab of shampoo, and then use one of these conditioners.</li>
            <li>My hair felt dry after using it and I also lost more hair than usual.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and following the directions on the bottle, it turned out,</li>
            <li>Love the product but getting tired of the bottles.</li>
            <li>I sleep on satin pillow cases to help keep the frizz down and allow me to wear my hair down for several more days after this process.</li>
            <li>Wash your scalp with it first, rinse, add some from bottom of your down to the ends and clip it up for the rest of your shower.</li>
            <li>My wavy/curly hair tends to be very dry, and even after using a small amount of this as a leave-in conditioner (as per directions on the bottle), I still had to use my regular leave-in to be able to comb through my hair.</li>
            <li>Well, I just loved WEN, but it was so expensive!  </li>
            <li>I am an African American woman who is transitioning from relaxed hair to natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I would like to note that this cleanser is not strong enough to completely elimanate shampoo (nor would I want it to be that strong as it would be harsh on my hair).</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and allows me to use less product in my hair after the shower.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair that is dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>Just as good as WEN and way less expensive</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I also use a little of this product in my hand with a little water and lightly touch the ends of my hair, it acts as a&lt;br /&gt;soft setting lotion.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This way, you don&#x27;t need to rinse out Lisa Rachel all the way, because it seems to work best if you leave some in your hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioning shampoo works wonderfully!  </li>
            <li> however, I still use the WEN styling cream, which IMO is what makes my hair the best.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good!</li>

            <li> Good product at great price.</li>
            <li> works great, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> If product remains on the ends of your hair that&#x27;s a good thing!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did not leave my hair any softer than a good conditioning shampoo.</li>
            <li> Good.</li>
            <li> As a comparison..it&#x27;s every bit as good as Wen.</li>
            <li> good.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works good for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Works well, and smells good.</li>
            <li> Very good product, leaves hair clean and smelling good.</li>
            <li> But, the price was great, so it made it even better.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, creamy &amp; moisturizing, &amp; had good slip.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I found this online because I will continue to purchase this miracle product!</li>
            <li> i love the minty feeling the scalp gets while using it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I am transitioning and this is amazing</li>
            <li> Smells nice, cleans my hair well (even when I&#x27;ve used a lot of product) doesn&#x27;t over-condition or strip my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice and creamy.</li>
            <li> I am excited to find this product on the internet and the price is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 61 and have a fair amount of fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I find the cost for Wen out of my budget, so looking for a more cost effective product.</li>
            <li> Loved this- almost as good as Wen in terms of how my hair felt but much more economical.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to come out!</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love!</li>
            <li> General pump mechanics aside, this product is perfect for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair like me you will love this product!</li>
            <li> Product works fine and leaves the hair in nice condition.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser had some great slip, and I was able to detangle fairly easily with it, but my hair didn&#x27;t feel right until I used some Aussie Moist.  </li>
            <li> It worked OK for me - using it was pleasant and convenient, it smelled fine and my hair ended up clean and somewhat conditioned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  a lot like WEN but slightly better because it&#x27;s formulated for curly hair... and cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this because I did notice my curly hair respond better to products (deva curl cream) and my difuser after using it.</li>
            <li> I also LOVE the Lisa Rachel Avocado/Tea Tree cleanser.</li>
            <li> Try instead: Hair One Cucumber Aloe Cleansing Conditioner smells lovely.</li>
            <li> The longer you leave it on the better.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to rinse well.</li>
            <li> It smells okay.</li>
            <li> Like so many reviewers</li>
            <li> My curls separate and stay frizz free!</li>
            <li> And looks better than it has in ages.  </li>
            <li> I have tried Wen and L&#x27;Oreal EverCurl, and this is probably my favorite.  </li>
            <li> , it works almost as well, but I wish it smelled better.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this product to anyone that has curlly hair, it makes it so much more manageable.</li>
            <li> but I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this .....</li>
            <li> but you get a better deal.  </li>
            <li> Rather use Wen, much better</li>
            <li> but since this isnt drying I havent been notiving as many flakes</li>
            <li> I have been using a couple of months and it has my hair looking so much better, and my hair has even grown quite a bit since beginning use and appears healthier.</li>
            <li> I can use a drug store conditioner and get better results.  </li>
            <li> and I needed a more budget-friendly cowash.  </li>
            <li> and my curls have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just used better (Wen, Deva-Curl No Poo).  </li>
            <li> I love the product.  </li>
            <li> so looks like a winning combination for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the price and have already ordered it again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I had a faulty product, I can&#x27;t be sure, but I know for a fact that I will never use it again.</li>
            <li> so i added lemon and lavender essential oils to help perfect that.</li>
            <li> Try it in you favorite products.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo/ cleaner.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER been able to not use a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I cant stop touching my hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely comparable to WEN with better scents and price!!!</li>
            <li> It seems to rinse out better and leaves my curls clean and bouncy!</li>
            <li> This product proved a pretty good substitute.</li>
            <li> I like it just as good as some of the higher priced products.</li>
            <li> My hair is full, shiny and not frizzy!</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to detangle.</li>
            <li> Others have mentioned the smell, and it does have a strong astringent smell, but I don&#x27;t find it offensive</li>
            <li> I use it for my son as well since is very gentle, smell nice but not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I really liked this at first, I even reordered it.</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil version also has a strong smell, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant and seems to work even better on my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> Seems to work just fine.  </li>
            <li> Strong, and cheap.  </li>
            <li> Imagine the company bought a vat of fragrance from a manufacturer of cheap men&#x27;s shaving cream, then added 100x the amount that they needed to a batch of this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was purchasing a product from my local Sally&#x27;s store it worked really great</li>
            <li> You can even leave some in if you want to wear your hair curly and it helps keep hair smooth.</li>
            <li> I bit the bullet and ordered Lisa Rachel Sulfate Free Conditioner &amp; Cleanser with Argan Oil</li>
            <li> Sulfate free is a nice bonus, too, for those looking for a more natural hair product.</li>
            <li> This works great, leaves my wavy hair looking and feeling terrific.</li>
            <li> I was experienced in the proper use of a cleansing conditioner, and I read the reviews for suggestions on using it that might differ what I was used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took a while for me to perfect the whole routine, but I finally found a conditioner that I like and a sulfate/silicone free shampoo.</li>
            <li> that are sulfate free.</li>
            <li> I have never used a conditioning cleanser before and am just switching to a sulfate free product.</li>
            <li> And since I travel quite a bit, I find it very handy that I need only 1 bottle for my haircare.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it now about 4 times and not disappointed yet.</li>
            <li> We were not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Scalp feels fresh!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was excited to try this.  </li>
            <li> I originally picked up Lisa Rachel at a discount store, having been attracted to the argan oil promise.</li>
            <li> It makes you scalp feel tingly and clean.  </li>
            <li> Hair does t even feel clean</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo because my hair feels clean &amp; soft for more than a day.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels clean and conditioned.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t feel stripped...but it didn&#x27;t feel squeaky clean either...more clean, but a bit gooey.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to find this product at Ross for the convincing price of $5, and I am so glad that I tried it out!</li>
            <li> Getting away from sulfates have helped so much, and this is product lasts a long time and is a great price :)</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it for me, I have lots of hair and sometimes very dry and frizzy and this product helps to clean it without overdrawing the hair.</li>
            <li> Not such a good idea to leave it in as a conditioner.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion this is a better choice as it moisturizes as well as Wen but rinses out much cleaner (a problem I had with Wen).  </li>
            <li> Like many who buy this, I was looking for an affordable variation of the Wen cleansing conditioners, which I just can&#x27;t make myself spend so much money on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not Bad...</li>
            <li> It activates the curl and smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> and it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> That has been greatly reduced since I started using this instead of conventional shampoo and conditioner combos.</li>
            <li> Lisa Rachel sulfate free with argon oil conditions my hair very well!</li>
            <li> Not to mention it was completely clean which surprised me since most of these cleansing conditioners tend to leave a residue and don&#x27;t leave me feeling like i have refreshed hair.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> Thankfully the smell fades pretty quickly!&lt;br /&gt;Second, it doesn&#x27;t clean as well as Wen, but it does get the job done.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I can say is this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> It really does stink of cheap men&#x27;s cologne...</li>
            <li> This is the only cream hair cleanser I&#x27;ve ever tried and, once I got used to it, I liked the concept.</li>
            <li> It also has such a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> So, the lower rating is just due to the scent, not the results, which are actually good.</li>
            <li> It not only makes brings out beautiful natural curls, but also makes hair so much easier to style!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it in place of shampoo and it leaves my hair feelings so soft and clean + clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of products over the years for my thick curly hair and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> The keys are:  use enough product, get hair wet with warm water, spread on the head itself (think more of covering the scalp surface), THEN put your head under the shower as someone else said &amp;#34;1.3 seconds&amp;#34; and then &#x27;lather&#x27;(it won&#x27;t be a real lather but that 1.3 second step makes a huge difference in how spread able it is).  </li>
            <li> Then I can kinda pick apart the curls and fluff it out a little.no more frizz!</li>
            <li> I like this product very much and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I also have dandruff that was leaving my scalp pretty itchy and</li>
            <li> Thanks, Lisa Rachel!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well</li>
            <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t work very well!</li>
            <li> It gets my hair clean and soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> It does have more amodimethicone than Deva, but my long curly 3b hair can live with, as I&#x27;m in a super humid climate.</li>
            <li> The smell is very light, with a slight and not unpleasant minty/medicinal smell.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to use a ton of this stuff and it doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> I recently began using no-lather, sulfate free cleansers on my biracial, curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to stay cleaner, and my scalp is much healthier.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair, I highly (infact, I insist) that you try this product!</li>
            <li> Havent noticed any real benefits here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier than the shampoo-conditioner-dry hair-compensating with a multitude of hair products routine</li>
            <li> My daughter came out of the shower with smooth manageable hair and no tears when i brushed it for her.  </li>
            <li> I used wen conditioning cleanser before,bbut it cost so much.</li>
            <li> and I need products that are gentle for my hair.  </li>
            <li> But it had too much menthol in it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update - If you are looking for real results for your hair, try Wen.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a mixture of curly, wavy, and nearly straight.</li>
            <li> my scalp, rinse, use this conditioner on the rest of the length of my hair and detangle with fingers, leave in for the rest of my shower, rinse, turn off water, add a bit more of this conditioner to the length of my hair while still sopping wet.</li>
            <li> My result is a ton of body with big frizz free curls.</li>
            <li> It works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Very overpowering.</li>
            <li> So, I have been doing the whole &amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34; method for about six months: co-washing, no sulfates, silicones, etc.</li>
            <li> but my hair is really frizzy and I&#x27;m not liking it at all.</li>
            <li> I especially like the way it magically encourages the curl, more than any other cleaning conditioner I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> It does not &amp;#34;tame&amp;#34; it like I had expected, but it is better than most other cleansing conditioners.  </li>
            <li> This left my hair feeling clean without stripping my hair from its natural oils, it left my scalp feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I tried other products to replace it, but never was able to find anything that worked as well as WEN.  </li>
            <li> Love it, my extremely curly hair (corkscrew curls) has never been happier.</li>
            <li> My hair has gone from stick straight to rather wavy in my older age</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first several uses were fine, and the result was okay, probably because I used it with my usual DevaCurl One Condition.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I really even liked how it was on my hair either.</li>
            <li> sure you use more than enough product (at least seven pumps)&lt;br /&gt;-Leave</li>
            <li> Not worth losing more hair over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave away the full bottle I had left and already see an improvement in the shine of my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was so soft after the first use.</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t be my one and only cleaning conditioner, but I do plan to buy more when this bottle gets low.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried the conditioning cleanser, my hair dried into non-frizzy beautiful curls (without gel or any other product!!!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixed (black and white) and this stuff works great on my curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I will say this product was easy to get through my hair, it seemed to me my hair looked shinier then normal, but I did notice more hair in the drain then usual which was concerning, after rinsing it out and squeezing it dry</li>
            <li> I find this product not only cleans my hairs, but leaves it super manageable and soft -- and doesn&#x27;t strip my color!</li>
            <li> process, every 1-2 times per week: wet hair, sulfate free shampoo</li>
            <li> I can wash my hair more often (everyday) without my hair stripping.</li>
            <li> It the only one that not only makes it easy to comb through but also keeps the volume.</li>
            <li> My gray hairs are slowly becoming less gray.  </li>
            <li> It makes a pretty decent shaving cream, so I guess it wasn&#x27;t a total loss.</li>
            <li> I am new to cowashing.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anybody looking for new products.</li>
            <li> I realize that one needs to give hair time to adjust to a new product</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and regular conditioners make my hair too flat.  </li>
            <li> My hair also has moderate heat damage and this product (in combination with others)is helping nurse it back to its original health.   </li>
            <li> This is the first product that I have purchased for curly hair that has actually worked well!  </li>
            <li> I then set my hair with curlformers and i cannot believe how soft my hair is!</li>
            <li> I have thin frizzy and dry curly hair, this product is great for that.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a large pharmacy chain last night and used it.</li>
            <li> Nothing special and not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Finding stuff that works on my crazy hair and not leave it frizzy is great.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this one 4 stars is I really don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> I only use this product (at a much lower cost than another brand).  </li>
            <li> and my hair feels soft as silk when I rinse this out.</li>
            <li> Bottom line: it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft, manageable and shiny as Wen.</li>
            <li> Soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> leaves hair soft .</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to fragrances</li>
            <li> I have natural curl</li>
            <li> I went straight back to the store and bought another one so as not to run out.</li>
            <li> It conditions my hair and leaves it so soft.</li>
            <li> I still cant believe how soft my hair is.</li>
            <li> My hair felt really soft,</li>
            <li> so I will try it at least 2 more days</li>
            <li> I wash my hair once a week with my regular sulfate free shampoo (biomega or its a 10) for clarification, and then i use this every other day.</li>
            <li> (there&#x27;s no other word for it) at the soft, silky yet defined curl.</li>
            <li> Any curly haired gal of any sort trust as believe there is no other product out there that will do what this does for you!</li>
            <li> Although I have a lot of it, my hair is basically fine in nature so too much of any hair product leaves it flat and dull.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and not dry at all.</li>
            <li> Similar products to this one are very exepensive (such as no-poo) and do not produce results close to Lisa Rachel.</li>
            <li> use these products about 5 days a week without shampoo, and on the other 2 days I first use a pea-sized dab of shampoo, and then use one of these conditioners.</li>
            <li> My hair felt dry after using it and I also lost more hair than usual.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and following the directions on the bottle, it turned out,</li>
            <li> Love the product but getting tired of the bottles.</li>
            <li> I sleep on satin pillow cases to help keep the frizz down and allow me to wear my hair down for several more days after this process.</li>
            <li> Wash your scalp with it first, rinse, add some from bottom of your down to the ends and clip it up for the rest of your shower.</li>
            <li> My wavy/curly hair tends to be very dry, and even after using a small amount of this as a leave-in conditioner (as per directions on the bottle), I still had to use my regular leave-in to be able to comb through my hair.</li>
            <li> Well, I just loved WEN, but it was so expensive!  </li>
            <li> I am an African American woman who is transitioning from relaxed hair to natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I would like to note that this cleanser is not strong enough to completely elimanate shampoo (nor would I want it to be that strong as it would be harsh on my hair).</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and allows me to use less product in my hair after the shower.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair that is dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Just as good as WEN and way less expensive</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I also use a little of this product in my hand with a little water and lightly touch the ends of my hair, it acts as a&lt;br /&gt;soft setting lotion.</li>
            <li> She has thick, soft (very) curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other argan oil producs, and they don&#x27;t smell anything like this, so it is clearly a fragrance that&#x27;s been added.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a pea size amount rubbed well between my hands and run my fingers throughout my hair, comb it with wide tooth comb and let it dry completely.</li>
            <li> it in for as long as possible</li>
            <li> First of all, I have thick, course african-american hair.  </li>
            <li> Use a Hubalou wrap (a thin absorbent fabric made from bamboo) to very gently wrap my hair and keep water from dripping on the floor, very soon after turn my head upside down and scrunch dry my curls using the same wrap until mostly dry.</li>
            <li> My hair actually feels dry after using product, I had to use a leave in conditioner after using it.</li>
            <li> Then towel dry and put one squirt back on the ends of your hair.  </li>
            <li> After that I either let it air dry the rest of the way or hit it with the diffuser for only a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> I am a black woman with natural coily hair btw.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t do that, I can smell this Barbasol-like stench on my hair all day long and it becomes revolting.</li>
            <li> I had alopecia universal years ago , and have to really be careful of the  the shampoos I use, And I have had no adverse reactions to this.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and curly/wavy.</li>
            <li> However using this every other day allows me to only shampoo once every 1 - 2 weeks without build up.</li>
            <li> I would definitely suggest it to other curly haired people.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was a medical issue and rushed to the doctor, but he couldn&#x27;t find anything wrong after numerous tests, and I wasn&#x27;t going through a stressful period before that could have brought it</li>
            <li> Its really similar to other products  </li>
            <li> My hair has a tendency to be naturally dry and lack shine.</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived with a loose cap and some of the contents had spilled out.</li>
            <li> Because I use a lot, the pump gets annoying quickly and it&#x27;s difficult to get the rest of the product out when I know there is still a lot left before throwing it out, this is an issue with most pump products out there.</li>
            <li> I just simply co-washed with it and added a little afterwards as a leave-in.</li>
            <li> My hair ended up limp and I had to use it every day to avoid looking gross.</li>
            <li> (get your hair wet and leave Lisa Rachel in for about 30 min)&lt;br /&gt;-When rinsing, just rub the product off from your scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> Overall it was too harsh for my hair.  </li>
            <li> But I found, over time, that it really dulls my hair.</li>
            <li> Lisa Rachel tames my frizzy, wavy, thick, shoulder-length virgin hair and keeps it soft without the oily roots.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to grow my hair for years but with conventional shampoos and conditioners it always ended up dry and with split ends</li>
            <li> it hair is thick and well moisturized and required very little in the form of handling thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Other shampoos cause my scalp to itch but not this one.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think for his hair (small afro) he will buy this over a regular drug store product that he can buy for a couple of dollars.</li>
            <li> I can comb it through my wet hair in the shower even!</li>
            <li> it was so frizzy and flat, pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> you literally have to cut the bottle which is no easy feat to get to the last half.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was a little weary of not shampooing but followed the directions to the tee but left it in for a few minutes longer.</li>
            <li> The good news is that the results are equivalent, but the bad news is that I find the fragrance unappealing.</li>
            <li> all i did was put a little in my hair while it was wet</li>
            <li> I just had to buy something because my hair was stiff and dry!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money to return it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is i wish it smelled stronger</li>
            <li> My husband has curly hair and he loves how this product help manage his longer then average curls.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the packaging needs much improvement.</li>
            <li> First off, a PP was right when she said it smelled awful.  </li>
            <li> I have slightly curly hair thats almost down to my waist, usually I wash and condition my hair and then use infusium and dry with my head upside down with a diffuser, I never brush my hair.</li>
            <li> and this was thrown away half used.</li>
            <li> The consistency is a bit less creamy</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m Black with 3a/b hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I end up using a lot of this product since my hair is long and thick, but it works well</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to Devacurl No Poo, that is easier to purchase online, &amp; a little less pricey.</li>
            <li> you have decided to purchase this product, here are a few tips!&lt;br /&gt;-Make</li>
            <li> Ordered a few times.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my hair but make it limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li> A waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Also, the intense chemical smell is really unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to throw out my bottle, so I&#x27;ve found that if I use it, rinse it out, then use a small blob of the Lisa Rachel product with the green label (with tea tree oil)</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t as awful as I expected from some of the reviews, and it kept my wild curls soft and tangle-free.</li>
            <li> I used to use Shea Moisture&#x27;s Raw shea leave in</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical, having tried combination shampoo and conditioners before which left my hair feeling limp and &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My hair has been damaged from bad perms and too much heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product has a strong awful smell and it burned my scalp.  </li>
            <li> but I wanted someting that was a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> When I retire in a few years this will be a treat--likely then I will find a less expensive product.  </li>
            <li> ANYWAY RINSE THE FINAL TIME WITH COLD WATER.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and</li>
            <li> actually this product wasnt too bad.  </li>
            <li> I did some research and was concerned because everything I was reading told me that there was no good substitution for Wen.  </li>
            <li> It is such a savings, however, that I may stick with it and try to mask the smell with another like patchouli or lavender, but I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think it smelled bad, but when I tried to dry my hair</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this product could be a replacement for the expensive Wen 613 product that I have been using as it is significantly less expensive.</li>
            <li> that has always been tough no matter what conditioner I was using.</li>
            <li> I had to unscrew the cap and shake the conditioner (which was very, very thick) onto my hand.</li>
            <li> a broken pump and the shampoo/conditioner was smeared all over the bottle</li>
            <li> This one with argan oil works well enough, but the smell is overpowering and becomes very unpleasant after awhile.</li>
            <li> Though I swear by Deva Curl products, I was looking for an alternative to the expensive No Poo, and I decided to try this.</li>
            <li> My hair is difficult in that I have 3 versions of curly going on at once (with the ensuing frizz factor, of course); and since I don&#x27;t brush my hair except when I wash it, my tangles are really bad.  </li>
            <li> but my daughter has this crazy frizzy wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smelly but nothing too bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that bad!</li>
            <li> but the smell is horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The instructions say to use a ton of this stuff and it doesn&#x27;t work very well. My hair ended up limp and I had to use it every day to avoid looking gross. Also, the intense chemical smell is really unpleasant. It makes a pretty decent shaving cream, so I guess it wasn&#x27;t a total loss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of products over the years for my thick curly hair and this is by far the best. It gives me big, bouncy and well-defined curls that last up to three days before my next wash. It&#x27;s  a lot like WEN but slightly better because it&#x27;s formulated for curly hair... and cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may complain they don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;ve &amp;#34;cleaned&amp;#34; their hair because it doesn&#x27;t foam up, however I&#x27;ve solved this by using Matrix Curl Life Shampoo and then using Lisa Rachel as a conditioner. This way, you don&#x27;t need to rinse out Lisa Rachel all the way, because it seems to work best if you leave some in your hair.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, cleans my hair well (even when I&#x27;ve used a lot of product) doesn&#x27;t over-condition or strip my hair. My hair is naturally wavy but when I use this, I can scrunch it into actual curls.</li>
            <li> I like this because I did notice my curly hair respond better to products (deva curl cream) and my difuser after using it. I also LOVE the Lisa Rachel Avocado/Tea Tree cleanser. The only reason I am giving this one 4 stars is I really don&#x27;t like the smell. It is too perfumy for my taste, although the scent doesn&#x27;t last on my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it for me, I have lots of hair and sometimes very dry and frizzy and this product helps to clean it without overdrawing the hair. I use it for my son as well since is very gentle, smell nice but not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> This product has a strong awful smell and it burned my scalp.  Try instead: Hair One Cucumber Aloe Cleansing Conditioner smells lovely.</li>
            <li> This conditioning shampoo works wonderfully!  My hair is fine and regular conditioners make my hair too flat.  I only use this product (at a much lower cost than another brand).  This works!!</li>
            <li> I still had to use conditioner afterward,  I went back to Suave shampoo and conditioner and this was thrown away half used.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman who is transitioning from relaxed hair to natural hair.  I was in my neighborhood Ross and saw this product.  The only thing I can say is this product is amazing. My hair is so soft and not dry at all. I am excited to find this product on the internet and the price is great. This is a must try...I just sent a bottle to my mother.</li>
            <li> I recently began using no-lather, sulfate free cleansers on my biracial, curly hair. My hair has a tendency to be naturally dry and lack shine. This cleanser helps me replenish both of these and my hair feels soft as silk when I rinse this out. My hair also has moderate heat damage and this product (in combination with others)is helping nurse it back to its original health.   Similar products to this one are very exepensive (such as no-poo) and do not produce results close to Lisa Rachel. I would like to note that this cleanser is not strong enough to completely elimanate shampoo (nor would I want it to be that strong as it would be harsh on my hair). However using this every other day allows me to only shampoo once every 1 - 2 weeks without build up. Give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret!</li>
            <li> I like the Lisa Rachel products. This one with argan oil works well enough, but the smell is overpowering and becomes very unpleasant after awhile. I&#x27;ve used other argan oil producs, and they don&#x27;t smell anything like this, so it is clearly a fragrance that&#x27;s been added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does it smell like? Imagine the company bought a vat of fragrance from a manufacturer of cheap men&#x27;s shaving cream, then added 100x the amount that they needed to a batch of this conditioner. It&#x27;s that bad! I don&#x27;t want to throw out my bottle, so I&#x27;ve found that if I use it, rinse it out, then use a small blob of the Lisa Rachel product with the green label (with tea tree oil), it overrides the smell enough that I can stand it. If I don&#x27;t do that, I can smell this Barbasol-like stench on my hair all day long and it becomes revolting. The tea tree oil version also has a strong smell, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant and seems to work even better on my hair and scalp. I recommend that one instead of this version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these products about 5 days a week without shampoo, and on the other 2 days I first use a pea-sized dab of shampoo, and then use one of these conditioners. My hair seems to stay cleaner, and my scalp is much healthier.</li>
            <li> It makes you scalp feel tingly and clean.  The longer you leave it on the better.  Not such a good idea to leave it in as a conditioner.  Be sure to rinse well.</li>
            <li> Loved this- almost as good as Wen in terms of how my hair felt but much more economical.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this product could be a replacement for the expensive Wen 613 product that I have been using as it is significantly less expensive. The good news is that the results are equivalent, but the bad news is that I find the fragrance unappealing. It is such a savings, however, that I may stick with it and try to mask the smell with another like patchouli or lavender, but I am disappointed. So, the lower rating is just due to the scent, not the results, which are actually good.</li>
            <li> Nothing special and not worth the price. Not WEN quality....If you are looking for a cheaper WEN option (which I did), Try the Pantene Cleansing Conditioner which you can get in your local grocery store, or online...and you can get 4 for the price of one bottle of WEN. I can&#x27;t tell the difference using either product...however, I still use the WEN styling cream, which IMO is what makes my hair the best.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair like me you will love this product! I have been trying to grow my hair for years but with conventional shampoos and conditioners it always ended up dry and with split ends so I had to always cut it! Bummer! I was purchasing a product from my local Sally&#x27;s store it worked really great but I wanted someting that was a little less expensive. I found this product! It smells great and my hair is happy and growing! I LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to find this product at Ross for the convincing price of $5, and I am so glad that I tried it out! The first time I tried the conditioning cleanser, my hair dried into non-frizzy beautiful curls (without gel or any other product!!!) I was hooked, and immediately went back to Ross to purchase the remaining bottles. I am glad that I found this online because I will continue to purchase this miracle product! If you have curly hair, I highly (infact, I insist) that you try this product! It not only makes brings out beautiful natural curls, but also makes hair so much easier to style!&lt;br /&gt;If you have decided to purchase this product, here are a few tips!&lt;br /&gt;-Make sure you use more than enough product (at least seven pumps)&lt;br /&gt;-Leave it in for as long as possible (You could even try a hair mask! (get your hair wet and leave Lisa Rachel in for about 30 min)&lt;br /&gt;-When rinsing, just rub the product off from your scalp. If product remains on the ends of your hair that&#x27;s a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;-Use a couple pumps for a leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> Havent noticed any real benefits here. My hair actually feels dry after using product, I had to use a leave in conditioner after using it.It smells okay.</li>
            <li> Cleans well, but is not a substitute for Wen. Like so many reviewers I find the cost for Wen out of my budget, so looking for a more cost effective product. Others have mentioned the smell, and it does have a strong astringent smell, but I don&#x27;t find it offensive and it dissipates quickly. Bottom line: it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft, manageable and shiny as Wen.</li>
            <li> Very good! Detangles and softens. Also great as a leave in. My curls separate and stay frizz free! Wish it didn&#x27;t have a menthol smell yuck. I&#x27;d otherwise like the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it now about 4 times and not disappointed yet. It&#x27;s so much easier than the shampoo-conditioner-dry hair-compensating with a multitude of hair products routine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixed (black and white) and this stuff works great on my curly hair.  Very moisturizing and allows me to use less product in my hair after the shower. You can even leave some in if you want to wear your hair curly and it helps keep hair smooth. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 61 and have a fair amount of fine hair.  I like this product very much and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a cheaper replacement for Wen but am so impressed!  My hair has gone from stick straight to rather wavy in my older age but my daughter has this crazy frizzy wavy hair.  I thought this may help.  We were not disappointed.  My daughter came out of the shower with smooth manageable hair and no tears when i brushed it for her.  My hair feels great too.  And looks better than it has in ages.  No reason to drop the money on Wen again</li>
            <li> I am new to cowashing.  I have tried Wen and L&#x27;Oreal EverCurl, and this is probably my favorite.  When I retire in a few years this will be a treat--likely then I will find a less expensive product.  But while working I will spoil myself with this.  The keys are:  use enough product, get hair wet with warm water, spread on the head itself (think more of covering the scalp surface), THEN put your head under the shower as someone else said &amp;#34;1.3 seconds&amp;#34; and then &#x27;lather&#x27;(it won&#x27;t be a real lather but that 1.3 second step makes a huge difference in how spread able it is).  Do at the beginning of the shower.  I will do this twice leaving it on through the rest of the shower til the end.  However, some days I feel like washing my hair every day in which case I just do one cowash.  ANYWAY RINSE THE FINAL TIME WITH COLD WATER.  It will come out 5x easier that way.  Then towel dry and put one squirt back on the ends of your hair.  My gray hairs are slowly becoming less gray.  I did not expect that.  Expect complements on your hair!</li>
            <li> Ordered a few times. Great for curly hair. Not so great if you have dandruff.</li>
            <li> I used wen conditioning cleanser before,bbut it cost so much. I like this product, it works almost as well, but I wish it smelled better.</li>
            <li> I have never used wen or this product before. Did not leave my hair any softer than a good conditioning shampoo. I did like the minty tingle  feel on my scalp while shampooing. I thing i will stick to creme of nature shampoo.</li>
            <li> One of the best product I ever used.</li>
            <li> Junk. Hair does t even feel clean</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for eight months now and my hair feels wonderful! I would recomend this product to anyone that has curlly hair, it makes it so much more manageable. (on that note I only use three hair products now)</li>
            <li> I chose this for my daughter.  She has thick, soft (very) curly hair.  It does not &amp;#34;tame&amp;#34; it like I had expected, but it is better than most other cleansing conditioners.  I would consider continuing use of this product, especially since it is a cheaper alternative to Wen.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the best!!! I use it in place of shampoo and it leaves my hair feelings so soft and clean + clean.</li>
            <li> Seems to work just fine.  I&#x27;ve only used it a few times. but I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> This left my hair feeling clean without stripping my hair from its natural oils, it left my scalp feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. My curly hair has never looked this good! Soft and shiny. Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> Love this .....yes it works.....yea it curls, softens and makes your hair look great. It&#x27;s smelly but nothing too bad</li>
            <li> Works just like the pricey ones but you get a better deal.  I wish they had this product in a larger size though.</li>
            <li> conditions hair and cleanses scalp well. leaves hair soft . i love the minty feeling the scalp gets while using it!</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to fragrances and I couldn&#x27;t even use this.</li>
            <li> Good. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell.</li>
            <li> works great, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Rather use Wen, much better</li>
            <li> I have 3b hair and this works well for me. I have never used wen before, but I do like this stuff. Before I started using this product my hair would break and fall out all the time, I was really starting to worry. That has been greatly reduced since I started using this instead of conventional shampoo and conditioner combos. I would definitely suggest it to other curly haired people.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and following the directions on the bottle, it turned out, I actually have cork screw curls, I never knew that! Very good product, leaves hair clean and smelling good. Scalp feels fresh! Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived with a loose cap and some of the contents had spilled out. And then the pump did not work. I had to unscrew the cap and shake the conditioner (which was very, very thick) onto my hand. Not worth the money to return it.</li>
            <li> My mom bought this one a whim when she saw it at the pharmacy. After using it my hair was the softest and shiniest and fullest its been in a while. Not to mention it was completely clean which surprised me since most of these cleansing conditioners tend to leave a residue and don&#x27;t leave me feeling like i have refreshed hair. I will never use another shampoo again! I also have dandruff that was leaving my scalp pretty itchy and even dandruff shampoos werent doing the trick but since this isnt drying I havent been notiving as many flakes and I also havent been itchy. Love itttt!!!!</li>
            <li> Just as good as WEN and way less expensive and you don&#x27;t locked in to a repeat order program!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo because my hair feels clean &amp; soft for more than a day.  Other shampoos cause my scalp to itch but not this one.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have been using a couple of months and it has my hair looking so much better, and my hair has even grown quite a bit since beginning use and appears healthier. I plan to keep using. I had alopecia universal years ago , and have to really be careful of the  the shampoos I use, And I have had no adverse reactions to this.  UPDATE: PLEASE PLEASE start wrapping the bottles in plastic again. The one that arrived this time had the pump fully opened and squirted on my box. the last 2 arrived pumps destroyed. Love the product but getting tired of the bottles. you literally have to cut the bottle which is no easy feat to get to the last half.</li>
            <li> Well, I just loved WEN, but it was so expensive!  I tried other products to replace it, but never was able to find anything that worked as well as WEN.  Till now!  Thanks, Lisa Rachel!</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I have purchased for curly hair that has actually worked well!  I love it!</li>
            <li> Second time that I bought this and the pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Product works well. Would recommend it to others. Thanks!</li>
            <li> First of all, I have thick, course african-american hair.  I no longer perm and I need products that are gentle for my hair.  My hair has been damaged from bad perms and too much heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try this.  I purchased it at the mall for about $10.  I thought I was getting a bargain instead of dishing out a lot of cash for Wen (which I just tried and am liking it).  Anyway, I wanted it to work.  But it had too much menthol in it.  It made my eyes water.  My hair felt dry after using it and I also lost more hair than usual.  It has some protein in it and that may have been the problem for me.  Overall it was too harsh for my hair.  I can use a drug store conditioner and get better results.  I did try it several times and used it different ways.  But I just ended up giving it away.  Not worth losing more hair over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - If you are looking for real results for your hair, try Wen.  I gave this to my son and likes it but I don&#x27;t think for his hair (small afro) he will buy this over a regular drug store product that he can buy for a couple of dollars.</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo for perm and color hair. It the only one that not only makes it easy to comb through but also keeps the volume.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! It works a well as Wen. I notice when I use Wen your hair can still have that \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; hair smell after 2 days but not with this product.</li>
            <li> As a hairstylist, I was hesitant to try a non professional product, but was curious after using Wen and liking that. As a comparison..it&#x27;s every bit as good as Wen. The consistency is a bit less creamy but that doesn&#x27;t defect performance a bit. My hair is full, shiny and not frizzy! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to Devacurl No Poo, that is easier to purchase online, &amp; a little less pricey. I tried the Loreal non-sulfate cleanser &amp; was underwhelmed (it was drying &amp; didn&#x27;t detangle). This product proved a pretty good substitute. Nice scent, creamy &amp; moisturizing, &amp; had good slip. It does have more amodimethicone than Deva, but my long curly 3b hair can live with, as I&#x27;m in a super humid climate. And I really like the round no-tip bottle with the pump.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been captivated by the ads for Wen Hair products and heard that this was extremely similar. Did nothing for my hair but make it limp and lifeless. No curl, no shine, nothing. A waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I like this conditioning cleanser for my short hair that&#x27;s a mixture of curly, wavy, and nearly straight. The smell is very light, with a slight and not unpleasant minty/medicinal smell.My hair feels clean and conditioned. I especially like the way it magically encourages the curl, more than any other cleaning conditioner I&#x27;ve tried so far. This won&#x27;t be my one and only cleaning conditioner, but I do plan to buy more when this bottle gets low.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Wen user for months and I needed a more budget-friendly cowash.  I did some research and was concerned because everything I was reading told me that there was no good substitution for Wen.  I bit the bullet and ordered Lisa Rachel Sulfate Free Conditioner &amp; Cleanser with Argan Oil and I&#x27;m thrilled!!  In my opinion this is a better choice as it moisturizes as well as Wen but rinses out much cleaner (a problem I had with Wen).  Lisa Rachel tames my frizzy, wavy, thick, shoulder-length virgin hair and keeps it soft without the oily roots.</li>
            <li> Great product. I like it just as good as some of the higher priced products. I have natural curl and I color it.&lt;br /&gt;I also use a little of this product in my hand with a little water and lightly touch the ends of my hair, it acts as a&lt;br /&gt;soft setting lotion.</li>
            <li> I end up using a lot of this product since my hair is long and thick, but it works well and my curls have never looked better. Because I use a lot, the pump gets annoying quickly and it&#x27;s difficult to get the rest of the product out when I know there is still a lot left before throwing it out, this is an issue with most pump products out there. General pump mechanics aside, this product is perfect for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My process, every 1-2 times per week: wet hair, sulfate free shampoo my scalp, rinse, use this conditioner on the rest of the length of my hair and detangle with fingers, leave in for the rest of my shower, rinse, turn off water, add a bit more of this conditioner to the length of my hair while still sopping wet. Use a Hubalou wrap (a thin absorbent fabric made from bamboo) to very gently wrap my hair and keep water from dripping on the floor, very soon after turn my head upside down and scrunch dry my curls using the same wrap until mostly dry. After that I either let it air dry the rest of the way or hit it with the diffuser for only a couple of minutes. My result is a ton of body with big frizz free curls. I sleep on satin pillow cases to help keep the frizz down and allow me to wear my hair down for several more days after this process.</li>
            <li> First off, a PP was right when she said it smelled awful.  It really does stink of cheap men&#x27;s cologne... Strong, and cheap.  Thankfully the smell fades pretty quickly!&lt;br /&gt;Second, it doesn&#x27;t clean as well as Wen, but it does get the job done.  My hair didn&#x27;t feel stripped...but it didn&#x27;t feel squeaky clean either...more clean, but a bit gooey.&lt;br /&gt;Third, you Will need to condition after using this...which is not the case with Wen.  This cleanser had some great slip, and I was able to detangle fairly easily with it, but my hair didn&#x27;t feel right until I used some Aussie Moist.  (I&#x27;m Black with 3a/b hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict:  I&#x27;m not a fan, and will not buy again.  It&#x27;s not Bad...I&#x27;ve just used better (Wen, Deva-Curl No Poo).  I&#x27;ll use the rest of the bottle on my boys hair.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  My hair is difficult in that I have 3 versions of curly going on at once (with the ensuing frizz factor, of course); and since I don&#x27;t brush my hair except when I wash it, my tangles are really bad.  I find this product not only cleans my hairs, but leaves it super manageable and soft -- and doesn&#x27;t strip my color! And since I travel quite a bit, I find it very handy that I need only 1 bottle for my haircare.  It works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;So good. So happy with this product. I have thick wavy hair and it hair is thick and well moisturized and required very little in the form of handling thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen for several years and like many others am trying to find a cheaper alternative since they continue to raise their prices and are now too expensive to buy.  This stuff works pretty well but the smell is horrible. Very overpowering.</li>
            <li> I originally picked up Lisa Rachel at a discount store, having been attracted to the argan oil promise. I was quite skeptical, having tried combination shampoo and conditioners before which left my hair feeling limp and &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;. Although I have a lot of it, my hair is basically fine in nature so too much of any hair product leaves it flat and dull. I was amazed (there&#x27;s no other word for it) at the soft, silky yet defined curl. Even my hairdresser remarked that my tresses felt healthier and I&#x27;d only been using the product for a short while. I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle so looks like a winning combination for me. Sulfate free is a nice bonus, too, for those looking for a more natural hair product.</li>
            <li> I really liked this at first, I even reordered it. But I found, over time, that it really dulls my hair. This is the only cream hair cleanser I&#x27;ve ever tried and, once I got used to it, I liked the concept. I don&#x27;t know if others have this same effect or not. I gave away the full bottle I had left and already see an improvement in the shine of my hair. I would not recommend</li>
            <li> I love this product and the price and have already ordered it again. Will continue to for ever!! Hope you never stop making this product, its fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> Like many who buy this, I was looking for an affordable variation of the Wen cleansing conditioners, which I just can&#x27;t make myself spend so much money on. I saw this product, and it was affordable enough to try. It worked OK for me - using it was pleasant and convenient, it smelled fine and my hair ended up clean and somewhat conditioned. My wavy/curly hair tends to be very dry, and even after using a small amount of this as a leave-in conditioner (as per directions on the bottle), I still had to use my regular leave-in to be able to comb through my hair. So I&#x27;m still looking for affordable perfection...</li>
            <li> I switched to this product after using Wen for 2 years.  It seems to rinse out better and leaves my curls clean and bouncy!</li>
            <li> Pump didn&#x27;t work and is faulty.  I ordered two bottles and both of them had a pump that didn&#x27;t work.  Product works fine and leaves the hair in nice condition.  Makes it easy to detangle.</li>
            <li> I have hair that&#x27;s both curly and wavy, and all frizz. Getting away from sulfates have helped so much, and this is product lasts a long time and is a great price :)</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair that is dry and brittle. Lisa Rachel sulfate free with argon oil conditions my hair very well! I order this product all the time and never had any shipping order problems so that&#x27;s a plus! The only problem I do have is the container! The pump doesn&#x27;t work very well! I end up removing it and have to fight to get the conditioner out if the bottle! Hope they consider redesigning the bottle to a squeeze so it&#x27;s easy to come out!</li>
            <li> was using Wen and switched to this.I like this product BETTER.what a surprise as it is cheaper also.I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This works great, leaves my wavy hair looking and feeling terrific. I recommend this to anybody looking for new products.</li>
            <li> Though I swear by Deva Curl products, I was looking for an alternative to the expensive No Poo, and I decided to try this. I was experienced in the proper use of a cleansing conditioner, and I read the reviews for suggestions on using it that might differ what I was used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first several uses were fine, and the result was okay, probably because I used it with my usual DevaCurl One Condition. The smell wasn&#x27;t as awful as I expected from some of the reviews, and it kept my wild curls soft and tangle-free. Then suddenly I started noticing an increase of hair building up in the shower drain. Next, my boyfriend commented that I needed to keep my hair up because my hair was falling out all over the house. I was mortified. At first, I thought it was a medical issue and rushed to the doctor, but he couldn&#x27;t find anything wrong after numerous tests, and I wasn&#x27;t going through a stressful period before that could have brought it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t suspect the product until I had run out and my mother bought me the [[ASIN:B000NE6QP6 Deva Curl No Poo 32oz,Zero Lather Conditioning Cleanser]]Once I started using that product again, my hair stopped falling out instantly. The shower drain was no longer clogged, and my hair wasn&#x27;t falling out all around the house anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I had a faulty product, I can&#x27;t be sure, but I know for a fact that I will never use it again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works good for my curly hair. I wash my hair once a week with my regular sulfate free shampoo (biomega or its a 10) for clarification, and then i use this every other day. My only complaint is i wish it smelled stronger so i added lemon and lavender essential oils to help perfect that. Tip: lemon EO is great for curly hair. It activates the curl and smells fresh and clean. Try it in you favorite products. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Looooooove this! Have purchased my second bottle. Was using wen but found it to be way overpriced once I tried this! Wash your scalp with it first, rinse, add some from bottom of your down to the ends and clip it up for the rest of your shower. I use a pea size amount rubbed well between my hands and run my fingers throughout my hair, comb it with wide tooth comb and let it dry completely. Then I can kinda pick apart the curls and fluff it out a little.no more frizz!</li>
            <li> OMG  all i did was put a little in my hair while it was wet and it became soo curly and detangled my hair w.o me even combing it. I am transitioning and this is amazing</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo/ cleaner. It gets my hair clean and soft and bouncy.  My husband has curly hair and he loves how this product help manage his longer then average curls.</li>
            <li> So, I have been doing the whole &amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34; method for about six months: co-washing, no sulfates, silicones, etc. etc. I even bought two microfiber towels to aide in the drying time. It took a while for me to perfect the whole routine, but I finally found a conditioner that I like and a sulfate/silicone free shampoo. Things were going along swimmingly, then I see this conditioning cleanser from Lisa Rachel for curly hair. Hmm. Well, being a product junky, I had to give it a try. My hair was so soft after the first use. I have NEVER been able to not use a conditioner. This stuff is wonderful! I can comb it through my wet hair in the shower even! that has always been tough no matter what conditioner I was using. My hair is long and curly/wavy. I have read the reviews that compare this stuff to Wen, which I have never tried, so I can&#x27;t compare. But, the price was great, so it made it even better. I went straight back to the store and bought another one so as not to run out. I am completely impressed with this product. Finding stuff that works on my crazy hair and not leave it frizzy is great. Fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> I have thin frizzy and dry curly hair, this product is great for that. I can wash my hair more often (everyday) without my hair stripping.</li>
            <li> Good product at great price. Unfortunately, the packaging needs much improvement. When my product arrived it had a broken pump and the shampoo/conditioner was smeared all over the bottle and it had seeped through to the outside package.</li>
            <li> Works well, and smells good. Its really similar to other products  that are sulfate free. I don&#x27;t think  I would buy again. I think I will stick with the wen.</li>
            <li> Another good product by Irene Gari Lisa Rachel! It&#x27;s so nice and creamy. It conditions my hair and leaves it so soft. It also has such a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a large pharmacy chain last night and used it. I just had to buy something because my hair was stiff and dry! I am a black woman with natural coily hair btw. I had to look for this on Amazon just to let yall know this conditioner is THE BUSINESS! I didnt pre-poo or anything. I just simply co-washed with it and added a little afterwards as a leave-in. I then set my hair with curlformers and i cannot believe how soft my hair is! This is the reason why I am a product junkie. There is always something out there that is magnificent for you and some that wont do a damn thing. This product is it for me! I cant stop touching my hair. I used to use Shea Moisture&#x27;s Raw shea leave in but it did nothing for me. I still cant believe how soft my hair is.</li>
            <li> actually this product wasnt too bad.  Ii just wish I could have found a deep conditioner, hair masque to go with it.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend it?  maybe&lt;br /&gt;would i buy it again? probably not</li>
            <li> This stopped pumping after a couple weeks. The product was just too think. I am not sure if I really even liked how it was on my hair either.</li>
            <li> I found this after ordering Hair One from Amazon in a Ross store for about $4. I have never used a conditioning cleanser before and am just switching to a sulfate free product. I have to admit I was a little weary of not shampooing but followed the directions to the tee but left it in for a few minutes longer. I have slightly curly hair thats almost down to my waist, usually I wash and condition my hair and then use infusium and dry with my head upside down with a diffuser, I never brush my hair. I will say this product was easy to get through my hair, it seemed to me my hair looked shinier then normal, but I did notice more hair in the drain then usual which was concerning, after rinsing it out and squeezing it dry I used one pump of the product and worked it in. My hair felt really soft, my scalp tingly and I didn&#x27;t think it smelled bad, but when I tried to dry my hair it was so frizzy and flat, pretty disappointing. I realize that one needs to give hair time to adjust to a new product so I will try it at least 2 more days but my hair is really frizzy and I&#x27;m not liking it at all. I will say I have been using Infusium for about 25 years so maybe not using it has freaked my hair out so maybe I just need time.</li>
            <li> Love it, my extremely curly hair (corkscrew curls) has never been happier.</li>
            <li> Definitely comparable to WEN with better scents and price!!! Any curly haired gal of any sort trust as believe there is no other product out there that will do what this does for you! It&#x27;s a shampoo/conditioner/leave-in-treatment/style cream all in one!!!! Love, Love, Love!</li>
