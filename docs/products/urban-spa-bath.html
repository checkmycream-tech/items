    <ol>
            <li>It scrubs/exfoliates great!</li>
            <li>Excellent mitt.</li>
            <li>the texture of this item is wonderful, exfoliates well but not too harshly&lt;</li>
            <li>I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It fits great on my hands and you can tuck the soap underneath for continuous bathing.</li>
            <li>despite those two things it&#x27;s still a great product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like an awesome bumpy washcloth, but in a handy mitt shape, with a loop for hanging and drying.</li>
            <li>I  use it about once a week, and it works great.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a bath mitt with a loop on it, and this looked great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great way to wake up in the morning, or relax after a stressful day.</li>
            <li>Great glove.  </li>
            <li>Great feel to it as well</li>
            <li>It does not scratch the skin off but yet still allows for good friction to the surface of skin.</li>
            <li>I use to use all kind of skin exfoliators made with oil and sugar or oats, now I save money using just the mitts.  </li>
            <li>I love this mitt.</li>
            <li>One thing you must expect is you WILL NOT get a lot of suds, so if you love suds you won&#x27;t get it from this mitt.  </li>
            <li>Will be buying more of these.  </li>
            <li>I love this bath mitt.  </li>
            <li>The only way to understand how wonderful this bath mitt is - use it and you will know.</li>
            <li>no matter how many times you wash it.</li>
            <li>glad I bought it</li>
            <li>bath mitt is great and it is very well made.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin amazingly clean!</li>
            <li>and he likes it just fine</li>
            <li>Because if it weren&#x27;t for the odd smell, I&#x27;d be perfectly happy with it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to lather up and the gentle texture really makes you feel clean when you pop out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Dries quickly and holds soap lather well.</li>
            <li>I love this mitt so much I bought two!  </li>
            <li>They really do a great job getting the dry flakey skin off your body.  </li>
            <li>I bought some for my Mother&#x27;s very dry skin and she loves the mitt(s)especially how nice her skin is becoming.  </li>
            <li>A bit rough but still good.</li>
            <li>My shower gel went right through it to the palm of my hand and stayed there.</li>
            <li>I could go 3-4 months without tossing it in the washer if I really wanted to!</li>
            <li>I first found them at Walgreens, but they no longer sell them.  </li>
            <li>Just the right amount of exfoliation for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>This Bath mitt works very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>I really like this mitt.</li>
            <li>It appears to be very well made.  </li>
            <li>This is much tougher a sensation than either of those.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t made much use of it.</li>
            <li>This wins out over the other two due to how non-damaging it is on the skin while still allowing for a nice, powerful buff.</li>
            <li>I have bought two other pricey bath mitts, both having more friction power than this one.</li>
            <li>My old ones were finally getting beat, I found this mitt on Amazon and this mitt is better than my old ones I bought in a drug store.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I had been using an old one that was made of terry cloth, and did not realize how much rougher this would feel on my skin.  </li>
            <li>before I dry off, my skin is really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I will repurchase when I need a new one.</li>
            <li>No better way to remove dead skin - easy to use and will buy more</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin clean and soft, and it washes extremely well.</li>
            <li>Works well, but still something a little more coarse to scrub the skin.</li>
            <li>I take the extra precaution of putting it in a lingerie bag before I put it in the washing machine though, and it comes out looking brand new after it air dries.</li>
            <li>(it certainly doesn&#x27;t stay wet).</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry desert, and my bathroom is well ventilated</li>

They really do a great job getting the dry flakey skin off your body.  I bought some for my Mother&#x27;s very dry skin and she loves the mitt(s)especially how nice her skin is becoming.

I use to use all kind of skin exfoliators made with oil and sugar or oats, now I save money using just the mitts.  After I shower I use coco butter oil before I dry off, my skin is really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my father, some one had give him some mitt a while back and i was in search for the same one but no luck however i got him this one and he likes it just fine</li>
            <li> I used my spa mitt several times in the shower; it worked well but after about a week of use it seemed to acquire a mildew-y smell from it. I&#x27;m not sure why this is the case, considering I wring it and air dry it every day; it also gets laundered weekly. When I use it in the morning, it is completely dry from the previous day&#x27;s use. I live in a very dry desert, and my bathroom is well ventilated so there&#x27;s no reason it should be developing such a smell (it certainly doesn&#x27;t stay wet). I had been using a similar fabric spa mitt for 6 years before purchasing this one, and I never had problems with any bad smell from it - I could go 3-4 months without tossing it in the washer if I really wanted to! I won&#x27;t be buying this mitt again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why three stars? Because if it weren&#x27;t for the odd smell, I&#x27;d be perfectly happy with it! It scrubs/exfoliates great!</li>
            <li> Great product. I use this for my face and shoulders. I will repurchase when I need a new one.</li>
            <li> not tough/rough enpough</li>
            <li> Very small. Like child size.</li>
            <li> Putting it simply, Dead Skin Gone!  No better way to remove dead skin - easy to use and will buy more</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mitt that I could slip on my hand and use.  This is it!  Just put on my mitt, gel up and voila!&lt;br /&gt;Ready to go.  Will be buying more of these.  5 stars</li>
            <li> This Bath mitt works very well.  I actually use a bar soap (Dove) and then put my hand inside the mitt with the soap and it works well this way.  I can get lots of suds for a thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> Works well, but still something a little more coarse to scrub the skin.</li>
            <li> I love this bath mitt.  I first found them at Walgreens, but they no longer sell them.  Thanks to Amazon I have found them again!!!  It fits great on my hands and you can tuck the soap underneath for continuous bathing.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of exfoliation for sensitive skin!</li>

            <li> the texture of this item is wonderful, exfoliates well but not too harshly&lt;br /&gt;well made&lt;br /&gt;so glad I bought it</li>
            <li> I really like this mitt. It is durable. It does not scratch the skin off but yet still allows for good friction to the surface of skin. It&#x27;s like an awesome bumpy washcloth, but in a handy mitt shape, with a loop for hanging and drying. I have bought two other pricey bath mitts, both having more friction power than this one.

            <li> I am very happy with it. I don&#x27;t have flaking and peeling skin anymore since using this. I  use it about once a week, and it works great.</li>
