            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product 4-5 times and honestly I don&#x27;t see the difference afterwards.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not life changing, nor is it a miracle worker but it feels nice on my face and it does what it claims.</li>

            <li>Buy it if your skin is very strong.</li>

            <li>If it was thicker it would work better.</li>
            <li>I give this product five stars because it is a proven favorite.  </li>
            <li>I would say if you have more problem skin to try the Mint Julep.</li>
            <li>I love the Queen Helene products as it is</li>
            <li>love love love it....</li>
            <li>It makes your face extremely smooth and nice.</li>

            <li>I love them all.</li>
            <li>Love love  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The scent of this mask is incredibly strong but I love the way it feels and makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>The clay mask itself works okay, but I had to stop using it because the perfume/fragrance used is just so strong.</li>
            <li>This is such an exceptional product that I can&#x27;t imagine anyone paying more for something that probably is not as good as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The OLIVE Oil is the BEST Mask Ever for dry skin!</li>
            <li>The mud pack is great, but for people with sensitive skin, don&#x27;t let the application burn bother you.</li>
            <li>Love the smooth feeling my skin had after using...</li>
            <li>But for the most part I really enjoy using this masque.</li>
            <li>This is quite drying, so I advise a good moisturizer after unless you have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, good price and quality product.</li>
            <li>I have tried alot of products and so far this is my favorite mud mask!!  </li>
            <li>I love the way the mud  tighten my face, and leaves my face clean .</li>
            <li>but it has a STRONG floral scent.</li>
            <li>Your face will be just fine.</li>
            <li>and  it helped  my fine lines under my eyes go away after using it for 4 weeks .</li>
            <li>then this is fine.</li>
            <li>My skin was smooth and non-redness.  </li>
            <li>This one is light, smells alright and works well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why they no longer sell it in the stores but leave it to good old amazon to have it in stock.</li>
            <li>I would stay clear of this product if you don&#x27;t like a strong rose, witch hazely scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never bought this in the jar but am so glad I did - much easier to use!  </li>
            <li>I put the mask on at night to give my face a clean wash</li>
            <li>Nice and plump and soft!</li>
            <li>This product is tried and true - I always see a significant improvement in tone, firmness and my pores when I use this and it lasts for days.  </li>
            <li>I have always loved this product and my local Walgreen&#x27;s and CVS</li>
            <li>This mask is absolute magic.</li>
            <li>My skin was soft and supple and had a fresh rosey kind of scent after I washed it off.</li>
            <li>The price cannot be beat and it does the trick for a quickly int he morning.</li>
            <li>Its lots of fun though.</li>
            <li>Now my skin is old and wrinkled, but it still looks and feels better after a mud masque.  </li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it highly unless you find perfumes and strong scents intolerable.</li>
            <li>and i noticed a difference right after i took it off.  </li>
            <li>it does what it says hubby &amp;&amp; i use twice a week &amp;&amp; fresh clean skin highly recommend A+++</li>
            <li>Does make my face feel a bit dry afterwards, but I can see it pulling the oil out of my clogged pores, so that is nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also increased my water &amp; vegetable intake, get as much exercise as possible (because sweating helps cleanse the pores), avoiding touching my face all the time, washing my pillow cases once a week, exposure to sunlight and keeping my hair clean.</li>
            <li>TRY IT FOR YOUSELF TO KNOW IF IT WORKS FOR YOU, EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT :-)</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>Help my face stay clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>Love it.it helps my face alots and makes me look younger....</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this mud mask off and on for many years- and have recently re-discovered it.  </li>
            <li>This mud pack masque really works!  </li>
            <li>Very fun for sleepovers and make over parties, even my little brothers enjoyed it after some talking in to</li>
            <li>It does what it claims- leaves your skin soft and clean-</li>
            <li>I love it, makes the skin feel clean and firm again.  </li>
            <li>This mask is great for reviving tired skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know whether the whole concept is valid, but this is a clay formulation, and after a shower,</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell that it does a lot for my skin though.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t tingle as much as the Mint Julep (for all you Queen Helene enthusiasts), but it does feel like its clearing out my pores.</li>
            <li>It started to burn so much</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very affordable.  </li>
            <li>This mud mask is gentle, cleans pores, reduce blemishes and dries in a reasonable 10 minutes (whereas some masks take up to 20-30 minutes.)  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and have problems controlling it.</li>
            <li>and I found it didn&#x27;t really do much for my skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast delivery.</li>
            <li>&amp; my hubby loves it as well it really does work</li>
            <li>I love to give myself a quick facial every other day to keep my skin looking refreshed and this does the trick.</li>
            <li>and I own quite a few of them!</li>
            <li>It has an odd smell to it but other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used products that cost so much more and delivered so much less.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t irritate it, so if you just want a mud mask to relax and enjoy (it does dry and crack,</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Really unfortunate that they had to add fragrance, because otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>In just one week I saw a reduction in my facial fine lines and my pores are actually smaller.</li>
            <li>Oh, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the packaging, the jar is perfect because then you can get all your money&#x27;s worth from the jar and not let one ounce go to waste!</li>
            <li>Though after using it several times, I don&#x27;t really see much improvement for my skin.</li>
            <li>However it is heavily perfumed, and those who are sensitive to flowery smells will not be able to use it.</li>
            <li>I did my first at home facial.  </li>
            <li>first time using this and will not be the last!</li>
            <li>I used to get my facials done in Jamaica, and at the end of each facial, they would use this exact product.</li>
            <li>I have tried it only once so far &amp; noticed a difference in my skin straight away!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it especially for large pores on the face, it makes a difference in how your skin feels and looks.  </li>
            <li>I just got it and and used it once so far</li>
            <li>and it wasnt with this product so far.  </li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>Turns out, you can&#x27;t just just do a regular face wash and then apply this masque, you have to go the whole 9 yards.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize I had sensitive skin until I used this product.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination-type skin and saw immediate benefit from using this product.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit funky but other than that worked on my blackheads after the first try!</li>
            <li>so it didnt dry it out, it made it just right to have for bare faced women.</li>
            <li>Seriously,  this product is worthwhile and I recommend it.</li>
            <li>A large jar, big and enough.</li>
            <li>live in mortal fear of a fire in the house with me naked as a jay bird,</li>
            <li>This stuff really works, it helps my face stay non-oily and helps dry out pimples.  </li>
            <li>I had been looking for this in the stores for the past few years and could not find it; I used it when I was young and still had nice skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only have the pleasure of using this product once, but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>Since this is a natural earth, mud masque, I keep my product usage as natural and simple as possible.</li>
            <li>My skin felt so soft after only using this mask once!</li>
            <li>It burns my sensitive skin for the first few minutes, however, my face does feel and look smoother and softer afterwards.</li>
            <li>This did not dry out my face or cause me to break out, but it didnt seem to have any benefits either.</li>
            <li>They should stop watering it down too much and packaging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if its from the product or if its because im going through winter right now with below zero temps and that causes problems for me as well.</li>
            <li>First, I rinse my face (twice) with African Natural Black Soap, then I search for any little blackheads poking themselves out for the day, then I apply this facial masque and finally, apply Vitamin E oil, and a natural Facial Moisturizer (St. Ives to be exact).&lt;br /&gt;I will warn however, that like every facial product, it&#x27;s not just what you put in the skin, it&#x27;s what you do to your entire body.</li>

            <li> I would stay clear of this product if you don&#x27;t like a strong rose, witch hazely scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought this in the jar but am so glad I did - much easier to use!  </li>
            <li> I put the mask on at night to give my face a clean wash</li>
            <li> Nice and plump and soft!</li>
            <li> This product is tried and true - I always see a significant improvement in tone, firmness and my pores when I use this and it lasts for days.  </li>
            <li> I have always loved this product and my local Walgreen&#x27;s and CVS</li>
            <li> This mask is absolute magic.</li>
            <li> My skin was soft and supple and had a fresh rosey kind of scent after I washed it off.</li>
            <li> The price cannot be beat and it does the trick for a quickly int he morning.</li>
            <li> Its lots of fun though.</li>
            <li> Now my skin is old and wrinkled, but it still looks and feels better after a mud masque.  </li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it highly unless you find perfumes and strong scents intolerable.</li>
            <li> and i noticed a difference right after i took it off.  </li>
            <li> it does what it says hubby &amp;&amp; i use twice a week &amp;&amp; fresh clean skin highly recommend A+++</li>
            <li> Does make my face feel a bit dry afterwards, but I can see it pulling the oil out of my clogged pores, so that is nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also increased my water &amp; vegetable intake, get as much exercise as possible (because sweating helps cleanse the pores), avoiding touching my face all the time, washing my pillow cases once a week, exposure to sunlight and keeping my hair clean.</li>
            <li> TRY IT FOR YOUSELF TO KNOW IF IT WORKS FOR YOU, EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT :-)</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> Help my face stay clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love it.it helps my face alots and makes me look younger....</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this mud mask off and on for many years- and have recently re-discovered it.  </li>
            <li> This mud pack masque really works!  </li>
            <li> Very fun for sleepovers and make over parties, even my little brothers enjoyed it after some talking in to</li>
            <li> It does what it claims- leaves your skin soft and clean-</li>
            <li> I love it, makes the skin feel clean and firm again.  </li>
            <li> This mask is great for reviving tired skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether the whole concept is valid, but this is a clay formulation, and after a shower,</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell that it does a lot for my skin though.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t tingle as much as the Mint Julep (for all you Queen Helene enthusiasts), but it does feel like its clearing out my pores.</li>
            <li> It started to burn so much</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very affordable.  </li>
            <li> This mud mask is gentle, cleans pores, reduce blemishes and dries in a reasonable 10 minutes (whereas some masks take up to 20-30 minutes.)  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and have problems controlling it.</li>
            <li> and I found it didn&#x27;t really do much for my skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the fast delivery.</li>
            <li> &amp; my hubby loves it as well it really does work</li>
            <li> I love to give myself a quick facial every other day to keep my skin looking refreshed and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> and I own quite a few of them!</li>
            <li> It has an odd smell to it but other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used products that cost so much more and delivered so much less.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t irritate it, so if you just want a mud mask to relax and enjoy (it does dry and crack,</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Really unfortunate that they had to add fragrance, because otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> In just one week I saw a reduction in my facial fine lines and my pores are actually smaller.</li>
            <li> Oh, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the packaging, the jar is perfect because then you can get all your money&#x27;s worth from the jar and not let one ounce go to waste!</li>
            <li> Though after using it several times, I don&#x27;t really see much improvement for my skin.</li>
            <li> However it is heavily perfumed, and those who are sensitive to flowery smells will not be able to use it.</li>
            <li> I did my first at home facial.  </li>
            <li> first time using this and will not be the last!</li>
            <li> I used to get my facials done in Jamaica, and at the end of each facial, they would use this exact product.</li>
            <li> I have tried it only once so far &amp; noticed a difference in my skin straight away!</li>
            <li> I would recommend it especially for large pores on the face, it makes a difference in how your skin feels and looks.  </li>
            <li> I just got it and and used it once so far</li>
            <li> and it wasnt with this product so far.  </li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> Turns out, you can&#x27;t just just do a regular face wash and then apply this masque, you have to go the whole 9 yards.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I had sensitive skin until I used this product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination-type skin and saw immediate benefit from using this product.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit funky but other than that worked on my blackheads after the first try!</li>
            <li> so it didnt dry it out, it made it just right to have for bare faced women.</li>
            <li> Seriously,  this product is worthwhile and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> A large jar, big and enough.</li>
            <li> live in mortal fear of a fire in the house with me naked as a jay bird,</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, it helps my face stay non-oily and helps dry out pimples.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for this in the stores for the past few years and could not find it; I used it when I was young and still had nice skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only have the pleasure of using this product once, but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> Since this is a natural earth, mud masque, I keep my product usage as natural and simple as possible.</li>
            <li> My skin felt so soft after only using this mask once!</li>
            <li> It burns my sensitive skin for the first few minutes, however, my face does feel and look smoother and softer afterwards.</li>
            <li> This did not dry out my face or cause me to break out, but it didnt seem to have any benefits either.</li>
            <li> They should stop watering it down too much and packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its from the product or if its because im going through winter right now with below zero temps and that causes problems for me as well.</li>
            <li> First, I rinse my face (twice) with African Natural Black Soap, then I search for any little blackheads poking themselves out for the day, then I apply this facial masque and finally, apply Vitamin E oil, and a natural Facial Moisturizer (St. Ives to be exact).&lt;br /&gt;I will warn however, that like every facial product, it&#x27;s not just what you put in the skin, it&#x27;s what you do to your entire body.</li>
            <li> the price, you get a lot and it will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have tried other similar products, that were more expensive, but this one is a winner!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not much different than any other mask I have tried</li>
            <li> Also, i did notice that when i took it off i could see how dry my skin was.  </li>
            <li> both on into completely dry ) do this for about 3 days guarantee you&#x27;ll see a difference</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not like a wet mud mask you might get at a spa)</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensative skin</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it every day or every other day, might irritate your face.</li>
            <li> First of all , I got the wrong masque</li>
            <li> I was extremely disaponted</li>
            <li> Overall it is a nice \\&quot;mud mask\\&quot; just for the sake of giving you and your friends something to do on a boring night.</li>
            <li> A jug of clay should not be expensive, and this product is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I combat this by using this product every other day, so that my skin can continuously be rid of crud!</li>
            <li> it helped to relieve my dry skin and a few small pimples on my face and neck!</li>
            <li> The application is thick and that makes it hard to get a \\&quot;thin even layer\\&quot; around your whole face.</li>
            <li> I have used this as a masque quite a few times now.</li>
            <li> I read that a few reviewers didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> For $10.00 you really can&#x27;t go wrong with simply just trying it out.  </li>
            <li> So when I came to the US, and didn&#x27;t get the same result, I couldn&#x27;t figure out what went wrong.</li>
            <li> Then I waited just a few days too late to return it.</li>
            <li> ALSO REMEMEBER NOT TO SAY ANYTHING NEGATIVE ON ANYONES REVIEWS.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I looked like I was 15 again.  </li>
            <li> This product gave me a serious rash.</li>
            <li> This mask rids my skin of oil and helps to open my pores (to get rid of the bad stuff), and then close them once the mask is removed.</li>
            <li> This mask helps to pull oil and other bad stuff to the surface, so after this you may get a break out or two.</li>
            <li> I WILL TAKE IT THE WRONG WAY.</li>
            <li> I purchased this randomly and thought i&#x27;d try it since i&#x27;ve never tried any prodcuts made with a type of clay.  </li>
            <li> I was really afraid that I had done some damage to may face.</li>
            <li> I was even afraid to look at my face afterwards but thankfully no damage (outwardly) was seen.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> YES I USED IT. WORKS GREAT. TRY IT FOR YOUSELF TO KNOW IF IT WORKS FOR YOU, EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT :-) HAVE A GREAT DAY. ALSO REMEMEBER NOT TO SAY ANYTHING NEGATIVE ON ANYONES REVIEWS. I WILL TAKE IT THE WRONG WAY. HAVE A GREAT DAY :-)</li>
            <li> Good and cheap for a mask but it has a STRONG floral scent. Think grandma going to church. I would suggest the mint julip mask over this, that one is like spreading Scope over your face. Much better experience. lol</li>
            <li> I love it, makes the skin feel clean and firm again.  I would recommend it especially for large pores on the face, it makes a difference in how your skin feels and looks.  Will order it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this randomly and thought i&#x27;d try it since i&#x27;ve never tried any prodcuts made with a type of clay.  I must say that i believe im going to love this product.  I just got it and and used it once so far and i noticed a difference right after i took it off.  My skin was smooth and non-redness.  I have extremely sensative skin so when i use store bought products my skin is extremely red afterwards and it wasnt with this product so far.  Also to my surprise it has a nice smell to it as well.  For $10.00 you really can&#x27;t go wrong with simply just trying it out.  Also, i did notice that when i took it off i could see how dry my skin was.  I&#x27;m not sure if its from the product or if its because im going through winter right now with below zero temps and that causes problems for me as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this masque for years, it is visibly firming, and add nice glow and tone to the skin.  I have tried other similar products, that were more expensive, but this one is a winner!</li>
            <li> This mask is great for reviving tired skin. It has a nice cooling effect and makes your skin feel great!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Does make my face feel a bit dry afterwards, but I can see it pulling the oil out of my clogged pores, so that is nice.</li>
            <li> I did my first at home facial.  I applied the mask and got an immediate tingle but not enough to annoy me.  It subsided after a minute and started to harden and I removed it after 10 minutes and my skin felt renewed.  I also have the mint julip which I havent used yet.  This mask smells great too.  I will use this as part of my facial regiman.</li>
            <li> If u girls want great skin this masque is the best.i ben useing it for 15 yr+ and will never stop.the stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I love this masque! I noticed a difference after the first use. Makes my skin tighter and refreshed. I use it about once or twice a week for about a month now and my skin looks and feels so much better! Thank you Queen Helene!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for awhile and this is a great product.  This purchase has been the best value I have found yet.</li>
            <li> Did not see a difference at all after using it and it stains any wash cloth you might use to remove it!  Threw it away after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> The mud pack is great, but for people with sensitive skin, don&#x27;t let the application burn bother you. Your face will be just fine. It appears to refresh your pores and exfoliates your face. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it every day or every other day, might irritate your face. My sister loves it.</li>
            <li> What is a mud mask?  Its supposed to be comprised of various clays that remove the impurities from the skin.  I don&#x27;t know whether the whole concept is valid, but this is a clay formulation, and after a shower, taking 30 minutes or so to relax with this on one&#x27;s face is very enjoyable.  A jug of clay should not be expensive, and this product is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have use mud pack masque off and on for many years .The mud detox&#x27;s my skin,  and  it helped  my fine lines under my eyes go away after using it for 4 weeks . I love the way the mud  tighten my face, and leaves my face clean . I will always use it .This is a good product . wow</li>
            <li> I do lots of masks and use this one spayingly as it is quite drying. Its lots of fun though. The OLIVE Oil is the BEST Mask Ever for dry skin! I use this then wash well then use olive oil mask by queen helene and face looks awesome. Nice and plump and soft!</li>
            <li> Love the smooth feeling my skin had after using...first time using this and will not be the last!</li>
            <li> The scent of this mask is incredibly strong but I love the way it feels and makes my skin feel. I&#x27;d recommend it highly unless you find perfumes and strong scents intolerable.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, it helps my face stay non-oily and helps dry out pimples.  Help my face stay clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used this as a masque quite a few times now. It feels good while it is drying and has a tingling effect. I can&#x27;t really tell that it does a lot for my skin though. I think it tightens some, but not a lot.</li>
            <li> A large jar, big and enough. But it&#x27;s not for my skin, my face got itch and red after using it. Buy it if your skin is very strong.</li>
            <li> this product is just as awesome now as it was 60 years ago.  Can&#x27;t change what has always worked.  Your pores will be smaller and skin smoother</li>
            <li> This product is a staple n my household. It has somewhat of a rosy smell to it which I find pleasant. I prefer this over the mint julep mask for regular usage but use the mint julep one if I ever happen to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you get a lot and it will last you a very long time. I use it 2 times a week and the jar has lasted about 6-7 months.</li>
            <li> My skin was especially smoother after rinse. The smell is a bit funky but other than that worked on my blackheads after the first try!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and needed.  Thanks - great product.</li>
            <li> If it was thicker it would work better. They should stop watering it down too much and packaging. Stop being stingy with the actual product. It used to work great</li>
            <li> It burns my sensitive skin for the first few minutes, however, my face does feel and look smoother and softer afterwards.</li>
            <li> I give this product five stars because it is a proven favorite.  I used it years ago and recently went back to it. In just one week I saw a reduction in my facial fine lines and my pores are actually smaller. I even get comments on the clarity of my complexion without make up. Seriously,  this product is worthwhile and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> First of all , I got the wrong masque I was extremely disaponted</li>
            <li> Product arrived well packaged and on time.  I had been looking for this in the stores for the past few years and could not find it; I used it when I was young and still had nice skin.  Now my skin is old and wrinkled, but it still looks and feels better after a mud masque.  This is quite drying, so I advise a good moisturizer after unless you have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> The clay mask itself works okay, but I had to stop using it because the perfume/fragrance used is just so strong. Really unfortunate that they had to add fragrance, because otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product 4-5 times and honestly I don&#x27;t see the difference afterwards. The application is thick and that makes it hard to get a \\&quot;thin even layer\\&quot; around your whole face. This did not dry out my face or cause me to break out, but it didnt seem to have any benefits either. Overall it is a nice \\&quot;mud mask\\&quot; just for the sake of giving you and your friends something to do on a boring night.</li>
            <li> It has an odd smell to it but other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Great Stuff!!!  Wonderful rose scent!!!  Works well, and is hypoallergenic, I did not beak out or itch at anytime.  Will purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only have the pleasure of using this product once, but so far I like it. It&#x27;s not life changing, nor is it a miracle worker but it feels nice on my face and it does what it claims. I could feel it tingling on my skin as it was drying. It didn&#x27;t tingle as much as the Mint Julep (for all you Queen Helene enthusiasts), but it does feel like its clearing out my pores. I would say if you have more problem skin to try the Mint Julep. But why I like this masque so much is because I don&#x27;t feel like my skin had been overly dried when I used it. My skin was soft and supple and had a fresh rosey kind of scent after I washed it off. I read that a few reviewers didn&#x27;t like the smell. I would stay clear of this product if you don&#x27;t like a strong rose, witch hazely scent. But for the most part I really enjoy using this masque. I always feel pampered when I use this masque, NO NEED TO GO TO AN OVER PRICED SPA! Oh, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the packaging, the jar is perfect because then you can get all your money&#x27;s worth from the jar and not let one ounce go to waste! Thank you Queen Helene!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good price and quality product. Very fun for sleepovers and make over parties, even my little brothers enjoyed it after some talking in to</li>
            <li> I love to give myself a quick facial every other day to keep my skin looking refreshed and this does the trick. I don&#x27;t know why they no longer sell it in the stores but leave it to good old amazon to have it in stock. The price cannot be beat and it does the trick for a quickly int he morning. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The consistency is nice. There&#x27;s a tingliness when you apply it to your face. Though after using it several times, I don&#x27;t really see much improvement for my skin. I&#x27;m uncertain of its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I used to get my facials done in Jamaica, and at the end of each facial, they would use this exact product. Yes it worked. So when I came to the US, and didn&#x27;t get the same result, I couldn&#x27;t figure out what went wrong. Turns out, you can&#x27;t just just do a regular face wash and then apply this masque, you have to go the whole 9 yards. Since this is a natural earth, mud masque, I keep my product usage as natural and simple as possible. First, I rinse my face (twice) with African Natural Black Soap, then I search for any little blackheads poking themselves out for the day, then I apply this facial masque and finally, apply Vitamin E oil, and a natural Facial Moisturizer (St. Ives to be exact).&lt;br /&gt;I will warn however, that like every facial product, it&#x27;s not just what you put in the skin, it&#x27;s what you do to your entire body. I&#x27;ve also increased my water &amp; vegetable intake, get as much exercise as possible (because sweating helps cleanse the pores), avoiding touching my face all the time, washing my pillow cases once a week, exposure to sunlight and keeping my hair clean. I did all of those things when restarting my application of the mud masque. It worked wonders. Try it!</li>
            <li> Just got it yesterday. 10/25 and its not the worlds greatest, but it did leave my face softer. I have oily skin so it didnt dry it out, it made it just right to have for bare faced women.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this product and my local Walgreen&#x27;s and CVS quit carrying this line.  I&#x27;ve never bought this in the jar but am so glad I did - much easier to use!  This product is tried and true - I always see a significant improvement in tone, firmness and my pores when I use this and it lasts for days.  I&#x27;ve used products that cost so much more and delivered so much less.</li>
            <li> Made me break out.  Probably works great for some people just not me.</li>
            <li> I really, really love this product!  I have tried it only once so far &amp; noticed a difference in my skin straight away! it helped to relieve my dry skin and a few small pimples on my face and neck! I would strongly recommend this product! I love the Queen Helene products as it is and I own quite a few of them! This mask is really Excellent for a mud mask and smelt nice and dried nicely too! My skin felt so soft after only using this mask once! I will implement it into my routine!!  I have tried alot of products and so far this is my favorite mud mask!!  If you need additional information post a comment and i will get back to you as soon as possible!!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of queen helene products and i use this mask once a week and i like how this product works...I put the mask on at night to give my face a clean wash</li>
            <li> Love it.it helps my face alots and makes me look younger....love love love it....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I had sensitive skin until I used this product. It started to burn as soon at I put it onto my face. I thought maybe it was just a reaction because I wasn&#x27;t use to the product so I tried it again on another date. It started to burn so much I was really afraid that I had done some damage to may face. I was even afraid to look at my face afterwards but thankfully no damage (outwardly) was seen. It&#x27;s just not for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I do not like the masque.  I used it twice... after each time my face fully broke out!  Seriously, I looked like I was 15 again.  I threw it away.</li>
            <li> What can I say - It&#x27;s good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this mud mask off and on for many years- and have recently re-discovered it.  It does what it claims- leaves your skin soft and clean- and it&#x27;s very affordable.  Plus it&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li> This mask is absolute magic. I have been using it for years. It makes your face extremely smooth and nice. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> This mud mask is gentle, cleans pores, reduce blemishes and dries in a reasonable 10 minutes (whereas some masks take up to 20-30 minutes.)  I have sensitive combination-type skin and saw immediate benefit from using this product.  However it is heavily perfumed, and those who are sensitive to flowery smells will not be able to use it.</li>
            <li> I have been battling my skin for years now. I have very oily skin and have problems controlling it. This mask rids my skin of oil and helps to open my pores (to get rid of the bad stuff), and then close them once the mask is removed. This mask helps to pull oil and other bad stuff to the surface, so after this you may get a break out or two. I combat this by using this product every other day, so that my skin can continuously be rid of crud! I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Like my younger years and sleep overs. We love it</li>
            <li> This product gave me a serious rash. I sure was hoping it would be a help for my pores. Then I waited just a few days too late to return it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with this mask. It&#x27;s not much different than any other mask I have tried and I found it didn&#x27;t really do much for my skin. HOWEVER, I do have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t irritate it, so if you just want a mud mask to relax and enjoy (it does dry and crack, so it&#x27;s not like a wet mud mask you might get at a spa) then this is fine.</li>
            <li> So happy and when I need more, I know  just where to go. Thanks for the fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This mask is one of the best out I&#x27;ve been using queen Helen mask for some time it def reduces the size of bumps but for best result you may want to try and wash your face 1st then apply the queen Helens mint julep mask and then apply the mud mask(leave both on into completely dry ) do this for about 3 days guarantee you&#x27;ll see a difference</li>
            <li> it was ok, I cant complain the price was good too</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask for years. I also see the difference in the tautness of my skin if I don&#x27;t use it for several days. It tightens your pores also use it on your neck</li>
            <li> Queen Helene makes a great, cheap, mask. I love them all. This one is light, smells alright and works well. I use it weekly or as needed, I feel like it cleans my pores, tightens my skin and makes me face feel happy.</li>
            <li> Love it! It keeps my skin looking younger.</li>
            <li> Love love  this product ive been using it for over a year &amp;&amp; my hubby loves it as well it really does work it does what it says hubby &amp;&amp; i use twice a week &amp;&amp; fresh clean skin highly recommend A+++</li>
            <li> This mud pack is a great moisturizer and makes my skin look and feel smooth.  I have repeatedly made this purchase for about for about 5 years.</li>
            <li> This is such an exceptional product that I can&#x27;t imagine anyone paying more for something that probably is not as good as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to have found it again.  This mud pack masque really works!  However, make VERY sure you are alone in the house, no one smoking, all kitchen appliances off, then with hair color applied, wait the appropriate amount of time, in the last 15 minutes apply the mud pack to face, neck and chest, hop in the shower and don&#x27;t come out until you are squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in mortal fear of a fire in the house with me naked as a jay bird, hair color on my hair, mud pack on my face and a fire breaking out.  Please don&#x27;t try to save me, I think I would choose to go with the house.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It works great. My face feels so refreshed and after using this.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, but i never seen it in a jar before i always bought the tubes which you can not always use it all. I seen this browsing amazon. I will be buying it this way from now on so i dont waste as much.</li>
