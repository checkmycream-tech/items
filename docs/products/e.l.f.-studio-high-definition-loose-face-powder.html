            <li>It is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>this product is amazing</li>
            <li>Also nice to add to eyes or highlighted areas.</li>
            <li>I really liked it.</li>
            <li>This one blends in so perfectly and shimmers very slightly and looks so beautiful in the sun.</li>
            <li>As some reviews stated it is very fine</li>
            <li>Looks pretty on and perfect for a special occasion.</li>
            <li>It goes on light and is a light finish with great finishing touch.  </li>
            <li>The powder has just the right amount of shimmer and the light color I chose looks real nice.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the bit of shimmer it adds which makes my skin look flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that using the puff that comes with it is much better than using a brush.</li>
            <li>Do not use on top of the shimmer primer made by ELF or you&#x27;ll end up looking like a Cullen.</li>
            <li>Its not the most convenient to carry the twist off and no mirror</li>
            <li>love it&#x27;s smoothness and healthy glow</li>
            <li>more of a shimmer.  </li>
            <li>This is okay.</li>
            <li>I heard the ben nye powder is way better but have not gotten a chance to try it.</li>
            <li>when used with elf HD powder this problem is alleviated.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this....very pleased.</li>
            <li>Taking the top off the container each time causes some powder to float into the air and end up all over the table.  </li>
            <li>I use this with It powder, between the 2 it fills in acne scars and fine wrinkles and brightens my skin.</li>
            <li>There is a light shimmer</li>
            <li>so I enjoy a bit of color and shimmer.  </li>
            <li>On its own it&#x27;s very nice, especially for older skin.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin look super smooth.</li>
            <li>I love putting on finishing powder but this product has to much sparkle  </li>
            <li>or you look like a super sparkle face.</li>
            <li>This loose powder is really good.  </li>
            <li>enough shimmer to look nice.</li>
            <li>The light has to catch it just perfect to see it at all, when I first opened it I thought they had sent me the wrong product.  </li>
            <li>A very nice plain powder.</li>
            <li>I wore it at night and it was fine in low light.</li>
            <li>This is a nice loose powder which I apply with a brush over my make up.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s okay, but I don&#x27;t think it makes me look any different, and I would not suggest buying it.</li>
            <li>I love the regular version of this product.  </li>
            <li>This is a very fine face powder that has a pink shimmer to it.</li>
            <li>makes your face super soft and keeps your makeup on through whatever</li>
            <li>So, It&#x27;s ok in certain places with minimal use...</li>
            <li>It covers very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this powder, it blurs my imperfections and gives a glow without &amp;#34;sparkles&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and it sets my makeup very well.</li>
            <li>Elf is a great product for the money you can not go wrong ....</li>
            <li>This particular one is a little shimmery for my taste, but a good product if you like a little shimmer.</li>
            <li>The box/container is a little cheap feeling.  </li>
            <li>It is a little light</li>
            <li>but generally I&#x27;m conscious of it and opt for something else.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to find a reasonable HD power that wasn&#x27;t white and doesn&#x27;t have shimmer.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin looking like skin (if applied properly) with a spritz of mac fix+ my skin looks marvellously natural and glowy.  </li>
            <li>Maybe the other shades arent so glittery, but this one is almost pure glitter.</li>
            <li>she has a hard time finding a face powder light enough</li>
            <li>This puts a little TOO much shimmer into the mix.  </li>

            <li> The reason for the four stars is that it does have glitter in it which I do not particularly like but the name has shimmer in it so should have known.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s natural, but its hard to get to the powder.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews about this product some bad but the people that gave it a bad review are picky people and probably complain about most things.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great powder but i hate the sparkles</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just enough shimmer to look nice. I use it in the morning and my face looks great all day. I love the bit of shimmer it adds which makes my skin look flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my 60&#x27;s and people guess my age in the 40&#x27;s.... This powder is amazing!</li>
            <li> This puts a little bit of sparkles on your face, but almost none, and no one can ever tell when I am wearing it. I guess it&#x27;s okay, but I don&#x27;t think it makes me look any different, and I would not suggest buying it.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. I use it after my primer and base coat. It comes in 2 shades, I use the transulant. It covers very well. I found that using the puff that comes with it is much better than using a brush. It also stays on well. Ladies don&#x27;t forget the finishing spray, as we know every formula is made to work together..</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last that long and I had to constantly reapply it</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter whose skin is so pale she has a hard time finding a face powder light enough</li>
            <li> This is a very fine face powder that has a pink shimmer to it. Looks pretty on and perfect for a special occasion.</li>
            <li> Works well for face and body. Do not use on top of the shimmer primer made by ELF or you&#x27;ll end up looking like a Cullen. On its own it&#x27;s very nice, especially for older skin. Also nice to add to eyes or highlighted areas.</li>
            <li> not very effective under eye brightner</li>
            <li> Leaves skin looking like skin (if applied properly) with a spritz of mac fix+ my skin looks marvellously natural and glowy.  My only complaint is that even though my skin is dry the powdered effect doesn&#x27;t last as long as it should (maybe 5 hours tops on areas like my forehead)</li>
            <li> The box/container is a little cheap feeling.  Its not the most convenient to carry the twist off and no mirror so it stays at home and I bought a different one for the purse. It does have a little sparkle in it which I like in some cases but generally I&#x27;m conscious of it and opt for something else.  Great for cleavage on a night out, though.</li>
            <li> I love the regular version of this product.  This particular one is a little shimmery for my taste, but a good product if you like a little shimmer.</li>
            <li> love it&#x27;s smoothness and healthy glow</li>
            <li> GREAT alternative to fancy mac setting powder. makes your face super soft and keeps your makeup on through whatever</li>
            <li> Just from looking at these pictures I don&#x27;t want it ....Yikes!</li>
            <li> This loose powder is really good.  It goes on light and is a light finish with great finishing touch.  There is a light shimmer so please know this before purchasing.  It is not an outright sparkle... more of a shimmer.  I like it, I have fair skin so I enjoy a bit of color and shimmer.  I think it will work well with any skin color.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s natural, but its hard to get to the powder. It&#x27;s extremely messy and its too white. Not my color at all.</li>
            <li> This puts a little TOO much shimmer into the mix.  My face ends up way too shiny looking and seems to emphasis any &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; areas.  I prefer the regular one to this one.</li>
            <li> This is okay. I heard the ben nye powder is way better but have not gotten a chance to try it. I g ave this a 3 star because it did get the job done however if u go to  take pics with the product on ur face, it looks like someone took powder and throw it in ur face. I even tried taking pics in different lighting and with the flash on or off and still the same thing</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this one instead of the other one because of the reviews that it made people look white, even though it was suppose to be translucent. I didn&#x27;t realize, until after I clicked order, that this was a shimmer powder. So, It&#x27;s ok in certain places with minimal use... or you look like a super sparkle face. I was hoping to find a reasonable HD power that wasn&#x27;t white and doesn&#x27;t have shimmer. Anyone reading this, please!!, I&#x27;d love to hear suggestions!</li>
            <li> I read many reviews about this product some bad but the people that gave it a bad review are picky people and probably complain about most things. I really liked it. It looks wonderful on your face. As some reviews stated it is very fine so take it slow the first time and you&#x27;ll be good.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this for a regular day at work because it&#x27;s overly shimmery, it&#x27;s like I have glitter on my face. I wore it at night and it was fine in low light.</li>
            <li> Wayyyyyy too shimmery. I was hoping this was like a setting powder.  No way you could use this as a setting powder.  You can use it as a highlighter. I got the color vixen. Maybe the other shades arent so glittery, but this one is almost pure glitter.</li>
            <li> I love putting on finishing powder but this product has to much sparkle  I feel like im weaing glitter jenna R.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the amount of shimmer this powder has.  The light has to catch it just perfect to see it at all, when I first opened it I thought they had sent me the wrong product.  A very nice plain powder.</li>
            <li> Love this powder, and you can&#x27;t beat the price! Use it very sparingly, a little goes a long way, and over-application will make you look  a little &amp;#34;frosted&amp;#34;. Other than that, totally finishes my look!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a powder like this FOREVER. All the ones I buy have a metallic, bronze color that gets left on your face and looks terrible. This one blends in so perfectly and shimmers very slightly and looks so beautiful in the sun. I don&#x27;t even need foundation when I use this. It is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I really like this powder, it blurs my imperfections and gives a glow without &amp;#34;sparkles&amp;#34;. I use this with It powder, between the 2 it fills in acne scars and fine wrinkles and brightens my skin. It powder can be white and give a ghostly white look. when used with elf HD powder this problem is alleviated.</li>
            <li> This is a must have in my make up bag. Makes my skin look super smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a nice loose powder which I apply with a brush over my make up. The reason for the four stars is that it does have glitter in it which I do not particularly like but the name has shimmer in it so should have known.</li>
            <li> This is great powder. It is a little light but I just add some bronzing powder over it. It is difficult to find loose powder that has a little shimmer to it..Clinique used to make one that I used but it was discontinued. So glad I found this....very pleased.</li>
            <li> Elf is a great product for the money you can not go wrong .... This is a beautiful sheer foundation powder excellent for highlighting</li>
            <li> The powder has just the right amount of shimmer and the light color I chose looks real nice.  Taking the top off the container each time causes some powder to float into the air and end up all over the table.  Maybe I&#x27;m just using it wrong as I usually apply it with a brush.</li>
            <li> If u have this product then u know if not then let me break if down for ya this product is amazing it gives u a flawless finish!</li>
            <li> I will not use this ever... it gives your skin an ashy overtone.</li>
            <li> Great powder, lightweight finish while still providing medium coverage and it sets my makeup very well. And the price is great, too!!</li>
