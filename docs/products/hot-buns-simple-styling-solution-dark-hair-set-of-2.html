            <li>Can put her hair up in a few seconds and it looks great</li>
            <li>totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I bought this for the summer to keep my long hair off my neck but still look nice.</li>
            <li>I ended up picking up the hot buns kit when I was at Walmart with my grandmother.</li>

            <li>I have viewed the hot buns in stores.</li>
            <li>I love I for adults,but the smaller one won&#x27;t work for litte girls.</li>
            <li>It was not possible for me to make a perfect bun, as my hair was sticking to the surface of this bun which also makes it hard to distribute hair around it.</li>
            <li>They Hot Buns worked very well for the first time then when I went to use them again</li>
            <li>I think this could work for some people, but not for me, so I&#x27;d suggest if you know someone who bought this already, try out theirs first because I can&#x27;t really return this now, so I am going to give it to someone else to try.</li>
            <li>My older daughter ended up cutting the top of a sock off and made a better bun with it much easier than using the Hot Bun, and it looked a lot better.  </li>
            <li>It takes too much effort to hold the hair.  </li>
            <li>so much neater and well shaped.  </li>
            <li>It is so much easier than a cut sock or a donut.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had a strong feeling it wasn&#x27;t going to be as easy as the commercial, because the As Seen On TV things seldom are, but she wore me down</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t consider this a fault of the item as in the advertisement all the models have long, smooth hair.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend.</li>
            <li>I have thin hair about 10\\&quot; below my shoulders, first I bought .99 cents donut that looked amazing.</li>

            <li>Bun was not tight as regular donut, as much as I tried to make it happen.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it only 2 stars was that the snap fastening fell off of one of the Hot Buns after only trying it twice.</li>
            <li>Also, the ends of the Hot Bun which snap together are too wide and bulky.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>My hair is very long, so I ordered the large size.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to girls with long hair, especially for the summer.</li>
            <li>item did not work on my daughter&#x27;s long, natural African hair.</li>
            <li>If you are not rough with it it will last and last though!</li>

            <li> It will work, but if I do not secure, it will slide and the small pieces begin to fall out quickly.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my mom, she had been asking for it for so long.</li>

            <li> I will go back to the plain mesh donut for buns.</li>
            <li> So if your hair is like mine when it&#x27;s wet, you may have to blow dry it and then use a little product (like hairspray or curl</li>
            <li> It definitely couldn&#x27;t be done with one hand or in one small motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> stars because it would have not be as delicate if they spent some extra money manufacturing it with a metal button snap instead of a plastic one.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product may work well for someone who has long and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter &amp; tried to make a bun a few times.</li>
            <li> She took it off after a few mins.</li>
            <li> Waste of $20+ dollars.</li>
            <li> It having dried in the bun overnight</li>
            <li> Takes less than a minute to have your hair in a perfectly round bun!</li>
            <li> Not easy to work with.</li>
            <li> CUSTOMER SERVICE DID LITTLE TO NOTHING TO HELP!  </li>
            <li> My daughter was unable to use the larger one.  </li>
            <li> Silky thick hair does not work well at all.  </li>
            <li> I tried and tried to get this to work with my medium length, very thick hair, but it just wouldn&#x27;t hold up at all.</li>
            <li> The bun produced is lumpy and not attractive.</li>
            <li> and it was vey uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I anticipated, it was difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it works on VERY thin hair, I don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> Truly disappointing.  </li>
            <li> It was pricey and a hug disappointment!</li>
            <li> SCAM WITH A POORLY DESIGNED PAGE!!!</li>
            <li> Did not meet expectations and is horribly made.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It will work, but if I do not secure, it will slide and the small pieces begin to fall out quickly. Could be me.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it only 2 stars was that the snap fastening fell off of one of the Hot Buns after only trying it twice. Also, the ends of the Hot Bun which snap together are too wide and bulky.&lt;br /&gt;This item did not work on my daughter&#x27;s long, natural African hair. Her hair is not smooth enough to spread it around the Hot Bun once rolled up. However, I don&#x27;t consider this a fault of the item as in the advertisement all the models have long, smooth hair.</li>
            <li> It takes too much effort to hold the hair.  After my hair got tangled in the mesh, I decided not to use it anymore.  I use  scrungies and form my own bun and it looks nice.  I tried to sleep with it and it was vey uncomfortable.  Maybe women who are not on the go and commuting to the city can stay at home and play around with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter &amp; tried to make a bun a few times. I was able to roll and clip it but it won&#x27;t hold in place. Even with the smaller bun, It didn&#x27;t work &amp; hangs down/falls so I tried using 10 bobby pins, which hurt her head. She took it off after a few mins. Maybe it works on VERY thin hair, I don&#x27;t know but it definitely didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li> Hot buns is a scam! Do not order online at their personal website! Their website is poorly designed and they do not give you the total before your order is complete! Next thing you know it they are charging you 50.00 and some change for your buy one get one free order! SCAM WITH A POORLY DESIGNED PAGE!!! CUSTOMER SERVICE DID LITTLE TO NOTHING TO HELP!  I have ordered tons of products online never with this dissatisfaction!</li>
            <li> This product may work well for someone who has long and thick hair. I have thin hair about 10\\&quot; below my shoulders, first I bought .99 cents donut that looked amazing. Only thing with a regular donut is that you cannot curl your hair with it, as this product. I decided to get this bun instead and as someone suggested I went to local Wal-Mart and got this thing for $9.99. It was not possible for me to make a perfect bun, as my hair was sticking to the surface of this bun which also makes it hard to distribute hair around it. Bun was not tight as regular donut, as much as I tried to make it happen. I then tried my daughter&#x27;s hair and same thing while she has much thicker hair then mine. I might use it to curl my hair and see what it does, but thinking to return it at this point.</li>
            <li> My 11-year-old begged me for this.  I had a strong feeling it wasn&#x27;t going to be as easy as the commercial, because the As Seen On TV things seldom are, but she wore me down and I finally purchased it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I anticipated, it was difficult to use.  No one in my family seemed to have enough hair to wrap completely around the Hot Bun, and both of my daughters have long, thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it wasn&#x27;t as easy as rolling your hair around it and snapping the clip.  We all tried it, but you would almost have to be contortionist to get the thing in the correct position to clip it.  It definitely couldn&#x27;t be done with one hand or in one small motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend these. My older daughter ended up cutting the top of a sock off and made a better bun with it much easier than using the Hot Bun, and it looked a lot better.  Plus it was free.</li>
            <li> This product works! The only reason I gave it it 4 stars rather than 5 is because it does take some practice until you get used to it for the waves you want.</li>
            <li> Hot buns is Easy and Quick to do. Takes less than a minute to have your hair in a perfectly round bun! 5 STARS! You will LoVe IT TOO!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will do!  My bun is beautiful and it stays in place!!!!!  A guaranteed hairstyle everytime!</li>
            <li> I tried and tried to get this to work with my medium length, very thick hair, but it just wouldn&#x27;t hold up at all. My hair is very thick and heavy and it just wouldn&#x27;t stay in and certainly didn&#x27;t look neat for more than a second before it fell down. I think this could work for some people, but not for me, so I&#x27;d suggest if you know someone who bought this already, try out theirs first because I can&#x27;t really return this now, so I am going to give it to someone else to try. I think if you can get a deal where you buy one get one free it might be worth it IF you can get it to work on your hair, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to work.</li>
            <li> They Hot Buns worked very well for the first time then when I went to use them again they broke.  Poorly made but when they worked it looked good.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my mom, she had been asking for it for so long. I feel that it is way to over priced. My mom does not even wear it anymore. Waste of $20+ dollars. Never again.</li>
            <li> I ended up picking up the hot buns kit when I was at Walmart with my grandmother. She ended up picking it out for me and we decided that I would try it because I heard if you wear it over-night, you can get really pretty waves/curls. I just put it in for the night and I love the way this looks already. The bun it makes is classy and professional, but I hate that you should do it with &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; hair or damp hair (it says it creates better buns), only because my hair refuses to untangle when it&#x27;s wet. So if your hair is like mine when it&#x27;s wet, you may have to blow dry it and then use a little product (like hairspray or curl setter).&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate this product 5 stars is because of the price. Just go pick it up in Walmart, it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> The Hot Buns comes in two sizes.  My daughter was unable to use the larger one.  She would have liked it to be more secure for dance.</li>
            <li> It works. it&#x27;s a simple concept and totally worth it. I&#x27;ve gotten tons of comments on my \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; bun so far!</li>
            <li> I would order it again great product I loved it.</li>
            <li> Silky thick hair does not work well at all.  My daughter was excited to see it on TV for an easy up do but I could not get anything like the TV add.  The hair kept unwrapping.  Not easy to work with.</li>
            <li> The manner in which the snap is sewed on creates a problem with this bunmaker. I have viewed the hot buns in stores. Those for sale in stores do not have the same shape or stitching as this one offered for sale here. I will not purchase another from here. The bun produced is lumpy and not attractive. I will go back to the plain mesh donut for buns.</li>
            <li> So easy wear it everyday I can&#x27;t help it I love it so much specially when have a bad hair day easy fix so cute!!!!</li>
            <li> I love I for adults,but the smaller one won&#x27;t work for litte girls. Easy to use and works just as described</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  I am in profession that requires my hair to be up off my shoulders.  This is easy to use and creates a  professional, yet very attractive hairstyle.  I use it every day.  It makes a bun look so much neater and well shaped.  I highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the summer to keep my long hair off my neck but still look nice. I love this thing! It is so much easier than a cut sock or a donut.&lt;br /&gt;I put my hair up in the bun while wet out of the shower. It is very comfortable to sleep in, and my hair stays put. When I take the bun out in the morning to re-do it. It having dried in the bun overnight, I have the most gorgeous  curls and waves. It will be a nice overnight curl maker in the winter. I highly recommend this to girls with long hair, especially for the summer. It&#x27;s so quick and easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because it would have not be as delicate if they spent some extra money manufacturing it with a metal button snap instead of a plastic one. If you are not rough with it it will last and last though!</li>
            <li> Did not meet expectations and is horribly made.  I would love to return if I had not placed in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Truly disappointing.  Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 14 year old granddaughter she uses it all the time. Can put her hair up in a few seconds and it looks great</li>
            <li> Great product easy to use and for the first time I can wear a bun and it stays all day</li>
            <li> I followed the directions,yet couldn&#x27;t receive the results of the picture.My hair is very long, so I ordered the large size. It was pricey and a hug disappointment!</li>
