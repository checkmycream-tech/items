            <li>Gorgeous, bright colors and the application for these minis was perfect.</li>
            <li>I love how they are minis easy to use!!!!</li>
            <li>I bought them awhile ago and its still good..</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love the set!</li>
            <li>Received on time, and the colors are amazing</li>
            <li>This quad of minis is nice but the colours are paler (pastels) than in the picture.</li>
            <li>another polish joke is kind of the oddball here being a yellow-toned glitter but can be saved for another time.</li>
            <li>I really liked the polish.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous colors, bought this set specifically for the &amp;#34;Can&#x27;t Find my Czechbook&amp;#34; color, it is a very unique blue-green color.</li>
            <li>are beautiful spring into summer colors, opaque in 2 coats and would be fun for nail art.</li>
            <li>Great summertime fun.</li>
            <li>I feel the fuchsia is more of a muted rose color.</li>
            <li>These are very cute and pretty colors!!</li>
            <li>Pleased.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy having these colors for spring.</li>
            <li>Love love these colors</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Minimum chipping within a week for me :)</li>
            <li>But anyway, I, your lovely and talented-with-one-handed-iPhone-pics hand model, bring to you a picture of Mariah&#x27;s nail polish collection via O.P.I. for your consideration.</li>
            <li>All in all an interesting product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So Skullicious, I hope you enjoy it!</li>

            <li>Still a better deal than buying opi polish in a store though</li>
            <li>so I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love the nail polishes.</li>
            <li>the gold is gorgeous and blue purple good for spring too.  </li>
            <li>mentioned issues with chipping easily.</li>
            <li>It applies easily, as well as removes easily.</li>
            <li>It applies easily, as well as removes easily.</li>
            <li>They are so cute and work as great as the larger bottles.</li>
            <li>I almost want to say I recommend the concept of the liquid sand polish more than I recommend the Mariah Carey mini set itself, as the one color I truly think is cool is \\&quot;Stay</li>
            <li>Oy is best used over something else as it is pretty sheer.</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly and was easy to work with on the nail.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter &amp; I enjoy doing summer glam.</li>
            <li>O.P.I. makes good nail lacquer in general; the Mariah Carey liquid sand minis are a solid collection of this super trendy kind of polish (Spring 2013).</li>
            <li>So So Skullicious set is really cute and would make a fabulous gift (or personal purchase) for any of your gothy friends or loved ones, or for the person who enjoys unusual and unique nail polish colors.</li>

            <li>/&gt;To dress up the color for special occasions, I invested in Polka dot com.&lt;br</li>
            <li>full sizes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super lemony, note.).</li>
            <li>I love the OPI mini sets, allowing me to try new colors without adding full sized bottles to my already large collection of polishes.</li>
            <li>It is so much fun to have a variety of colors to play with.</li>
            <li>Wanting to see all the colors, I went ahead and painted two nails on my right hand \\&quot;Stay</li>
            <li>I would recommend skipping this mini set and purchasing the full size or sticking with a more recent collection.</li>
            <li>personally do like \\&quot;Stay the Night\\&quot; (black) best, followed by the purple, the turquoise, and then the fuchsia.</li>
            <li>&quot; I was surprised, one, at how easily this \\&quot;sand\\&quot;-based texture applied.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would like the blue, but fell in love with Can&#x27;t Find My Czechbook.</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of my favorite collections to date.</li>
            <li>However, I was interested in the liquid sand texture of the polish and wanted to see what it was all about.</li>
            <li>mainly I took a quick pic to show anyone reading this the colors of the polishes.</li>
            <li>It was definitely not difficult to remove.</li>
            <li>appears (note I say *appears*) to be almost identical to O.P.I&#x27;s Kiss Me On My Tulips.</li>
            <li>appears (note I say *appears*) to be almost identical to O.P.I&#x27;s Kiss Me On My Tulips.</li>
            <li>I love these colors, but I find the all of these nail polishes chip the next day.</li>
            <li>I should also mention that this kind of nail polish seems to dry more quickly than other</li>
            <li>The liquid sand polish came off extremely easily for me, almost as easily as regular creme polish.</li>
            <li>I love the colors, its still the amazing OPI product, however, with small er bottles come smaller brushes.</li>
            <li>My only beef is this beautiful color only comes in the mini bottle in the Skullicious set, so there&#x27;s no chance of buying a regular sized 0.50 oz bottle.</li>

            <li>More so than other brands (like Essie) that I have.</li>
            <li>I should note that I prefer dark polishes in general -- the darker the better!</li>
            <li>the colors are seasonal and not \\&quot;staple\\&quot; or classic</li>
            <li>Let Go\\&quot; (classic purple),</li>
            <li>I wanted to try the bright pink A-rose From the Dead</li>
            <li>I wanted to try the bright pink A-rose From the Dead</li>
            <li>Love the small bottles</li>
            <li>The polish appears old (it is a 2013 collection)</li>
            <li>(I recommend LUSH&#x27;s Lemony Flutter cuticle butter for keeping cuticles in tip-top shape.</li>
            <li>I thought it wasn&#x27;t particularly classy.</li>
            <li>As someone who mostly wears very dark or black nail polish, I have to really love a pink to recommend it, and A-rose From the Dead is just super.</li>

            <li>She hasn&#x27;t complained about them so they are probably fine.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re kind of difficult to use.  </li>
            <li>It chipped within a day or two even with proper OPI base coat and OPI top coat application, I have numerous OPI nail polish&#x27;s and none have ever chipped this easily.</li>
            <li>They really compliment each other!</li>
            <li>The Skullicious set is really darling -- I bought it for my daughter for her birthday, but, in typical fashion, I borrowed it from her before she has had a chance to use it.</li>

            <li> What&#x27;s really weird is she appears to be holding some kind of creature with long fangs; as it turns out, it was a strangely arranged bit of her hair.</li>
            <li> Photo makes the colors seem so much brighter but even after having to paint on multiple layers, the colors were still dull.</li>
            <li> However this set is more expensive than the other collections listed here and the quality is not up to OPI par.</li>
            <li> none are completely glitter-free or just plain</li>
            <li> So So Skullicious are Hi, Pumpkin (a medium pumpkin orange cream), Morning Glory (either a deeply dark charcoal or black cream), and Candlelight (a dark marigold yellow cream, which is prettier than it sounds, although yellow isn&#x27;t my personal color).</li>

            <li> I sat down and painted the fingers on my left hand with \\&quot;Stay the Night.\\</li>
            <li> &quot; (fuchsia), and \\&quot;Stay the Night\\&quot; (black matte w/ red flecks).</li>
            <li> although note that I took the picture without doing a cuticle clean-up first, so it looks sloppy --</li>
            <li> Removal of glitter polish often results in aching, very dry skin, and damaged cuticles, etc</li>
            <li> The product arrived as expected.  </li>
            <li> It was everything I didn&#x27;t expected......</li>
            <li> Also, the purple polish was slightly open so it dried up.</li>
            <li> Picked this set up at my local Ulta because I wanted to try more outrageous colors without committing to an entire bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the Night\\&quot; and then applied the other three colors to my remaining fingers.</li>
            <li> The other three colors in</li>
            <li> The other three colors in</li>
            <li> Its just to bad my nails don&#x27;t become smaller too, because the brushes are too small to make clean strokes, so the paint becomes streaky...</li>
            <li> Maybe* the dark purple, as well.</li>
            <li> Let Go\\&quot; (dark purple).</li>
            <li> A-rose From the Dead is probably one of the prettiest pink nail colors I&#x27;ve ever worn</li>
            <li> A-rose From the Dead is probably one of the prettiest pink nail colors I&#x27;ve ever worn</li>
            <li> I felt slightly embarrassed when I dashed into Ulta to purchase the Mariah Carey set of \\&quot;liquid sand\\&quot; minis by O.P.I., of all things.</li>
            <li> There are four colors in O.P.I.&#x27;s mini set, which is typical: \\&quot;Get Your Number\\&quot; (turquoise),</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically look like I dipped my fingertips in finger paint.</li>
            <li> the Night\\&quot; (black) or \\&quot;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> so tightly you might feel like you need a jackhammer to get it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done some research and A-rose From the Dead</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done some research and A-rose From the Dead</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll put up a pic of A-rose From the Dead.</li>

            <li> So I&#x27;m adding a few thoughts here!</li>

            <li> Bought as a gift. She hasn&#x27;t complained about them so they are probably fine.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as expected.  Quality of the product was superb, and I am very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> It was everything I didn&#x27;t expected...... Beautiful colors</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered. Pleased.</li>
            <li> Love the small bottles so i can try so many different brand and colors without feeling guilty about it.  the gold is gorgeous and blue purple good for spring too.  the colors are actually a lighter than it shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> The colors are great! They really compliment each other! I also thought this was a great price! Cute for a gift!</li>
            <li> This quad of minis is nice but the colours are paler (pastels) than in the picture. I still like them (especially the blue), they just aren&#x27;t as shown.</li>
            <li> It is so much fun to have a variety of colors to play with. Great summertime fun. My granddaughter &amp; I enjoy doing summer glam.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous colors, bought this set specifically for the &amp;#34;Can&#x27;t Find my Czechbook&amp;#34; color, it is a very unique blue-green color. However this set is more expensive than the other collections listed here and the quality is not up to OPI par. The polish appears old (it is a 2013 collection), it is streaky and takes multiple coats to get an even color. It chipped within a day or two even with proper OPI base coat and OPI top coat application, I have numerous OPI nail polish&#x27;s and none have ever chipped this easily. I would recommend skipping this mini set and purchasing the full size or sticking with a more recent collection.</li>
            <li> These are very cute and pretty colors!! I&#x27;m very happy with these...I bought them awhile ago and its still good..</li>
            <li> I like tiny colors, I change my mind a lot...</li>
            <li> Loved this purchase! Received on time, and the colors are amazing</li>
            <li> I love the OPI mini sets, allowing me to try new colors without adding full sized bottles to my already large collection of polishes. You&#x27;re such a budapest, suzy&#x27;s hungary again and don&#x27;t touch my czechbook are beautiful spring into summer colors, opaque in 2 coats and would be fun for nail art. Oy another polish joke is kind of the oddball here being a yellow-toned glitter but can be saved for another time. Oy is best used over something else as it is pretty sheer. Overall very happy having these colors for spring.</li>
            <li> Love love these colors these are colors that are great for spring! I love how they are minis easy to use!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the colors, its still the amazing OPI product, however, with small er bottles come smaller brushes. Its just to bad my nails don&#x27;t become smaller too, because the brushes are too small to make clean strokes, so the paint becomes streaky...</li>
            <li> Picked this set up at my local Ulta because I wanted to try more outrageous colors without committing to an entire bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is good for that aspect-- the colors are seasonal and not \\&quot;staple\\&quot; or classic colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, the bottles are SO SMALL.  They&#x27;re kind of difficult to use.  I felt like I was painting Barbie&#x27;s nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hey, if you&#x27;re nimble, this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem!</li>
            <li> OPI is a great nail polish.</li>
            <li> Euro Centrale Minis are the perfect way to try before you buy.  I didn&#x27;t think I would like the blue, but fell in love with Can&#x27;t Find My Czechbook. Ditto for the mauve represented by You&#x27;re Such a Budapest. I purchased the two full sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To dress up the color for special occasions, I invested in Polka dot com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just can&#x27;t beat OPI for the freshest colors and longest lasting polish.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of my favorite collections to date. Gorgeous, bright colors and the application for these minis was perfect. Minimum chipping within a week for me :)</li>
            <li> I felt slightly embarrassed when I dashed into Ulta to purchase the Mariah Carey set of \\&quot;liquid sand\\&quot; minis by O.P.I., of all things. However, I was interested in the liquid sand texture of the polish and wanted to see what it was all about. There are four colors in O.P.I.&#x27;s mini set, which is typical: \\&quot;Get Your Number\\&quot; (turquoise), \\&quot;Can&#x27;t Let Go\\&quot; (classic purple), \\&quot;The Impossible\\&quot; (fuchsia), and \\&quot;Stay the Night\\&quot; (black matte w/ red flecks). I should note here that all the polishes have glitter or sparkles in them -- none are completely glitter-free or just plain matte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I sat down and painted the fingers on my left hand with \\&quot;Stay the Night.\\&quot; I was surprised, one, at how easily this \\&quot;sand\\&quot;-based texture applied. It went on smoothly and was easy to work with on the nail. Wanting to see all the colors, I went ahead and painted two nails on my right hand \\&quot;Stay the Night\\&quot; and then applied the other three colors to my remaining fingers. Please see my pics, although note that I took the picture without doing a cuticle clean-up first, so it looks sloppy -- mainly I took a quick pic to show anyone reading this the colors of the polishes. I don&#x27;t typically look like I dipped my fingertips in finger paint. Anyhow, you can judge the colors for yourself and see if you like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally do like \\&quot;Stay the Night\\&quot; (black) best, followed by the purple, the turquoise, and then the fuchsia. I feel the fuchsia is more of a muted rose color. But anyway, I, your lovely and talented-with-one-handed-iPhone-pics hand model, bring to you a picture of Mariah&#x27;s nail polish collection via O.P.I. for your consideration. I wanted to mention what it was like to remove the liquid sand polish. I admit it -- I braced myself. Anyone who&#x27;s worn glittery polishes before knows what an ordeal it is to remove the polish -- the glitter is like fused to your nails so tightly you might feel like you need a jackhammer to get it off. Removal of glitter polish often results in aching, very dry skin, and damaged cuticles, etc (I recommend LUSH&#x27;s Lemony Flutter cuticle butter for keeping cuticles in tip-top shape. Super lemony, note.). The liquid sand polish came off extremely easily for me, almost as easily as regular creme polish. It was definitely not difficult to remove. I should also mention that this kind of nail polish seems to dry more quickly than other kinds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some mentioned issues with chipping easily. I didn&#x27;t have any problem with chipping myself. When I tested the polish, though, I already had a coat of regular polish on, which probably acted as a base coat. I used two coats and they lasted until I took them off three or four days later. Just an aside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, would I recommend this product? Yes, I would -- and I do -- with a couple of contingencies. I almost want to say I recommend the concept of the liquid sand polish more than I recommend the Mariah Carey mini set itself, as the one color I truly think is cool is \\&quot;Stay the Night\\&quot;. *Maybe* the dark purple, as well. I should note that I prefer dark polishes in general -- the darker the better! So I&#x27;m probably not that targeted consumer who will respond to a fuchsia-that-really-looks-like-dark-rose or a generic-ish turquoise. So if I were recommending to a friend, I&#x27;d suggest he or she check out \\&quot;Stay the Night\\&quot; (black) or \\&quot;Can&#x27;t Let Go\\&quot; (dark purple). I do not like the packaging. From what I can tell, Ms. Carey is apparently nude, with her long hair strategically placed here and there to cover her up. What&#x27;s really weird is she appears to be holding some kind of creature with long fangs; as it turns out, it was a strangely arranged bit of her hair. I found her nekkid pose to be unnecessary, but others may disagree. I thought it wasn&#x27;t particularly classy. O.P.I. makes good nail lacquer in general; the Mariah Carey liquid sand minis are a solid collection of this super trendy kind of polish (Spring 2013). An advantage of a mini set is to get to see if you would beinterested in buying a bigger bottle by experimenting with the tiny bottle. I did give this product four stars for the basic creativity and relative uniqueness of the product itself -- the liquid sand. I like two out of four of the colors. It applies easily, as well as removes easily. All in all an interesting product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/1/13: I wanted to review the So So Skullicious minis set by O.P.I, but Amazon won&#x27;t let you review the individual sets. So I&#x27;m adding a few thoughts here! The Skullicious set is really darling -- I bought it for my daughter for her birthday, but, in typical fashion, I borrowed it from her before she has had a chance to use it. I wanted to try the bright pink A-rose From the Dead and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. A-rose From the Dead is probably one of the prettiest pink nail colors I&#x27;ve ever worn and I recommend it heartily. My only beef is this beautiful color only comes in the mini bottle in the Skullicious set, so there&#x27;s no chance of buying a regular sized 0.50 oz bottle. I am verklempt! I&#x27;ve done some research and A-rose From the Dead appears (note I say *appears*) to be almost identical to O.P.I&#x27;s Kiss Me On My Tulips. As someone who mostly wears very dark or black nail polish, I have to really love a pink to recommend it, and A-rose From the Dead is just super. The So So Skullicious set is really cute and would make a fabulous gift (or personal purchase) for any of your gothy friends or loved ones, or for the person who enjoys unusual and unique nail polish colors. The other three colors in So So Skullicious are Hi, Pumpkin (a medium pumpkin orange cream), Morning Glory (either a deeply dark charcoal or black cream), and Candlelight (a dark marigold yellow cream, which is prettier than it sounds, although yellow isn&#x27;t my personal color). This set also comes with nail decals you can apply over the polish if desired. If you buy So So Skullicious, I hope you enjoy it!

            <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t know what would do without it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Photo makes the colors seem so much brighter but even after having to paint on multiple layers, the colors were still dull. Not a great quality product. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really liked the polish. However,  I didn&#x27;t realize they were going to be so small. Also, the purple polish was slightly open so it dried up. Still a better deal than buying opi polish in a store though so I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love the nail polishes. They are so cute and work as great as the larger bottles. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love these colors, but I find the all of these nail polishes chip the next day. More so than other brands (like Essie) that I have.</li>
            <li> Before buying these...you need to know that these are MINI nail polishes. Only about an inch or so tall; about the size of a basic visine bottle. Great colors!!! Love the set!</li>
