            <li>Always use warm or lukewarm water (not boiling water)</li>
            <li>Love Love .....</li>
            <li>i just have to do it every 2 weeks vs every 4 weeks with better quality indigo.</li>
            <li>I try to get it on my hair within 15 minutes making sure to saturate the roots that show the most.</li>
            <li>the color is rich and lovely.  </li>
            <li>black color is really flawless -</li>
            <li>like I experienced with an indigo that I purchased from a local store.</li>
            <li>I am glad the color can be easily controlled, and it&#x27;s  natural and safe.</li>
            <li>FAAAAAST shipping, fast dye release, very finely sifted (no plant scraps, twigs or grit) and</li>
            <li>My new hairdresser kept playing with my hair for like 15 min loving the shine and texture.</li>
            <li>It was delivered quickly, packaged well</li>
            <li>This is my very first review.</li>
            <li>but you would never know, hair color is very natural and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Basically, use warm water for 1/2 henna and cool water for 1/2 indigo after the henna dye is oxidized; mix them, apply and let them sit in hair for 1-3 hours to create shades from light brown to dark brown.</li>
            <li>I have purchased the more expensive henna from online, but this henna covers my grays as good or better.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised and pleased.  </li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m ready to color, I mix the Indigo with 1 tsp of salt, 130 degree water and mix it up quickly, and add the Henna mixture.  </li>
            <li>While taking shower if water is just warm enough to feel comfortable then hair color will last longer or if you use very hot water shower then it will fade in as soon as 2 weeks time.</li>
            <li>and this was my first time purchasing from Amazon or this seller.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t follow it exactly</li>
            <li>If/when I run out, I will definitely purchase more from this seller.</li>
            <li>I am going to order more of this Indigo powder next month.  </li>
            <li>I apply Jamila henna first for an hour then mix the Zenia indigo with salt and water and apply it.</li>
            <li>Results are better when applied individually after applying henna.  </li>
            <li>I have natural african american hair and this henna is great along with the indigo.</li>
            <li>nice dark brown</li>
            <li>With usage of warm water indigo releases dye faster and gets ready for application in lesser time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time by which hair color fades totally depends on how much you expose hair to humidity / water or hot water.  </li>
            <li>It really looks like my natural black,  And the coverage of the grey is amazing!!</li>
            <li>I also decided to use some of this in parts of my hair, My hair is much lighter</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really like it.</li>
            <li>I was expecting and really appreciate the amount I got for the price.</li>
            <li>and after 15-20 mins of soaking it would be ready for application.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, i love how my hair feels after dying it with henna &amp; indigo mix.</li>
            <li>Chemicals free, dye your hair and you don&#x27;t feel the itching or dry your scalp.</li>
            <li>Originally I was mixing this Indigo powder with Lush henna bars to darken the too red color to an Espresso</li>
            <li>so the first time it darkened my henna red hair</li>
            <li>Easy (though messy) to use, the Indigo powder will give your hair a bluish-black color without all of the damage that comes from store-brand chemicals.</li>
            <li>I leave it on my head uncovered, for less red and because the Indigo activates better when exposed to air.  </li>
            <li>This product creates a rich black color.</li>
            <li>I recommend to use it and be far away from regular chemicals products.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying this again in the near future.  </li>
            <li>I do the two-step henna/indigo process to achieve jet black hair, and this works as well or better than others I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>When you first mix the Indigo - it will be green.  </li>
            <li>She naturally has dark brown hair, it dyed her hair dark black the first use and has stayed very well.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m about 30% grey.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely grey</li>
            <li> The entire time it will run down your neck and face, so don&#x27;t wear anything you don&#x27;t want to ruin.</li>

            <li> Washes off within 5 washes (from gray hair, at least).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, you must grow out or cut off the black color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>

            <li> I followed all the instructions. I have dark hair and tried it several times, for several weeks. kept it 4 hrs at a time..Could it be that it is a bad batch?? Hope to find another herbal remedy that actually works.</li>
            <li> It is the best product I ever use in my life. Chemicals free, dye your hair and you don&#x27;t feel the itching or dry your scalp. I recommend to use it and be far away from regular chemicals products. (I left in my hair 2 hours and then rinse it.)</li>
            <li> Easy (though messy) to use, the Indigo powder will give your hair a bluish-black color without all of the damage that comes from store-brand chemicals.</li>
            <li> Easy to use at a very good price.  I plan on buying this again in the near future.  It was delivered quickly, packaged well and I am quite happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Good, quality indigo.  Have been coloring my hair with hendigo for years and this was my first time purchasing from Amazon or this seller.  I am impressed with the quality and the bargain price.</li>
            <li> The instructions on the product look too tedious and I didn&#x27;t follow it exactly but it worked for me anyway. Basically, use warm water for 1/2 henna and cool water for 1/2 indigo after the henna dye is oxidized; mix them, apply and let them sit in hair for 1-3 hours to create shades from light brown to dark brown. I am glad the color can be easily controlled, and it&#x27;s  natural and safe.</li>
            <li> I am getting grey hair around my edges and I wanted something to cover that up!  I can&#x27;t do hair dyes so I was looking for an alternative and decided to try Indigo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I do a Henna treatment - I use Jamila Henna - and I keep the Henna on my hair for 12 hours.  I rinse out the Henna then followup with the Indigo.  I mix this Indigo powder with water, apply it to my hair, cover with a plastic cap and let the Indigo sit on my hair for 8 hours.  When you first mix the Indigo - it will be green.  But after the mix sits on my hair, the Indigo turns black by the time I rinse it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black color is really flawless - but it doesn&#x27;t look fake.  It really looks like my natural black,  And the coverage of the grey is amazing!! I love this powder!!</li>
            <li> this is a really nice product. it turns white hair into black . mix it with henna and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> This is great indigo powder.  FAAAAAST shipping, fast dye release, very finely sifted (no plant scraps, twigs or grit) and the color is rich and lovely.  If/when I run out, I will definitely purchase more from this seller.</li>
            <li> This indigo is excellent for hair. I do the two-step henna/indigo process to achieve jet black hair, and this works as well or better than others I&#x27;ve used in the past. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sisters hair. She naturally has dark brown hair, it dyed her hair dark black the first use and has stayed very well. I also decided to use some of this in parts of my hair, My hair is much lighter then my sisters so the first time it darkened my henna red hair a dark red brown, I had to dye my hair twice to get the dark black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like it. Warning: it runs! The entire time it will run down your neck and face, so don&#x27;t wear anything you don&#x27;t want to ruin.</li>
            <li> This is my very first review. I have purchased the more expensive henna from online, but this henna covers my grays as good or better. I have natural african american hair and this henna is great along with the indigo. Love Love ..... the price is great for this henna.</li>
            <li> Bleeds so badly... Washes off within 5 washes (from gray hair, at least). I use it in combination with henna. So, the henna stays (the grays become red) and the indigo washes off... sadly. I bought 2 packs, so i&#x27;d still be using it to dye my hair... i just have to do it every 2 weeks vs every 4 weeks with better quality indigo. Other than that, i love how my hair feels after dying it with henna &amp; indigo mix. My new hairdresser kept playing with my hair for like 15 min loving the shine and texture.</li>
            <li> I applied henna and let sit for 4 hours and rinsed it out. Then I applied this product afterwards and let it sit for 3 hours and rinsed it out.  My 70% gray hair was black.  I didn&#x27;t think it would work because I have been using semi permanent hair color for years.  I was pleasantly surprised and pleased.  I have washed once and the color is still there.  I am going to order more of this Indigo powder next month.  Loved it!</li>
            <li> This indigo works well!  I use it to color my mom&#x27;s stubborn gray hair at the crown of her head. I apply Jamila henna first for an hour then mix the Zenia indigo with salt and water and apply it. The color comes out jet black and lasts for about 4 months.</li>
            <li> I got the results (hair color) I was expecting and really appreciate the amount I got for the price. Worked great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about 30% grey.  I&#x27;ve been using this Indigo in conjunction with Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder 9 Herbs Blend sold on Amazon.  Originally I was mixing this Indigo powder with Lush henna bars to darken the too red color to an Espresso and it worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For nice dark brown, I do a 1/3 Henna to 2/3 Indigo mix.  I prepare the Godrej powder with apple cider vinegar (I&#x27;ve tried coffee, but it didn&#x27;t work as well) and let it sit covered for 6+ hours.  When I&#x27;m ready to color, I mix the Indigo with 1 tsp of salt, 130 degree water and mix it up quickly, and add the Henna mixture.  I try to get it on my hair within 15 minutes making sure to saturate the roots that show the most. I leave it on my head uncovered, for less red and because the Indigo activates better when exposed to air.  3 hours later, 2 shampoos and conditioner and I&#x27;m done.  The color darkens over the next 2 days and I have NO greys. LOVE!</li>
            <li> Item as described.  Will buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I used this after the Zenia henna to dye my hair jet black.  Excellent coverage and no burning/irritation like I experienced with an indigo that I purchased from a local store.</li>
            <li> This Indigo is good.  Results are good.  Initially you will have to try different variations or henna and indigo quantity to achieve desired hair color.  Do not mix this with henna while applying.  Results are better when applied individually after applying henna.  One can add just a pinch or two of salt while mixing indigo with water to achieve darker hair color.  Always use warm or lukewarm water (not boiling water) and after 15-20 mins of soaking it would be ready for application.  With usage of warm water indigo releases dye faster and gets ready for application in lesser time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time by which hair color fades totally depends on how much you expose hair to humidity / water or hot water.  While taking shower if water is just warm enough to feel comfortable then hair color will last longer or if you use very hot water shower then it will fade in as soon as 2 weeks time.</li>
            <li> I choose not to use any other indigo. The price is fair, the indigo is excellent. I&#x27;m completely grey but you would never know, hair color is very natural and healthy looking. I use it with Jamila Henna.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product it turn my gray hair to blue!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product creates a rich black color. Unfortunately, you must grow out or cut off the black color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again.</li>
