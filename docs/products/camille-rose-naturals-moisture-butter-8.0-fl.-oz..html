            <li>Really liked the product.</li>
            <li>There are many excellent hair moisturizers for natural hair and this one is very good if you need more moisture than most people do with 2 twist strands.  </li>
            <li>So for a a sealant, pretty good!</li>
            <li>The moisture butter is by far the best moisture cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

            <li>I love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of hair</li>
            <li>The smell is light and nice.  </li>
            <li>I have found my staple product! :)</li>
            <li>However, I was looking for a moisturizer and this is more of a sealant.</li>
            <li>but i  have to say that i absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>It helped her curls to form up better and stay that way.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Wonderful curling cream, not greasy, made my curls more defined and longer lasting.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Leaves my curls light and springy and smelling devine!</li>
            <li>and i run through it very quick because i always use it.</li>
            <li>It works wonderful for my curls to keep the frizz down.</li>
            <li>I use it with NO other products which is amazing!</li>
            <li>Not all products work great when mixed.</li>
            <li>After the first jar, I bought six more, didn&#x27;t want to run out anytime soon.</li>
            <li>I used the Camille Rose Curlaide along with flexirods and it kept my hair moist while giving it a soft hold.</li>
            <li>I would have a wild fern on my head instead of nice lust curls.</li>
            <li>I also did a very nice wet set....</li>
            <li>It is not a light weight moisturizer, but it smells so good, like whipped vanilla!</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I was able to try this product before purchase and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping too</li>
            <li>I have tried many from high end to drug store.</li>
            <li>using it on dry hair helps to give the hair a good stretch.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday moisturizer and for detangling.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and smells lovely.</li>
            <li>First I want to say that I received super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s one of the first 3 ingredients</li>
            <li>My hair absolutely loooovveees this stuff!</li>
            <li>it cost $20 in the whole foods store, but I must say it is worth it.</li>
            <li>As great as the product is, the price is ridiculous.</li>
            <li>The product arrived very fast but there was too much water in it for it to be called a butter in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even tried making my own products from shea butter and other oils, but this---this is my new go-to product and line.</li>
            <li>Also, my hair responds very well to Aloe Vera</li>
            <li>Very please</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and the scent of it is intoxicating.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>My curls are soft and very well defined.  </li>
            <li>I would consider this a semi-heavy cream, which is just right for my hair, especially since I have highlights and my hair needs moisture.  </li>
            <li>One of my new staples now</li>
            <li>it smells like cake, and leaves hair moisturized but not heavy!</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair moist, soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li>This is the first product I have tried on my hair that actually works like it says it will.</li>
            <li>I have spent how many hundreds of dollars on hair care products for dry, thirsty curls.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>I have natural 3c/4a hair and my hair LOVES this curlaide moisture butter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using this product on my 12 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>She also has natural hair.</li>
            <li>This makes my braid outs very soft and curly and they last for 3-4 days.</li>
            <li>Let me first say that my hair normally doesn&#x27;t respond well to butters, so I usually use conditioners as a leave in.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd time going natural which was due to my inability to really find a product that both moisturized my hair as well as define my curls.  </li>
            <li>I am African American with natural hair.  </li>
            <li>(CD healthy hair butter, Q Amla heavy cream are all too heavy).  </li>
            <li>I really feel like its too expensive, as much as i love the product I&#x27;m going to be looking for other moisture butters and styling products because i refuse to pay this price for this product.</li>
            <li>Super thick hair butter.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> it does not dry your hair out or leave it hard.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not too oily and weighed down.</li>
            <li> I usually apply midday when I need to re-moisturize my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I always became frustrated to the point where I would just wear my hair straight or go back to relaxing my hair.  </li>
            <li> I now have people standing a little too close to me, just to smell my hair.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> The texture is fluffy and creamy.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews on products</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something thick and moisturizing, this is the product for you!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Didnt like it to oily for my hair..</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product. It works wonderful for my curls to keep the frizz down.</li>
            <li> First I want to say that I received super fast shipping. ..thank you&lt;br /&gt;The product is AWESOME! !  Not much is needed and it leaves my hair moisturized and soft...I do a lot of cowash and goes and on some days I can actually just fluff and go ...I also did a very nice wet set....I love this stuff...its definitely a staple</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Smells great. Makes my hair soft &amp; shiny. Not too heavy. Doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of hair it actually moisturizes. GREAT STUFF.</li>
            <li> I have natural 3c/4a hair and my hair LOVES this curlaide moisture butter. Let me first say that my hair normally doesn&#x27;t respond well to butters, so I usually use conditioners as a leave in. (CD healthy hair butter, Q Amla heavy cream are all too heavy).  Fortunately, I was able to try this product before purchase and was pleasantly surprised.  Also, my hair responds very well to Aloe Vera and that&#x27;s one of the first 3 ingredients listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for twists, braid outs, edge tamer and ends sealer.  I apply a generous amount when wet or dry. This makes my braid outs very soft and curly and they last for 3-4 days. Sometimes I apply to dry hair and rebraid and my hair still looks great. I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve been using it.  I use it with NO other products which is amazing! The smell is light and nice.  The texture is fluffy and creamy. I would consider this a semi-heavy cream, which is just right for my hair, especially since I have highlights and my hair needs moisture.  Perfect balance of oils so it&#x27;s not too oily and weighed down. I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> THEEEEE best curl cream! it smells like cake, and leaves hair moisturized but not heavy! I like that it disappears and doesn&#x27;t leave a lingering white residue on my hair! Very please and I will be buying it again!</li>
            <li> Been a fan since she started please don&#x27;t change !</li>
            <li> Packed with moisture and gives curls definition, not to mention the great aroma!  I love it!!! One of my new staples now</li>
            <li> The moisture butter is by far the best moisture cream I&#x27;ve tried. I am African American with natural hair.  This product leaves my hair moist, soft and shiny!  This has become my staple for twist outs and braid outs!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using this product on my 12 year old daughter.  She also has natural hair. LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Best product ever. My hair is so soft and smells lovely.</li>
            <li> This has been my moisture butter for a year now since my big chop. I usually apply midday when I need to re-moisturize my dry hair. I dampen my hair with aloe juice/water then apply to my curls it smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty residue however at times when I tried to use gel with it left a filmy white residue so be careful when using other products with it. Not all products work great when mixed. Great when applied at night as well, tie hair in pineapple &amp; apply silk bonnet.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something thick and moisturizing, this is the product for you! It is not a light weight moisturizer, but it smells so good, like whipped vanilla!</li>
            <li> What can I say about this product? It is absolutely AMAZING. I&#x27;ve been struggling to find a product that will help me style my 4b/4c hair, but I finally have. I used the Camille Rose Curlaide along with flexirods and it kept my hair moist while giving it a soft hold. My style lasted for a week and so did the moisture I got from the butter. It also made finger detangling a breeze. So much money wasted on trying other products that end up cluttering up my cabinet, but not anymore. I&#x27;ve even tried making my own products from shea butter and other oils, but this---this is my new go-to product and line. Thank you, Camille Rose!</li>
            <li> This hair product is amazing!! This is my 3rd time going natural which was due to my inability to really find a product that both moisturized my hair as well as define my curls.  I always became frustrated to the point where I would just wear my hair straight or go back to relaxing my hair.  While in Target one day I saw this product and decided to give a try.  My hair absolutely loooovveees this stuff! My curls are soft and very well defined.  I have found my staple product! :)</li>
            <li> this product is pricy. it cost $20 in the whole foods store, but I must say it is worth it. it does not dry your hair out or leave it hard. the smell is delicable. using it on dry hair helps to give the hair a good stretch. excellent choice.</li>
            <li> Really liked the product. However, I was looking for a moisturizer and this is more of a sealant. The directions state that also. So for a a sealant, pretty good!</li>
            <li> Super thick hair butter. Smells great and does the trick when it comes to keeping hair moisturized. I will definitely be purchasing again once my jar is empty. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I used this product and the algae deep conditioner along with twisting butter... And it gave my hair moisture and softness it needed. Love it! Best part is its all natural. I have medium curly frizzy hair... 3a/3b... Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews on products but i  have to say that i absolutely love this product. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and the scent of it is intoxicating. I always get compliments on my twist outs and braids out when i use this product and i run through it very quick because i always use it. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re wondering why i gave this amazing product 3 stars. As great as the product is, the price is ridiculous. I used to pay about 16 dollars for this on amazon and now they are charging $25 for this product. I really feel like its too expensive, as much as i love the product I&#x27;m going to be looking for other moisture butters and styling products because i refuse to pay this price for this product.</li>
            <li> great, not too heavy made my hair feel great!</li>
            <li> The product arrived very fast but there was too much water in it for it to be called a butter in my opinion. Instead of \\&quot;bouncy coils\\&quot; my hair drew up and became more difficult to comb. Sorry to say but I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Got this for my god daughter. She seems to like it a lot. It helped her curls to form up better and stay that way. Her hair&#x27;s not crunchy or greasy after using it. She used it all before any of the other products I&#x27;d gotten her. In fact some of them are still in the cabinet. Not this one though.</li>
            <li> There are many excellent hair moisturizers for natural hair and this one is very good if you need more moisture than most people do with 2 twist strands.  If I don&#x27;t twist the night before I can always count on Curlaide to stop breakage during a comb out.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Will be purchasing this again. Great for everyday moisturizer and for detangling.</li>
            <li> One of the best moisture butters out there. I have tried many from high end to drug store. I have 3c-4a hair. And this is it. I cannot ever be without this item. Quick shipping too</li>
            <li> Wonderful curling cream, not greasy, made my curls more defined and longer lasting. No flaking or feeling of heaviness. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have spent how many hundreds of dollars on hair care products for dry, thirsty curls. I thought this would be like all the rest, after 20 mins I would have a wild fern on my head instead of nice lust curls. This stuff does not disappoint and the smell is wonderful. Leaves my curls light and springy and smelling devine! I now have people standing a little too close to me, just to smell my hair. This is the first product I have tried on my hair that actually works like it says it will. After the first jar, I bought six more, didn&#x27;t want to run out anytime soon.</li>
