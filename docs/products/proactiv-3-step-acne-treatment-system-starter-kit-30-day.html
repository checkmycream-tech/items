    <ol>
            <li> Works well for our family.</li>
            <li> Bottles are travel size, do not buy! Rip off</li>
            <li> I brought  Proactive acne for my granddaughter  and she loves  it!</li>
            <li> The leading acne solution...Effective and fast</li>
            <li> Having a very hard time even giving this a one star so extremely disappointed in the tiny trail size three step system we have received. Have bought this before and it was big bottles for the same price. We will return this product. Very dissatisfied rip off price.</li>
            <li> Ridiculously small. Buy straight from the company or the vending machines in the mall. This is the $19 set, not the $30plus size bottles</li>
            <li> So far seems to be working well for my 14 year old son.  Have been using for about a week.</li>
            <li> PoP love it. works great.</li>
            <li> Great for my teenaged grandson...keeps his face clear</li>
            <li> I got it for my grandaughter, so far great results</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for Proactiv: I&#x27;d seen commercials and ads for the stuff since it first came out in my middle school days. I finally sucked it up and bought some. After 4 days, my skin is trashed: it not only made my acne worse, but my skin is peeling, red, itching, and beginning to scar. At first use, it just made my skin feel a little bit tight and my skin looked a little red....this gradually progressed to peeling, pain, and burns. SO sad. This is just not a therapeutic product and I hate that it&#x27;s marketed off like a medicine: it&#x27;s the furthest thing from curative. Sadly, I&#x27;m back at the beginning and so disappointed. I&#x27;m left than worse than what I started with. Please heed my warning and the negative comments of the hundreds of others and stay far away</li>
            <li> Item was perfect, and just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any improvement in my acne, except for dryness.</li>
            <li> How on God&#x27;s green earth could these people charge 34.99 for these ridiculously small bottles. They must be crazy. Do not even waste your money.....tooo small</li>
            <li> Works grate. Face is cleaning up and the helpful tips so I don&#x27;t have to keep buying</li>
            <li> Excellent. Clear skin. Ordered proactive plus from proactive and it broke me out. Never cleared my skin. Returned it and purchased this original proactive which works wonders.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my wife and let me tell you, We&#x27;ll worth the money. She&#x27;s so beautiful</li>
            <li> I used proactiv off and on from the time I was 16 to ago 28. It was the only thing that worked for me. I was always so insecure about my skin. It was such a struggle keeping it clear, however as long as I was using proactiv consistently I never worried about my skin. If I stopped using if for a while and a started breaking out I knew all I needed to do was start up again and I would have clear skin within a week. And then one day it stopped. As if over night it just stopped working. I used this product for years, it&#x27;s not like I stopped using it correctly. So I went to my dermatologist and was prescribed retin a and spironolactone. After one tube of retin a my insurance co decided it was no longer &amp;#34;medically necessary at my age&amp;#34; (I had just turned 30, I guess 30 year olds don&#x27;t get acne) which was a total let down because that stuff is a miracle. However I stuck with the spironolactone solo and I kept my acne away (I have still been unhappy with my pores and texture without my retin a...) for about a year... and NOW I was recently advised my my Dr. to immediately stop my medication, and that I could be causing my kidneys to fail.... great. So I decided after a year without proactive to give it another chance and try proactiv plus. I INSTANTLY broke out, and after 2 weeks called it quits for good. It is so unfortunate because this worked so well during my teen and most of my 20&#x27;s. So for those years, I gave this 3 stars,</li>
            <li> Just wish it was a bit bigger</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling acne since third grade (I&#x27;m 22 now), and I think it&#x27;s safe to say I finally found something that works! I did not find Proactiv drying like I found several other 3-step products to be. Within a week my face had cleared up, and in the past 3 weeks I&#x27;ve only had a few minor blemishes. I suffer from severe acne on my jawline, as well as cystic acne. I really only wish I had tried Proactiv sooner. Great product. I only wish they gave more product for the price, but regardless I&#x27;ll be repurchasing again and again...</li>
            <li> After 4 months on the system, here are my thoughts: This is NOT an acne miracle cure as some ads try to portray. BUT, in conjunction with another RX I got from the dermatologist, it made my situation more livable. The acne is somewhat improved, but definitely not gone. (I&#x27;m a 30-something who is experiencing skin problems for the first time ever)</li>
            <li> Very Small , sample size bottles.Rip off for the price. Will not order again...</li>
